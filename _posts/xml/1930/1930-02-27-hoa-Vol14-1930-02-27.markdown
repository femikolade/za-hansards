<p>as chairman, brought up the second report of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unauthorized Expenditure (Railways and Harbours)&#x2014;1928-&#x2019;29.&#x2014;Your committee begs to report that sums amounting to &#x00A3;34,213 12s. 2d. are shown on page 2 of the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s report as requiring to be covered by vote on revenue services, and an amount of &#x00A3;17 13s. is similarly shown as requiring to be covered by vote on capital and betterment services. Included in the former sum is an amount of &#x00A3;7,935 6s. 11d., which, on enquiry, your committee finds does not require to be voted. Thus the amount to be covered by vote on revenue account is &#x00A3;26,278 5s. 3d.</block>

<heading>MOZAMBIQUE CONVENTION.</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>,</from>

<p>with leave, made a statement as follows : Difficulties having arisen in regard to the interpretation of certain articles of the convention regulating the introduction of natives from Portuguese East Africa into the Transvaal for work on the mines entered into between the Government of the Union of South Africa and the Government of the Portuguese Republic, the Minister of Native Affairs was delegated by the Union Government to visit Lourenco Marques to discuss with the Governor-General of Mozambique the points in dispute and endeavour to secure agreement. The matters upon which agreement was reached are the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. Under Article XVI of the convention the Union is required to treat all Portuguese natives other than those employed on the mines contemplated by the convention as prohibited immigrants. It has now been agreed that such natives actually found in employment in the Union will be granted a temporary permit to complete the unexpired portion of their contract but not for a longer period than six months. A Portuguese native who enters the Union after the 1st March next and who is already in employment when identified as a Portuguese native may continue in such employment for such period not exceeding three months as will enable him to earn sufficient money to pay the cost of his repatriation.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_1251-1252" refersTo="page_0696"/>Unemployed Portuguese natives found within the Union will be given the opportunity of taking employment on the mines under the convention. Natives refusing such employment or found to be unfitted therefor will be repatriated.</p>

<p>The Portuguese authorities, though pressed, would under no circumstances agree to any departure from the principle laid down in the convention that Portuguese natives shall only be allowed entry into the Union for employment within a fixed quota on the Rand mines.</p>

<ol>

<li>2. It was agreed that any native engaged subsequent to the 1st May, 1927, under the 1909 convention will, if medically fit, he allowed to enter into fresh contracts operative from the date of expiration of the period of service under the 1909 convention for such further period or periods as are specified in the convention of 1928. Deferred pay will operate in regard to such natives from the first shift worked.</li>

<li>3. Questions relating to the interpretation of Article XV; compensation due in respect of natives accidentally killed; the repatriation of natives engaged on the mines under the convention of 1909, and the repatriation of Portuguese native women, were satisfactorily disposed of.</li>

<li>4. The Portuguese authorities were not able to make any concession in regard to Article XII relating to the maximum period of employment of Portuguese natives on the mines, nor was the Minister of Native Affairs able to meet the request of the Portuguese authorities for the application of the deferred pay system to all Portuguese natives engaged on the mines. I may say I propose in a few days to lay on the table of the House the correspondence containing the arrangements come to.</li>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I do not think I need go into details, but there are two or three points other than textual amendments which I want to mention. The first is in relation to the power of the Minister. The Minister has no power to set the wage determination in motion, to make an investigation apart from a recommendation. The fact of the investigations is a distinct stimulus in the direction of the industrial council. It is necessary for me to have power to conduct a preliminary investigation before I take action. The other provision is also in the same direction, that of facilitating or, rather, helping forward the organization of the industrial council. Under the Act as it stands, once determination is in force no industrial council agreement can be entered into, unless it is the same thing as determination. In practice I have found that where determination prevails both employers and employees are prepared to come to an agreement. In one case I have hung up the whole determination for the time being. The Cape Peninsula have come to an agreement. If the others do not come to an agreement, then I can apply the determination to them.</p>

<p>On amendments in Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this amendment. I think, perhaps, when the matter was last discussed, the Minister was irritable at some of the criticism, and decided to accept an amendment which was somewhat sprung upon him. I want to appeal to him from the point of view of ordinary humanity. Members of this House have been inundated with representations from persons all over the country who want their families to come out. In some cases money has been sent out, and now the Bill is being brought in two months earlier than was intended, and the relatives are being put to a good deal of trouble and inconvenience. I think the Minister should consider this. It will not affect very many people, perhaps 100 or 200 at most. I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of these people who are anxious for their relatives to come out. I have had wires on the question from members of the Nationalist party&#x2014;wires from the Free State&#x2014;pointing out cases where, in the case of some intending immigrants, all arrangements have been made for them to arrive during the second week in May. I am sure the Minister would not entail undue hardship in such cases. It will meet with the wishes of large numbers of people in South Africa if the Minister will agree to bring in this Bill with as little hardship as possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#robinson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROBINSON</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge). In doing so, I hope the Minister will not think, for one moment, that I am pleading for the admission of a few more Jews into South Africa. I was away last week, when the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart) moved this amendment. When I heard it I was absolutely shocked. The hon. member has a reputation for springing amendments of this description on the House, and for doing disagreeable things. But I never imagined that he would bring up an amendment of this description. Least of all did I imagine the Minister would adopt it. What. I am pleading for now is not that the Minister will allow a few more Jews to come into South Africa, but rather that he will appreciate that the altering of this date from July 1st to May 1st will make a considerable difference to those people who have already made arrangements to come in. A similar position arose when the Quota Bill was brought into operation in America. Something like 2,000 or 3,000 Jewish people were stranded in passage en route to America. They had to subsist for some years, in many cases, under most distressing conditions. They could not return to the place whence they came, and they could not go to America. They were stranded in England and in other parts of the world. In England, with their customary generosity, they allowed these unfortunate people to land, and they were maintained by other members of the community until, by degrees, they were returned to their own country, or were allowed to go to other parts of the world. I fear that we are appealing in vain to the hon. Minister, who is not even condescending to listen to my arguments. I repeat, that, of the unfortunate features connected with this Bill and its mode of introduction, nothing has been more hurtful to me than the alteration of this date to May instead of July. It is a miserable alteration. I am not pleading for an extension of time so that more immigrants can be admitted. I am appealing seriously because the alteration of this date is going to leave certain people, who quite legitimately were coming to South Africa, held up and unable to enter the country. I cannot believe that the Minister has altered the date really with the object of restricting those who originally intended to come in. I rather understand that the idea was to shorten the date so that an effort could not be made to bring in an unduly large number of people into the country. It will not have this effect. I am informed, if the date is altered to the 1st May, it will have the effect, as already pointed out, that numbers of these people who are practically in passage, will be held up and stranded, being unable either to go back or to come to South Africa. I do not know if the Minister will accept a proposal to revert to the original date, July 1st. If not, it is futile to move it. I make a last appeal to the Minister. This alteration of the date from the 1st July to the 1st May is the culmination of a series of actions which will hit the people I am pleading for very hard indeed. I cannot believe that the Minister is really frightened of the possibility of a few additional people coming into this country. If that is the case it should not weigh against the cause I am pleading for, that a number of these people who were legitimately intending to come here, will be probably held up somewhere in passage and unable to go back to the place whence they came, or to come into this country. I appeal to the Minister to allow the date to go back to the 1st July, or even to the 1st June, in order to avoid the hardships I have already indicated.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I think the House will abide by the decision it has already taken in regard to this matter. The matter is largely out of my hands at this stage, and I could not have accepted it at the previous stage. The House must not forget, in connection with this particular amendment, that there was a division of the House. All the arguments that are being brought forward now were brought forward on the previous occasion, and after the House had considered the matter there was a division, and this amendment was carried. I think it would be wrong for me, in view of the previous decision of the House, to go back on that decision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not understand the Minister&#x2019;s logic at all. The amendment was sprung upon the House in committee, and it is only since the effect of the amendment has become known that the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) and other hon. members, have realized what a great hardship the acceptance <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0699"/>of this amendment will work. The Government drafted this Bill after taking stock of the position, and they took July 1st as the date in question. They were satisfied that the mischief they wished to check would effectively be checked by the operation of the Bill being fixed at the 1st July. That did not satisfy some of the die-hards in this House, and the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart) thought he would improve on the Minister&#x2019;s effort by moving that the date of the operation of the Bill be fixed at May 1st. The Minister gave that proposal his blessing, and it was carried after a division in this House. The Minister&#x2019;s original proposal, after considering all the circumstances, was the 1st July. All that he is asked now is that the Government should stick to its original proposal, and not abide by a decision taken on the spur of the moment, and without the knowledge of the people chiefly affected by the Bill, who were not aware of what was going on. They realize the position now, and they tell us that it means unnecessary hardship in the case of quite a number of individuals. If the Minister thought that by moving forward the date to the 1st May he was shutting out a lot of fictitious immigrants, who were trying to avoid the effects of the Bill, I can understand it. But he has not said that, He has not said that there are a lot of immigrants who are threatening to come in on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>I gave notice of my amendment because when the Bill was before the committee of the whole House and an amendment was sought to be introduced to Clause 9 on the lines of my amendment the chairman ruled that that could not be done, because Clause 3 precluded an amendment of that nature being made to Clause 9. Therefore it is necessary for me to move an amendment to Clause 3. It will be necessary for me to explain the nature of my amendment to Clause 9 in order to justify the amendment to Clause 3, because if Mr. Speaker should approve the ruling of the chairman and my amendment to Clause 3 is lost, it will be out of order for me to move an amendment to Clause 9. I wish to put briefly to the House the difference between the amendment I propose to move in Clause 9 and the amendment which the Minister has on the paper to Clause 3. They both deal with the same matter, namely, the position of the wives and children of persons now lawfully and permanently settled in the Union, these wives and children being still resident in the countries which are not scheduled in the Bill. What I ask the House to adopt is this&#x2014;when a man is permanently and lawfully resident here and who has left in the country whence he came a wife to whom he was married before May 1 of this year&#x2014;we are not opening the door wide to all future wives or children born after that date&#x2014;these wives and children should be allowed to enter the Union. What I ask is that that wife and these children should be allowed to come in as a right, not at the discretion of a board, or going before a board and being dependent on them, whether they are to be allowed to come here or not, but because a man is a citizen of the Union and lawfully and permanently settled here, he ought to be allowed to bring his family here, if he wishes to do so. The Minister&#x2019;s amendment is different. According to the Minister&#x2019;s proposal, these wives and children must make application to the board, which may say &#x201C;no,&#x201D; we are not going to admit anyone over and above the quota of 50 allowed to your country. In that case they are barred. All that the Minister&#x2019;s amendment does is to say if the board does admit from that country, over and above 50. these wives and children shall have the preference. Well, that is something. It is a little better than the Bill as it stands, but it still leaves this objection that the man who has lived here does not know whether or not he will be allowed to bring in his wife and children from the country from which he came. The board are entitled to say &#x201C;no&#x201D; if they choose to do so. It is a precedent which has been followed in other countries which have restricted immigration that in cases of men who have become citizens of the country, their wives and children who have been left behind are allowed to come in as a right, and not as part of the quota. The Minister need not be under any misapprehension that if this amendment is adopted we are going to open the flood-gates to an unlimited and unknown mass of immigration from these countries. This is limited as strictly as it is possible to do. It is doing an act of elementary justice <span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_0700"/>and humanity to men who are citizens of our country. I do hope hon. members will bear with me, that there is a claim upon us. We are bringing into force at very short notice this restricting Act. People in this country who have wives and children overseas have not had time to make the necessary arrangements by which they would have brought their families in.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment. We can fairly hope the Minister will accept this amendment. There seems to be a certain amount of misunderstanding about the amendment he has put on the Order Paper. He will remember how this position was approached when we discussed this matter in committee. We asked that the wives and children of persons already domiciled in this country should be allowed to come in free of the quota and free of the board. The Minister said he would like to take time to consider the proposition, and he came forward and said he had agreed to meet our wishes to the following extent&#x2014;he would allow these women and children to come in up to the number of 750 in any one year, and then I asked him, &#x201C;Does that mean they have to come in subject to the discretion of the board or not&#x003F;&#x201D; And he said, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;They come in, board or no board,&#x201D; and he said &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; We were most distinctly under the impression that these wives and children would be allowed to come in as a matter of right, and not in the discretion of any board. The Minister may think this particular section sets that forth and honours that particular understanding, but as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) has said, I do not think it does, and all the Minister&#x2019;s proposal means is that those people can come in subject to the discretion of the board, but if they do want to come in they have priority over strangers who have never come in before. That was not what the Minister promised. I would say the Minister must do one of two things&#x2014;other accept the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville, or allow this matter to stand over so that he can give Clause 2 further consideration, because I would put it to him that Clause 2, as drafted, does not meet the case. I know that when we were discussing the matter in committee I thought the defect could be met by putting in certain introductory words, which he has now put on the paper. I submitted somewhat hastily, that that might meet the position, but on further consideration I do not think it does. Supposing these words are put in in Section 1 [Sections 1 and 2 read]; I read that as meaning as the hon. member for Yeoville has read it, that these wives and children shall, up to the number of 750, have priority over anybody else; but they still come under the governing clause of the section, and still have to run the gauntlet of the board. These wives and children up to 750 should have an indefeasible right to come into the Union, board or no board. I think that was what the Minister intended, but I have more than a doubt as to whether this will be effective. I am almost certain, from my reading of subsection (2), that it does not effect this. If I have correctly stated the intention of the Minister, and if this sub-section does not effect it, there is only one way of getting out of the difficulty, and that is to adjourn the discussion. If I have not correctly interpreted the intention of the Minister, then there has been a misunderstanding. The trouble is that we are now at the report stage, and I shall not be able to speak again on the matter when the Minister has spoken. Perhaps while I am on my feet the Minister will tell me if I understood him correctly &#x003F;</p>

<p>I thank the Minister. I have discussed this matter with half-a-dozen legal members on this side of the House, and they assure me that the clause does not effect what the Minister intended. I ask the Minister to agree that the debate be adjourned, so that he may further consider the matter, and put it on a proper footing. Let me point out a further defective drafting in sub-section (3). The Minister will notice that in sub-section (1) he recognizes the fact that this Bill starts to operate for a broken period of the calendar year, that is, from the first of May, and he has put in the clause the number who may enter for the remainder of the year, but sub-section (3) deals with the calendar year, and speaks of the number of persons being admitted for the calendar year, namely, 1,000. He has apparently omitted to make the same provision for the broken portion of 1930 under sub-section (3). In a spirit of co-operation with the Minister, I certainly think that the drafting of this proposed new sub-section is imperfect. It does not attain the object that the Minister wants to attain, and I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>What I want to move is an alternative amendment, and in order to discuss it, it must be before the House. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 41, before &#x201C;It&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section,&#x201D;; and to insert the following new sub-section (2) to follow sub-section (1): (2) The board shall grant all the applications for permission to enter the Union under this section (but not exceeding seven hundred and fifty in any one calendar year, which shall be included in the one thousand referred to in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of this section) made by or on behalf of wives or children under twenty-one years of age, of persons who were, at the commencement of this Act, permanently and lawfully resident in the Union, in preference to the applications of any other class of persons: Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to any woman who became the wife of any such person after the commencement of this Act; and provided further that if any such applications are made in excess of seven hundred and fifty in any calendar year, the board may consider and deal with such excess applications in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section.</block>

<p>I also want to move a few verbal alterations in the English text, and separately in the Afrikaans text. We have here before us two alternative amendments, the one is that proposed by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), and the other is the one I have just handed in. It has been said by the hon. member for Yeoville, and by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) that the alternative I have proposed practically leaves the matter as it was before with regard to the entry of wives and children of persons resident in this country before the 1st of May. They say that it still leaves the 750 that can be admitted from other countries under restriction to the discretion of the board. I am much surprised that there are so many lawyers opposite who support such an interpretation, according to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It seems to me as if it were the same with lawyers as with archaeologists, and that the law is just as little an exact science as archaeology. It looks very much as if the legal opinion on the opposite side of the House was exactly the reverse of that on this side. Let us look at the matter clearly and read the clause that I want to amend first in English. In English it begins as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be competent for the board in any calendar year to permit in its discretion any person born in any particular country not specified in a schedule in this Act to enter the Union for permanent residence therein, notwithstanding the maximum number of persons born in that country which may, under Section 1, be permitted to enter the Union.</block>

<p>I think that anyone with common sense will see that the board will not get discretion to deal with the unallotted quota of 1,000 as it pleases, but will be subject to the provisions of sub-clause (2). That is what I am now proposing that the discretion given to the board shall be subject to the provisions of sub-clause (2). What the hon. members opposite tried to explain was that sub-clause (2) was subject to the discretion of the board.</p>

<p>Suggest something then. I will consider it. But it is quite plain here that there can be no question that the board must allow 750 of these wives and children before all the others. Let me add something here in connection with what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that I had admitted that there was an absolute right for these wives and children to come to the Union. I did admit it, but with the reservation, of course, that they were subject to the ordinary immigration law. There may, of course, be criminals amongst them, or persons with contagious diseases.</p>

<p>According to my motion, the wives and children of those who were here on the 1st of May must be included in the maximum number that are allowed in that year under the quota. In the first place, the 50 of the quota for the country concerned must be exhausted, and then the general unallotted quota in respect of the countries under restriction. But I am not prepared to open the door wider. The principle is this, that if the women and children come in, and I want to give them all the right, then it must be done at the expense of their own compatriots who want to come in. We are opening the door for them, but it closes the door for their other compatriots. Hence they are included in the quota of 50, and the 1,000 which is granted to the countries under restriction. The hon. member for Yeoville wants to do that. He wants to give them the absolute right of coming in over and above the definite quotas. If we did that, then this Bill would, to a great extent, be useless. Then we should be opening the door very wide. The question is whether my proposal goes far enough. The department informs me that it makes ample provision for all wives and children. One thing I will concede, viz., that if we had accepted the limitation of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, viz., that this right should only be granted for three years, then that provision would not have been sufficient. But now that we are not applying that restriction, my department informs me that this provision is quite ample. There will, in all probability, be no one who will be able to come in. Therefore I think that there can be no question here of the restriction causing hard cases. My motion amounts to this, that the people can come in, but that they must come in under the quotas for the unrestricted countries, i.e., under the 50 for every separate country, and the 1,000 of the unallotted quota, while the hon. member for Yeoville wants them to come in freely over and above the quota.</p>

<p>In effect, therefore, the Minister makes no concession whatever. He absolutely sticks his toes into the ground and does not move an inch. I understood, a couple of days ago, when the hon. Minister last spoke on this subject, that he was going to make a concession, a substantial concession, which would remove our grievance. Now it is perfectly clear that no concession whatever is made, not in the least. The hon. Minister has not moved an inch forward. He is still saying that he sticks to these two limitations of 50 for each country, and in addition 1,000. In regard to the women and children, in so far as they have to be accommodated, their numbers must go in abatement of the quota of 50 or of the 1,000. I say that the Minister has made no concession whatever. In another form of words he has come round to exactly the same position. The complaint we made originally remains, that the Minister has not met the position fairly. Now the only way to meet the position is to adopt the amendment my hon. friend the member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) has moved, and to make the number of women and children to be admitted additional to the limits which have already been laid down in the Bill. That is the concession the Minister can give over the 1,000. Well, the position is quite clear. The Minister says he is advised that if his proposal is adopted and the 750 women and children are allowed in as part of the 1,000, that the case will be fairly met. <span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0703"/>He says that is his information. If that is so, if the case will be fairly met by letting in 750 women and children per annum, then what remains of his argument that, if they are additional to the 1,000, a wide door will be opened and very large numbers of people will be let into this country&#x003F; I assume that the Minister&#x2019;s information is correct, that the stream of women and children which is likely to come in under the amendment is not likely to exceed 750. That 750 per annum is a fair number to allow. That shows that there is no danger of excessive immigration under this amendment which the hon. member moves.</p>

<p>That 750 will not spoil the position. Surely the Minister will agree that that number is not excessive, and that number, when you are dealing with the total immigration to this country, is not an excessive number at all. If the Minister is right in his advice that 750 is a fair provison to make for the women and children that will come in, it is quite clear that the amendment of my hon. friend will be accepted and the number of women and children let in under the amendment will not be excessive. The Minister must see that under this amendment a very great hardship is committed. Only this morning I received a letter from a gentleman in Johannesburg, who writes to me to this effect: &#x201C;We are three brothers here who, years ago, came to this country and are lawfully resident here. We have a mother in one of these prohibited countries. What is the position&#x003F; Can we get our mother in&#x003F;" I do not know.

That is why we want to exempt these people, the wives and children of citizens already lawfully resident in this country, from the provisions of this Bill. Surely that is perfectly fair. Let them know where they are. At present they do not know. Nobody can answer that gentleman who wrote to me this morning, saying what the position is, whether he can get his mother in the next six months. Nobody knows what the position will be under the conditions and restrictions placed here by the Bill. I think the charge of unfairness and harshness is not escaped by the amendment the hon.

The other point was that they felt sorry&#x2014;and we all sympathize with them&#x2014;for the wives and children of people who are domiciled here. The Minister has met the objection by allowing 750 of them to enter annually, and the leader of the Opposition has, himself, admitted that that is generous, and that no injustice is being done to those people. But where is their pity now, what has become of the oppression they spoke of&#x003F; The hon. members of the Opposition now say that we must admit a large number. They are no longer sorry for the women and children, but they now say that 1,000 is not enough, and that we must increase the figure.

I expected the hon. member for Colesberg to regard the matter from a fair and just standpoint. The Minister, however, is only proposing here a different way of making trouble. If the Minister admits that it is fair and just to allow free entry to the wives and children of persons living here, why then does he want to restrict them&#x003F; If it is fair for them to come in, then they have a right of doing so whenever they wish without coming under the quota. The Minister must understand that he has taken a very serious step in Clause 1 in altering the date. I think it is very small-minded. In this case there are family and marriage bonds, and we must not try to break them. I know of cases where men entered the country five or six years ago.

<p>I am very glad the Minister of Native Affairs has moved that amendment, although it does not meet with my requirements, but, at any rate, it makes the meaning clearer. The Minister of the Interior, when he takes his stand, is so bigoted about it that nothing will move him. I am glad the Minister of Native Affairs has driven him out of his obstinacy. The Minister of the Interior must have known that the objection was a very valid one. I am not moving any amendment because I realize the absolute futility of trying to bring reason to bear with the Minister of the Interior. The amendment does not meet the demands of ordinary, bare justice and although it effects an improvement it means, so far as this provision is concerned, not only that these women and children are not coming in as a right, but they will still have to go through all the machinery before they can have an opportunity of coming into the country. It is true that after going through all the machinery the board will have to allow them to enter South Africa, but the Minister will deduct their numbers from the quota so, in effect, as far as new immigrants are concerned, the door will be closed. They can come in, not as a right, but as a grudging concession at the expense of other people. The amendment the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) is much more creditable to the House and the country because it recognizes the sanctity of family life. I do not propose to reason with the Minister on that matter, and I would leave it alone were it not for the fact that I have the highest regard for the good name and the reputation of South Africa&#x2014;higher than the Minister and his supporters. Before very long they will find they do not represent the true instincts of the people of South Africa, but in the eyes of the outside world, who cannot distinguish between the people of the country and its Government, a definite idea will go forward&#x2014;absolutely justified, by the action of the Minister of the Interior and his friends&#x2014;that South Africa not only has a disregard, but a contempt, for family life, and rather has a regard for assimilability, which in the eyes of the outside world will not be distinguishable from miscegenation, than for domestic life.</p>

<p>It appears now that the Minister sees some amount of substance in the difficulties we saw in the amendment. Now that his colleague has moved to delete those words it has more of the effect of the amendment as originally promised by the Minister. We are now entitled to ask, which do we prefer, the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion as now made, or the suggestion made by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan). It seems to me the question resolves itself now not into a hardship for the wives and children, but what is left of immigration from the nonscheduled countries, once this is done. I do say that you are practically shutting the door entirely to immigration from these countries. The clause says persons from non-scheduled countries can come in only if they are of good character, are likely to be assimilated by the inhabitants of the country, are not harmful to the economic and industrial welfare of the country and do not follow an occupation which is already full in this country. If you have a person who is so wonderful as to fulfil all these qualifications, and over and above that, commends himself to the discretion of the board, you do not need any limit over and above that. The thing is grotesque and ridiculous, and I do not understand what the Minister is driving at in regard to it. The amendment falls far short of what we, in common sense, desire in this matter. We are just as keen as the Minister in seeing that the immigration into this country is selected and that we are not flooded by those countries by which we are being flooded to-day; but we do say the Minister is going too far, and the reasonable thing to say is that new immigration is limited in these two ways; but why ban the children who have a right to come in, independent of any quota, and under the provisions of Section (9) as is to be moved by the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) thinks that he is an authority on family life. I just want to point out that he ought to know that there is no other nation in the world that feels so strongly about family life as the South African, that has more honour for it. We have shown this by accepting the amendment. The hon. member ought to know it. It is not necessary for him to threaten and to say that we will find that we do not represent the feelings of the people. I can assure him that we absolutely represent our people. The misfortune is that the hon. member thinks that this measure is directed against the Jews.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN BROEKHUIZEN</person>:</from>

<p>It is easy to make such wild statements, but we attach little value to them. Everyone who uses his common sense knows that it is so, and I am glad the Minister of Native Affairs has moved the amendment to make certain that the wives and children shall get precedence, because we feel that that should be so. It would be unfortunate for the husbands to have to live here without a chance of getting their wives and children out. The question we are now asked is to allow the 750 to come in without their coming under the quota of 1,000. As for myself, personally, I sympathize with it a little; I feel that the provision that they must form a part of the 1,000 will practically close the door to immigrants from those countries. The wives and children must, however, come in the first place, and, in the second, I feel that if the Minister of the Interior had been convinced of the reasonableness of the request, that he would have complied with it. I know he is a man like the late President Kruger who sticks to his point, but when he is convinced that he is wrong he gives in. I have, myself, had the experience when I tried to convince him of something, but I was unsuccessful. He has, however, proved that he gives in when convinced. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) is once more talking prohibition. Our view is that good suitable immigrants who adapt themselves to our people are desirable, and therefore immigration from other countries is permitted. I also feel that we must yield as much as possible in this direction. I wanted to say these few words to point out that the South Africans need stand back for no one in their respect for family life.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite true that now that the amendment moved by the Minister of Native Affairs is adopted, the only point between the Minister of the Interior and myself is that under this amendment these applicants will go before the board, and will come in as part of the quota. The Minister knows perfectly well that limited as this amendment is to persons who are married before this Act takes effect, and to children who are born before this Act takes effect, you cannot have a stream of 750 a year, or anything like it. Therefore it is absurd for the hon. member for Colesberg (Dr. Lamprecht) to talk as if we were going to add to the quota 750 a year, or anything like it. I should say that 750 altogether is much nearer the number who would come in if my amendment were adopted. I ask the Minister not to press this in what I may call a niggardly spirit. Let these people come in. It will be no possible detriment to the future welfare of South Africa.</p>

<p>In support of the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) I would like to ask the Minister to consider this point. The Minister told us a little while ago that it would involve the admission of 750 persons, the wives of men to-day resident in the Union, and their children.

<p>If you find that the numbers coming in as wives and children are so great that it would be dangerous to allow more of the unallotted quota in, then you need not allow any more of that category into the country. Therefore, I think, in the administration of the law you can get exactly what we are aiming at, and at the same time give way to this humanitarian appeal which we are making. If the amendment of the hon. member for Yeoville is accepted, you still have all the power you need, under Clause 3, to exclude too great a number. The board will have its discretion and need not allow even one of the unallotted quota to come in, and I think we shall be quite safe in leaving it to the discretion of the board. I seriously ask the Minister to consider that point.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOFMEYR</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to have further information from the Minister about this clause than he gave on the motion for the second reading. I listened to his statement carefully but it appeared inadequate to me, and therefore I referred to what he said as reported in Hansard, from which I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first clause deals with the recognition of degrees granted by other South African universities, by the University of South Africa including its constituent colleges, and also with the recognition of work and lectures for certain degrees of certain South African universities, and the recognition thereof by the University of South Africa.</block>

<p>That statement is not only inadequate, but it is also incorrect. From the statement he made it looks as if the clause only applied to universities in South Africa, but it applies to graduates of universities in the Union from elsewhere. I know in the main what the intention of the clause is, but what I would like to know is why the clause is drafted as the Minister has drafted it. Apparently the intention is to prevent the clause conflicting with the changes made in the universities of other countries. But I should like to know why we are here departing from the corresponding section in the Act of the Witwatersrand University, and also the clause in the Bill for the University of Pretoria, which is now under consideration by the House. It is certainly desirable to have uniformity in the Universities Acts in South Africa. I should like to know whether the Minister will have any objection to an amendment to bring this clause into agreement with Section 16 of the Pretoria University&#x2019;s Bill and the corresponding section in the Witwatersrand University&#x2019;s Act&#x003F;</p>

He says that the University will have the right of admitting &#x201C;such person to the status of holder of such degree in the university&#x201D;. Amongst these there may be persons who have no degree. Clause 1 refers to students who have taken lectures at a technical school, e.g., the Royal School of Mines, or a course for women, at Cambridge. They have no degree, and what then do these words &#x201C;such degree&#x201D; mean&#x003F; I think that it will be well to report progress and ask leave to sit again so that the Minister can consider this matter, when he has had an opportunity to consider my objection, he will see that it is well grounded.

There can be no object in admitting people who have passed an examination equivalent only to the bachelor&#x2019;s examination to the status of master or doctor of the University of South Africa.

<p>[Debate, adjourned on 30th January, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#chiappini">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHIAPPINI</person>:</from>

<p>As representing a very large urban area, in which there are two very large native locations, I would like to make a few remarks on the Bill. The principal Act referred to in this Bill was passed in 1923, and provided for the segregation and control of natives in urban areas. That Act, I think, worked very well. It is one of those Acts, like a good many passed in that period, which worked very well. Now it is proposed to improve on that Act, and it seems to me this Bill is going a little bit further than the principal Act. It provides that the natives outside urban areas should be controlled. It is quite natural, after a period of six or seven years, that circumstances will arise which make it necessary to amend an Act and put in further provisions. The Bill will operate right through the Union, of course, and we must assume that the conditions prevailing in the different urban areas vary very much in the different provinces. I have listened very carefully to the speeches made by hon. members, and I must say that as far as I can see their conception of native rights in the different areas, also varies very much. I want to give those who spoke, especially on the other side of the House, every credit that what they said was genuinely their opinion, although it was different from mine. I would like to support, very strongly, the speech made by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), who made, I think, a very moderate and statesmanlike speech, and appealed to the Minister of Native Affairs to allow this Bill to go to a select committee. I was sorry to see certain hon. members on the other side of the House take very strong exception to the Bill being allowed to go to select committee. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) said it would be a good thing to send the Bill to select committee so as to give the natives an opportunity of giving evidence. As far as I could see the idea of members on the other side of the House was that if we allow the natives to give evidence before a select committee it will to a certain extent spoil the natives. One hon. member said that if the request made from this side of the House were granted it would be an encouragement to the agitators. My view is that it would to some extent stop the agitators from agitating if you give the natives a fair chance of giving evidence before this select committee. I listened with interest to the speeches made on this side of the House, and particularly to the speech of the hon. member for Maritzburg (North) (Mr. Deane). He did not seem to be in favour of sending the Bill to a select committee. He said that Natal wanted the Bill as it was, and he indicated that the natives of Natal are having a very good time. I think he mentioned that they were earning very good pay, and that they did not wear clothes. After the hon. the Minister of Justice went to Natal with an expeditionary force he sent a commission there, and the report of the commission does not show that the economic conditions prevailing among the natives are so excellent. I do not want to criticize the state of affairs so far as natives are concerned in other provinces. I am going to deal with the natives in our province, and especially with regard to the Cape Peninsula. Coming to the Bill itself, I feel that from the speech made by the Minister of Native Affairs he has been appealed to by local authorities to bring in this Bill, and making my own deductions I cannot help thinking that the Minister has not given these people all that they asked for in this Bill. Some of the clauses of the Bill are very drastic. If I were a native and read some of the clauses contained in the Bill I would regard them as very drastic. <span class="col_1277-1278" refersTo="page_0709"/>It is possible that the Minister thought it necessary to make drastic clauses if the Bill were to be effective, and that he relies upon the public authorities, who will administer the Bill if it passes, to be as lenient and as sympathetic as possible. There is one clause I would like to refer to, and that is a clause whereby upon the request of a public authority the Governor-General may issue a proclamation preventing a native from coming into an urban area for the purpose of seeking work. I know that some of my hon. friends on both sides of the House will disagree with me in what I have to say on that clause, but I must say that I cannot agree to that policy, a policy whereby we want to make a law to prevent a man from seeking work. I feel that the natives has to bear taxation directly as well as indirectly. He has to pay his direct tax, and if he does not pay it under a law we have made we put him in jail. We deal with him in quite a different manner to what we deal with a European. On the other hand we are making a law here whereby we want to prevent him from seeking employment. That is not a fair way of treating the native, to make one law to prevent him from seeking employment, and to have a law on the statute book saying that if he does not pay his direct tax we will put him in jail. I know that there are people who say that the native is competing with Europeans and with the coloured people in the labour market, but I am not prepared this afternoon to go into the question. It is a very big question. Here in the Peninsula our natives, unlike some of the natives in Natal, all wear clothes. I think you will find some of them even going about with Piccadilly suits and &#x2019;varsity caps. The clothing manufacturers and the cap manufacturers and the boot manufacturers do not object. We encourage the native to uplift himself because we feel that he then becomes a consumer. The more he uplifts himself the more he becomes a factor in the civilized life of the Union; in fact a boot manufacturer told me that if half of the seven million natives were to wear boots every factory would be working full time. From what has been said I make the deduction that the Minister was not only asked to put in this clause, but that he was asked to go further and to make provision in this Bill that where there is in the opinion of a local authority an overplus of natives in an urban area they can be repatriated. I am glad to see that the Minister, if I am right in my assumption, has not put that into this Bill. Some of these clauses are drastic. There is only one hope for the native in the urban areas&#x2014;especially the native living a civilized life holding a responsible position such as in a store. That is that the Minister will remember the great responsibility which devolves on him to ensure that the Act is administered sympathetically. Millions of natives are looking to him; their destiny lies in the hollow of his hand. As far as natives in the Cape are concerned, if the law is administered in a sympathetic manner, it will certainly work much better than the policy of the mailed fist, I appeal to the Minister to instruct his departmental officials to see that if the provisions of this Bill are not carried out in a sympathetic manner, he will again come back to the House and ask for an amendment in the law.</p>

<p>While thanking the Minister for Clause 16 of this Bill, I nevertheless want to assure him that the principle contained in Clause 10 will cause general dissatisfaction, and I might almost say general indignation in the Free State. The reason is that the principle of that clause is diagonally opposed to the old Free State policy in connection with locations adjoining villages. The Free State view always was that locations next to villages were only sleeping and living places for the coloured people who were required to do the work of the villages. The Free State policy never was for the locations to develop into native villages. The principle of the clause mentioned tends in the direction of creating a state of affairs which will end in a native township being established alongside of every European village in the Free State. We cannot get away from that. When the locations were established the villages intended them to be just as a farmer engaging his servants for work, and then saying: &#x201C;Boy, you can build a house there.&#x201D; Just as little as the farmer could be expected to be compelled to have to take out a licence in the town for his work-people to carry on business, just as little can it be expected here. I can assure the Minister that this feeling does not exist only in me, but right through the Free State. Every Free State member has received telegrams and letters from the villages in his constituency, to use his influence to prevent the clause passing in its present form. I may point out that the telegrams come from town councils that represent every section of the Free State population. The Minister must not think that the opposition to the clause is caused by envy. It is not the people who have small shops in the villages, or trade with the natives who dictate the policy at municipal elections. The big shopkeepers, doctors, attorneys, farmers, who have retired, make up the town council in the villages, and they are decidedly opposed to the provision that the Minister may give power for native shops to be established in the locations.</p>

<p>We do not sell ground hurriedly in the Free State. I think it would not be permitted. The Minister, moreover, need not be afraid of following or honouring the Free State policy, because it is the one province in the Union which has introduced no problems. No Asiatic question, no drink question, no native franchise question were introduced by the Free State in the Union to be settled by the Union. We have always been a clean, white country, and want to remain so, and therefore we do not wish the Minister to drive us in a different direction. I also want to say that I do not believe that this provision will benefit the natives much, because we have the example adjoining our boundaries. In Basutoland the natives are allowed to carry on business as they please. As far as I know, there is not one that does so, but the trade is in the hands of Indians and Europeans. The Basuto, himself, does not carry on business. I just want to raise a few more points which are against the stipulation. In the first place the natives in the villages do not possess the necessary capital to establish proper shops. The Free State municipalities to-day have a right of allowing natives to set up shops, but they find in nearly every case where a request for a trading licence in the location is made by natives they are employees of one of the white shops in the villages. The trade is not done for the benefit of the native, but of some one else in the village, and I do not believe that it ought to be allowed in the circumstances. Then I want to say that such a business in the locations will make the work of the police considerably more difficult, because it will lead to liquor smuggling, and all sorts of vice, and will make the estimates of the Minister of Justice much higher to give every village in the Free State more police. That this is so I can illustrate by a small incident in a village near to my constituency, where they gave a native the right to open a butchery. About three months ago he was prosecuted, and it appeared that he had slaughtered about 40 cattle belonging to neighbouring farmers, including a good stud animal worth about &#x00A3;40. The Free State is very strongly opposed to that, and therefore protests strongly. I hope that if the Minister does not wish to introduce the Free State policy throughout the Union he will, at any rate, not force on us the provision as it now stands. We have a white population there in white villages, and the work-people in the locations merely live there. That is our view, but this clause will establish about 50 native townships in the Free State, and that we should not like to have.</p>

<speech by="#acutt">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ACUTT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support the amending Bill before the House in its broad principles. The hon. member who has just spoken (Mr. Chiappini) referred to the provisions of this Bill as being drastic. I realize that in many respects this amending Bill can be construed as drastic, but I think, after examining it, that the drastic provisions will not fall heavily upon law-abiding natives. There is one clause in the Bill which I do think is too drastic. That is Section (4). Under this section it gives one municipality the right of purchasing land within the area of another municipality. Furthermore, it gives the purchasing municipality full jurisdiction over that area, which is a very far-reaching measure. I should like to point out what the significance of this clause is. Let us take, for instance, the case of Port Elizabeth and Humewood. It means that Port Elizabeth, if it so desires, under this particular section, could establish a native village in the Humewood area and have complete jurisdiction over it. On the other hand, the town council of Humewood would be permitted to establish a native village in the Port Elizabeth municipality. I am sure hon. members will realize what an uproar there would be if anything of that sort transpired. I, therefore, take exception to that section of the Bill: I realize that this particular section is devised for the town of Durban. I happen to represent a constituency outside the municipal area of Durban, and I should like to read a telegram which I have received from the South Coast Junction Area Local Administration and Health Board, which runs as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This board places on record its emphatic protest against the proposed clause in the Bill empowering one local authority to acquire land, in the area of another to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the latter.</block>

<p>I think that puts the matter in a nutshell. I appeal to the Minister before this Bill becomes law, that he will see his way to so modify this particular clause that it will not be undermining the authority of these various local bodies which surround Durban. There is another section to which I should like to refer. It is Section (10). Under this section it gives to the local authorities certain trading rights in native villages, and native compounds, but prohibits anyone else to trade in the area except natives. I think that is a very good provision. We hear a lot of talk about the upliftment of the native, and giving him a chance to rise in the scale of civilization, and I think this is one of the cases where we can encourage natives to trade with their own people, and earn a living in that way, besides giving employment to many other natives. I think a local authority should give every encouragement to natives to trade in this way. There is one danger, of course, that natives who are not well-versed in the matter of trade, and unless protected, will be exploited by other traders. I think this particular sub-section should be tightened up in some way to prevent traders, other than natives, from in any way getting control of trade in native areas and simply using the natives as their tools. There is another question in Section (10) which I wish to refer to. It gives the local authorities the right to carry on trade themselves in native areas, and it specifies what these trades may be. <span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_0711"/>The trades are those of general dealer, butcher, baker and eating-house. I should like to see that list increased, and should like to see municipalities or local authorities having the right to run bioscope entertainments in native areas; I do not mention this in any frivolous way. I do not suggest that bioscopes should be run in native areas solely for the sake of entertainment, but properly controlled bioscopes, exhibiting suitable films, would be a means of giving education to the natives, and at the same time, it would keep them occupied in the evenings. I commend the suggestion to the Minister to include the running of bioscopes by local authorities in native areas. I am quite sure that if this were done, quite a lot of good Would be derived by the natives. Of course, Whatever is done in that respect, the very strictest censorship should be exercized in regard to the type of film that is exposed. As one realizes, it would do the native no good to see many of the films that are exposed in European bioscopes. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the question of the curfew. So far as the Durban district is concerned, the re-introduction of the curfew daw will be welcomed. But I can see, one weak point in it. Natives are allowed out if in possession of a Written pass from their employer or other authority, but I would remind the Minister that a great many natives can read and write, and in those areas, generally speaking, there are only native police who can neither read nor write. Owing to the increased number of educated natives, there is nothing to prevent natives writing their own passes. I think the Minister should tighten up that section in some way so, as to obviate this weakness in the law. I feel quite certain that unless something of this sort is done, the curfew law will not be of very much use in Durban and district. As I have said, on broad principles, I support this amending Bill. I should like again to appeal to the Minister in connection with Section (4) so to modify it that it will not be as drastic as it appears to be at present.</p>

<p>I just want to add a few words to what the hon. member for Senekal (Mr. Visser) has said. In the Free State we have, always had a different view about these things to the rest of the country. My hon. friend here is right. We took up a different point of view with regard to the Liquor Act. We also took up a different view in connection with the Asiatic question which came from Natal, with the result that we are not bothered to-day with all these things that concern the other parts of the country, and I think the other provinces ought to have followed the example of the Free State. In our province we can also boast that the native is more justly treated than in the other provinces. We willingly give him his full rights there. When he lives in a native territory we give him every right. But we have always hitherto held the view that a location is not a native reserve. It is a place where work-people live, and of course the work-people of the town or village, and therefore it is simply the village Management board or the town council which must have the say as to how the location must be controlled and regulated. It more frequently happens every day that working people lie idle in the locations and if we take away the right of the town councils to control the locations, then it will become still more difficult for them to keep the natives in order there. If I had a location of working people on my farm then I would dictate how things should he conducted there, and in our towns and villages we must not take this right out of the hands of the town councils. In.-the Free State we feel that it must not he left to the native to put up his own shops in the location. In the past, in his reserves and in Basutoland where the natives have full say, what part have they in the shops&#x003F; They are in the hands of the white man. This shows that the natives have not the desire and aptitude to have shops in their reserves and why must we give him the exclusive right to have shops in the locations. He will subsequently want ownership of ground and other rights which will cause much trouble to town councils. The land belongs to the town councils and it is they who are responsible for good government. I think there is something behind it. Trading is not his metier. He does not want it, because in the places where he has full rights, he also has that right, he does not use it, and does not take up trading. I hope the Minister will consider these points. The town councils must have full control over the locations if we do not want difficulties. I am convinced that the Free State is strongly in favour of the Minister meeting us on this point. It is the town council (not the Minister) that is the competent authority to decide whether there shall be trading in the locations or not.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>It would be a very fair proposal to refer the Bill to a select committee. Many believe that the crux of the native question is to be found in urban areas, where you have contact between black and white, in more marked degree than is to be found in rural areas. There, also, you have contact between the workers of the two colours&#x2014;the white artizan and the black labourer&#x2014;and because of that contact the whole future, as based on the native question, is set out before you, because ultimately the knowledge the native will imbibe will be the basis of his desire to improve himself. Because of his contact with the European he will have a desire to emulate the way in which the Europeans live, and seeing the European&#x2019;s habits, ways and appearance he will desire to emulate him sartorially. I think also that we are trying to legislate without giving sufficient consideration to the natives&#x2019; economic future, and yet we go on gladly and merrily legislating. It is also a fair statement to make that unless you have some idea of the economic future of the native you should go very warily with your legislating. This benign Government more or less throws its responsibilities on the local authorities to administer what is a <span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0712"/>very difficult matter. I have some reason for saying that I think you are shirking your responsibilities in many respects in asking the urban authorities to carry out a duty that in many respects is difficult. Take your ordinary municipality run on modern lines. You have a body of 18, 20 or 30 men&#x2014;sometimes women, which makes it more difficult&#x2014;and they have to administer a tramway system carrying 49,000,000 people a year and all the complexities that go with that; they have to administer an electricity department selling 80,000,000 units a year as they do in Durban; on the other hand they have the abattoirs to administer, a general revenue fund and a borough fund to deal with; you have 20 or 30 departments to administer, and on top of that there is the native question&#x2014;the administration of the Urban Areas Act. It will be realized how little time, study and real thought you can give to a question of this kind, when you have to deal with so many other multifarious questions. Having realized the difficulty that an ordinary town council is faced with, I have come to the conclusion that the administration of this Act is far too great a responsibility for a town council committee. I have come to that conclusion after working on various town council committees for five years. I think this House should give some consideration to that aspect of the question. There is another question to be considered. Every town throughout the country is widening its boundaries, or, if it is not doing that, it is taking on responsibilities for areas outside of its boundaries. The reason is that people who do not take kindly to control get outside the boundaries of a borough, and for that reason you have difficulty in an urban area, and greater difficulties in an extra-urban area. How are we going to deal with this&#x003F; To my mind it has been definitely proved that an ordinary committee of a local authority finds this matter too difficult to deal with. It has not the time. Further, it has no power outside the boundaries of the local authority. How can we best administer this Act so as to deal with these various aspects of the question&#x003F; I think the House should consider the establishment of a council, composed of representatives not necessarily members of a town council under the chairmanship of the resident magistrate, in each urban area. Take Durban&#x2019;s position. We have our own borough council, and we have 38,000 natives within that area, The peri-Durban area has seven health boards, each dealing with as difficult a problem as that which Durban has to face, though the number of natives is smaller. Durban tries to improve the condition of its natives in one respect, and immediately there are repercussions over its boundaries. Infectious disease may break out in the town, and outside there may not be any infectious disease, but you find the utmost difficulty in dealing with the peri-Durban area because of dual control. When you have to administer public health in big towns, it is necessary to have some sort of unified control. I suggest a joint council as a means to that end. I think you could in Durban, for instance, nominate two or three town councillors and one representative from each health board, and there you would have a body of men who could administer the Act. You could appoint the magistrate as chairman. The administration of this Act is so important that we should take steps to ensure, as far as possible, that it will be efficiently administered. I think the debate went over a very wide field in the first instance. It was stated&#x2014;I think by the Minister of Lands&#x2014;that the reason for the influx of natives into the towns was that they wanted to enjoy bioscopes and the gaieties of town life. On the other hand, the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) said that natives were being pitch-forked into the towns because they could not live in the rural area. It only shows how divergent opinions are on the question. The point is not so much how the native enters the town, but whether he is reaching the town for his own good and that of the European as well. That raises a very difficult question. The Minister does not like the natives coming into the towns at their own will, but is this a matter for local authority to prevent&#x003F; Once he is in the town, he is difficult to get rid of. It is a national job; the Government should control natives before entering towns. It is for the Government to find ways and means to deal with the method of dealing with this question. I think there are brains in the Government; if not, they could borrow from our front benches. The point is that the entry of natives should be stopped in its beginning. In Durban it is chiefly male adults who live in the compounds. By Section 4 you are prepared to allow Durban to buy land to establish a native village. Do you want us to establish a principle of encouraging-native family life in the towns&#x003F; If so, then let us hasten slowly, as by so doing we might be laying up trouble and difficulties in the future that we little realize. I have urged on the Durban Town Council that we should hesitate before establishing a native village, the present system works so well, why break it down&#x003F; I want you to go into the question of Durban and not alter our system which has worked so well. I want to say, further, in dealing with these matters, that the question of the curfew is one that will please the women of Durban. I do not want to say very much. I have a divided mind on the question of strict control and subjection on matters of that kind. But I appreciate it on behalf of the women of Durban, who have their own fears and anxiety of being under-policed at night time. I hope the Minister will give these points some consideration, it involves so much. It involves the whole native question. It also involves the poor white question. The more we can get the natives into their own areas, the more we shall help to solve the poor white question.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to one or two aspects of this Bill. In the first place, there are portions of this Bill which, to my mind, are futile, I am not opposed to them, but I think they are futile. There are other portions of the Bill which, to my mind, are harsh <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0713"/>and unfair. First of all, Section 22 of the Bill is repealed, and a new section is substituted, which says that local authorities may trade in a location. That is possible under certain conditions, but highly improbable, because municipalities to-day are opposed to such trading for the reason that the commercial communities in the municipalities are very large ratepayers, and the municipalities get large taxes paid by these people.</p>

<p>When the House adjourned I was pointing out that there are clauses in the Bill which are futile, while others are unfair. The clause which allows local authorities to trade in a location is a good one, if the Minister were a little more sympathetic, but as things are at present it is possible&#x2014;but highly improbable&#x2014;that municipal councils will be able to do any sort of municipal trading, because the people who pay the rates are not going to allow their money to be used in competition with them. I ask the Minister how many natives are there in the Union who hold trading rights in urban areas, and how many natives would be able to obtain credit if they were granted trading licences. The natives are poor because they are in receipt of low wages, are heavily taxed, and most of them are in debt. If the cause becomes law a native may carry on trade in a location, but he will be the cat&#x2019;s paw of a European or Asiatic trader. Our attitude towards the native is a curious one. We educate him, safeguard his health, prevent tribal fights and cure his diseases on the one hand, while on the other hand we tax him and underpay him. In some instances a native receives only 10s. a month and his food; this working out at 4&#x00BD;d. a day or a farthing an hour. I think the clause is a hopeless one. A drastic clause in the Bill provides that if native dwellings are found verminous or dirty the municipality in which the dwellings are located can provide the native with another dwelling. If the local authority has to provide the native with another dwelling free of charge, I have nothing to say on this clause. But I do not think local authorities are able to provide natives with free dwellings; they have interest, redemption and renewal charges to pay. It is here I feel that the native should have a little more consideration. Take an owner-occupier&#x2014; I am not talking of landlords who rack-rent&#x2014; but a native who possesses a cottage in a location which is worth &#x00A3;50, which is equivalent to a European cottage of &#x00A3;300. That native is probably an old man, who may be a pensioner and living on the charity of his friends. The cottage may not be fully paid for. The rooms, doors and windows may be out of order, and nothing conforms with the Minister&#x2019;s regulations. The Minister must remember that the cottage is all the man has in the wide world. In municipalities to-day we have the same position&#x2014;old men who have just one thing in the wide world, and that is a cottage for which they have probably worked for 15 years; and although such a cottage may be dirty and verminous, morally you should not touch it because it is everything the man has. Let the Minister destroy such a cottage by all means, if it is dirty&#x2014;if he gives compensation. The native looks to the Minister when he is in distress, and looks to him for help. I hope the Minister will take this point into consideration.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAMSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to add my quota to the expressions in favour of this Bill, which I think is a step in the right direction. The Minister referred to Durban in connection with Clause 4. Although Durban is the third largest town in the Union, from the population basis, its area, including the Congella lands, is only 8,200 acres. Durban&#x2019;s first attempt to solve this question of a native village occurred a few years ago when 194 acres of land at Wentworth were purchased with the object of establishing such a native village. The land in question comes under the jurisdiction of the South Coast Health Board. A lay-out was prepared which met with the approval of the Native Affairs Department under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health of the borough, which provided ten dwellings to the acre. In Durban seven dwellings to the acre are common, and I understand in Cape Town, eight to the acre are allowed. Under the building by-laws of The South Coast Health Board only four dwellings to the acre are allowed, which rendered it quite impracticable to establish the native village contemplated. All attempts to solve this difficulty proved futile. The provincial council was approached with a view to giving the town council extended powers on the lines suggested in Clause 4, but it requested the parties concerned to settle the matter amongst themselves. Durban cannot be accused of shirking its obligations to the natives who seek a refuge within its gates. In a recent publication I find that the Native Affairs Department have spent no less than &#x00A3;276,345 in the interests of the natives within the borough boundaries. This comprises barracks, eating-houses, a native brewery, locations, married quarters, schools, hospitals and so forth. The council was ready, prepared and willing, to establish a native village, but under the condition that they shall have control in the area. At the present time, the council have a more extensive scheme under consideration, and have acquired an option of 2,890 acres of land and contemplate setting aside 1,445 acres and spending &#x00A3;68,000 for native settlement. The Central Housing Board are prepared to advance &#x00A3;39,000 for the erection of dwellings. This land may be described as prairie land; a portion is under sugar cane, and there is no European habitation within a reasonable distance. It has the advantage of being in close proximity to the industrial area, has railway facilities, and from every point of view is eminently suited for a native village. It is contended that the control contemplated in Clause 4 enables a powerful municipality to override a <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0714"/>small adjoining authority. But one can readily visualise the obverse side of the picture when a smaller authority adopts an attitude of &#x201C;the dog-in-the-manger.&#x201D; I would like to draw the attention of the House to the principal Act and what safeguards are provided to meet a case such as this. I will read Clause 7 of the principal Act. [Clause read.] The clause provides that the consent of the Minister and the Administrator must be obtained before a native settlement can be established. It also goes so far as to provide for expropriation in case agreement is not come to, so that ample safeguards are provided against a powerful authority using the big stick on its less fortunate neighbour. But that Act does not give the power which the Bill now before the House gives, a necessary power inasmuch as while the purchasers would become landlords, they would still be held up by such a provision as I have referred to, viz., a by-law which provides that only four dwellings to the acre are permitted. When it is necessary to acquire the consent of the administrator, that I contend provides all the necessary safeguards for the smaller authorities.</p>

<p>We had a very serious riot in Durban last June in connection with native affairs. There were several deaths and numerous casualties. The Government sent a commission to Durban and I will read a few extracts from the report of that commission which is signed by Mr. Justice de Waal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I sat at Durban on eight days between the 3rd and 8th July. Most of the matters contained in the terms of reference are readily capable of solution and answer, but in order to report on the causes which gave rise to the riot of the 17th June, I shall have to go fully into the conditions under which natives are housed and live in Durban and their grievances, real and imaginary. There are 38,000 natives resident within the borough of Durban. They are mostly of Zulu origin, and are superior in appearance and general culture to the native one meets with in other large industrial centres.</block>

<p>It is a very lengthy report, but I am only drawing attention to that part of it that has a bearing on this measure. Under the heading, &#x201C;native locations and places of recreation,&#x201D; the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot be too strongly urged upon the borough that the establishment of a native location is a pressing need. The borough has done much in erecting high-class barracks and eating-houses, and huts for married workers. But it should do more. The huts, some 120 in number, are well constructed but are totally insufficient for the needs of all the better class natives who wish to have their families with them. What is essential is for the borough to lay out a residential native township where a native who wishes to do so may reside with his family.</block>

<p>That is the crux of the matter from the point of view of Clause 4 of the Bill. The paragraph I have just read has been regarded as conveying censure on the Durban corporation for their sins of omission, but I maintain that the sins of omission lie at the door of the provincial council who refused to give the corporation power to establish a location two years ago. It was the provincial executive who were so tardy in the matter, that they prevented the corporation from getting on with the job. Clause 4 gives the corporation the right to impose its by-laws within the area set aside for a native village. That is all they require, and the by-laws the corporation are most anxious to enforce are those relating to sanitation and public health. I understand that the provincial council have taken steps to prevent Clause 4 from going through in the form in which it appears at the present time, not that they have any objection to a native village, but because they claim that the expansion of the borough boundaries comes within the scope of their jurisdiction and that that jurisdiction should not be encroached upon. In this connection I would like to draw the attention of the House to an opinion, by an authority well-known in the House and in the country, on this question, an opinion by Mr. Graham Mackeurtan. This opinion was obtained some years ago when Mr. John Taylor held the position of town clerk of Durban, who was also an admitted authority on municipal law. Counsel was asked to advise whether the administrator (under Section 23 of the interpretation of Statutes Act 5 of 1910) is empowered under the provisions of Ordinance 1 of 1854 or of Law 5 of 1864, or of any other law, from time to time to alter the boundaries of the borough of Durban or otherwise, or whether any alteration which may be desired of such boundaries is a matter which should be dealt with by the provincial council by means of a provincial ordinance. The reply to that is a lengthy one, but it is summarized in the last paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Law 5 of 1864 only entitled the lieutenant governor to alter the boundaries of a borough so as to include within those boundaries, land conveyed to a borough by original grant from the Crown. This is clear from the title and the preamble of the Act, if it is not entirely clear from Section 1. All land so conveyed up to date and still belonging to the borough of Durban, does in fact fall within the existing boundaries. Prom this it follows that before those boundaries can be extended, legislation is necessary. In so far as such extension may be sought so as to include within the borough any area which may properly be described as a harbour area (such as the Congella lands and the Point reclamations) it is perfectly clear that a Union statute alone would achieve the desired result. The whole control of harbours and wharves is vested in by the South Africa Act in the Governor-General in Council and the provincial council would have no power whatever to bring such areas within <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0715"/>the purview of municipal boundaries. Nor am I in the least degree satisfied that an inland extension could be achieved by means of provincial legislation. It is true that under the South Africa Act the power to legislate in respect of municipalities is conferred upon provincial legislatures, but I very much doubt whether that entitles the provincial council to extend the borough boundaries at all. There are many laws, as for instance the Road Board Act, the Mines Act and other Acts, which do not apply inside boroughs, but do apply outside them. To extend the borough boundaries means a wholesale alteration of people&#x2019;s settled rights under statutes of that kind not falling within the jurisdiction of provincial legislatures. In these circumstances I think that the only way to extend the borough boundaries in any direction at all is by means of a Union statute.</block>

<p>I think it is clear from that opinion that the only way to give relief to Durban is to have Clause 4 as it stands at present passed by the Union Parliament. I have just one more quotation to make. Immediately after the commission over which Justice de Waal presided in connection with the native riots the Native Affairs Department, held a further enquiry into the position at Durban. They were assisted there by several prominent people who take an interest in native affairs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of this commission proceeded to Durban on the 26th November, 1929, with a view to investigating the position of affairs in relation to the native population in that borough. The Secretary for Native Affairs was with the commission for the major portion of its stay in Durban. The commission interviewed the Borough Council of Durban, representatives of the health committees of areas adjoining the borough area, the Chamber of Commerce and individual Europeans who came forward to tender information. The commission also met representatives of native organizations, individual natives, and a representative of the European and Native Joint Council. The commission reported that the position in Durban is unique inasmuch as no &#x201C;location&#x201D; has ever been set aside for the residents of natives. Thus, large employers of labour have erected barracks for their male employees and the Borough Council has confined its housing efforts for natives working within its area to similar barracks, and a modest 120 houses for married natives. The accommodation so provided is not sufficient for the number of natives actually working at any period in Durban and in consequence natives of classes (1) to (5), i.e., (1) industrial labourers; (2) dock labourers (togt boys); (3) commercial labourers; (4) ricksha pullers; (5) clerks, teachers, agents, etc., have hired private accommodation either usually from Indian landlords) within the borough, or within the health committee areas adjoining. It may be mentioned that these various &#x201C;barracks&#x201D; are within the industrial and commercial areas in European centres. It must not be overlooked that the Borough Council has some excuse for its apparent neglect in this matter. There is no land within the borough which could have been set aside as a native location. The Borough Council is extremely anxious to provide a native village and has at the moment an option to buy land which in the commission&#x2019;s opinion is well suited for the purpose. Unfortunately, it is faced with a serious difficulty as this land lies outside its own area but inside the area of jurisdiction of a health committee. The latter it is understood, while not objecting to the Durban council establishing a native village on that land, requires that such village shall be subject to the bye-laws of the Committee. This appears to the Borough Council to be an impossible position and it does seem fair that the Durban Council should get the relief which it asks for, namely, that power should be given under the Natives (Urban Areas) Act (Amendment) Bill to enable a municipality to establish, maintain and control a native village in the area of a health committee where the Minister and the Administrator consider that such a step is desirable.</block>

<p>I desire to emphasize the decision contained in this report, more especially as it has come to my knowledge that influential attempts are being made to induce the Minister to whittle down and amend Clause 4. I have no hesitation in saying if that effort should prove successful it would defeat the scheme for the housing of natives in Durban and retard their progress for an indefinite period. In Durban we are deeply interested also in the curfew clause. The abolition of the curfew by legal decision has created a very undesirable state of affairs, the activities of the Amalaita gangs renders this highly desirable, not only in the interests of the European population but in the interests of all law-abiding natives residing in that area. I trust that this will also pass without amendment.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not suppose there is any member of this House who does not realize that the Minister of Native Affairs is carrying a very heavy responsibility; there is, in fact, no Minister who is carrying a heavier one. The hon. Minister comes from Natal&#x2014;I believe he was born in the Garden Colony and knows the conditions existing there. One of the members from that Colony (the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg) (Mr. Deane), was telling us a few days ago that recently the streets of Durban had been runing with blood, that women were afraid to venture out at night, and that the affairs were more serious than since 1907, when the Bambata rebellion occurred. This afternoon the hon. member for Durban County (Mr. Eaton) stated that so far as Durban is concerned, things had never been so peaceful as they are now&#x2014;that everything <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0716"/>in the Garden Colony was lovely. When we hear two diametrically opposed statements like that, it is difficult to know which is true. All I can say to the Minister of Native Affairs is this, if he comes to the Cape, he will find we have had no serious trouble for the last thirty or forty years. The South African party, from the very outset, have done their best to introduce a consistent native policy in this House. In 1913, the South African party introduced the Act of Segregation, 1913. The natives fought that Act from the beginning. They sent a deputation to England to protest against it. They felt it encroached on their rights. After 1913 the South African party introduced the Native Affairs Act (1920) still connected with the principle of segregation. And later the Urban Areas Act which we are now discussing. That Act of 1920 made provision for the establishment of a native affairs commission and the composition thereof, and prescribed generally the duties of their commission. Its functions were as follows&#x2014;Consideration of the administration of native affairs and recommendations on any such matters to consider and make recommendations on any matter of routine submitted to it by direction of the Minister. And last but not least that Act made provision for full consultation with the natives through the commission upon all matters dealt with by Parliament and the administration in which the natives were primarily and directly interested. The Minister, I understood, recently instructed that commission to report upon the Bill we are now discussing. I will, however, deal with that aspect later Last year this Bill was introduced by the present Prime Minister, who was the Minister of Native Affairs. He recognized the necessity and desirability of consultation with the interested parties and withdrew the Bill before the second reading and submitted it to the select committee for native affairs for consideration and report. He stated then that the reason for so acting was not because there was anything extraordinary in the amendments proposed, but that it would expedite matters considerably, and many important points necessitating careful inquiry were involved and could be better dealt with if it were referred to select committee before the second reading. He therefore moved that the order for the second reading be discharged and the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Native Affairs. I sat on that committee and we gave the matter our most earnest consideration. We took evidence from a considerable number of representatives of European bodies, municipalities and so forth. I have the report here and I make bold to say that the recommendations of that committee have not been studied by very many members of this House. If they had been I think the Minister of Native Affairs would have unhesitatingly accepted the suggestion of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) that this Bill should be referred to a select committee before the second reading. At that committee to which I refer, representatives of the municipality of Johannesburg came down as well as the representatives of the municipality of Durban and Bloemfontein, and the very provisions that are being made in this Bill to-day were proposed to that committee by the interested bodies. Yet that committee did not dare at that stage to make any recommendations with regard to such new proposals. For the edification of members I would like to read portion of the report the committee placed before the House. This was in March of last year. It states inter alia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many important points were brought to the notice of your committee by the various witnesses examined, foremost amongst which may be mentioned&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) A limitation upon the entry of natives into municipal areas in excess of the legitimate and. reasonable demands of the labour market in such areas.</li>

<li>(b) Expulsion and exclusion of coloured people from native locations where provision is made for coloured persons.</li>

<li>(c) The lack of machinery to deal adequately with the repatriation of undesirable or unemployed natives for making provision for employment of such natives elsewhere.</li>

</ol>

<p>The committee made the following recommendation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your committee recognizes, although these are questions in regard to which it is desirable to introduce measures of legislation or reform without undue delay, such far-reaching consequences may be involved that they should be dealt with the greatest circumspection. Unfortunately, owing to the limited time at its disposal to deal with the matter, in view of an early termination of the session, the committee has not had the opportunity of hearing sufficient evidence on the different phases of these questions from the parties concerned to justify it in framing definite proposals for bringing about an alteration in the present state of affairs where it seems desirable.</block>

<p>The committee made provision then upon those points actually and urgently necessary to be dealt with and provided for in the Bill. These new points, however, which arose, were not dealt with, as it was considered it would not be fair to deal with them until the interests of the people concerned, and more especially the natives who had not given evidence, were directly represented before the committee. I will now return to the Native Affairs Act of 1920. As I said before, this Act provided for consultation with the natives by the Native Affairs Commission on all matters in which the natives were directly interested. The Minister has, during the recess, I understand, instructed the Native Affairs Commission to consult with those interested in this Bill and to report to him. I asked the Minister a question about that a few days ago. I asked if he had instructed the commission to hold an <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0717"/>enquiry into the administration of the Native Urban Areas Act and if he would lay the report on the table of the House. That is a report that we desire, and it should be laid upon the table of the House before we proceed with this legislation. It is the duty of the Government to place the full facts before the House and to have a discussion on the report before we proceed further. The reply of the Minister to my question was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No enquiry has been held by the Native Affairs Commission into the general administration of the Natives (Urban Areas) Act, but the commission was requested to consult with some of the municipalities principally affected by the Bill, which was adopted by a select committee of this House, and to obtain their views and those of other bodies or persons interested, on the need for further amendment of the Act referred to. I am considering the desirability of laying the commission&#x2019;s report upon the table.</block>

<p>We are still waiting for that report. I asked to see it at the Native Affairs Office, but was told that it was not available. I say that it is entirely wrong that we should pass any legislation in this House until we know what the report of the Native Affairs Commission is and until we know the views of the natives. Therefore, I say that this Act to-day is premature so far as any new principles are concerned. As I said before, in 1913 the natives opposed the Act and the principle of separation or segregation, but we find that the natives themselves are generally in sympathy to-day with the general principle of segregation in urban areas. We find that they are beginning to realize that it is in their own interests in the towns and the urban areas that they should protect themselves. I have here a resolution which was passed by the Joint Council held at Bloemfontein on the 19th of December last. This congress was attended by representatives from the Cape, the Transvaal, the Free State and apparently gave very earnest consideration to the Urban Areas Bill. Resolution No. 2 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the good of the residents in municipal locations, congress finds that rural natives should not be allowed to enter urban areas, but because of the treatment meted to the natives in rural districts, congress finds it not wise to prohibit rural natives entering urban areas until the Land Act of 1913 has been amended.</block>

<p>We are trying to prevent the natives coming into the towns, but we are not finding out the reasons or causes which compel them to come into the towns. As the hon. member for Yeoville said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are trying to pump out the ship and we are not trying to stop the leak.</block>

<p>We are starting at the wrong end. Surely we must realize that this influx of natives into the towns and into the mining areas, is not because the natives like work, or because the parents want to send their sons and daughters to work there. It is because under the economic conditions prevailing to-day they are being forced to go there. Until we look to the other end and try to stop the leak from the outside and not from the inside, only then shall we find a solution for our present troubles. I have received a letter, as I suppose has every other member, from the Transvaal Agricultural Union signed by the President, H. R. Abercrombie. In that letter he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The control of natives entering the towns should be in the hands of a national board consisting of members of the mining and agricultural industries, with a chairman appointed by the Government. The natives could then be diverted to the primary industries.</block>

<p>I do not know whether that means that the mines will be able to devise means to attract the natives into the primary industries or whether the farmers will be able to divert them to the mines. It is a doubtful proposition to me. It is, however, extraordinary that you get two bodies representing the farming and mining industries to come together to try and force the natives into the particular areas in which those bodies consider they should work, without any consideration for the natives themselves. They are not to be considered in the least. I think myself that the Minister of Native Affairs is facing an extremely difficult and serious situation. He told us this afternoon that the natives from Portuguese territory working on the farms are to be turned out and counted as prohibited immigrants. He said that those natives might go to the mines but not to the farms. I understand there are some 40,000 or 50,000 natives who are working in the sugar estates and other industries in Natal and on the farms in the eastern Transvaal. If that huge mass of labour is to be turned away, this country will be in grave difficulties. Any man who studies the conditions here must realize that we are an exceedingly poor country agriculturally, and that our chief, if not only, asset is the native, and unless we make the best use of our native labour we shall not be able to carry on. Certainly in Natal and the Transvaal native labour is not being used to the best advantage. Under our system these natives work on farms for three months and then they are turned adrift. Naturally they gravitate towards the towns, and once a native has tasted the excitement of town life, he is apt to remain in the town. That is the problem that is to be faced. The Minister should try to find a remedy for it. Last year Canada imported some 20,000 labourers from Europe during the reaping season, and the Argentine regularly imports labour from Italy. We should try to devise some scheme to utilize our natives on the same lines. Then our educational system is at fault. Natives complain <span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0718"/>that on the farms their children cannot get education. A commission should be appointed to enquire into the question of native administration from every aspect, including that of fanning. With regard to Clause 3 of the Bill, I was more than astounded, I was hurt at the attitude of the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) which, however, apparently met with considerable support from the Government benches. He said we must get all the surplus native labour and redundant labour out of the towns&#x2014;by redundant meaning the work carried out by a native which could be performed by a white man. Rhodes in the early nineties brought in the Glen Grey Act, and taxed the natives with the object of forcing them out to work. Natives from the territories assisted to build the Simon&#x2019;s Town dock, and after the Chinese left the Rand, agents begged and implored the natives to work on the mines in the Transvaal. In the Transkei, in 1912, Europeans had to obtain a permit from a magistrate if they wished to buy liquor, simply because it was found that gentlemen from Johannesburg were tempting the natives with liquor to proceed to work on the mines. Now these very people are turning round and saying that the natives must be kept out of the towns. Do they know that at least 30 per cent. of the natives desiring to proceed to the mines are turned down by the doctors owing to phthisis and general debility contracted from mine labour. These are the natives the hon. member for Roodepoort wishes to turn down! It is the Cape native who is carrying, very largely, the sugar estates on his back, and is also working on the mines. When they are no longer fit to work on the mines, when they have given of their best, they drift into the towns to earn money, and now they are to be called &#x201C;redundant.&#x201D; All the juice has been squeezed out of the orange and now the rind is to be thrown away! The whole thing is totally unfair. It is all very well to talk about segregation in its narrow sense, but there is not a man in the House, apart from the hon. member for Roodepoort, who believes that it is practicable. One of my complaints against the Bill is the provision for sending the natives hack to the place whence they came. What is going to happen to the native in the Free State, for the place whence he came is the European farm&#x003F; He has lost connection with his tribe and race and may have become a wastrel, a scoundrel and a rogue, while the native woman has become a prostitute and is diseased. Now we are told they must be sent back &#x201C;to the place whence they came.&#x201D; Recently 40 natives were sent back to the Transkei because they had created a disturbance. Already the result is very serious, and assaults have been committed on white women in the Transkei and they are going to continue. Is it fair to the well-behaved native in the Transkei that these rogues and rascals should be let loose amongst them &#x003F;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>Would you take them back on your farm&#x003F; I have no doubt there are many of these dissolute people who were born on farms in the Free State where the natives have no reserves. I wonder what the hon. member would say or do if he one day found a policeman with half-a-dozen dissolute women and a few vagrant criminals who happened to have been born on his farm handing them over to his care and custody&#x2014;returning them &#x201C;to the place whence they came.&#x201D; Exactly the same applies to the decent native in the reserves whose sons and daughters may have lost all decency and become criminals and wastrels. They do not want them. These people should be sent to labour colonies and not allowed to drift back and disseminate disease amongst the tribes in their own areas. I can speak from experience in these matters, because I have lived in Umtata for many years. It is the terminus of one of our railway lines, and we have this mass of uncontrolled natives and diseased native women coming into Umtata, and drifting across the river into the native location. I say it without pride: we have one of the biggest cess-pits of roguery and rascality there in the country. Unless we deal severely with that particular class of person, and the native is saved from his own people, we are going to have a position created which is extremely dangerous. I think the Minister knows that there is a very strong feeling on the part of the natives that they should be heard in this matter. It is all very well for the Europeans to say that the Bill affects them, but it affects the native a good deal more. In common fairness I do think it is a fair proposition to put to the Minister, and it will make a great difference if native representatives are heard. Even if he turned down their proposals, consultation has a salutary effect on the natives. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) stated that the agitation which was going on was very largely due to economic conditions. I regret what the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. M. L. Malan) said. If the Minister of justice had been in the House and the Riotous Assemblies Bill had been in force, the hon. member would probably have been deported because his speech was tending to cause hostility and ill-feeling amongst the natives if the hon. member for Heilbron was correct in his attitude. Where are we going to end&#x003F; Every hon. member has a duty to perform and those of us who represent natives must speak freely. Hon. members from the Free State spoke strongly against the issue of trading licences to natives in native areas. To-day we have set aside certain locations for natives in urban areas to live in. We tell them. &#x201C;This is your area.&#x201D; Immediately the native turns round and says, &#x201C;If that is my area, I would like to trade in it.&#x201D; I admit the native is not a trader. He has not been educated up to it; he has not yet had an opportunity, but because of that is he <span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0719"/>to be prevented for the rest of his life from becoming a trader&#x003F; Is it right that an Indian who comes from India may trade, and is it fair that a Lithuanian may come here, apply for a licence in Bloemfontein &#x00E0; week after his arrival and get one, when the native, who has lived here all his life, and is a citizen of the country, should be refused&#x003F; They say the Orange Free State is the model province and takes up a liberal attitude towards the native, but upon my word, I am surprised at the Free State. I want to ask hon. members for that province, is it fair&#x003F; I know the Prime Minister is with me. He says, &#x201C;Give the natives an opportunity of learning to trade.&#x201D; which is all they ask for. The natives want an opportunity. They must learn to crawl before they can walk; but give them the chance to learn. It is only fair to the native of the Free State that he should hold the same position and have the same privileges as the natives in the Gape and the Transvaal. It is all very well for an hon. member to say that a valuable cow was stolen because there was a native butcher in the location, but that would have taken place even if there was no native butcher. That is no argument. The Free State has been unfair to the natives; they have Basutoland on the one side, and Bechuanaland on the other, and are bloodsucking from the native areas. I do say they must be fair and give the natives an opportunity of rising in the scale of civilization. There is one particular aspect with which I would like to deal in conclusion, and that is the economic aspect. In Umtata there are as many natives as in the district of Klip River, and three times as many Europeans in the Klip River district as in Umtata and the Klip River area is twice as large. Yet in revenue returns Umtata has contributed twice as much. It is due to one fact, and that is that under the Cape system&#x2014;you may decry it as you will&#x2014; we have had a more liberal policy and we have trained the native to develop and they have tried to raise themselves above the scale of the bare Zulu, to whom an hon. member referred. As long as the Zulu goes naked he will not work as the Cape native does, or go to the Rand for the mines; and that is the reason why to-day, taking the Union as a whole, the native of the Cape Province is carrying the great burden on his back of service for the European population.</p>

<p>Kadalie and his gang was directly responsible for that. He comes from East Africa and Wellington, another agitator came from Natal. If you are going to push measures through without consulting the natives, and without giving them an opportunity of voicing their views before this House, you are going to create a feeling amongst them which is dangerous. I hope the Minister will realize that he will never get a satisfactory solution of this trouble until he gets at the root of the trouble. I do not say give the natives land ad. lib., but I believe a much better use could be made of the land the natives have than is being made of it to-day. I make bold to say, however, that there is not a penny on the coming estimates for the development of the land in the native areas. The native does not go to Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town for the sake of seeing bioscopes and to attend dancing halls. He goes to these places to pay his taxes and to keep his family alive, and to provide education for his children. That is the aspiration of the decent, clean native, and until the European population realizes that, you will never have a solution of the native question. Let us try to prevent the influx into the towns by providing means to prevent the natives from being forced into the urban areas. I do hope that the Minister will give the natives an opportunity of giving evidence before the select committee, and it does not matter very much whether they do so before the second reading or after, as there are so many principles involved, but he must be given opportunity. I understand representations have been already made to him by the natives of Bloemfontein and Johannesburg and I have here a petition from the natives of Johannesburg, copy of which I believe he has and I hope he will meet these people in their very reasonable requests.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAYWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill contains important amendments to the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923. Unfortunately a flaw has crept in. The better housing which was contemplated by the Act has unfortunately resulted in the natives streaming from the countryside into the towns, and this exodus has greatly increased during recent years. It may perhaps be attributed to the better housing in the towns, but the stream consists chiefly of the lazy native from the countryside. The fact is that the Town Council of Bloemfontein recently gave evidence before the commission which went into the matter, and from this it appeared that there were about 12,000 natives walking about Bloemfontein without work, and it is just that rind which leave the countryside because they are too lazy to do the work on the farms. The question may be asked whether the farmer actually pays so little. The wages have remained more or less the same for years past, but yet the stream to the towns has constantly increased. During the seven months, from June, 1929, to January, 1930, 2,781 natives came from outside of Bloemfontein to look for work. These natives come to the locations and compete with the young natives who have grown up in the locations, <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0720"/>in the labour market. During January no less than 580 natives entered Bloemfontein looking for work. That is the clearest proof how large the rush of natives to the towns from the countryside is and therefore I am glad that it is being laid down that the town councils shall have proper control over natives who do not work. We find in the Government Gazette that it is said that a two-thirds majority of a town council is necessary for a resolution to expel natives from an urban area, but the Bill speaks of a bare majority. I am glad of that. There is another point in this Bill of especial importance to the Free State. It is one the Free State is opposed to, viz., the grant of trading licences in locations to natives. The Free State has always prohibited the issue of trading licences to natives and Asiatics. The question is whether we are to regard the location as a native territory, or as a locality where the towns work-people are kept. I make bold to say that the Free State has always regarded a location as a locality where natives are kept as work-people for the town. If that is the position, then the native is not entitled to trade, moreover, the granting of permission to natives to trade in their locations will lead to many difficulties. The native population in Bloemfontein has increased very much in proportion to the white population of 22,000. In the last two years the number has doubled, and if things proceed so fast it will mean that we shall have a tremendous native population. This will make the position much more complicated, but the question is whether the native is suited to trade. The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) pointed out the experience, in the Transkei. When we go into the Transkei, we find that all the trade is in the hands of Europeans, mostly English &#x201C;traders,&#x201D; but also other white dealers. If we allow the native to trade in the location, then we shall see the shop in the location being run by a native, but really owned by a European. The danger is that certain white people will try to get hold of the licences in order to make large profits. Suppose the native gets a trading licence in the Bloemfontein location, then possibly a white man will be willing to pay &#x00A3;1,000 to have control over that native&#x2019;s shop and he will make big profits. It must be remembered that in Bloemfontein the natives have to be paid a stipulated wage of 3s. to 3s. 6d. a day. Then there are the taxes, etc., and the trader in the location will not have the relative expenses. Consequently the white dealer who gets hold of a shop in the location will be able to sell much cheaper than the dealer in the towns. Regulations will possibly be made to prevent this, but it will be very difficult. We have retail dealers to-day in Bloemfontein who come from overseas and don&#x2019;t understand a word of English or Afrikaans, but who keep a native shop. They pay a native to run the shop, but they are the owners. In the same way they can get hold of the shops in the location. If that is so, the location trader will sell much cheaper than the one in the town. That would mean that that shop in the location would be so much cheaper that even white people would try&#x003F; to get something from the location, because they would be much cheaper than the town. We must bear this great danger in mind, when dealing with the Bill. I think that if once we concede this point allowing the native to trade in locations, then we admit that the location is a native reserve, and there can be nothing to prevent the native of having his, own possessions and properties there. In other words, we shall have a native township adjoining the white township, which will have its own rights, and consequently continuous friction will be created. Therefore the old Free State point of view that the location is the place for the residence of the native workers in the towns is far and away the best. It is often the bad kind of native who will not remain on the farm because he is too lazy, who streams into the towns, where he commits all kinds of crime. We ought therefore to keep that sort out of the towns, because they constitute a danger to the white population there.</p>

<p>I wish to support the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) in his appeal that this Bill be sent to select committee for the purpose of allowing consultation with leading natives on the provisions of the Bill. The hon. Minister was recently in King William&#x2019;s Town and I think he there came into contact with a very superior class, of urban and other native people, not the migratory type that one meets in the large industrial and mining towns but natives who have grown up side by side with the European population, respecting us and being respected in return. I know that there are occasions when you have to say to the native &#x201C;Thou shalt or thou shalt not&#x201D;, but I do maintain that this is an occasion for mutual discussion between European and native. When the hon. Minister was in King William&#x2019;s Town he left an impression among the native people of, not alone wisdom and understanding but of sympathy, I have this in Writing from natives themselves who say that the Minister regards them as &#x201C;his children&#x201D; and not merely very remote stepchildren. If this Bill is sent to select committee it will do much to enlist the support of the natives, especially in view of legislation that this House anticipates having to deal with shortly in reference to native matters, by doing so you will pay them the deserved and rightful compliment of discussion, discussion between European and native leaders. I think the hon. Minister has realized the excellent atmosphere that exists between the two races in King William&#x2019;s Town, this is due largely to the practice of consultation, we have our advisory boards and native welfare societies where we meet, not perhaps, as equals, but certainly as friends able to consider the points of view of each section. Even if the hon. Minister is not prepared to accept the native&#x2019;s point of view on this Bill surely he can show them that he is, at least, prepared to listen to them. I strongly support the request that this Bill go to select committee with power to take evidence and call for papers.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words on a subject which has also been discussed by other members from the Free State. We know that in the past it has appeared necessary to have a Native Urban Areas Act, and that Act now needs amendment. The clauses propose provision for the further extension of the areas for natives, and to help them to increase in the most suitable way in that area. That is exactly the difference. Our view has always been, and I hope it will always remain, that the localities within the urban areas where the natives live are not considered native territories, but as urban areas where they are housed, where the native labourers can live. We therefore trust that the Minister and the House will give us the opportunity to amend the provision which deals with the trading by natives. I do not want the natives to be oppressed, but I challenge the hon. members for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) and Kingwilliamstown (Mr. Baines) to give the name of one native trader in their territories. They spoke so much about the desirability of giving the natives a chance of trading, but it is all in the hands of Europeans and others. Not that the natives are not sufficiently developed, but the cause is in our rotten system of issuing licences to everyone as long as he has a white skin, whether he is competent or not. That is the cause of there being so many poor natives and poor whites because they are exploited by those who never should have had licences. They are not competent to carry on &#x201C;trade&#x201D; which is the pulse of the people. We must try to only issue licences to the class of persons who will realize the importance of their work, and we must feel that the occupation, just as any other, demands the most efficient powers, people of the highest moral sentiments of honesty and duty. We must try in that way to protect the poor creatures against exploitation. Just take my little village, the population is about 8,000 natives, and less whites. We do not require 8,000 natives at all, but we give them the opportunity of stopping there particularly those who will not work. We cause the taxpayer to be obliged to give water, light and sanitary facilities to the natives. The taxpayer will have to pay some more thousands of pounds this year to cover a loan for those purposes. It is stated that the Free State exploits the natives. May I just say that if hon. members went to that model state they would see that natives have been living with the farmers on the farms for generations. What is the direction, however, we are now taking&#x003F; When a young native is fourteen years old he can decide on his own future, and the parents are powerless and after his eighteenth year he pays poll tax and is entirely his own master. I am father and guardian of my child, until its twenty-first birthday. Our system is wrong. We are giving further opportunity for conditions being developed to the detriment of the native himself. I hope the Minister will meet us in the matter, and will exclude the Free State from the trading provisions, even if the other provinces must have them. No province has done so much as the Free State in protecting the native against himself. Therefore I am against a measure which I feel will be injurious to natives. I hope this Bill is not considered part of the native policy which is still to be dealt with, because we are here going to create native territories in every village in our country, besides the great native reserve which exists in all parts of it. We must provide housing for the natives who work in the towns, but let us lay down the strictest provisions, and let us see that every man in the native locations is working. What is the reason, notwithstanding our thousands and millions of labourers, with all our natives, coloured persons, and poor whites, who have to be found work, we continually hear the cry of a shortage of labour in our industries. What is wrong &#x003F;, By means of this Bill we are encouraging Europeans and natives to do as little as possible, and to live as parasites on others. We must get rid of this system. Every inhabitant must contribute to the upbuilding of the country. We are, however, educating our population wrongly, and the level of morality is dropping. In the old days our ancestors considered every debt a debt of honour, but as a result of the exploitation by people who never ought to have had licences, and the low business morality, we have got into this sad position. I have received heaps of telegrams, even from the chairman of the Free State Municipal Congress to protest against the provision, and I ask the Minister to, in any case, exclude the Free State.</p>

<p>I would put this point, and I do not think it has been mentioned here before. It is one that concerns the natives in the huge locations, and the one particularly in my own constituency. We have there a native location of some 20,000 natives, and we have for that location an advisory committee that has done amongst the natives, a tremendous amount of good work. From time to time advice has been sent in to the municipal council, and from time to time their deliberations have been simply recorded and nothing more has been done. I can tell the House this, that amongst those 20,000 natives there is not one single medical officer and at any time when urgent medical aid is needed, it is not forthcoming. I can assure hon. members of this House of this fact, that urgent medical aid has been needed, and the natives have sent in from time to time to <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0722"/>doctors in town to come and attend to these people, but they will not come and attend to these people unless they first see the colour of their money.</p>

<p>I admit that, but when they send in their reports to the local authorities, they are simply disregarded, and no attention is paid to them. Unfortunately the death-rate amongst the native children is abnormally high, although when they are born they are normally healthy. This high death-rate is due to the lack of proper medical attention and advice. The advisory committee has brought this matter to the notice of the authorities, but their attitude is expressed in the words &#x201C;They are only natives,&#x201D; so the advice of the advisory committee, excellent though it be, is disregarded. The regulations should be tightened up so that the local authorities should be forced to pay attention to the recommendations of these people, and be compelled to carry them out. When you have a population of 20,000 natives, their health conditions should be looked after properly, and at East London they are. The chairman of the advisory committee&#x2014;who is the inspector of the location&#x2014;is an excellent man, and the committee take an intelligent view of affairs and put forward admirable suggestions. I am in full accord with the Bill and welcome it in every way, but it should be tightened up so as to be of practical use.</p>

<p>Up to a very little while ago my view would have been the same as that of my respected colleagues from the Free State, because I was under the same wrong impression that they are still under to-night, and we do not think on this matter on the same lines. I agree with them that segregation is a sound policy for the country, but if we do not want to allow the native to trade in the locations then we must see that the natives do not do it in the towns and. villages. What do we find now in nearly all the towns and villages in the Free State&#x003F; Many shops have a little shop adjoining for the natives and the natives trade there just as they would do it in the locations. Certainly in the location there will be strict supervision, so that the European cannot trade in the location, and this actually takes place in these little shops in the towns. Some of the less privileged Europeans go and buy in the little shops where the natives trade. I cannot see the distinction. It is a greater danger to allow natives to trade in the towns, than in the locations. We can keep better supervision in the locations, but we cannot do it when the native trades in the town or village. As for me, I want to point out that Bloemfontein, which is the chief agitator in connection with this matter, is already issuing trading licences in Bloemfonten. I do not know if it is so, but I hear that 70 licences have already been issued to natives in locations, not to permanently carry on trade, but to go smousing in the location, and that is a more dangerous state of affairs than giving a licence to someone who can trade there permanently. I have a few telegrams, and I believe every Free State member has received similar ones. The contents of them all is more or less the same, and they all come from the same source. It is therefore clear to me that those people want to use us for protecting their trading rights, and I will not allow myself to be used for that.</p>

<p>So do I, and apart from the towns the traders in the villages who approached me in the matter, no one has asked me to vote against this clause. My country electors certainly have not done so. One of my friends said here that an experiment has already been made by giving a butcher&#x2019;s licence to a native. He said the result was that the native was convicted of stealing a head of cattle, but it often occurs on the Free State farms that cattle are stolen. In Vrede, where the natives have no such licences, a group of natives were recently arrested and they admitted that they had stolen over 200 cattle in the last few years. Therefore, the theft of that beast cannot be ascribed to that trading licence. If these natives in Vrede can have a licence then possibly things would have gone better, and I am sorry to disappoint my Free State colleagues in this matter. I thought as they do once, but after considering the matter in a sober light I came to sound views. I hope that they will also shortly do the same.</p>

<p>On these various changes, especially rooting out people you say are redundant. Our position is we have an open roadstead, and we have steamships coming in day by day. I have known as many as 19 to lie in Algoa Bay, and have also known the day <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_0723"/>when there were none at all. There are days when a large number of men are required to work these ships, which require labour to discharge; that means 400 to 500 boys every day, and if you are going to reduce that labour, you are going to have a serious state of affairs. I can remember in the old days when we had a location in the centre of the town&#x2014;the London Missionary Society location. They had to remove out of that area, and were moved a little to the north. These poor people had to buy ground at Korsten, and they are now trying to get them out to go to New Brighton. If they gave evidence you would find there is a good deal to be said by them. I have a letter from the superintendent which is very favourable. There is a feeling they are overriden, and if they were treated firmly and fairly, they would get rid of that feeling. I know it is the Minister&#x2019;s intention to do the right thing. We have at Port Elizabeth people who are the great-grandchildren of those born in the original location, who are useless on farms and do not know how to work a spade. I think the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) said, &#x201C;send them to Tembuland, where there is plenty of land, and also to. Zululand.&#x201D; He has a beautiful dream of whites on the one side and blacks on the other. Where are these people to go&#x003F; I think you will find if it is explained to them that the regulations are for their own good they will accept. We had no trouble at Port Elizabeth such as has been stated; there was a great deal of newspaper trouble. The trouble we had some time ago was with the harbour board natives. They had a very strict system manager who said to these natives that if they did not want to work, they would get a pass and would not be taken on again. They agreed this was fair and the trouble ended. As to the economic question, there are certain few merchants who insist on underpaying these people, and trouble ensues. The majority give fair treatment and wages. We get our domestic service in Port Elizabeth from natives and coloured, and there are any amount of them to have. Attempts were made to use the poorer whites, if I may use the term, but they looked upon domestic service as derogatory. I feel that if you entertain the suggestion put by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) in such a clear and nice way, you will not only get on with the Bill, but get it through with the good feeling and support of the natives.</p>

<p>I think that unlike any town or city in this country, Johannesburg has had the bulk of the trouble that led to the alteration of the Act as suggested by the Minister in the Bill in its present form. Johannesburg realized the evils of the Native Urban Areas Act as it was because of the interest it has displayed in carrying out that Act, in bettering the native, eradicating slums, and avoiding the unnecessary spending of ratepayers&#x2019; money on natives flooding into the town who had no right to come there. Johannes burg, in order to fully understand and convey a clear impression to the legislature as to what is necessary for the improvement of the native, appointed a committee of native affairs out of the city council. Johannesburg did not lend her ears to the advisory boards constituted by natives which have no idea of how to deal with the evils of the slums in the towns. She has entrusted the matter to men of experience; who are interested in the welfare of the native, and the committee of native affairs of the city council has suggested the lines on which legislation should take place. The committees and boards who object to the Bill have not displayed that interest in the natives and in their towns which they owe to their towns. They have been lagging behind. Members who have been speaking against the Bill have not the merest conception of the nature of it, We have redundant natives in the towns, and it is suggested that we are squeezing them. The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) suggests that, and the hon. member has not the merest conception of the intention of the Bill, nor of the circumstances and conditions prevailing in the towns. Johannesburg has spent over &#x00A3;750,000 on native locations. She is faced with an expenditure of another &#x00A3;500,000 or &#x00A3;700,000 in the near future, and unless this Bill comes into force soon she will probably have to spend another &#x00A3;1,000,000, and still the town will be menaced by slums. The European suburban areas are not improving but depreciating because of native slums. Is it fair to the Europeans who are spending money to improve their suburbs that this should take place&#x003F; I cannot see the force of the arguments of hon. members who are opposed to this Bill when so much depends upon the measure. The sooner it passes the better, because more money will be spent in the interests of the natives when it is through, and justice will be done to the Europeans at the same time. European properties will not be depreciated as is the case to-day. Hon. members cannot successfully advocate the interests of the natives in this respect when they forget the interests of the Europeans.</p>

<p>I wish to support the last speaker. Most of the speeches delivered this evening have been on behalf of the natives generally, but the Bill deals with natives in the urban areas. It is only the members of the House who have to deal with the natives in urban areas who understand what is at the back of this Bill. I wonder whether the Minister has got the contents of a letter sent by the Transvaal municipal association. The association welcomes the amendments proposed by this Bill, but as the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) has pointed out the select committee which sat last year sat for a very short period. Their deliberations were rushed. They sat eight times, and altogether they deliberated for twelve hours. The Transvaal municipal association states that the amendments proposed in the Bill do not go far enough. Some tightening up is needed in <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0724"/>their opinion, especially in regard to the position of natives in locations, and the question of liquor-selling, and also respecting the question of redundant natives. With reference to the suggestion that bona fide wives might be allowed to go into the locations, it is difficult to know whether these women are really married to the men or not. Then there is the question of the whole position in the locations. This, perhaps, should be delegated to the municipal authorities.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SHAW</person>:</from>

<p>The fixed policy of the whole of the Free State was in the past that native areas should be set apart by the towns for the service of the town. But to-day the position is changing vastly. The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) sneered at the state of affairs in the Free State, but I think I can say, without fear of challenge, that the natives in the town I have the honour to represent are better treated than any natives in the country. This is not only in the interests of the whites but of the native. Natives in Bloemfontein are being displaced from their own employment; natives born in the urban areas are being displaced by natives from outside so that, I think, the Bill is long overdue. I have to support the municipalities in the Free State in their attitude that the Minister should have no say as to whether the natives should be allowed to trade in the locations. The municipalities take the view that they have bought this area and have placed it temporarily at the disposal of the natives. They are supplying them with all manner of conveniences, enabling them to live in better style than in the past; and they consider that, for their benefit, as well as for that of the town, it is in the interests of the natives that this clause should be deleted as far as the Free State is concerned. They believe the native will simply be exploited by other interests. If the native had proved capable of being a store keeper, then there would be something to be said for the viewpoint that he should be entitled to trade in the native areas of the town, but there is a possibility that the native in the town who is put in a store as a figurehead will be exploited by people outside and he will certainly become the tool of these people for the purpose of evading the regulations which apply to store-keepers outside. That is the difficulty which will have to be met if the Minister carries out his idea of demanding that native trading shall be allowed in the urban areas. It is not only the fact that the regulations regarding trading may be evaded, but there is a chance that, in the present licensing laws, we cannot avoid increasing licences. I think trading is overdone and that there should be means of curtailing licences. At present, I understand, there is no means of refusing the application of anyone for a licence. If these regulations are not tied down, then we shall have a flood of licences in the locations with the result of over trading which will not be in the interests of the native, or of the trader in the town. One feels there is a certain amount of justice in the demand that they should be allowed to trade, but the natives are being refused other things that would appear equally just in their own interest, from time to time. I hope the Minister will grant the plea of the municipalities in the Free State to have the same powers as in the past to refuse, wherever they think fit, a licence to permit native trading.</p>

<p>The Minister may rest assured that on this side we have nothing but the desire to assist him in the legislation he is responsible for. The Minister may not require our assistance. We know that in the ordinary parliamentary custom he would not introduce any measure without the assurance in advance of the support of the hon. members sitting behind him; so perhaps our assistance is not required, but he can have it if he wants it. We wish to co-operate with him as far as possible. I am sorry the air has not been cleared about a number of native matters. Unfortunately it is not clear that all hon. members have made up their minds as to whether the native is a human being or an animal. I hope the Minister, when he replies, will be quite clear about this. Until the point is cleared up, it is impossible to bring in sound legislation. Many of us view with some concern the manifest reluctance with regard to this measure to take the native into consultation. We have a very useful Native Affairs Commission, but their advice is not enough. We must go deeper. If there are hon. members who are not clear whether the native is a human being they will perhaps look on the Native Affairs Commission as veterinary surgeons who are in close contact with these people and are able to describe to the Government what their reasonable pains, diseases or wants may be. That is what we want to get. If we want to put the natives on the plane on which I consider they should be put, we want direct consultation with them. There is a tendency to legislate for natives qua natives. I would prefer that they should be recognized, in the first instance, as South Africans, and that we should legislate for them <span class="col_1309-1310" refersTo="page_0725"/>as South Africans as an essential portion of our social, economic and industrial system. We do not want in this country, above all, to be continually putting on our statute books legislation particularly directed towards the interests of one race, or class or industry. It should be viewed as to how it affects South Africa as a whole. I hope the Minister will make it clear to us what his views are on the matter, and that he regards the native as a South African and as an integral portion of our people whose fate is inevitably linked up with ours. I believe it is the case that the Minister has not yet visited some very important parts of South Africa. Of course, he has not been in office very long, but I should have thought he would have made a great point of going to the Transkei as soon as possible after he took office. There, there are many problems to be worked out, the working out of which the Minister should see for himself, and see the many admirable results that are already to be seen in the Transkei. I venture to suggest to him that he should visit the next meeting of the Transkei council which I understand meets in April. He will there see things for himself and he will be given, perhaps, a new idea of what is in the native&#x2019;s mind, and of the native&#x2019;s mentality, and what is his state of development. Of course, I am not speaking of purely political matters, but venture to put these points before him, and I think they are reasonable points. I wonder how many members on both sides of the House have ever visited the Transkei and have taken the trouble to make themselves acquainted with what is going on there. The Prime Minister did pay such a visit, and I think he will be the first to admit that that visit was valuable to him, and I am sure he regrets that he did not go there years ago. There, an experiment is being carried out covering many years, of great importance to us, and it will be useful to all concerned, particularly in the administration of native affairs. It is not enough to read about them; we must come into personal contact and see exactly what is going on. Then, too, the Minister, I think, has visited very few of the large locations in some of the large towns. Surely it would seem to be a little premature for him to be the sponsor of this particular Bill without getting rather more first-hand information than he is possessed of at present. The whole thing is intensely complicated. No one can sum up in a word or two a specific solution for the native question. The word &#x201C;Segregation,&#x201D; of course, occurs at once. But I do not think anyone has ever put forward any practical scheme by which segregation in the wide sense can be adopted in this country as between the black and European populations. Of course, we have social segregation already. There is no difficulty about that. But segregation, to be effective, must be on a very large scale. It must be on a gigantic scale. It must be fairly complete and thorough, or we shall remain in the same position that we are in at present. Has the Minister really become a convert, or has he adopted segregation in its wide sense as part of his policy&#x003F; I want to convey to him, too, the undoubted inclination of those natives who are civilized, or who are approaching civilization. They are not content with the policy of repression being carried out so long. They point out to me on the occasion of my visits the impossible position they are in. They told me, and it can be verified by figures, that only 8 per cent. of the area of the Union is reserved for native use or native occupation, only 8 per cent. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can give me the exact figures in his reply. I do not think he will deny that this is fairly accurate. If we remember that the natives are at least three-quarters of the population, the disproportion is very great. That is pointed out to me in one form or another every time I visit my constituency. They point out that they are forced into the towns and they are met with every obstacle.</p>

<p>Where are they to get the purchase money from&#x003F; The Prime Minister must be reasonable. I am trying to be reasonable, and I say that the natives have not the command of money. They have not got a land settlement scheme to help them, such as Europeans have. There is no legislation enabling them to acquire land on easy terms. They cannot acquire land on the same terms as Europeans can. Perhaps something might be done in that direction. Again I say if the native is considered as a South African, as a South African citizen, surely he is entitled to some of the reasonable benefits which are reasonably given to South African citizens. I want to put a very grave point indeed now. I believe the Prime Minister is rather enamoured of the word &#x201C;segregation.&#x201D; I do not know what the real idea is. Do these people who desire segregation desire the native to be removed entirely, or practically so, from European areas&#x003F; Do they, or do they not&#x003F; If so, is it practical&#x003F; Do they want to have a rigid dividing line between the European and native population as is done in the case of Basutoland and Swaziland, and, to a certain extent, in the Transkei&#x003F; Is it desired that that should be extended&#x003F; Are there those who think that South Africa would be far better off if we were in the position, say, of Australia, New Zealand or Canada, with no natives at all&#x003F; If that is a desirable state of affairs to be brought about, can we work for that end&#x003F; We know, of course, that it cannot be done at once. Is it desirable, and can we work to that end to make South Africa, as regards the native problem, rather like Australia or New Zealand or Canada, where they have not got these complications of colour&#x003F; It is not impossible to do that if it is really <span class="col_1311-1312" refersTo="page_0726"/>desired. Do hon. members who speak sometimes of the drawbacks of the native population, and how it is hampering progress in South Africa, really desire that&#x003F; Do they desire that the native population shall be gradually withdrawn from South Africa, and that South Africa should become a white man&#x2019;s country in the true sense of the word&#x003F; Otherwise, will they argue that this can become a white man&#x2019;s country under the present conditions or under a perpetuation of those conditions as they are now&#x003F; Will they argue that it can really be called a white man&#x2019;s country, or say: &#x201C;We can go on in the future with the present mixed population and mixed conditions that we have at present, and have segregation&#x201D;&#x003F; Is segregation on a large scale really desired&#x003F; I, for one, believe it is quite possible. If segregation on a large scale is really desired, I think it is possible. Look to the north, where we have enormous mineral developments foreshadowed in Northern Rhodesia, the only considerable drawback being lack of labour. If we really want to get rid of our natives, I am sure our friends in Northern Rhodesia would be glad to have them. Is that desired&#x003F; That is what segregation really means, if it is to be done on a large scale, and unless it is done on a large scale, it is not worth talking about. If we desire to have this a white man&#x2019;s country, I believe this end could be secured in the course of time by encouraging our natives to go where they are wanted, but I do not think any responsible statesman will take that view. If not, why talk of segregation&#x003F; You cannot bring about industrial segregation. The world will not stand this depriving of one portion of the citizens of the means of developing themselves simply on account of their colour. The war now going on in the world is one for markets. Production has overtaken and is overlapping consumption. There is nothing we produce in which we have not rival producers in other parts of the world, and they will be only too pleased of the chance of pushing their wares if they can create a prejudice against ours. That prejudice will follow if the colour bar is pushed too far. Other people say the natives should be treated as children. That is very sensible up to a point, but when you talk of children it is implied that eventually they will develop into men and women, and as we treat them so will the future of the country be affected. We do not want to train children&#x2014;and the natives are regarded as children&#x2014;so that they will have a legacy of hate and revenge to wreak on those whom they think have kept them back and oppressed them. If you consider the natives as children you must remember that some day they will grow up to manhood&#x2019;s stature. Does the Minister seriously hope to alter the course of development of a race or nation by legislation&#x003F; Has it ever been done&#x003F; Does he hope seriously to affect the natives&#x2019; future by legislation in advance&#x003F; I do not think he will be able to produce a case where the course of a nation was mainly affected by legislation Legislation follows, but does not precede, civilization, and it is impossible to hold back the advance of any race indefinitely by means of legislation. That is another argument for not putting these laws hastily on our statute book without the fullest possible enquiry from those who are most interested in the subject; and, naturally, the natives are as interested in their future as the Europeans. Again, I would ask the Minister to make it quite clear he is not legislating solely for the convenience of the European section of the community, as the hon. member for Roodepoort (Col. Stallard) would advise him, but for the betterment of South Africa&#x2014;not for that of only one race or class, but for the permanent benefit of the whole community. If the Minister will go into the health statistics of the native, he will be appalled, I think. The mortality in the native locations on the average in the larger towns is at least five times that of the European, which is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and also constitutes a very grave danger. It must be looked into, and we must arrange our legislation regarding natives, not only for their health, but for that of the whole community. I do not think that matter has received anything like the attention it should deserve and it deserves more. The Bill may fairly be characterized as a retrogressive measure. There is very little assistance to the native, who is viewed as one who must be kept down and in his place. I would urge the Minister to avoid repression, which is a futile policy and never has been effective. No race can be kept down unfairly and unjustly. I will sum it up by an apothegm; speaking of force, it has been said: &#x201C;You can do anything with bayonets except sit on them.&#x201D; You can hold down things by force for a time, but no state of society is stable or satisfactory that is kept in position by force. That is my complaint&#x2014;there has been too much repression and too little amelioration of their condition, and the natives have a good many things to complain of which I will not go into now&#x2014;taxation of their necessities, indifferent wages, and so on. They cannot expect an improvement unless the economic side gets more consideration than it has had in the past.</p>
