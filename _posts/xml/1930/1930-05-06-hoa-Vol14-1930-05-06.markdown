<ol>

<li>(1) Whether, in the re-appointment of pensioners to positions in the railway services, <span class="col_3733-3734" refersTo="page_1939"/>he is giving effect to the provisions of section forty-five of Act No. 24 of 1925, viz., that full payment in respect of the office or post in which a pensioner is employed shall he made and shall not be subject to abatement; and, if not,</li>

<question by="#heyns" to="#minister_of_education">

<num>II.</num>

<from>Mr. HEYNS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Education:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) What are the benefits attached to the State pension fund in view of the fact that, as the Secretary for Education says in his report, his department cannot obtain suitable instructors because, among other reasons, the pensions offered compare unfavourably with annuities which can be bought more cheaply from insurance companies;</li>

<li>(2) whether the pensions are so inadequate that the majority of officers are obliged to insure their lives in addition to contributing to the pension fund;</li>

<li>(3) whether the feasibility has been considered of paying the pension contributions into a life insurance fund on the &#x00A3; for &#x00A3; system, by which the officer will be provided for life, as is done in the case of the university pension funds; and</li>

<li>(4) whether all contributions to the Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund are returned to both married and unmarried members, including those who are divorced and widowers, (a) when they are retired and (b) when they are dismissed?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_education" to="#heyns">

<from>The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The staffs of the schools under the Union Education Department are members of the Union Pension Fund and therefore as regards pensions are treated as members of the public service.</li>

<li>(2) Most people, whatever the pension scheme under which they fall, would probably go in for additional insurances.</li>

<li>(3) This possibility was considered but the University Teachers&#x2019; Pension Scheme which is on an insurance basis was not regarded as suitable.</li>

<question by="#heyns" to="#minister_of_education">

<num>V.</num>

<from>Mr. HEYNS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Education what steps have been taken or will be taken to insure that there will be a direct systematic flow of pupils from the primary schools to the technical schools instead of leaving it to chance?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_education" to="#heyns">

<from>The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:</from>

<p>The housecraft and trades schools under the department are practically full to the limits of their accommodation, and there is no need in their case to direct a systematic flow of pupils to them. The department is in a position to select suitable entrants from a large number of applications and is assisted in this by the advisory committees. The agricultural schools serve particular areas and each principal with his advisory committee tries to keep in touch with the provincial schools in his area. He also tries to obtain the co-operation of the local inspector and the principals of provincial schools.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Education whether, in view of the finding of the Bloemfontein Juvenile Affairs Board, that trades schools to a large extent mean so much wasted energy and expense, the whole question of technical education will be enquired into&#x003F;</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_education" to="#heyns">

<from><span class="col_3735-3736" refersTo="page_1940"/>The MINISTER OF EDUCATION:</from>

<p>The finding of the Bloemfontein Juvenile Affairs Board referred to cannot be regarded as fair or even well-informed criticism. The trades schools have been steadily improved since they were taken over by the Union Government and form a necessary part of our system of industrial education. It is not necessary to institute a special enquiry into their usefulness for of this the department has sufficient evidence, and it is furthermore completely au fait with the problems which arise in connection with them.</p>

<num>X.</num>

<from>Mr. DEANE (for Dr. Steenkamp)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Public Health why Dr. van Niekerk, of Vosburg, was appointed district surgeon for Namaqualand despite the applications of local medical practitioners, the higher qualifications of the latter and the strong representations by the public?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_public_health" to="#deane">

<from>The MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH:</from>

<p>Dr. van Niekerk is no less qualified for the post of district surgeon of Namaqualand than the other doctors who applied.</p>

<p>Strong representations on behalf of these other applicants were only made by one or two individual persons. Strong representations were however made by the Divisional Council of Namaqualand and the &#x00C0;.C.V.V., and I have every reason to believe that they represent the feeling of the general public of Namaqualand. Both these bodies made their representations on behalf of Dr. van Niekerk.</p>

<p>I gave preference to Dr. van Niekerk because amongst other things he is also known to have a warm heart for the poor, and as such was connected with the work of the Dutch Reformed Church at Kakamas. Apart from this I have every reason to presume that he will be best able to understand the conditions and needs of the people, because amongst all the applicants he alone was a son of Namaqualand.</p>

<li>(3) The Department of Public Works, by arrangement with and at the request of the provincial administration, has, since Union, carried out all building works on their behalf and the department is satisfied that, on economic and general grounds, this policy has been fully justified. Recently the executive council decided to entrust new work to private architects and repair and maintenance work to school boards&#x2014;this arrangement to come into force at 1st April. As the departmental workshop organization&#x2014;staff and plant&#x2014;was based on combined Union and provincial work, it became necessary, when the provincial repair work was withdrawn, to reduce staffs.</li>

<li>(4) The Witwatersrand School Board has requested reconsideration of the instructions and, should the previous arrangements be reverted to, the department will be enabled to re-engage most of the men discharged. Meantime 30 men are employed, and it is hoped to start more Union Government work shortly to permit of further men being taken on.</li>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Why are members of the three permanent batteries of S.A.F. Artillery not paid full camp allowance as laid down in S.A.P.F. regulations, Chapter V, paragraph 124;</li>

<li>(2) why are members of other units, such as ordnance, air force, staff, etc., paid the full allowances as laid down in the above-mentioned regulations;</li>

<li>(3) whether married members of the artillery were formerly paid 1s. 6d. per day camp allowance in lieu of the full allowance of 7s. 6d. per diem, as laid down in regulations abovementioned, and whether this sum of 1s. 6d. was latterly increased to 3s. 9d. per diem and is set out in P.F. order No. 444, of the 2nd February, 1929, section 4791; and</li>

<li>(4) whether a regulation can he superseded by a P.F. order?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#du_toit">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) The allowance prescribed in paragraph 124, Chapter V of regulations for the S.A. permanent force is paid only when members of the force are detailed for temporary duty at training camps.</li>

<li>(2) Members of the S.A. Field Artillery in common with all other members of the force receive this allowance when employed under the conditions stated. There is a distinction between individual members being employed on temporary duty away from normal headquarters, and, in the case of the S.A. Field Artillery, when the whole unit is undergoing normal training. Members of the field artillery when at Potchefstroom undergoing shell practice cannot be said to be employed on temporary duty &#x2014;which be it noted is a condition precedent to payment of the special camp allowance. It is recognised that to some extent married members are out of pocket when absent from their normal station and away from their homes, but this is not so in the case of unmarried men. They enjoy exactly the same messing facilities at Potchefstroom as they do at their normal station and are consequently not put to any additional expense.</li>

<li><span class="col_3739-3740" refersTo="page_1942"/>(3) Allowances are only intended to re-imburse members of the service for unavoidable extra expense incurred and in recognition of this principle, married men receive an allowance. This allowance is not governed by the regulation quoted.</li>

<from>&#x2020;Col. M. S. W. DU TOIT:</from>

<p>Yes, the interpretation by the Minister of the regulation quoted by me is not at all clear. Staff, ordnance, air force, etc., members, sent for duty to Potchefstroom, get full camp allowance. Why not members of the S.A.P.A.&#x003F; I cannot understand from the Minister&#x2019;s reply why full camp allowance is not paid when officers are sent to camp with other units?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#du_toit">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<p>They are sent on temporary duty detached from their unit when that allowance is paid. This matter was examined into by the Lukin Commission, and it was held that the artillery, when it went into camp for the regular Six weeks&#x2019; training are not on temporary duty away from headquarters. When an officer leaves headquarters on temporary duty he receives that allowance, but when the whole unit go for six weeks to the Potchefstroom camp, which is a yearly event, that is not looked upon as temporary duty away from their unit.</p>

<li>(1) Tariff &#x201C;B.&#x201D;</li>

<li>(2) Falls away.</li>

<li>(3) The information will not be available until after June when final adjustments are made by the company, but the figure is expected to be lower than that of 1928, which was, 584d.</li>

<li>(4) The information given by the &#x201C;South African Engineering,&#x201D; mentioned by the hon. member, was taken over from the general manager&#x2019;s annual report and refers merely to an arrangement whereby the point of receipt of the supply of electric energy from the company is to be altered. For this purpose a new agreement was not necessary, and the latest agreement with the company is dated July, 1926.</li>

<li>(5) The annual requirements at Braamfontein, Jeppe, and at Johannesburg, after completion of the new station, will probably total 3,248,000 units.</li>

<li>(6) The maximum demand now occurs between 7 and 8 p.m. according to the season of the year.</li>

<li>(7) 378 kilowatts.</li>

<li>(8) 2,165,000 units per annum.</li>

<li>(10) To meet its requirements for lighting and power as provided for under the existing agreement, and all arrangements, including the question of the ordering of the material required, were completed in June, 1929. It was not until a month later that the council approached the Administration in connection with the supply of power.</li>

<p>The hon. member complained the other day, when I told him that a record is not kept of the petitions <span class="col_3745-3746" refersTo="page_1945"/>which are from time to time referred to the Government, and on which the persons of course received a reply. He is now, naturally, following the right procedure in moving the amendment that he would like the Government to report to the House with regard to such petitions. The petitions concern various departments, and the department concerned with the matter, of course, replies to the interested person when the petition has been considered, If, however, the House wants the Government to report what happens about such petitions then it is right to propose such an amendment. As for the proposal itself I do not know whether the House would be doing the right thing to pass such motions. From the nature of things they are applications which have already been considered by the Government, and they raise expectations in the people which cannot be satisfied. If the House refers such a petition to the Government the persons concerned think that it gives a certain amount of justification to the petition, and they expect some concession from the Government. This individual thinks that he has a grievance. He sued the Government for a large amount of damages, the Court decided against him, and does Parliament now expect the Treasury in such circumstances to use the taxpayers&#x2019; money to make a payment to him&#x003F; The petition refers to an ex gratia payment which was made to Mr. Grant, but that has nothing to do with the grounds of the action instituted against the Government. What took place was this; Mr. Grant draws a pension from the British Government, we were only the agents of the British Government in paying that pension. When the enquiry took place in Natal in connection with the alleged mental condition of Mr. Grant the magistrate asked for certain documents regarding the pension to find out what the facts were entitling him to a pension in England. Our pensions department sent the relative papers to the magistrate who got certain information. Certain action was then taken. Mr. Grant objected to this on the ground that pension papers are considered as confidential in Great Britain, and that they may not be furnished to other departments. I was told this by a British official who came here to make enquiries about Imperial pensioners. He thought that Grant had a sound objection because his papers were placed at the disposal of another department. I explained to him that we had no such rule, but although I do not think an injustice was done to Grant, we agreed to make the aforesaid ex gratia payment to him. He accepted it, and acknowledged that we had treated him liberally. But now we come to the action for &#x00A3;10,000 damages because he is detained in an institution. He lost the case, and I do not think it is right to make a payment in such circumstances, and unless the House thinks that I am wrong in principle this petition must not be referred to the Government, because it raises hopes in the individual that in the opinion of the House his claim is justified.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN BROEKHUIZEN</person>:</from>

<p>I am very sorry that the Minister of Finance has adopted that line because I think that the case of Mr. Grant is really very sad. I have the judgment in the case here, and it clearly sets out the facts. I quote from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But though the action fails, there are features connected with Grant&#x2019;s incarceration which give rise to considerable misgiving and in view of the wide powers placed in the hands of officials by Act 38 of 1916 it seems to me desirable to deal with this aspect of the matter. In the first place the medical reports made by the doctors in England in connection with Grant&#x2019;s pension ought never to have been used for the purpose of the issue of a reception order under the Mental Disorders Acts. The attitude taken up by the Ministry of Pensions, England, in this respect seems to me quite correct, that the pensioner having submitted himself to examination and having afforded the doctors an opportunity of obtaining intimate personal information for a specific purpose, information so obtained should not be divulged in connection with another purpose. The action of the Pensions Office, Pretoria, in informing the magistrate for the purpose of free medical attendance, what Grant&#x2019;s pensionable disability was, is intelligible. But the information in the English medical reports ought not to have been conveyed to the doctor who was asked to examine Grant under the Medical Disorders Act. The Department for Finance seeks to put the whole blame on the magistrate. But the blame must be shared by the Pensions Office, Pretoria in sending the reports to the magistrate, the Pensions Office never told the magistrate that the reports must not be used in connection with proceedings under the Mental Disorders Acts, although the Pensions Office knew that the magistrate contemplated such proceedings. Indeed, a telegram from the Pensions Office of 7th February, 1925, may be regarded as an encouragement to the magistrate to use the reports for that purpose. But for the disclosure of the English reports, I believe Grant would not have been sent to the mental hospital; on this point I share the view expressed by the commissioner, Dr. Dunstan, in his letter of 22nd April, 1927. It is also clear to my mind that the magistrate should not have set about things in the way he did. Considering the manner in which the magistrate had arranged matters, as described above, the nature of Dr. Samson&#x2019;s certificate and the issue of the reception order by the magistrate himself were a foregone conclusion. The magistrate ought to have realized that the whole atmosphere was prejudiced and that Dr. Samson could not help being influenced by the English medical reports, and the opinion of his partner, Dr. Moberley. The magistrate ought not to have issued an order without a certificate by an entirely impartial medical man whose mind was not prejudiced by the talk in Empangeni. And unquestionably the magistrate ought to have given Mrs. Grant notice and afforded her an opportunity of putting impartial medical <span class="col_3747-3748" refersTo="page_1946"/>testimony before him. The argument that it was necessary to set about the thing in the surreptitious manner adopted because notice to Grant or his wife might have led to violence by Grant, carried no conviction to my mind. There was no justification for ignoring Mrs. Grant and the furtive manner in which Grant was certified is, in my opinion, most deplorable.</block>

<p>That is the judgment of the judge. Then I also have here the opinion of Dr. Dunstan to the same effect, and I would be sorry if the House does not agree to the recommendation. Accordingly I hope the Minister will withdraw his objection. Mr. Grant&#x2019;s condition is deplorable; he is under the impression that he is being wrongly persecuted, and his position, as a human being, will be much improved if the House passes the motion, and the Minister were to consider it favourably. I know there are cases where it is not desirable, but Mr. Grant&#x2019;s case is a deserving one, and I trust the Minister will withdraw his objection.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYNS</person>:</from>

<p>If you will permit me I just want to ask for a little information from the Minister, and in order to get it I shall have to explain the position a little. We maize farmers are having the greatest trouble in the world to-day. We can get 7s. 6d. a bag for mealies, and it costs at least 6s. 6d. to produce a bag. Now I want to ask the Minister to give us the best advice as to what to do. The water has risen right up to our mouths and we are in danger of being drowned. We shall have to stop producing if conditions do not change, because we cannot produce at 1s. a bag. The Minister will possibly say that we must cooperate and many of my hon. friends will agree with that. It is all very well, and we are at any time prepared to do so when co-operation is practicable for the maize farmers. We must use every means of saving the maize farmers, because maize is one of the largest products of the country, and if nothing is done the maize farmers will be ruined. We must co-operate, but we can only do so when it is practicable. Now I want to ask the Minister whether he thinks that compulsory co-operation for mealie producers is possible&#x003F; How can we do it with all the native tribes round about us like Zululand, etc.&#x003F; I would like the Minister to give a lead. If the Minister thinks that compulsory co-operation is possible and every man who produces maize in the country can be brought into the co-operative society, I say we must do it as soon as possible. In the past i section of the people co-operated, but they were disappointed, and now I ask for the Minister&#x2019;s advice. I fear nothing can be done, but I should like the Minister to say how we can introduce compulsory co-operation which will include everybody, the white producer, and the native people. The people on the countryside cannot live on 1s. a bag, and we feel that when the mines are making greater profits than ever and they only pay 7s. 6d. a bag for maize it is unfair, and creates an impossible position. Perhaps it will be possible to export mealies at any price, but here in South Africa to fix a certain price, e.g., 15s. Will that be practicable&#x003F; If, e.g., we export half the production at 7s., and sell the other half in this country at 15s., then we shall be getting an average price of 11s. a bag, and could make a living, but I doubt if that can be done. It would have to be done in the same way as is done with sugar. If we were to do so the Government must make sure that all farmers will stand together, and they must then be protected as the Government has protected the Natal sugar farmers, and it must not be permitted that some of the farmers should sell at a low price. If nothing is done we shall have to act like the wine farmers in the Cape Province, who allow their wine to run waste, and be compelled to feed our maize to our stock or to burn it. Such a state of affairs is not desirable for the state, nor for the business of the railways, nor our elevators which have been erected in the harbours for the export of maize. Some hon. members say that we should then produce something else instead of maize, but our lands have been prepared for growing maize, and they take years to prepare, and it will take years more to order the ground and make it suitable for growing something else. I should like to hear the views of the Minister, and also hon. members about this. I know the Minister has always been sympathetic towards our farmers when they are in trouble, like the sheep farmers, and I shall be glad to have the best advice he can give.</p>

<block name="quote">To reduce the amount by &#x00A3;5 from the item &#x201C;Minister, &#x00A3;2,500&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do this in order to discuss the policy of the Minister in regard to the cattle industry of the Union. In discussing this question I wish to refer to the remarks of the hon. the Minister of Finance yesterday. We farmers were astonished, surprised and disappointed to hear the statement by the Minister of Finance when he was dealing with the Rhodesian Customs Convention. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of the depression the cattle farmers have very little to complain of. They are better off than any other section of the population. We have a wonderful compound market, and our good class cattle fetch better prices than are obtained in other parts of the world. As far as bounties are concerned, I am dead against them, and I will never <span class="col_3749-3750" refersTo="page_1947"/>agree that the Government should pay bounties to help the export of cattle.</block>

<p>What an expression of opinion from the leader of a farmers&#x2019; party in this country. That expression goes to prove that the Government have no conception of what the cattle industry means to us. Evidently they are satisfied that the cattle farmers are in a very good position and have nothing to complain about. What, however, is the real position&#x003F; If the cattle industry has no greater outlook than the supply of the compound market in Johannesburg, and the needs of the Union&#x2019;s small white population, then the sooner we follow the advice of the Minister of Agriculture and switch over, as fast as we can, to some other branch of agriculture, the better it will be for us. Our cattle farmers have been most disappointed at the way in which the Government have treated the cattle industry. Evidently the Government have no intention of doing anything, but will let the matter slide. If that is their policy, then I agree that there is no future for the cattle industry. We do not wish to make party capital out of the question, for it is too great a national question for us to do that. Our only idea in raising the question is to impress upon the Minister the urgent necessity there is to make some attempt to improve the position of this great industry. The Select Committee on the Cattle Improvement Bill, in the course of its report, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your committee realizes that it is most necessary, in the interests of the cattle industry of the Union, that measures be taken for the amelioration of the conditions under which it is languishing It is very evident that the most promising means of disposing of at least some of the surplus cattle in the Union is by further developing an export trade, either on the hoof or in the form of frozen or chilled meat. In view of the quality of most of the cattle in the Union, your committee realizes that such an export trade is not possible at present, unless it can be assisted financially. The only direction in which the industry can look for this assistance is by means of a levy to be imposed on all cattle slaughtered, the proceeds of such levy to be devoted to paying a bounty on cattle or meat exported.</block>

<p>If that committee has gauged the position correctly, then the Minister of Finance has a lot to learn still with regard to the cattle position. One of the officials, an expert of the Agricultural Department, who was specially deputed to investigate and report on the matter, but who unfortunately is no longer in our service, having gone to Rhodesia, said, in the course of his evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The compound market gives you a permanent and fairly satisfactory outlook for the cheap grade of cattle, but you have only a small local consumption for good beef and dairy animals, which means that any big developments in our cattle industry will have to be in the direction of the overseas market.</block>

<p>Another great difficulty is the obtaining of a good outlet for our cheap cattle, as the only time they can be sold is in the summer. The witness recommended the payment of a bounty. Proceeding, the witness (Dr. A. E. Romyn) said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another problem we have to face is the great surplus of sheep; before long there is going to be a big surplus of mutton. I am told by the economic section of the department that it is quite possible that we shall have a surplus of 5,000,000 sheep to our own requirements at the end of this season. That would depress the meat market, and has to be looked after, although I think there is a good deal of promise in the outlook for mutton at present. I think the actual problem is to be regarded as a whole, but my point is that as 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of our cattle are more of the beef than the dairy type, so the beef industry requires first consideration.</block>

<p>These are suggestions which the farmers have been pressing on the Government for a very long time, but the Government have taken little or no notice of these excellent suggestions. With regard to the export trade, Dr. Romyn pointed out that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The trouble, however, has been the cost of freight, the export is a useful development because it takes a number of cattle off the market, and it gives an outlet for cattle ranches in the northern portion of the country, which is more suitable for beef than dairying.</block>

<p>I think that that advice given by the man the Government specially deputed to enquire into this great industry of ours should be seriously considered. Unfortunately with regard to the Cattle Improvement Bill, when it was referred to a select committee, it had already passed its second reading, and our hands were tied in regard to introducing any new principle. The Minister will remember that he brought into existence a committee of men drawn from the cattle interests with the idea of taking advice from them, but if anybody has read the papers he will see how dissatisfied that committee is with the way the Minister treated their advice; in fact some of the best men on the committee have signified their intention of resigning because their advice has simply been ignored. Our only reason for raising this is to press the Government to do something and to formulate some policy to try to solve in some way the problems of this industry. If it were developed in a proper way most of our problems which we, as farmers, are confronted with, would disappear; for instance, the mealie farmer, of whom the hon. member spoke just now, would solve most of his troubles. If the growing of mealies was with the idea of feeding cattle, both for the dairy industry and the production of beef, these farmers instead of being faced with a proposition of 7s. 6d. per <span class="col_3751-3752" refersTo="page_1948"/>bag of mealies, would most probably reap the reward of double that. In the past these men have been able to make good by growing mealies just for sale on the market, but times have changed now and it is absolutely essential that they should alter their style of farming, and unless they do their position will be worse than that of the cattle farmers to-day. If mealies were fed to cattle it would not only mean the production of milk and beef, but there are other side-lines which could be developed in the same way&#x2014;I refer to the pig industry and poultry. There is no doubt that the most profitable way of farming mealies is by way of feeding livestock. This also applies to the lucerne farmer. We have spent millions to develop irrigation schemes, and the result has been that men who have gone on those schemes are in dire trouble, and are struggling to maintain themselves on the land. The Government is now advising these men to form a co-operative society to pool their lucerne, and wait until such time as there is a demand; in fact we are advising them to grow for times of drought and distress when the sheep farmers can buy their product, which is a poor outlook for them. In other countries like New Zealand, where they pay up to &#x00A3;100 per acre for grass land, they have been able to develop the dairy industry, and with 3,000,000 head of cattle they are exporting to the extent of &#x00A3;17,000,000 in dairy products and beef. I do not think you could say that New Zealand land at &#x00A3;100 an acre is better than our lucerne land in this country, if properly farmed. What is the Minister&#x2019;s policy going to be with regard to the cattle question&#x003F; Has he got a policy&#x003F; I do not think so. It has been a policy of drift, and allowing farmers to think that they are making an investigation, while they are doing nothing of the kind for the cattle industry. Whenever we ask the Government what is being done we are told that the matter is being investigated. I would just like to read from the report of the Secretary of Agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department has been repeatedly pressed for a declaration of its cattle policy.</block>

<p>This is quite true; we have done so for many years, and we again press and ask for a declaration of the Minister&#x2019;s cattle policy. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general policy of the department has been to encourage fewer cattle and better cattle and to feed them better.</block>

<p>We want something more than advice; we want deeds and not words. We want the Government to do something more than give us advice. What we require is not so much advice, but we must have a market for whatever we produce, and if we are not going to get that, what is the use of having a smaller number of cattle, even if we treat them properly&#x003F; If we have a larger market we can keep good cattle and make them pay. I would like to say what result has attended the cattlemen who have taken the advice of the Minister. We have a number of cattle-breeding societies whose business is to breed pure pedigree cattle, and they have produced cattle of which any country would be proud; in fact, equal to those from the European countries from which the cattle originally came.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ABRAHAMSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not some years ago, but at the present time too. I would like to deal with the cattle-breeding association with which I was intimately connected&#x2014;the Friesland Cattle Breeders&#x2019; Association. In 1922, realizing there was a small demand for cattle which we were breeding, they had to recognize that they would have to seek markets outside as well, and they, in co-operation with the British Friesian Society, induced the British Government to grant them permission to send 100 head to Great Britain, which was a great concession to us because up till that time Britain did not allow live cattle to be landed. The Friesian Society was developing this foreign breed and did not have the stud cattle for improving them. These cattle of ours were so well thought of by them that they were responsible for a world&#x2019;s record sale for pedigree cattle. They realized &#x00A3;1,200 a-piece, which was a record for animals sold at a public sale. Those animals have been the means of building up the Friesland industry in Great Britain. The British Friesland Society did not wish to give us an open door from this country, so we agreed we would only supply animals as they were required. In 1926 or 1927, after they had had these animals for five years, the time arrived when they wished for fresh blood. I went over on behalf of the South African Friesland Association, and arrived at an agreement, under which we could ship another shipment of these cattle to Great Britain. Very strict requirements were laid down, both as to pedigree and milk production. We were out to send them the very best that would meet their requirements. One condition that the British society laid down was that the Minister of Agriculture of this country should give a guarantee that we could carry out our undertakings. I thought there would be no difficulty about that. On arriving here, I went to the Minister of Agriculture and put the whole position before him. He at once said that be was not going to give a guarantee. That was the sympathy which we got from the present Minister of Agriculture. He said he was not going to give a monopoly to the South African Friesland Breeders&#x2019; Society for the export of cattle from this country. Was there any need of giving a monopoly to us, because we already had a monopoly&#x003F; No breeder of Friesland cattle could register any cattle in this country unless he was a member of our society, so we already had a monopoly. As regards the British society, they had the power to demand what they wanted, and to prevent the registration of <span class="col_3753-3754" refersTo="page_1949"/>any cattle in that country imported without their wish or consent. The Minister&#x2019;s excuse that he was not going to give a monopoly to the South African society or the British society was a very poor excuse for refusing this guarantee. If the Minister had been at all sympathetic or out to develop the cattle industry he would have stretched a point, and fallen in with our wishes. It could have done nobody any harm, because the only person who would have been hurt was the speculator, who would have bought cattle from us, perhaps, and sent them over as a speculation. I have brought up this matter to show that while the Minister poses as a friend of the cattle farmer in this country, he has done nothing to assist us. We have tried over a period of years to bring forward all sorts of schemes for the improvement of our cattle. I might mention another one. The Friesland breeders&#x2019; society in this country will not allow any cattle to come in from overseas and be registered in our Herd Book unless they comply with strict regulations with regard to breeding, milk production and certain strains of cattle. The former Minister of Agriculture of the South African party Government was most sympathetic, and framed regulations so that no cattle could come into this country from Holland unless they complied with these conditions. The next thing required was an inspector in Holland, because someone was needed there to see that the cattle exported complied with the regulations. Our Minister of Agriculture will not appoint anyone. He says he is unable to do it. The result is that these cattle come out here, and many fail to comply with the conditions, and the men who have imported them have to suffer because the cattle cannot be registered. That goes to show that the Minister is not sympathetic with much that we are trying to do. We have also tried to introduce a system of preferent bulls, so that we might breed only from the very best strains of bulls. The preferent bulls are the most prized strains of cattle kept in Holland to-day, and if the same system were followed here, the results would be equally beneficial. We also approved of a scheme called a &#x201C;premium bull scheme&#x201D;, by which bulls were declared premium on the production of their daughters. We adopted that scheme, and every official of the Minister&#x2019;s department was in "favour of it. They told us it only required the Minister&#x2019;s signature. After two years the Minister refused to give his consent to the scheme, and the thing has died a natural death. There are many other things we could mention to show how the cattle industry of this country has been thwarted and discouraged by the action of the present Minister and the present Government. I would like to say a few words about the way we have been treated with regard to cattle diseases. One of the greatest menaces to improve cattle in this country is tuberculosis. We approached the Minister, and even before his time we discussed the matter with the veterinary department, and tried to overcome the difficulties. The only question before the Minister came into power was what compensation the Government could afford to pay. The late Government was paying compensation, and slaughtering animals to keep the disease within bounds. The present Minister and Government have taken up the position that this is too big a thing for the country at the present time. The Minister has told us the matter is under consideration, and that negotiations are going on with certain municipalities in this country to make a start in the urban areas. The longer it is left, the more difficult it becomes. There is no doubt that we have certain areas where this disease is very bad, and animals are being distributed from these areas right through the country. From the Western Province area cattle sold from here have been tested, and there are cases where practically every animal has reacted. The usual percentage of reactors is 40 per cent, to 50 per cent. Wherever these animals go they constitute a source of danger to the rest of the country. The department admit they know there are many herds in this country which are infected, but they do not want to hear about it.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ABRAHAMSON</person>:</from>

<p>They are better pleased not to know, because if they know, they may have to take some action. There is only a question as to what it is going to cost. We could eradicate tuberculosis in this country; the climate is not favourable to the disease, and if we were to restrict movements of animals from badly infected areas, something would be done to stop the spread of the disease. In the up-country districts, I am quite sure that the infection is not very bad, and it would not cost the Government very much to eradicate the disease here. Most of the animals infected can be sent to abattoirs and used for human food. Only a small proportion of the animals would have to be destroyed. The veterinary reports confirm this. I ask the Minister again not to allow this matter to slide any longer. I was told by the Friesland Breeders&#x2019; Association that they are pressing this matter again, and the chief veterinary officer is to meet them, and I ask the Minister to allow this official to come to some arrangement with a view to making a start to eradicate this disease. What I have said about tuberculosis applies to several other diseases, such as contagious abortion. I would like to say a few words more about the value of this great industry. We have about 11,000,000 head of cattle in this country, of which the great proportion are called &#x201C;scrub.&#x201D; We had evidence before the select committee that &#x201C;scrub&#x201D; refers rather to badly developed and badly fed animals than those which are badly bred. A large proportion of them, if well fed, and under good conditions, would no longer be scrubs, but would become a good marketable product. While a large proportion of these animals are not fit for export as beef, we maintain it is the Government&#x2019;s duty to subsidize or induce some financial concern to start a canning factory in this country&#x2014;the best <span class="col_3755-3756" refersTo="page_1950"/>use to which these scrub cattle can be put. We have a very valuable concern in this country&#x2014;Nestl&#x00E9;&#x2019;s milk&#x2014;which is developing the cattle industry in Natal to a very large extent. These people came to this country because they found it more advantageous to produce Nestl&#x00E9;&#x2019;s milk in this country than to produce it overseas and export it here. It would be the same with the canning industry. We use in this country &#x00A3;300,000 of canned products. If the Government could give some firm of that description an undertaking that they would protect the industry in the same way as Nestl&#x00E9;&#x2019;s are protected to-day, they would be prepared to start a canning factory here.

<p>The hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Abrahamson) expressed his astonishment at the fact that the Minister of Finance did not yesterday agree to subsidizing our meat industry, and said that he was astonished at the party on this side of the House, which represented the farmers, taking up such an attitude. This is a practical admission by the hon. member that this side of the House is the farmers&#x2019; side, and we are glad of the admission. I think the farmers of the country are thankful for what the Government has so far done for them. The hon. member now pleads for the meat industry, and says that the Government apparently does not intend doing anything for the cattle farmers. I do not think the hon. member allows for what the Government has already done, because otherwise he would honestly admit that the cattle farmers are already much indebted to the Government. When six years ago the Government assumed office our cattle farmers could not sell any animals on the local markets, because Rhodesian cattle farmers who had cheap farms had taken away our cattle market. The Government immediately took steps to protect our farmers, and, as a result of the prohibition, importation from Rhodesia decreased. While in 1924 about 65,000 head of cattle were imported from Rhodesia, in 1927 the number was only 25,000, i.e., 40,000 cattle less in a year, which was of direct benefit to our farmers. The Minister of Finance rightly said that our cattle farmers were the only farmers now who got a fair price for their produce, and hon. members must admit that the cattle market is not bad. Now the hon. member and also the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) plead for the subsidy to the meat exporters. I want to ask how then we can withhold it from the other sections of our farming industry if we give it to cattle farmers&#x003F; Then the wine farmers, the tobacco farmers, the sheep farmers and the maize farmers will also ask for a subsidy. What would this mean&#x003F; The hon. member said that it was calculated that there was even now an annual surplus of 5,000,000 sheep in our country. If we want to export those sheep and pay a reasonable subsidy of 2s. a sheep, then it will amount to &#x00A3;500,000 a year. Suppose the maize farmers get a subsidy of 1s. a bag&#x2014;it is not much&#x2014;then on an export of 20,000,000 it would mean a sum of &#x00A3;1,000,000. The tobacco farmers would like to have 3d. a lb. on 6,000,000 lbs. of tobacco, that they want to export, which will mean &#x00A3;75,000 a year. If we add these up it means millions of pounds, and the taxpayers, and especially the farmers, will have to pay it. The question is whether our country is ripe for a system like that, and I think it is impossible in existing conditions. The previous Government introduced such a system, but the cattle farmers did not benefit by it. A few exporting companies reaped the benefit which they put into their own pockets. There is, however, another system, viz., of levies, which has been introduced here, and which has appeared a good system. If our farmers will adopt that method they can get all they need to subsidize the export of produce. The Minister of Agriculture has introduced a Bill in connection with the dairy industry which makes provision for a levy; this will enable the dairy farmers to use the levy to subsidize a part of their produce that they want to export. The same system can be adopted by the sheep and maize farmers. Only along those lines do I see immediate assistance to our farmers in connection with the subsidy for export. That is also the only sound method, and it will cause no differences between one section and another. The hon. member for Middelburg (Mr. Heyns) spoke eloquently about compulsory co-operation. I am glad that he has become a supporter of co-operation. Hitherto the hon. member has never thought it worth while to become a member of the co-operative society in his own district, I think.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member&#x2019;s eyes have now been opened, and that he will join the society in his own constituency. Every time the tobacco farmers have pleaded for compulsory co-operation for which they have a very good case, it was the hon. member for Middelburg who stood in the way, threw up his hands, and pointed out the dangers of compulsory co-operation. I hope that the hon. member now appreciates that co-operation is the only salvation, and that in future he will heartily support the organization of our farmers along the requirements of the country. If it were not for compulsory co-operation and good organization by our tobacco farmers their position would be very bad. There was a time when the farmers could hardly sell any tobacco, but owing to the control of the position they were able to sell tobacco in the local market, and the position is so much relieved that the farmers, once more, can hope for the possibility of selling their tobacco at a satisfactory price. I do not, however, want to speak about the other industries, but to ask the Minister for heaven&#x2019;s sake not to introduce any semi-compulsory co-operation, if compulsory co-operation is introduced, particularly not with a luxury like tobacco.</p>

<p>They may have started, but the results are not apparent. At a conservative estimate the capital involved in our cattle industry amounts to &#x00A3;150,000,000, which is about the capital cost of our railways and harbours. The latter, at any rate, do earn the interest on their cost, but you cannot say the same of the cattle industry. The Minister said that the money invested in the cattle industry was largely locked up and was not profitable. That means an annual loss in interest alone of &#x00A3;6,000,000 or &#x00A3;7,000,000. We see the results of this right throughout the country. All the country stores are maintained by the farmer. Is it any wonder that an abnormal number of business houses are closing down because they are not getting the custom from the farmers that they used to have in the past&#x003F; Every member of the community is indirectly affected by this unfortunate state of affairs. Where are the representatives of the cattle farmers in this House&#x003F; In 1925 there were 61,538 cattle farmers in the Union. It was calculated that each farmer had on the average 2,179 acres, giving a total of 134,000,000 acres utilized for cattle farming. All this money is being expended, and all this vast area is being utilized, without any profitable result. I hope the Minister will tell us how far he has got already in this long way he says he is prepared to go to assist the cattle industry. I think the cattle farmers are not aware of any steps being taken at all to turn cattle farming into a more profitable business than it is at present. The proposals that have been made to the Government with this end in view have, so far as I am aware, been received unsympathetically. What has been done, for instance, to reduce the number of our scrub cattle, which constitute 80 per cent, or more of the whole of our cattle&#x003F; These scrub cattle cannot be exported, dead or alive. Again, while we have such a big proportion of inferior animals, we cannot develop an export trade, either on the hoof or in chilled form. Australia, which has many millions of cattle all of a very good grade, is utterly debarred from participating in the chilled meat trade with England in consequence of her great distance from Europe, because the meat will not keep during the long voyage from Australia to England, but with the shorter distance from South Africa to Europe, there is no reason why we should not develop a profitable trade with that continent. But we must remember that the meat obtained from scrub cattle is not of a high quality, while the expense of marketing a pound of inferior meat is just as high as the cost of marketing a pound of a better type of meat. There is always a market for products of a first rate quality. It does not seem likely that we can, within a measurable distance, develop a meat export trade, and I am not persuaded from the experience gained in other directions that we are likely to develop a good packing trade. Undoubtedly a large number of establishments have not been able to compete with those establishments which have brought packing and advertising to a fine art. When the Watkins-Pitchford process is introduced, we should give it a trial. It is claimed for it that scrub cattle give just, as valuable an extract as fine, well-bred cattle. Under this process it is claimed that the whole of the meat values are extracted and brought into a form which is highly tasteful and nutritious. It is claimed, too, that scrub cattle will return the owner something like &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;7 per head. Whether it is at present proved or not it is most desirable that such a process should be given a trial. [Time limit.]</p>

That bonus system did not help the farmers at all, and only a few cold storage companies were benefited by it. With all respect to the hon. member for Weenen, I want to point out that if he talks here in that way then he must not plead as a party politician, but as a farmer, otherwise we will take no further notice of him. The way the cattle farmer must go is different. The cattle farmers will not be assisted by a subsidy system, but they must so organize that they will get full value for their cattle. I want, e.g., to ask the hon. member, as a cattle farmer, whether he is getting full price for his cattle when he sees at what price meat is put on the market in Cape Town. As long as we allow the butchers in the cold storage companies to exploit us no methods will assist at all.</p>

<p>It makes no difference how many are consumed, but the fact remains that the consumer has to pay 15d. for his meat, and we get from 4d. to 5d. Let us see to it first of all that we get proper prices in our country, then we can turn our eyes to the transition stage, and then, when we are organized, we can give export bonuses out of our own funds. I think the hon. member will agree with me when I say that the only way to get better prices is co-operation. Co-operation is the only salvation for our farmers, but when I speak of that I do not mean the co-operation of the man who is willing to co-operate while another is permitted to sell at a lower price, but I mean compulsory co-operation. We shall have to organize so that we can take the trade into our own hands. We shall have to have our own cold storage, our own slaughter-houses. We can use the subsidy which we want to pay to the organizations of the industry to dump our produce on any market, that is, indeed, what other countries are doing, but it is of no use our talking yet about bonuses. We must, first of all, introduce compulsory cooperation, and I want to appeal to the hon. member for Weenen to preach that doctrine of compulsory co-operation in the country, and then we are prepared to support him.</p>

<p>No fresh legislation is necessary, because we have the law under which compulsory co-operation can be introduced. I would like to say a few words to the Minister about compulsory co-operation. The Minister means well, and he has already done much for the farmers, but in this case I think he is wrong. Some time ago he said&#x2014;I speak subject to correction&#x2014;that he would not allow compulsory co-operation in the case of maize farmers, because it is one of the food supplies of the Union, and it will be possible to exploit the consumer. But let me tell the Minister that if there is one class that is exploited, then it is the farmer, not merely the cattle farmer, but every farmer. Look at the price the farmer gets for any product, and what the consumer has to pay. I admit that the consumer sometimes pays too much for the article, and I think it is the Government&#x2019;s duty to see that the farmer gets proper prices for his produce. Hon. members complain that at the moment they cannot get a good price for their cattle, and yet we see meat being sold here in Cape Town at 15d. to 16d. The Government is doing a great deal, and is spending millions to keep the population on the land, and, notwithstanding all their efforts, we see the stream from the countryside to the towns becoming greater every day. What is the cause&#x003F; It is that the producer does not get full value for his work. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty, and primarily that of the Minister of Agriculture to see that the producer of the foodstuffs in the country gets value for his labour. The only way of securing this is by co-operation, and to pass legislation for the farmers to make it compulsory. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Hon. members are talking about the farmers co-operating to get better prices for their produce. I would like to investigate the root of the evil. This is a young Country which is still developing. Not so long ago it was the custom for a farmer to leave a farm to his son or sons, which was sufficiently large for them to make a living out of. To-day the father is no longer able in many cases to bequeath a farm large enough for that purpose if they cannot farm scientifically. It is too small for them to live on by extensive farming. He can, however, make a living if he has the necessary knowledge of scientific farming. In connection with this I want to bring the matter to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. I am sorry that it has to be done personally, but it cannot be helped. I gave a bursary in the schools in my district to the boy who got the most marks in agriculture, and he could then go to the agricultural school <span class="col_3761-3762" refersTo="page_1953"/>for further education free of charge, and come back to the district to farm. He would not only be able to make a living, but would also be an example to the farmers in the neighbourhood. The Minister of Agriculture must try to get that done right throughout the Union. If every district sent two boys to the agricultural school then in ten years&#x2019; time there would be 20 of those boys with scientific training farming in each district, and then we could talk about organization and co-operation, because those boys would understand the matter, and explain to the farmers in our district what co-operation means. Then we could expect better prices for our produce. This is no longer the time for looking for markets within the four corners of the Union; we must also go abroad, and this necessitates scientific farming in our country. I would like to ask the Minister, almost as a favour, to give his attention to this matter. I need not go into the system for effecting this, I need not explain it to him, because he can work it out for himself. I think he must make the public understand that the time has come for scientific farming in our country, and then it will not be necessary to talk all day about co-operation and of running to the Government for help. Let us see that our boys are properly trained, and those things will come automatically.</p>

<p>A few matters have been raised during the debate to which I want to take the earliest opportunity of replying. The position of the maize farmers, as well as that of the cattle farmers, was referred to. Certain solutions were suggested of the difficulties that are met with. Before I deal with these matters I want to refer to a remark made by the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson). I am sorry to find the spirit of Cain in this committee that one section of the farmers grudge another section getting help. He attacked the hon. member for Oudtshoorn (Mr. le Roux) about the &#x00A3;100,000 that was given to the ostrich farmers. Allow me to say that it was not a present to the ostrich farmers, but a loan, such as we grant to co-operative societies, and as we granted approximately &#x00A3;300,000 to a co-operative sugar factory. We hear nothing about that. That is not wrong, but when the poor ostrich farmers are assisted then we get a complaint from the other side. I am sorry that that spirit is being shown in agriculture, and I can only trust that when hon. members debate agricultural matters that they will keep the debate outside of party politics. I should now like to come to the speech of the hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Abrahamson), who put up a great plea on behalf of cattle farming, but has he put any facts before us&#x003F; He chiefly asked what the Government was going to do in connection with stock diseases, and he mentioned tuberculosis. He says that the previous Government was prepared to spend millions in 1922 to eradicate tuberculosis. Is that true&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, it is not true. It appears from the files of the department that the previous Government said that it did not intend to carry out the Act because it Would cost too much. What right has the hon. member to try and make political capital out of this matter by representing that the previous Government wanted to eradicate this disease. I said we were giving attention to this disease, and that we were negotiating with certain town councils about it. We are starting to fight the disease in Durban. Do hon. members know what the Act lays down&#x003F; Do they want the Act to be administered in the way the previous Government did&#x003F; In the first place, provision is made for compensation which in the case of farmers is not high. Secondly, it is provided that the stock must be quarantined. Are hon. members in favour of quarantine&#x003F; No, the hon. member for Weenen only wants to irritate the cattle farmers with this kind of speech by telling them that the Government will do nothing for the cattle farmers, but I will not allow myself to be deflected by such speeches from the course the Government has adopted. I will give attention to the matter, and start combating the disease as we are already doing. As I have said, a start has been made in Durban. We pay a certain amount and the Durban town council also pays it part; in that way I hope we shall soon find a solution in Durban, and I hope the other municipalities in the country who also are responsible for the health of the dwellers in the town will assist just as Durban has done. It is a national matter and we must all help. But the hon. member asked what the policy of the Government was, and what the Government had done. Have we not saved the market in the Union for our own farmers&#x003F; In what country in the world do the farmers have a better market for scrub cattle than in South Africa&#x003F; Why is Rhodesia so anxious to get our market&#x003F; Simply because our prices are better. What about the system of registering milk, which was first started in 1927 with the object of improving the breed of stock&#x003F; Today 15,000 cows come under the testing system, because the farmers have seen that it is a good system to be able to pick out the poorer cattle for sale and to retain the good ones. What did the previous Government do?</p>

<p>300 animals were tested under the previous Government, but to-day the number is 15,000. The hon. member asks about our policy. There was a Bill before the select committee and the hon. member made proposals there. He says that the House had already passed the principle of the Bill, and he, therefore, could make no further proposals. Did he ask to have the Bill referred back to the House for further instructions&#x003F; If he had so much love for the cattle farmers why did he not take that step&#x003F; When the members of the select committee on the opposite side could make proposals they had nothing to suggest. Notwithstanding all the agitation they had nothing to propose, and the improved Bill which is now before the House was adopted unanimously. Did the hon. member <span class="col_3763-3764" refersTo="page_1954"/>for Weenen protest&#x003F; We hear so much about the cattle breeders&#x2019; association. Let me tell him that they applied for legislation to register cattle south of the equator. They asked the Union Government to make laws for other countries, but what are members of the association doing on the countryside&#x003F; One of my officials was present at a meeting, they preached this kind of thing to catch votes. They came and gave evidence before the select committee. Where was their association then&#x003F; We sat for about two months and they had every opportunity, but the association and the members who make so much noise in Parliament did not come to give evidence. It was very disappointing to me that the people who agitate on the countryside did not come and give evidence when they had the chance.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>It was advertised in all the newspapers, and why did not the hon. member, who is one of the members, advise the association to give evidence&#x003F; He is now trying to make propaganda here. Let me say that I have received a letter from the Natal agricultural union to the effect that when the Advisory Board makes a certain recommendation with regard to legislation we ought to approve of it. I will just say what reply I sent, because I think it is a good thing that hon. members should be well acquainted with the position. My letter was dated the 10th of April, and I read from the copy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am directed by the Minister to say that he has perused your letter of the 28th ultimo, in regard to agricultural legislation, with considerable feelings of surprise. The Minister has always evinced the utmost desire to consult with the agricultural community in regard to legislation on agricultural matters, as is proved by the fact that such measures have invariably been submitted to the Agricultural Advisory Board, which is the only body which he can recognize for this purpose, being as it is constituted from representatives of the various agricultural unions. You mention the fact that the Dairy Control and Cattle Improvement Bills had been submitted to and approved by the Agricultural Advisory Board, but that the drafts have since been altered. I would point out that obviously the drafts were only altered by the Government, and it surely cannot be seriously contended that when the Government which has been discussing with the Agricultural Advisory Board and decides to make any alteration therein that such alterations must be submitted for the consideration of the agricultural unions. This would mean that the Government, which is responsible to Parliament alone, would be precluded from making any alterations in a Bill, unless it had first obtained the opinion of the agricultural unions as representing the farmers, or, more properly, the organized farmers of the country, but he cannot for one moment concede that the course of action which the Government may elect to take, after having consulted the Advisory Board, is to be in any way restricted or necessarily made the subject of further consultation. This is a matter for the Government alone to decide. The Bills in question were published in the Government Gazette in order that they might be perused and considered by all parties interested, who were thereby afforded an opportunity of considering whether or not they should appear before the select committee to which the Bills were referred. As a matter of fact in the case of the Dairy Bills a great deal of evidence was given by the various interests concerned. With regard to the Cattle Improvement Bill, however, the Minister is sorry to say that but little practical interest appeared to be evinced in this measure by the representatives of the agricultural community. While auctioneers, butchers and local authorities were well represented before the committee, the only representative of organized agriculture to give evidence was the delegate of the Transvaal agricultural union. The Minister was all the more surprized at this in view of the fact that the Natal agricultural union was at the time contemplating shipment of cattle overseas as a step towards the amelioration of the cattle position. He fully expected, in view of the fact that the Bill dealt with the question of a levy and the award of a bonus on export cattle, that the Natal agricultural union would not fail to avail itself of this opportunity. In conclusion, the Minister asks me to say that, while he has always appreciated and will continue to appreciate the efforts of the Union to improve agricultural conditions and its co-operation with him and his department, he feels compelled to speak frankly on this subject and he hopes his frankness will lead to a better understanding in the future.</block>

<p>I acted openly, and that agricultural union also had every opportunity of giving evidence. The hon. member said that not only he, but the farmers of the country were disappointed. Since when&#x003F; In 1929 the farmers once more expressed themselves in favour of the Government, notwithstanding the statement that the farmers had no confidence in the Government. The hon. member attacked the Minister of Finance for saying yesterday that cattle farming was better off than many other industries, and that he was not prepared to give a subsidy to cattle farmers. That is a fact. What was the position seven or eight years ago&#x003F; At that time the position of the cattle farmer was worse than it has ever been. Does the hon. member not know that not so many years ago we exported cheese and butter, and that to-day we import a good deal of butter&#x003F; Those are indisputable facts. I say again that with regard to the cattle farmers, hon. members must not expect the Government to take the lead. Let them follow the same lines as the sheep farmers, viz., by keeping the best cattle. We must not try to force it by legislation. Are hon. members prepared to say that a certain man must keep these cattle, and another those cattle, and that <span class="col_3765-3766" refersTo="page_1955"/>a third may keep scrub cattle&#x003F; There is actually so much talk about scrub cattle, but in Bechuanaland they have been put on experimental farms, and have been much improved by good treatment. When hon. members go to Prinshof Station at Pretoria, they find that those cattle which are three years old weigh from 700 to 800 lbs., and if they are properly treated in favourable circumstances they reach 1,200 lbs. As the Minister of Finance rightly said the other day, cattle farming in other parts of the world is retrogressing, and there is a good chance for our farmers to develop their trade and to improve their stock. But do not come and ask the Government to do it, let the farmers improve their cattle themselves. Then the hon. member for Weenen says that the farmers must use their maize for cattle feed. That is quite right, but are we to say that a man is compelled to feed his stock with maize&#x003F; No, that is only a matter of propaganda, and the hon. member can assist in that as well. Has he ever recommended it to other farmers?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am glad to hear it. If then the hon. member asks what the policy of the Government is, I think it is very clearly shown by the existing legislation. It cannot be expected that the Government should pay a bonus on the export of certain produce, because then we would have to extend it to all produce, and are hon. members prepared to do that&#x003F; Notwithstanding that &#x00A3;60,000 was paid in bonuses for the export of beef, there is not a single case that hon. members can mention where the farmers got any benefit from it. Then the hon. member mentioned the matter of the export of cattle to England, the hon. member can, himself, find out that it was only a certain class of stud cattle that were exported. Then the hon. member says that I used the argument that I would not permit a monopoly. That is so. I know that a monopoly in the export trade was threatening, and I would not permit it. Then the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) told the old story that he repeats practically every year about the large amount invested in cattle farming. He adds that we could only sell the scrub cattle at &#x00A3;6 to &#x00A3;7 to a canning factory. I cannot believe that our industrialists are so stupid as not to have put up such a factory long ago if the profit to them were so great. I may say that the Government is negotiating with a company to see if we cannot establish such a factory, because it will certainly assist in getting better prices for our scrub stock. Allow me to add a few words in answer to the hon. members for Middelburg (Mr. Heyns). Oudtshoorn (Mr. Le Roux) and Albert (Mr. Steytler). These hon. members asked me what I intended doing in connection with the maize farmers, and whether I was going to institute compulsory cooperation. The hon. member for Albert says he noticed that I stated in the Transvaal that I would not do so. What I did say was that I had already clearly stated that I would not put compulsory co-operation into the Act, but if an hon. member wants to propose compulsory co-operation in the case of maize, e.g., he can do so. Is it possible, however, to have co-operation in connection with maize?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Then let the hon. member suggest a way of doing it. What about the thousands of natives who grow maize&#x003F; Does he expect the European to come under a co-operative society and to find a market for the natives&#x003F; If we make co-operation compulsory then it is not cooperation. Let us call things by their proper name. Co-operation is voluntary working together between farmers or other members of the community. Compulsory co-operation such as is suggested by the hon. member amounts to our telling the maize farmers that they are not masters over their own produce. The farmer may not sell his maize or his cattle, but if it is the feeling of the House that we must apply that kind of prohibition, then let us do so. I feel, however, that this is not the time for that kind of compulsory co-operation.</p>

<p>I learnt my lesson there. I was new to my position then, and if I had to deal with that matter now I would act differently. The hon. member for Middelburg says that I should make a public statement in connection with the maize position. The position in that connection is that there is practically a world over-production. The price on the world market will be about 7s. a bag. I advised the hon. member last year to sell his maize at 12s. a bag; then he wanted 14s.</p>

<p>Now I say that the price is 7s. A miracle may happen if the other countries do not get the harvest they expect, but I can say nothing about that. Now the hon. member says that the world price is 7s. a bag and that we can <span class="col_3767-3768" refersTo="page_1956"/>not produce mealies at that. Let me say that we run away too quickly from ploughing with oxen in order to use tractors in our lands. Let us continue for a while the old and cheaper methods. I know what it costs to produce maize, and I am sorry for the maize farmer because I produce it myself. We, however, are an exporting country in regard to maize, and we are dependent on the world price.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but there is a great difference between a bonus on a few hundred thousand bags, and one on 13,000,000 bags. As I have said, I am sorry for the maize farmers, but all the various industries are in difficulties now. The price of wool has dropped; conditions are fortunately a little better now, and I only hope that the improvement will continue. Rut if we give bonuses to the maize farmers then the wool farmers will also have every right of applying for them. The hon. member says that the prices of sugar have been fixed. What happened there&#x003F; The sugar farmers were told that if anything went wrong with the world production, then they would never be able to sell at a higher price than the one fixed. The hon. member for Middelburg further said that we had to sell our maize abroad at 15s. if it was necessary, but that we should fix the local price at 15s. Will the farmers on both sides of the House be satisfied with that&#x003F; It is impossible to do such a thing, especially as we want to bring down the cost of living. I am sorry for the maize farmers, but I do not think that that is a solution. Co-operation will assist us, hut who was it that co-operated in the past&#x003F; It was the smaller farmers; the farmers who produced from 30,000 to 50,000 bags would have nothing to do with co-operation. I pleaded with them to co-operate, but in the good times they would not listen. Now, however, that bad times have come they want compulsion. The hon. member for Oudsthoorn (Mr. le Roux) spoke of compulsion with regard to tobacco. I will certainly not agree to that. If the people of a definite district ask for it to be made compulsory, and 75 per cent, are in favour, then they can take steps under the Act to make it compulsory. I now come to the hint of the hon. member for Vereeniging (Maj. K. Rood) who has given a very good example by donating a bursary for the education of boys in agriculture. I hope other hon. members will follow his example. He says I should encourage such a bursary system. It has been our practice for years to grant bursaries at our agricultural schools to encourage boys to take up education in agriculture. But I am glad that the matter has been mentioned here, and that that step was taken. I hope that hon. members and rich people will follow his example, so that our boys will be educated in agriculture. I have now more or less replied to all points. In conclusion I want to say that hon. members must not forget that conditions in South Africa are favourable when compared with those in other countries. The Government is not the cause of the depression. It is a world phenomenon and while we find that Australia has received about &#x00A3;25,000,000 less for its wool clip, the Union has only received &#x00A3;2,000,000 less. That is, nowever, no reason why we should sit still. Therefore I am introducing legislation and trying to organize the people. We must, however, do this on a sound basis, and not on the lines that hon. members suggest who speak about nothing but compulsory co-operation and bonuses. Just let me say that the Minister of Agriculture is being attacked for being against the levy. When I introduced the Dairy Industry Bill there was a great outcry about &#x201C;Aunty&#x2019;s butter,&#x201D; but to-day quite a different tune is sung. Why are hon. members not consistent&#x003F; Hon. members who opposed the levy, even those on this side have now seen that their opposition was wrong. The hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Abrahamson) tried very hard to treat agriculture on political lines.</p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister if he will kindly state what the east coast fever position is in Natal. It would be very interesting to know whether it is on the increase there or not, and what prospects there are of stamping it out. Only a few days ago it was reported to me that in my own district of Klip River a very serious outbreak had occurred, quite a number of animals having died on one farm, and I would like the Minister to tell me to what this recent outbreak can be attributed: whether it is due to neglect on the part of inspectors or the owner of the stock or what&#x003F; I wrote a note to the Minister&#x2019;s secretary this morning to advise him of the fact that I intended to raise this matter, because the people are very much perturbed, not only in Klip River, but in Natal generally. I want to ask him a question I put two or three years ago, and that is what is his research department doing&#x003F; It is a highly paid department, which has been making investigations and experiments for many years without apparent result of recent years. The last time I put a question the Minister could not point to any useful results. If this department is not justifying its existence, it is about time that the whole position be reviewed. Could the Minister tell us what discoveries have been made or what good work has been done, of recent years&#x003F; If he can I am sure the country would like to hear it. I want to revert to a question I raised a few weeks ago on the Part Appropriation Bill in regard to abuses which have taken place in his <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_1957"/>department, regarding appointments which have every appearance of being political. I want to deal with the replies the Minister gave, which seem to me unsatisfactory and contradictory. I first alluded to two dismissals of stock inspectors in the Bethlehem district who were appointed by the late Government. When the Minister assumed office he almost immediately dismissed inspectors Froneman and van Rooyen. The dismissal was enacted in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Owing to the re-organization of the sheep division it has become necessary to terminate your position in the department.</block>

<p>The Minister first attempted to explain away these dismissals by saying that if an official goes and makes political propaganda instead of doing his work, then I will definitely assume the attitude that he must not be kept on. Realizing he had no facts in support of this view, the Minister shifted his ground and said in this instance there were too many of these officials, and he had to discharge some of them. Then the Minister said that I did not know that stock inspectors are not on the established list. Of course I knew that perfectly well. What did he do&#x003F; He had too many stock inspectors according to his statement, and was in consequence obliged to dismiss two at Bethlehem. But he immediately followed this up by appointing a brother-in-law and brother of the then member for Bethlehem in the place of the two inspectors whom he dismissed on the ground of redundancy. On another occasion the Minister stated those men were dismissed because they were suspected of being political agents of the South African party. The explanation of the Minister does not hold water. But assuming that the Minister&#x2019;s explanation is correct, why did he appoint the brother-in-law of the late member for Bethlehem in the place of one of the stock inspectors, and the brother of the same late member in the place of the other if he was out to eliminate political agents?</p>

There was some complaint that he had overlooked the claims of Mr. Lament, which was perfectly true. He excused himself on the ground that Mr. Lamont was not a trained economist. A few months afterwards, however, he suddenly realizes that Mr. Lamont was a first-class economist, and he moves Dr. Geldenhuys down to the position of under-secretary and puts Mr. Lamont over his head. In doing this he blocks the promotion of an old tried and efficient officer who had acted under secretary, and who had every right to expect the appointment. That officer became a discontented man, so much so that he sought the first opportunity that presented itself of getting out of the service. He took his retirement 9 years before the retiring age. They are all leaving the country as fast as they can.</p>

<p>We all know the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson). He has accused me of losing my temper, but he has lost his own. Why does he lose his temper so quickly&#x003F; The hon. member has again brought up the question of the appointment of Dr. Geldenhuys. That question has been brought up annually for the last four years. Every year we have the same old story. Was the appointment of Dr. Geldenhuys made by the Civil Service Commission or by the Minister&#x003F; If I appointed him when the commission recommended his appointment, what sin have I committed&#x003F; The hon. member is very jealous of Dr. Geldenhuys, but there has never been any complaint about him since his appointment. The hon. member says that I did not do right with regard to Mr. Lamont. Mr. Lamont was sent by me to England to help the tobacco farmer, and he communicated with me saying that he was very sorry that his appointment had been made a political matter. Let me tell hon. members that Mr. Lamont is quite satisfied with his position. The hon. member has referred to officers who were redundant. Does the hon. member think that I must keep on officers who are redundant&#x003F; I am not prepared to do that. The hon. member made a fuss about the appointment of Mr. Wessels, because he was a brother of a member of Parliament. It will be a very sad day when a relative or a brother of a member of Parliament can never get an appointment. As long as the country <span class="col_3771-3772" refersTo="page_1958"/>keeps me liere I shall go on in the same way as I have done during the past six years. I can obtain more service from a man who is loyal to me than from a man who is disloyal. What did the late Gen. Botha say when attacked with regard to the appointment of the late Mr. Ramsbottom&#x003F; He said that they wanted not to appoint party people, but people who would assist him and follow his policy. It is strange that they always did it on the other side. They made political appointments, but they had not the courage to say that they were doing so. When I took over in 1924-&#x2019;25 there was a re-organization of the sheep division, and many inspectors had to go. Later on other appointments had to be made, and if the same circumstances recurred I would do exactly the same as I did then.</p>

<p>I do not want to rub in what the Minister has said, but the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) brings up the same objection about the appointment of inspectors year after year. I want to ask him whether the appointment of the inspectors of a certain political conviction is possibly the reason the scab has so successfully been eradicated&#x003F; If that is so, I want to ask the Minister to continue the magnificent policy, and to apply it in other departments as well. The country will be thankful to him for it. But, apart from that, I think that hon. members opposite are ungrateful if they say that the Minister has done nothing for the cattle farmer. I am a cattle farmer myself, and I and my co-farmers are thankful to the Minister for what he has done. May I remind hon. members that without this Minister, or this Government, there would no longer be any question about cattle farmers, because the previous Government definitely refused to do anything to put a partial embargo on the importation of cattle from Rhodesia, and that importation was killing our cattle farmers. After this Government came into office they immediately imposed the partial embargo in respect of oxen up to 1,000 lbs. weight, and 750 lbs. for cows, so that cattle under that weight could not be imported. And have hon. members forgotten that the Minister at the commencement of this session put six Bills on the order paper, five of which were definitely intended to advance cattle farming&#x003F; He only needs the support of the House to put the Bills through. I am therefore surprised at the attitude of hon. members, and at their saying that they do not know what the Minister has done. However, I do not quite agree with the statement of the Minister of Finance that the cattle farmers are getting a good price. There is a world of difference between the price the farmer gets and that which the consumer has to pay. The fault does not lie with the Minister, but with the middleman, and I still hope that the Minister will succeed in rectifying matters, and in eliminating the middleman. Although I can hardly get a price for my cattle the people in Pretoria and elsewhere have to pay for meat through their necks. As for the agreement with Rhodesia, I want to remark that there is absolutely no agreement with Rhodesia and the Protectorate. The agreement does, indeed, apply to rail transport, or when the animals come through our places of entry, but we forget the dry Malopo River between the Union and the Protectorate which represents almost 400 miles of unoccupied country. Natives lie on both sides of the river. I do not say they are the smugglers, but it is the Europeans who use the natives, and who on earth is to guard the border&#x003F; The Minister always says that the law is there, and if I can bring concrete cases to his notice he will not delay in prosecuting such a person, but the Minister cannot expect the farmers in Bechuanaland to guard the border. He cannot expect us to be sentries. There is no other boundary which the police there have to protect, and I think the police can protect the farmers there against the smugglers. I think that with the assistance of a few native constables the illicit importation can be stopped. I want once more to plead for it. The territory is so deserted that the boundary has not even been fixed yet. The river forms the boundary, but we do not know whether it is the middle of the river, or this side, or the other side. Otherwise we might possibly put up a fence. But as long as this position continues the partial embargo is useless. It is not good cattle that come in but the worst scrub stock that can be imported, and the hon. member for Lichtenburg (Mr. Swanepoel) will confirm that one can at once recognize the animals that are imported in this way on the stock market at Mafeking if he has a little knowledge about the cattle. I appeal once more to the Minister to assist us in this matter.</p>

<p>The Minister has again adopted his old tactics, as soon as we raise a question, of accusing us of making party capital out of anything with which we charge him, but he never really enters into our charges. That is our difficulty on this side of the House&#x2014;to get the Minister really to consider anything we suggest. We have been asking the Minister to adopt a policy so far as the cattle industry is concerned. I asked him what is his policy, and he is trying to give us the impression that the whole horizon of the cattle industry is limited to this country. He is not in favour of bounties, nor of anything that will extend our markets outside. The one thing they do point to is that they have stopped the importation of scrub cattle from Rhodesia. But will that settle the cattle industry in this country&#x003F; All they have been doing is to make Rhodesia improve the quality of their cattle. They are not sending us scrub cattle now, but good cattle. That means that the scope of our market in our country is for scrub cattle to be sold for compound meat. Rhodesia now is sending cattle to this country to compete with the best market cattle, that the hon. member is advising us we must produce. He also tells us that the Government <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_1959"/>is seriously considering the question of tuberculosis in this country now, and that the previous Government had done nothing. That I beg to say is not the fact. The last Government did do quite a lot.</p>

<p>Didn&#x2019;t they&#x003F; All I can tell the Minister is that the Friesland Breeders&#x2019; Association was negotiating with the late Government, and the late Government offered to do for us what you have never offered to do, that is to pay us a certain amount of compensation for the cattle they would have to slaughter. The only reason why it was not put into force was because we were not satisfied with the price that they could pay, which we considered was too small. Had this country been fortunate enough to have kept that Government, the tuberculosis question would have been settled and we would have been well on the way to eradicate tuberculosis in this country. Now, he says that they are negotiating with Durban, and that they will make a start in Durban. What dairy cattle are there in Durban&#x003F; All the milk consumed in Durban comes from the outside districts. How will you control the cattle in the districts outside of Durban&#x003F; Are you going to test all the herds that supply the milk sent to Durban, or are you going to confine your efforts to the few little dairies round about Durban&#x003F; That is playing with the trouble. Unless the Government is prepared to embark upon a big scheme which will have some effect upon the cattle in the country, we shall never get any further than we are to-day. When I had to stop speaking a little while ago I was dealing with the question of scrub cattle in this country. I am sorry to say that I do not agree with the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) about extract and canning factories. In every other country they can make a success of canning and extracting. Then surely we can do it in this country. It is not a question of canned meat being the only source of making the profit. There are many by products which go to make a profitable industry. I wish to say that the department&#x2019;s experts and people best able to judge, having investigated this question, have definitely said that the only way to deal with scrub cattle is by way of canning or extract factories. Why does not the Government take the advice of the experts&#x003F; What is the use of the experts, if their advice is turned down if it does not suit the Government?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ABRAHAMSON</person>:</from>

<p>I will leave the question of scrub cattle. We are told to breed fewer and better cattle. What are we going to do with them&#x003F; We have a market in Italy and in central Europe whence we can export cattle with advantage. All that the farmers require is a certain amount of assistance from the Government in bringing them nearer the market than they are to-day. We have had evidence from men who know, and they say that a small subsidy would enable this country to export a very large number of cattle to those countries. In fact, a matter of perhaps &#x00A3;1 per head would make just the difference between a profitable export or not. There is the question of exporting cattle on hoof to Great Britain. There are farmers in this country who have gone to the trouble and expense of trying to develop that market. The evidence we have had is that small assistance from the Government in the way of cheapening freight would make that business a possibility to this country. If the Government can see their way clear even to subsidize the export of cattle on hoof to Great Britain by &#x00A3;1 or 30s. we can only guess to what extent that industry can be developed. But the Minister, and I take it the Government, are not interested in this business. Now the Minister evidently misunderstood me when I spoke of the cattle committee. That was a committee appointed and brought into existence to advise the Minister. It was not the Stud Book Association. It was a committee of all the cattle interests combined, appointed by the S.A. Union. That committee made certain recommendations to the Minister which they wished embodied in the Cattle Improvement Bill. We were never told about it, but I understand that the Minister was in favour of it. The Cabinet, however, saw fit to turn these down, so the Minister had to leave it all out of the Bill, those important recommendations. That Bill had to pass the second reading before it was sent to the select committee, on which I had the honour to sit, and we could not introduce anything new. The Minister asked why we did not alter the Bill when it was sent to the select committee as we had it in our power to do.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down said that the Minister of Agriculture had, as usual, not listened this afternoon to the complaints or recommendations that they had made. I have sat here practically the whole afternoon, but I must honestly say that I have not yet learned what the complaints or recommendations are. As for recommendations, I ask whose recommendations are to be accepted&#x003F; Those of the hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Abrahamson) or those of the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron)&#x003F; I should like to know this, because the hon. member for East London (North) made certain recommendations, and the first one to disapprove of them was the hon. member for Weenen. What is the Minister to do in order to satisfy the Opposition&#x003F; I understand their difficulty very well, but then they must not <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_1960"/>make charges against the Minister. If the Opposition want to make definite proposals, then let the leader of the Opposition make them, or let hon. members say that either the hon. member for Weenen or the hon. member for East London (North) is the mouthpiece of the party, but as things are now, we simply do not know where we are. If the Minister had to do with one responsible person his position would be much easier. Hon. members also say that the Minister makes a political matter of every question. I should like them to tell me when the question is a political matter, and when not. Hon. members opposite are so divided that one leader cannot keep them together. They now say that the Minister makes a political matter of something, but as soon as they rise they make a party political matter of it. Accordingly the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) called the Research Institute a political department, and the other day he called one of the officials, who was appointed, &#x201C;the victor of Wakkerstroom.&#x201D; What right have hon. members to make such accusations&#x003F; We have now been having the same arguments over again for the last five years, but we can appreciate the difficulties of the Opposition, because there is nothing new on which they can lay a finger. I hope that hon. members from to-day will no longer harp on the appointments. In my constituency Saps, have been appointed, and Nationalists dismissed. When the Minister dismisses Nationalists, then he also has the right of dismissing Saps, in his department. Why does the hon. member for Klip River never mention the discharge of Nationalists: The fault I find with the Minister is that there are still so many Saps, in his department. I believe that all the chief inspectors left are Saps.</p>

<p>Well, I am glad to hear that they are not all Saps. The hon. member for Klip River wanted to criticize, but he got no further than the appointment of certain officials, inter alia, the appointment of Mr. Wessels. He is not a relation of mine, but let me tell the hon. member that that person was a sheep inspector under his Government, but that he was dismissed. The hon. member for Klip River can enquire into it, and I hope that when this vote comes up next year that he will then agree that the little criticism that he wanted to make was wrong. The previous Government dismissed Mr. Wessels, but the present Minister reappointed him. The hon. member for Klip River said that if he came into office again that he would, in the first place, discharge the Minister of Agriculture. Of course, because he is a Nationalist. I believe the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) will remember, just as well as I do, how, during his Government, Saps, were always appointed. When applications were made the question was never asked whether a man was a Nationalist, but it seems strange to me that they had that wonderful instinct of knowing at once whether a man was a Sap. when they merely looked at him. A Nationalist was never appointed, and in the Zoutpansberg district they had over a hundred Sap. inspectors.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ANDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down trotted out the old story that my objection to these appointments and promotions was based on the fact that they were being given to Nationalists. It is significant that only a few days ago, when I levelled an attack on a certain promotion, the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. A. S. Naud&#x00E9;) said I was attacking a South African party man. As a matter of fact, I am not concerned whether a man is a Nationalist or a South African party man; what I am concerned with is the interests of the country, and what I am going to show is how the interests of the country suffer through the system of jobs for pals. The Minister introduced the system of making appointments from outside the service, and immediately after dismissed or retired officials in the name of redundancy. He does not say the official whose promotion was blocked by the appointment of Dr. Geldenhuis to the position of under-secretary for agriculture was inefficient. We know he was denied his just rights for political reasons. What was his explanation when asked in the House why he did this&#x003F; He said that no injustice was done to that official because he draws his legal pension. That is just my complaint. The Minister has made him a present of nine years&#x2019; service in order to get rid of him, and the taxpayer has got to pay the piper. Let me tell the Minister&#x2014;he ought to know it, and probably does know it&#x2014;that where an official is retired before he reaches the retiring age, the whole of the pension paid to him before he reaches the retiring age is a charge against general revenue. This particular case, as in many other cases, is one in which nine years&#x2019; pension will be drawn against general revenue by an official retired at the whim of the Minister for political reasons. These officials who are pensioned in this way only become a charge against pension funds when they reach <span class="col_3777-3778" refersTo="page_1961"/>the retiring age. Our pension commitments are going up by leaps and bounds under this pernicious system of which the Minister of Agriculture is the arch culprit. I gave an example the other day by pointing out that he brought an ex-manager of a bank named van Dolsen from outside the service, and made him registrar of the division of economics and markets. The Minister made the excuse, when taxed by me, that he had to do that because he wanted a qualified bookkeeper. He had a qualified bookkeeper in the department at the time he made this outside appointment, but the trouble was that that gentleman had not the name of van Dolsen. Why has Dr. J. M. Tinley retired or resigned from the service&#x003F; Dr. Tinley supplies the answer in giving his reason for resigning as reprinted in the Friend of May 3rd, at follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dissatisfaction is rampant throughout the Department of Agriculture, especially in the division of economics and markets. New appointments during the last few years have been followed by the rapid promotion and undue preference of certain men, which has led to a general stultifying of ambition and a dislike of service conditions. Men with the best qualifications and with many years&#x2019; service have consequently been forced into junior positions. The avenues of promotion have been blocked, and in the department there is a widespread desire to get out of the service.</block>

<p>That is what Dr. Tinley says. America has taken on Dr. Tinley, and was only too glad to have him. Here we have another example of the kind of thing that is taking place, and these examples can be multiplied a tenfold. The policy of the Minister is to hound out of the service every man whom he is not sure is a Nationalist. If he is even suspect, that is a sufficient ground for the Minister to get rid of him and substitute a &#x201C;pal&#x201D; in his place. If there is anything that is doing harm in this country, it is this policy of the Minister. I do not know if there is any hope of the Minister working on right lines in the future&#x2014;let us hope so&#x2014;but I do not think there is, because this has been his policy since the day he took office. I would like to ask the Minister what has become of his friend, Mr. Bezuidenhout&#x2014; one of his locust officers&#x003F; Is he still in the employment of the department&#x003F; I would like the Minister to tell us. I would like to know what he is being paid, and what work he is doing. Is he still chasing flying locusts in a motor-car and receiving a shilling a mile motor allowance in addition to his salary for doing so&#x003F; I venture to hope Mr. Bezuidenhout is not being paid the money to-day which he was receiving when I formerly criticized his appointment. When I criticized these appointments of locust officers recently the Minister said I was jealous because he had succeeded in exterminating the locust. I take a very serious view of the manner in which the Minister makes these appointments. I do not want to refer to the appointment of Manie Maritz&#x2014; that is another blot on the record of his department. I hope the Minister will see the error of his ways. I do not know how much longer he will remain in his position.</p>

<p>I thought the hon. member had been dreaming. Badenhorst is an Afrikaner name, and therefore it is good enough to attack. Bezuidenhout is still in the service, and he will long remain there, because the locust plague is always a dangerous thing. Does the hon. member want us to have the position that prevails in other countries with regard to locusts&#x003F; We are freed from them, and that hon. member is jealous about it, as I have said before. Let me discharge those officials and I can assure the hon. member that within three or four years we shall be in the same position that we were in before. Therefore Bezuidenhout will be kept on however jealous the hon. member may be. With regard to Tinley, I am glad and proud that other countries want to use the brains of South Africa. Many of our officials have gone to Rhodesia because Rhodesia needs them. If Dr. Tinley was dissatisfied at my not increasing his salary I can only say that I cannot do so, and that he must wait for the ordinary increases. The hon. member must know that he was talking nonsense about the promotion of officials. Officials are constantly being appointed from outside the service, and they start at the bottom, but there are also certain cases where the Cabinet thinks that officials in the higher ranks ought to be appointed from outside the service. In that case I make a recommendation to the Public Service Commission. He further states that I have increased the expenditure of the department. If the hon. member looks at the estimates he will see that I have reduced them by means of the reorganization which is challenged by him. Fortunately, he will never have anything to do with appointments, because otherwise I should like to know where we would land. He asks what the position is with regard to east coast fever in Natal. The position is considerably better than it was before, but it is not a disease which can immediately be eradicated. We are fighting it, and are gradually mastering it.

<p>I want to raise the question of east coast fever with the Minister with a view to ascertaining what the policy of the department is in regard to the suppression of outbreaks. He says it is a difficult disease and very difficult to control. I brought up this matter last year, and I put certain questions to the Minister in reference to the outbreak at Komgha. The first outbreak was four years ago. The Minister stated, in reply, that the department had spent somewhere about &#x00A3;5,000 up to the 30th June last year to try and cope with this outbreak of east coast fever. The position is that these restrictions on the movement of cattle still exist to-day, and, although they have been relaxed to a certain extent, these conditions and restrictions are still irksome and being felt by the farmers, and there is grave dissatisfaction in that district. This matter has not been finally fixed up, and cattle farmers are hard hit thereby. I asked the Minister last year whether he would not visit the Kimgha district and investigate the position for himself. I do not know whether he has done so. I can tell him that the farmers are very despondent about the methods adopted to eradicate the disease and feel that the steps taken were not sufficiently effective. Not only would the &#x00A3;5,000 already spent at Komgha have practically compensated all the owners of infected cattle in that area, but had the Minister taken his courage in both hands and blotted out the infected and contact cattle, relief would have been afforded. But the expense continues, and there is no relief whatever for these farmers. They are commencing to wonder seriously whether you are not using them as a buffer for the rest of the Cape Province, and that they must bear the burden in order to protect the rest of the cattle owners in the Cape.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of east coast fever in the Komgha district occurred in September, 1926. There were 13 cases and the last one was reported on January 6th, 1928. The expenditure by the department in connection with the outbreak up to 30th June, 1929, was &#x00A3;5,000, a veterinary surgeon and eleven inspectors being engaged on the work. The procedure generally was that, as soon as an outbreak was discovered, not only the infected farm, but the whole district was placed in quarantine and very severe restrictions were imposed on the removal of cattle within and out of that district, although only a wire fence may form the boundary with the adjoining district. Up to the present, east coast fever in the Komgha district has cost the country about &#x00A3;7,000 at a very low estimate and the expenditure is still running on. The farmers in the Komgha area are not satisfied with the methods adopted by the department for the eradication of east coast fever. I notice on the estimates a sum of &#x00A3;1,500 has been placed under B.3 for compensation for loss of stock, viz., stock destroyed in terms of Stock Diseases Acts, an increase of &#x00A3;500 on last year&#x2019;s estimates. I would suggest that the time has arrived, in view of the difficulties and the losses sustained by the farmers, when there should be an alteration in the Government&#x2019;s policy and that the matter should be more effectively dealt with.</p>

<speech by="#van_coller">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Most of the farmers in that area are cattle farmers. They have not been able to sell their stock and, as the restrictions on the removal of cattle have been very effective, their stock has accumulated. I know of the case of a young farmer who has actually lost everything and was seeking work as a result of the restrictions. If the restrictions are not relaxed a good many more farmers will become insolvent. In fact had the drastic restrictions on removal not taken place I am convinced ruin would have stared them all in the face. You could very easily have destroyed those cattle, which would have been an effective way of dealing with this; instead of this these people have been under restrictions for four years. I hope the Minister will see that more effective steps are taken. This is not carping criticism; I am just as anxious as he is to get rid of it, because I do realize the disabilities under which these people are suffering. Steps should be taken to see that this wasteful expenditure is obviated, and the Minister should give his personal attention to the hardships under which these men have been suffering. The whole farming industry is to-day experiencing very difficult times and any restrictions of the free sale of their stock must be avoided as far as possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sauer">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAUER</person>:</from>

<p>There are a few points that I would like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. In the first place I visited Carnarvon a few days ago, and by chance the demonstration train happened to be there. I can assure the Minister that the train is not only highly valued, but that the farmers make great use of it. My complaint, however, is that they receive little from the train. Last Friday there were farmers who had come not less than 75 miles to attend the lectures, but after their coming so far and making great sacrifices, although the officials also made great sacrifices in the interests of the people, the train only stopped there one day, and it was only possible for the farmers to attend the lectures. They did not have a sufficient opportunity of going through the train and getting into touch with the people on the train. There was, e.g., a display of wool and many farmers took great interest in it, but there was no opportunity of looking at the wool with the officials, and of getting advice. I think it would be a good thing if the trains travelled a little slower, and stopped a little longer at some of the important places, otherwise time and money is wasted, and it does not answer the purpose. Furthermore, there are many sheep inspectors in the northwest and the farmers are satisfied with them, <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_1963"/>i.e., with their work. There is one thing that causes a little dissatisfaction, viz., that there is hardly one inspector who comes from the north-western district. They come from the Free State, Transvaal and even Natal. But there are many excellent sheep farmers in our part, and they know more about the circumstances there than the sheep inspectors that come from elsewhere. They feel that it is a little unjust. That not one of the inspectors hails from the north-west. The sons of the north-west best understand the local conditions. Another point of great importance to the farmers concerns the arrear railway dues which affects the Department of Railways as well as the Department of Agriculture. The Minister knows the history of it. Last year a frightful amount was paid off, and I think that there is still &#x00A3;37,000 owing. Last year &#x00A3;110,000 was paid off. I made enquiry about the class of person that pay, and found that almost without one exception all the middle class people pay. That is a class which is afraid of debt, and in many cases they went to the banks, and borrowed money at 8 per cent, to pay off the debt. They realize that the railways assisted them, and they did their utmost to pay their debt.</p>

<p>Yes, the Minister of Agriculture is responsible. As for the very poor people a section have not yet paid, that is the section who are so poor that nothing can be got from them. Then there is a group of people which cannot be considered otherwise than well off, and who are still in debt. The Minister said that the time had come when the people would be compelled to pay. I would suggest that in each of the districts where there are amounts still outstanding a small commission should be appointed with the magistrate as chairman, and two or three farmers acquainted with local conditions to deal with each case on its merits. I do not think the farmers will expect payment. The position now is that the magistrate is asked what the financial position is of the people who owe money. At Carnarvon we have an excellent magistrate who is sympathetic towards the farmers, but he has not been there long, and does not know the circumstances of the farmers so well yet. I therefore recommend that the magistrate in each of the districts should investigate matters along with a few farmers. The Railway Department and the Department of Agriculture will recover much more money and the farmers will be quite satisfied. I discussed the matter with the farmers, and they are quite satisfied with this proposal. They feel that if people who can pay do not pay it will be detrimental to the farmers if they have in future to get help to trek with their stock. They see that the department might then say that when they had got cheap rates before they did not pay their debts. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) said that where 50 per cent, of an industry desired co-operation the other 50 per cent, should be compelled to fall into line with them. That is a most preposterous suggestion and especially in a country where the people pride themselves on their love of liberty and freedom. The Minister rebuked the hon. member for Albert on this attitude, and yet ever since Parliament opened the Minister himself has consistently urged the desirability of co-operation of this nature, and has brought in measure after measure the aim of which is not merely to secure voluntary cooperation, but to force unwilling men into cooperative concerns. We have had no less than nine Bills, most of which have dealt with cooperation, and the others, while not exactly co-operative in their essence, have contained the principle of Government control. When I heard the Minister rebuke the hon. member for going too far, I began to think that perhaps some of our speeches on this side of the House had converted him, and that the scales were falling from his eyes. I want to refer to the question of erosion. The sum of &#x00A3;1,000 set down seems very small for so important a matter, because I think the subject of erosion ranks even above irrigation in importance. I hope that the country has awakened to the necessity of combating this evil. It is suggested that we stop the big sluits and uniting generally by putting barricades across them, and I see a possibility along those lines of doing a great deal of good, but most of the evil is not on the plains, but along our mountain slopes. The lack of adequate fencing and paddocking is a prolific cause of trouble, overstocking is another, and through these causes the soil is drifting away. You find whole slopes of mountain absolutely corrugated. That is a point which deserves the closest attention of the Government. The only remedy is to paddock such lands, and give them absolute rest. There are many parts of the country where it is impossible to do this owing to the conditions, especially in the native territories, but I think that this is the sole way of combating evil. I would also like to refer to the question of scab, and to ask the Minister whether the country is absolutely free from it, or whether there is not still a considerable amount of scab in various parts of it. I have lately been advised that the district of King William&#x2019;s Town is full of scab. Basutoland, too, I am informed has scab, and also Herschel. In Basutoland they have only applied scab regulations during comparatively recent years, and it is not to be expected <span class="col_3783-3784" refersTo="page_1964"/>that they will wipe it out in a very short time considering the millions of sheep they possess and lack of equipment. Our district, Barkly East, was proclaimed free from scab in 1924. The recent outbreaks there have been due to sheep straying in from Basutoland or Herschel. We have urged the Government to come to our assistance in regard to erecting proper fences along the border. The present Minister has consistently evaded that issue. We have had fences along that boundry since prior to 1903, and from the time of their erection up to the early part of 1924, the previous Governments used to contribute towards their maintenance and paid not only half the cost of maintaining them, but also of their original construction. The present Government refused to render that assistance, and farmers have had to do it off their own bat. So much for the false claim that the present Government is the only true friend of the farmer. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">REV. S. W. NAUD&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Many reproaches have been cast at the Minister of Agriculture this afternoon, e.g., that we have done nothing for the farmers, and other hon. members asked what he has done. An attitude like that reminds one very much of the proverb, &#x201C;ingratitude is universal.&#x201D; It appears to be necessary to freshen up the memories of hon. members a little. I represent a district of cattle farmers, and they are very thankful for the partial prohibition on cattle coming from Rhodesia. In 1924 when the previous Government was in office 64,690 cattle came into our country from Rhodesia, but in 1927 the figures had dropped to 25,139. Moreover the Minister of Agriculture has eradicated scab. During the administration of the previous Government there were more than 14,315 infected flocks in 1923, but during the present Government&#x2019;s regime the figure dropped in 1927 to 6,667. In 1924 there were only 26 clean districts, but in 1927 there were 187 of them. In the same way the Government also assisted the fruit farmers by making the agreement with the Union-Castle Line which meant a saving to them of &#x00A3;134,000. Other farmers who have been assisted are, amongst others, the wool farmers, who by the &#x00BE;d. tax per lb. on scoured wool save &#x00A3;500,000. The tobacco, and wheat farmers also got assistance from the Government, but there is yet another kind of farmer whose interest no one has advocated, viz., the groundnut farmers. The northern Transvaal, and especially the district I represent is particularly suited to ground nuts, and the farmers have started to produce or, a large scale. Unfortunately an unhealthy competition has come from East Africa, and those farmers have been brought under the impression by the other side that that competition has come about owing to the Mocambique treaty. I am very glad that the Minister of Finance has made it clear that the Mocambique treaty has nothing to do with it. I have the treaty here, and the annexure says that everything can come in free except groundnuts. Groundnuts for industrial purposes can, however, come in free under the Act of 1925, but what prevents the trader importing groundnuts for industrial purposes and then selling them&#x003F; We would have preferred the tax to have been 5s. instead of 3s. on groundnuts, and we hope that the Minister will see his way also to put a tax on the importation of ground nuts for use. I want again to express my hearty thanks or the Minister for what he has already done and to emphasise that the Mocambique treaty has nothing to do with the importation of groundnuts. It is said that the groundnuts are required for establishing our soap factories, but I hope that the Minister will avail himself of the first opportunity he gets to assist the groundnut farmers in this respect.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>I have had no personal contact with them so I cannot say whether it is due to the Minister or to his staff in particular, but there is no doubt our poultry in South Africa is going ahead by leaps and bounds &#x2014;especially the egg side of it. I want to help the Minister if I can to strengthen and extend that division. I would suggest that it is just as well not to confine ourselves to the production and sale of eggs. I think the Minister has realized it, but I want to spur him on if I can. He will want more men and will have to appeal to the hon. Minister of Finance to support him, but it warrants a little more money being spent, and an increase in personnel. I would like particularly to direct his attention to table poultry. I understand&#x2014;it may be an exaggeration but there is a good deal of truth in it&#x2014;that the whole of the poultry industry of South Africa, so far as table poultry is concerned, is not yet sufficient to supply the Johannesburg market. With the small exports at the moment, the overseas markets take our poultry with the utmost avidity. Along these lines, lies a tremendous scope for development. I suggest that two or three experts on the subject be obtained to give advice to those anxious to produce table poultry as to the breeding strains and feeding, etc. Lots of private people and clubs are taking up this question but naturally their resources and opportunities of research are limited, and it is in this direction the Minister <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_1965"/>can help. There is another matter I would like to deal with, to which I was referring on another occasion when I was ruled out of order. I have been ruled out of order so often that I cannot remember the details, but whether or no I wish to have the sympathy of the Minister. I would suggest to the Minister that the Land Bank should adopt a more sympathetic attitude when dealing with those who have met with misfortune. I particularly refer to the East Rand Co-operative Society, a horticultural society which is producing fruit. It is composed entirely of working men, who, whilst carrying on their industry, are endeavouring to build up a reserve towards a home where they can hope to end their days in peace, and meanwhile, they formed a co-operative society and borrowed some money from the Land Bank to make that concern a flourishing institution. They have a packing shed; they bought lorries and all the necessary appurtanences for the distribution of fruit. All our products&#x2014;tobacco, cotton, eggs, fowls, fruit, maize, everything&#x2014; the problem is not so much that of production, but rather of distribution. They borrowed this money, and they were faced with three consecutive years, unfortunately, of hail. In the second year, the Land Bank called in their money. I personally made representations to the Land Bank, and they temporarily withdrew that demand. Then there intervened another hailstorm, which destroyed all their fruit and half their trees. Just at that moment, because they could not, by reason of the fact that nature was working against them, meet their commitments, the Land Bank foreclosed again. They actually foreclosed. Not only did the Land Bank insist upon the repayment of the full amount, but they collared all the machinery, and the lorries. They even took over the packing shed, and made it impossible for these men, even if they could produce the fruit, to pay back the loan. I hope the hon. Minister will look into this question. I say it is better for the state to abandon all that money and give these men an opportunity of getting on their feet again, than it is to squeeze this money out of them and make it impossible for them to establish themselves in the future. They are earnest men, and they are anxious to succeed. They are doing all they can. They are bringing scientific methods to bear on their work, but nature has robbed them of the fruits of their toil. I ask the Minister, as he is strong, to be merciful, and as he is equally strong, to bring that strength to bear upon the Minister of Finance who will, I hope, approach the Land Bank in this respect. I hope for another opportunity, later on, to bring up one or two other matters which will take a longer time to deal with.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALBERTS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask whether the Minister knows that my constituency is chiefly dependent on tobacco culture and wheat. There are two experimental stations on which we depend for information, and I have received complaints&#x2014;I hope they are groundless&#x2014;that the farmers apply for information to those stations, but that they cannot get it, because the stations are not efficient. The farmers asked, e.g., what kind of wheat they should sow, and the reply from the officials was that they did not know. The farmers then have to follow their own ideas. I should like to know from the Minister whether those experimental stations are efficient, and whether experiments are made with wheat which is free from rust, and what we can plant in that neighbourhood. Many poor people will then have an opportunity of making a living. In connection with tobacco, we are much troubled with the pest which is known as wild fire. It sometimes destroys the whole harvest. I should like to know whether experiments are made to find out what the cause of it, and what remedies should be used against it because the farmers cannot find it out. I hope that the Minister will enlighten me on these points. I now also want to come to the question of maize. I do not represent a large maize district, but I am not quite satisfied with what has been said here about the matter. I do not agree with the opinion expressed here that co-operation ought to be made compulsory. Co-operation can only be effective if it is voluntary. Hon. members will possibly mention the case of the Co-operative Wine Farmers&#x2019; Association, and the Tobacco Co-operative Society. The latter is not a success, and the wine farmers are in a different position. They are a comparatively small group, and live close together. The maize farmers are however spread over the whole country, and you have all the natives planting mealies.</p>

We have to do something because we cannot possibly produce maize and sell it at 7s. a bag, but I do not agree that we ought to come here and attack the Minister about the matter. It is the duty of the farmers to come together, and not to differ here amongst themselves about the matter. We must first decide what we want, and then we must go to the Government as one man. We must allow the maize all to go through one channel at a fixed price, but it is our duty to join hands, and we must not expect the Government to do it for us. We must have less party politics in connection with agricultural matters. We are indulging in party politics, and the interests of the farmers are neglected. Hon. members opposite, and hon. members on this side must join hands and decide what the interests of agriculture require. But if we cannot co-operate here how then can we expect people outside to co-operate&#x003F; We must work together more here, and in connection with tobacco, maize, and all the various produce we must agree on what is to be done, and then we can go to the Minister concerned.</p>

<p>The only answer the Minister of Agriculture could give to the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) was that we <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_1966"/>must put on the brake. The object of the hon. member for Albert was to get better markets for our produce. I do not want to go into the merits of compulsory co-operation, but the Minister says that we must put on the brake and must go back to the ox in order to be able to produce maize cheaper. It is an astonishing answer for a Minister of Agriculture. Why then not advise us to go back to prehistoric times and to use the pick&#x003F; That will be still cheaper. The Minister ought to urge us to produce on a larger scale Instead of that he advises us to go back to the pick. We are from time to time disappointed by the Minister when we discuss agricultural problems. Where we expected a lead from the Minister of Agriculture we have only found slackness. When we want enthusiasm from him we get nothing else but weakness. It is very deplorable. I want the Minister to tell me the reason why, when the director of agriculture and stock breeding was sent throughout the whole civilized world to study our cattle farming and the meat market, he was transferred on his return to the Department of Native Affairs&#x003F; What was the benefit derived from his mission&#x003F; It cost the country a few hundred pounds. I notice that there has been an amount of &#x00A3;99 for entertainment purposes. That was, of course, given him for going more fully into matters and getting information. All that is lost, and the Director of Agriculture and of Stock Breeding is the only one who benefited by it. Then I would like to ask the Minister what the result is of the experiment by the department in connection with the supply of sheep to farmers for cross-breeding purposes. Is this work that should be done by private persons, or that the department should undertake&#x003F; Can we expect good results if it is done by private people&#x003F; It is work in connection with which the department ought to specialize, but the Minister gives the sheep gratis to the farmers without any responsibility being taken, and he does it to have experiments made in connection with cross-breeding. I think that is wrong. Then I would like the Minister to say what he has done in connection with scab on the farm Trooilaps Pan. As the Minister knows, there is an awkward state of affairs there. The owner states that his sheep have already been dipped 11 or 12 times, but the scab still continues. Has the Minister taken steps against the inspector in connection with the position&#x003F; Does it meet with his approval that the state of affairs should continue&#x003F; Then I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that the agricultural unions feel that when they sometimes make recommendations to the Minister he Rejects them and takes the advice of private farmers&#x2019; associations, who do not speak through the agricultural union. They feel that the Minister should not rely so much on the recommendations of private farmers, recommendations which often conflict with the definite advice of the agricultural union. Then I should like to know under what regulations the inspectors are being appointed. An hon. member opposite complained that the inspector in his district did not come from that district. I would like to ask whether the regulation does not provide that when anyone is appointed as an inspector he cannot remain in his own district. If it is so, I should like to know why in the district of Piet Retief, where the Minister resides, the inspectors can remain on their farms. They are rich men.</p>

What steps have been taken to prevent bad meat being exported&#x003F; I put a question to the Minister in connection with meat which was sent to England, and which was condemned as bad on arrival. The Minister replied that there was one consignment that was rejected. According to our information, there were two consignments, one of liver and tongue and one of beef. I have here an extract from a correspondent in London&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another promising South African export industry has received a severe blow in the shape of 2,000 packages of boneless beef which have been condemned by the Glasgow medical officer of health out of a consignment of 9,000.</block>

<block name="quote">This is particularly inopportune because the trade believes that present conditions are favourable to the starting of a small and regular export which has so long been the dream of South Africa&#x2019;s smitten cattle-owners. It is considered that the South African Government should insist on a more rigid inspection by an expert in meat packing, which is a specialized branch of the industry for which an ordinary meat inspector is not qualified.</block>

<block name="quote">The medical officer of health&#x2019;s complaint is that the meat was internally tainted, probably through being chilled before it was properly cold. Boneless beef, for which an inferior meat cannot be used, is a new departure for South Africa, a short supply on the English market during the last few months having afforded an opportunity for the start. It is considered that there is a big opportunity for the expansion of this trade.</block>

<p>I am glad that I have another opportunity of speaking. My friend, the hon. member for Magaliesberg (Mr. Alberts), did not attack the Minister of Agriculture, but me, in connection with compulsory co-operation. But at the end of his speech he also advocated compulsory co-operation. The hon. member said that the maize farmers must stand together, and must then tell the Government that this or the other must be done, and that they must fix the price. If that is not <span class="col_3789-3790" refersTo="page_1967"/>compulsory co-operation I do not know what is. In any event the hon. member for Magaliesberg and I stand on the same footing, but the hon. member merely misunderstood me. It is not my object to get the Government to provide by legislation that farmers must co-operate. I speak from my own experience when I speak on co-operation. Take the case of a group of farmers, say, 100 farmers establishing a cooperative society in a district, and selling their mealies in a co-operative way. 95 per cent, are loyal to the organization, but five of them are disloyal and undermine their co-operative society. I ask hon. members whether it is right to allow the five disloyal ones to make the work of the whole organization useless?</p>

<p>I only gave it as an example. When the farmers establish a cooperative society then every member must be compelled to stand by it, and we must not allow a section of the farmers to try and make a success of the co-operative society, and the others to get the advantage of such an organization, but yet to pass their own society by. The existing Act says that as soon as there are farmers representing 75 per cent, of the production that want to form a co-operative society, they have the right to come to Parliament to compel the remaining 25 per cent, to join the society. All that I suggested was to make 50 per cent, instead of 25, but if hon. members think that that is too low we can, e.g., make it 55 per cent. When I oppose the hon. member for Magaliesberg I am not making a personal attack on him, and we do not want to make a party matter of this. I think we ought to encourage that compulsory co-operation, and if the Minister says that he is against it, then I, as a simple farmer, cannot agree with him. The Minister does a great deal for co-operation among farmers, and I want to appeal to him to encourage co-operation, and as soon as there are a certain number of farmers who co-operate, then he must make it compulsory in that district. I can understand that the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) saying that it is &#x201C;preposterous&#x201D; to say that if 50 per cent, of the farmers co-operate the other 50 per cent, should be compelled to co-operate. If I am not wrong the hon. member is a member of an organization which calls itself a cooperative society, viz., the F.C.U.</p>

<p>Well, then, I will not mention any names, and will speak about the principle of co-operation. There is a certain organization which calls itself a co-operative society which gives its members the liberty of selling to whom they wish. In my opinion such an organization ought not to be registered under the Co-operative Societies Act. Say, e.g., that the hon. member for Aliwal North were a member of such an association and sold his wool to a speculator, and that speculator in turn sent the wool to his organization, then it makes a farce of co-operation. I would like the Minister of Agriculture to enquire what can be done to prevent that. At every show we see the advertisement, &#x201C;co-operation without compulsion,&#x201D; but they are organizations which, nevertheless, buy thousands of bales of wool from speculators.</p>

<p>Yes, I can quite understand that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. McIlwraith) is against compulsory co-operation because it would result in putting an end to his business. The Minister of Agriculture ought to see that the co-operative societies should not be allowed to carry on business with the wool of dealers. They ought only to do business with the shareholders, or with farmers. I do not agree with the Minister when he says that they also may not carry on business with farmers who are not members. A co-operative society must do propaganda work, and the best propaganda work is that a society should also handle the produce of non-members, and in that way convince the non-member of the benefits of co-operation. We had the example in the Western Province of compulsory co-operation among the wine farmers. Where would they have been to-day without that compulsory co-operation&#x003F; It was their salvation, and in the same way we will make a success of maize, wheat and all the other produce when we introduce compulsory co-operation.

<p>I want to say a word or two to the Minister of Agriculture about our citrus export, and I hope he will give me credit for doing all I can to help the industry, and for having no desire to hinder him in his work. We all know that the last season was a disastrous one. All sorts of reasons are given for that. One reason given is that we irritated our best customer, and another is that we were not careful enough in the quality of the stuff we sent overseas. I think the latter reason is the real one. Our trade commissioner, Mr. Dimond, says in the Commercial and Industrial Gazette, a Government paper, issued monthly by the Board of Trade and Industries, that the prices realized in 1929 must have come as a severe shock. The reason for the low prices is given by him. He says it was the appearance on the market of large quantities of oranges from all quarters of a type and quality that would not be welcomed under any circumstances. It is not South Africa only who has <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_1968"/>reason to cogitate on the disastrous season, according to Mr. Dimond. Both California and Brazil have reason to do the same thing, as the Californian and Brazilian crops contained a large quantity of small oranges. There were juiceless and stringy oranges sent to London according to Mr. Dimond. These come from young trees, and, therefore, I hope that the Minister will see that more care is exercised by the inspectors. Then Mr. Dimond says that discrimination should be shown even in sending good fruit of the large size. We should avoid sending nothing less than eighties, but as few as possible of eighties and ninety-sixes. Mr. Dimond says he hopes to see steps taken before next season which will remove a good deal of the grounds for complaint. He says that the hands of the inspection staff should be strengthened. There is a good deal of room for research and experiment. Then he eulogizes the work of the empire marketing board. That, I think, we will all agree with. The empire marketing board have done all they could to facilitate the sale of South African oranges in London. He says further that visits were paid to various shops in England to find out the reasons why South African oranges were not used, and the reasons given were: &#x201C;You are no friends of ours,&#x201D; and also that the oranges were sour. Other complaints were that the fruit was dry, wasting, coarse skinned and of poor flavour. What I want to point out is that we are allowing oranges to go out of this country which should not be shipped. I also want to point out what is done in London. We know that all the people are not too well principled, and that when a man can buy oranges cheap and put a good man&#x2019;s label on them, he will do it. On the costers&#x2019; barrows the following announcement was made with regard to their fruit: &#x201C;Guaranteed all sweet; not mixed with sour South African oranges.&#x201D; Is not that a terrible thing to have said of our produce, which I think is some of the best in the world&#x003F; This is caused through our sending faulty fruit. I see that regulations have now been issued regarding these sour oranges, and I want to give the Minister credit for trying to do the next best thing in the circumstances, that is to insist that every orange shall be stamped &#x201C;sour&#x201D; with letters a quarter-of-an inch in height. That is different from what he stated in the House, that the packages and wrappers only be marked &#x201C;sour.&#x201D; But I want to point out to the Minister that another thing has occurred which I warned him about when we last discussed this subject. England and the continent contain a lot of ignorant people, and some of them will take the stamp &#x201C;suur&#x201D; as another brand of oranges. I hope they will not taste them, because if they do they will give us a very bad name. We know that each grower is levied to the extent of 5s. per ton, which amounts to 3&#x00BD;d. per case. Last year some of the growers did not get 1s. per box nett for their oranges. That makes it a serious matter for them.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member who has just sat down has found out how hostile their action was in the past towards the citrus farmers of the Union.

<p>On a point of explanation, would the Minister mind putting that in English&#x003F; I find his Afrikaans a little difficult to understand. What I said was that in putting the letters &#x201C;suur&#x201D; on these oranges, the Minister was doing his best to make his oranges unsaleable.</p>

<p>I say that the hon. member is now approving of the regulations which he recently disapproved of. Some weeks ago he disapproved of them, but now that the citrus exchange have disapproved of hon. members dragging this matter into the political arena, they draw back, and now they approve of the regulations. The hon. member need not be afraid that I will put the word &#x201C;sour&#x201D; on the oranges. We shall put the word &#x201C;sour&#x201D; on them for sale overseas. There will, therefore, be no danger that the oranges will be regarded as a particular mark. The hon. member further said that we had angered our best friends overseas, and that it was on that account that the orange market was so bad last year.</p>

<p>But why repeat it here that the market was bad because we had angered our best friends&#x003F; It is a thing which is said every day on the countryside by members of the South African party, although they know that it is not true. In regard to this matter, I may say that England is satisfied with the produce we send, and receive and to sell. The hon. member rays that certain people say so, but why cannot it be repeated here so that other countries should get to know it&#x003F; Now he says that we must not send large oranges. We must first look for a market, but when we have the market then first we may not send sour oranges, and thereafter once more we may not send large oranges. What then are we eventually to send&#x003F; I do not follow the hon. member&#x2019;s argument and his motive. The orange market was bad last year because there was a big harvest in Brazil, but my information this year is that there will not be such a big harvest, and, therefore, the orange farmers can expect to get better prices. The hon. member for Cathcart (Mr. van Coller) said here that the farmers in his district have been struggling for four years now under the east coast fever regulations. My district has been struggling for 27 years under them. It is not a disease which can so easily be eradicated, and it is not a disease we can play with. It is difficult and treacherous. To-day it breaks out here, and to-morrow at some other place. The hon. member admits that the regulations have <span class="col_3793-3794" refersTo="page_1969"/>been made easier and why does he now plead for them to be made still easier&#x003F; No. I am not going to do it because it is a serious matter which we have to face. He complains of the high cost. It cannot be otherwise, because if we are to fight stock diseases and get rid of them, then we must incur expense. I do not want to go into the details of the matter here. He says, however, the people are going bankrupt. It is possible. If there is an extraordinary disease then special steps have to be taken, but I have never yet heard of people having gone bankrupt in consequence of the regulations. He says that there is &#x00A3;1,500 on the estimates for the payment of damages, and that it is too little. Are we then to compensate people for the low prices of stock, because there is east coast fever in a district&#x003F; The hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. Sauer) complained that the demonstration train did not stop longer than one day at a place when people sometimes came more than 75 miles to attend the lectures. I have often visited the train, and I can assure the hon. member that one can easily go through the whole train, which is not very long, in one day, and also attend all the lectures. Our experience is that on the second day the people, for the most part, have left, and there is not much interest. Then such a train would stop there, and cause unnecessary expense. I will, however, make enquiries, and If there are places who so much love the train we shall possibly be able to arrange to let the train stop longer. Then the hon. member said that there were so many inspectors in the north-west. There are possibly many inspectors there now because the control staff is there. They are engaged in cleaning those areas. The hon. member also complains that no inspectors were appointed from the north-west. I can tell the hon. member that if we were to go through the appointments it will be found that out of every two appointments one was from the Cape Province. We must not show a provincial spirit.</p>

<p>Several inspectors have been appointed by the present Government who came from the northwest. Then the hon. member spoke about arrears of railways debts. He said exactly what I said a little while ago, viz., that the poor people and the middle classes paid their debts as far as ever possible, but that there were a number of rich people who did not pay. I will consider the suggestion he has made. The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) has once more brought up the old matter of the fence between the districts of Her3chel and Basutoland. I have already repeatedly said that if the Herschel farmers want to fence, Basutoland is prepared to pay half the expense. In the same way that I have to pay half, and my neighbours half, if we want to fence our farms the farmers will also have to pay half in that case.</p>

<p>Why then do you not do so&#x003F; Then he complained about the small amount which is made available in connection with erosion. That is a matter to which the owners should themselves attend. This amount is merely for the necessary instruction of the farmers. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) spoke about the poultry industry. I appreciate the way in which he praised the officials for their work. If it is necessary to increase the staff we will consider it, but I hope we shall be able to continue with the staff I have at my disposal. He also spoke about the Land Bank. The difficulty, inter alia, is that certain co-operative societies have gone wrong. The hon. member knows that the Land Bank is conducted on a business footing, and it is very difficult for the Government to tell the Land Bank what to do. If we were to decide to make a Government institution of it, I fear that many difficulties would arise. The hon. member for Magaliesberg (Mr. Alberts) asked whether our experimental stations were answering their purpose. Yes. He further asked whether we were trying rustproof wheat in the various districts in the country. Yes. But nature in our country is often, or usually so unfriendly that after two or three years the climate affects the rustproof wheat, and rust, nevertheless, gets into the wheat. We are still looking out for a kind of wheat which will continue to be rustproof. If farmers get no satisfaction from the experimental stations they can write to the Secretary for Agriculture. The department is always prepared to send an official. Then the hon. member spoke about wildfire in tobacco; the department has made enquiries, and even purified the seed. Pamphlets have also been issued in connection with it. With regard to maize, hon. members say that we must do something, but they do not bring up concrete proposals. I have already said that I am not prepared to adopt compulsory co-operation. Now I come to the hon. member for Dundee (Mr. Friend). One might forgive him a little because he is still a little young, and he sometimes says irresponsible things. He spoke of two consignments of meat which were sent to Europe and rejected. I have already in answer to a question, told the hon. member that there was one consignment, with which I regret to say something apparently went wrong. I do not know whether it happened on the ship, in the cold storage, or before the meat was inspected. I have not yet received a final report. I can, however, say that I only know of one consignment, and that I have given instructions that the inspection should be very carefully conducted in future. Then the hon. member spoke about the appointment of sheep inspectors, and asked why some of them were appointed in the district where they resided. It is left entirely to the discretion of the Minister. He mentioned the name of Mr. Piet Rabie. He is a farmer&#x2019;s son, and his father, I may say for the information of the hon. member, is a great supporter of the South African party. He is a very good inspector, and does his duty. If Mr. Rabie does not do his duty because he <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_1970"/>attends to his own farm too much I will certainly intervene. Then he mentioned the name of Mr. Piet Bannewater. He is no longer alive, and he was appointed under the previous Government. He lived on his farm. Then it was not wrong, but now in the case of Mr. Rabie it is a sin. Then the hon. member argued that I ought to pay more attention to the advice of the Natal Agricultural Union than to that of private farmers.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>If I get better advice according to the view of my department, and according to my own ideas from private farmers than from the agricultural union, then I need not reject the advice of the farmers. If the advice of the agricultural unions is sound, we will attend to it, but then it must not be of such a dictatorial nature as the advice that the Natal Union wants to give us. In this connection I quoted a letter which I wrote to them, and in which I, in a very friendly way, called attention to this. I refuse absolutely to be dictated to in that way. Then he spoke about scab on the farm of Mr. Hayward in the north-west where sheep have already been dipped twelve times without eradicating scab. It is a very big farm, and scab recurred every time. Mr. Hayward has now come to see us, and said that he would give attention to the matter himself; and he would be able to eradicate scab himself. We approved of it provided he dipped all his sheep; thereafter further telegrams came that they only wanted to dip a portion of them. It will be no use, and we will see to it that all are dipped, so that scab will eventually be entirely eradicated there. Then the question of the crossing of sheep was discussed; with that object I tried to give a few farmers sheep, and I hope it will be a success, but that method is not quite satisfactory, and the department is now making the experiments chiefly on the agricultural schools. Then an hon. member attacked me because a high official of the Veterinary Department after a journey to the Argentine had been transferred to another department. The officer was transferred on account of the policy laid down by the chiefs of the department in 1926. The hon. member will know that the department consisted of about fourteen sub-departments, and we reduced the number to six. It was with reference to that alteration that we put the Veterinary Department under stock breeding where it belonged. The hon. member said that the advice of the official is now lost; that is not the case, and a proper report was made which the hon. member can see if he wishes. Then the hon. member complains about my saying that he went too far with his recommendations of motor tractors. I said that we must follow the old method of ploughing by oxen, and must be slow in making changes. The hon. member said that every farmer ought to buy a motor tractor. It may be a big thing for the farmer who has a very big farm and plenty of money, but I want to warn the farmers because a tractor costs much more, and it is much more profitable, especially to the small farmers, to use oxen. The farmer must beware against the cost of production becoming too high. I do not think that I need again reply to the speech of the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) with reference to compulsory cooperation because I did so in my previous speech. Then there is the further question of the export of sheep. Let me say that I exported two lambs in cold storage accommodation to England. The result was satisfactory because we got a higher price than in Cape Town, viz., 5&#x00BE;d. a 1b. net. We intended to send a further experimental consignment, but I received a cable from the High Commissioner saying that at the moment there was a surplus of mutton in England and that the market in, consequence was weak. Accordingly we will not send it now, but rather wait a few months until the market has improved.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the Minister objected to our discussing the question of citrus oranges in the House. The Minister knows that a very large capital is invested in citrus oranges, and we did not debate the question with any intention of making party capital out of it, but we only did so to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister and the House. We have the fullest right to do so. Where else can we discuss the interests of the farmers except under this heading&#x003F; I know that the Minister is acting contrary to the view of the citrus exchange if he allows those sour oranges to be exported. We have been debating the position of the maize and grain farmers this afternoon, and I am sorry that the Minister was not able to give us a little comfort by saying that the Government will be able to assist those farmers. The Minister said that the position of the farmers in Australia was still worse and he advised the farmers to co-operate. Co-operation is a good thing, but at the moment we are in trouble, and, in my opinion, the Minister should devise a scheme by which we can get rid of the surplus of grain and mealies in as cheap a way as possible as regards transport. There is another matter which comes under the Minister&#x2019;s estimates, and where in my opinion the Minister can assist the farmers. It is the yield of Government guano. The Government during the past year has sold 77,750 lbs. of guano, etc., and the cost of administration was &#x00A3;51,500; this shows a surplus of more than &#x00A3;22,000 a year. The farmers to-day pay &#x00A3;7 a ton for guano. I will frankly admit that the experts think that that is cheap, and that the guano is worth much more than &#x00A3;7 a ton. But I think that we have here to do with a product on which the State ought not to make a profit. If I remember rightly guano cost &#x00A3;5 years ago, and even if the Minister brought the price down to &#x00A3;5 he will still suffer no loss, because 9,000 tons a year is produced. In my opinion the Minister cannot assist the grain farmers in this respect only, but must also assist the horticulturists and other farmers. The Minister must his my opinion, try to get the consent of the Minister <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_1971"/>of Finance to bring the price of guano down to &#x00A3;5. I think this will be well received by the farmers, and it will be of great help to further development. This is an indirect form of assistance which the Minister can give to our farmers.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister the necessity of establishing agricultural banks in the country. There is a surplus of lucerne and grain in the country and we must now bring the matter to the notice of the farmers. I mention it here in order that the public may think about it. I also want to congratulate the Minister on what he is doing in connection with the survey of land. Last year I brought the question of white labour in the agricultural schools to the notice of the Minister. It is a question of policy and so I mention it here. The Minister said that he was making experiments in the matter, and that he would go further if the experiments proved successful. I hope that he will be able to tell us that the experiments were successful, and that a more expended use of white labour will result at the agricultural schools. I also hope that the Minister will go further and will build small houses&#x2014;as small as possible, and as cheap and effective as possible&#x2014;for those white labourers, so that they can serve as a model for the cottages which will subsequently be required when those people are put on settlements. Further, I have here a telegram received from the Secretary of the Cape Agricultural Union to bring the position of the chicory farmers to the notice of the Minister. I have before me the report of two officials of the marketing and agricultural economy department on the chicory industry at Alexandria. The report was submitted to the Minister in 1929, and although it is clear that those chicory farmers have a monopoly they are absolutely exploited by the buyers and agents, and to such an extent that they can hardly make a living. The position was so serious that they were obliged to form a cooperative society. The number of farmers is about 140, and 100 of them have already become members of the society. If the number is 140 then it is just on the borders of the quantity which is required by law before they can apply for compulsion. The producers realize that they cannot go on as at present. They want compulsion and expect the department to assist them in the matter. There are already more than 100 of the farmers out of the 140 who are members of the co-operative society. Unfortunately we have already reached the stage in the session that we are prevented from proposing here that chicory should also be included as one of the agricultural products in the Act which provides for compulsion. I hope, however, that these farmers will have the sympathy of the Minister, and if he cannot do it this year then he must give assistance next year so that the society may get control over all the chicory. I have the report before me, and the recommendations amount to this that the farmers have to send their chicory roots for proper cooling to the association That they are there to be classified into three grades, and that advances must be given that the management must have a fixed policy in regard to prices, that the factories must be fairly treated, and that the association must do its best to improve the quality of the article. The conclusion of the matter is that if that is done the farmers will be better rewarded for their work. To a great extent I favour compulsory co-operation. I feel that we ought to observe that the professional planters protect themselves. They compel no one to join a definite profession, but when a person becomes an advocate or a doctor he must join up with the professional association concerned. I think the time has come when a farmer decides to become a chicory farmer, and that industry thinks that its interests demand that there should be a co-operative society to control the products, then he ought to be compelled to join that society. The same applies to the other branches of farming. We compel no one to become a farmer, and if a person has become a farmer then we do not prescribe what kind of farming he is to do, but when a person decides to apply himself to a specific branch of farming, then we must follow the example of the professions and make it compulsory for him to join the association which that branch of farming considers necessary for the protection of its interests. If we do that then we shall be able to make great progress. This presumes that the co-operative societies are already in existence there. When the Act speaks of 75 per cent, it presumes a co-operative society which is so strong as to be able to handle the products of the non-members. The Act does not say that the rest of the farmers who produce that specific article must become members of the society, but that they must allow their produce to be handled through the co-operative society. If the society is not allowed to handle those products then they are practically made a present of to the grocers. The co-operative society can only be a force if all the farmers belong to it. I therefore hope that the Minister will attend to the appeal which the chicory farmers have made to him. I also hope, and I may possibly be optimistic, that it will not stop at the chicory farmers, but that the farmers throughout the Union will follow the example of the wine and tobacco farmers, although in closely defined areas, and will see that the farmer will advance his own interests for the farmer and through the farmer. I also hope that the farmers wall learn themselves to look after the financial basis of the co-operative societies that they will collect funds with the assistance of the Government to be able to properly protect themselves. To the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) and other hon. members I want to point out that there is something wrong when a farmer gets 3d. a lb. for beef, and the consumer has to pay from 11d. to 13d. If that is the position then there <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_1972"/>must be a far-reaching exploitation of the farmer and of the consumer. [Time limit.]</p>

What the Minister has endured in the nature of criticism to-night is a mere nothing to what he is to have at the hands of the farmers of the Union. They are beginning to find him out. The test of his efficiency is the state of the farmer to-day. If we want to determine whether the Minister has made a success of his job as the champion of the interests of the farmer, we must ask, what is the position of the farmer&#x2014;is he satisfied, prosperous or content&#x003F; Has his confidence in the Department of Agriculture been enhanced during the Minister&#x2019;s period of office&#x003F;</p>

Are the markets for the farmers&#x2019; produce adequate and satisfactory, and are they markets at which produce is sold at a margin of profit&#x003F; Is agriculture pulsing with life and activity to-day&#x003F; Are the farms improving, and are the farmers&#x2019; bank balances improving every year&#x003F; Has there been a steady increase in the agricultural population of this country during the Minister&#x2019;s period of office&#x003F; What steps has he taken to see that there is such a desirable increase&#x003F; One of the most important things in this country is to see that there is an increase in the agricultural population, and that the whole of that population is prosperous. Have the farmers a sense of security for the future&#x003F; In other words, do they trust the Minister&#x003F; The answer is, &#x201C;No.&#x201D; The Minister promised the farmers prosperity, and what have they got&#x003F; Poverty. Let me point out how negligent he has been. I have received to-day from the Durban Chamber of Commerce, most appropriately, a statement respecting one matter that the Minister has neglected. For over two years the trade which deals in farmers&#x2019; implements and machinery and so on has pointed out to the Railway Administration that, in view of the saving in truck space, when these implements are consigned packed in cases, a lower rate should be charged. The Railway Administration has, however, increased the railage charges. This is the way the championship of the farmers is being carried out to-day, and this is done when the agricultural industry is experiencing great difficulties on account of the low prices obtainable for agricultural produce. It is unsound that the railage rates on agricultural implements should be increased at such a time as the present, and it would certainly appear desirable that an explanation from the Government should be called for. A table is given in the communication of the Chamber of Commerce, and in it there is an indication of the amount&#x2014;</p>

<p>But this is the very instance I want to demonstrate, how the Minister has failed to take care of the farmers&#x2019; interests. The increase in rates averages 46 per cent., notwithstanding that the railways have materially benefited by the smaller truck space used. This is the manner in which the farmers&#x2019; interests are being championed by the Minister. He is allowing his colleague, the Minister of Railways and Harbours, to stab Him in the back. I want also to refer to the subject introduced by the hon. member for Weenen (Mr. Abrahamson). It seems to me that if the Minister would give adequate attention to the question of a cattle market, and solve that problem, he would solve the key to the farmers&#x2019; difficulties to-day. If a good and secure market can be found for the cattle of this country, a long step is taken towards solving the problem of the lucerne farmer, and the maize farmer, and practically of all the farmers of the Union. What has the Minister done in the six years he has been in office to achieve this&#x003F; What is his cattle policy&#x003F; A nobler service he could not render than the solving of this question of an adequate market for the surplus cattle of this country. We hear a good deal about scrub. The scrub cattle only exist because there is no market for cattle. Scrub cattle are cattle which do not pay to feed, because there is no market. The Minister has given this question the attention it deserves. Let us take the problem of the maize farmers, and see how they would be helped by a solution of this cattle problem. Maize is fed to cows for milk, to cattle of all sorts for maintenance and beef, to pigs and fowls, and there is also a market for human consumption. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>In connection with the remark of the hon. member for Dundee (Mr. Friend) I want to ask the Minister to pay more attention to the advice of co-operative societies than to that of ordinary bodies, and to that of the agricultural unions. In the Transvaal, e.g., there are large co-operative societies in various districts with hundreds of members, while the agricultural unions in certain districts only count twenty or thirty members. If we gradually pay more attention to the board of co-operative societies then we know in each case that we have to do with people who take an interest in the industry concerned. The agricultural unions are only too frequently composed of members who in many respects only want to make political capital out of it, or who want to make a name as members of the board or some such thing. Where cooperative societies exist agricultural unions have also gradually become superfluous. The agricultural unions have preached co-operation, and as soon as it exists agricultural unions are no longer required in such a district. We have in the past, e.g., had a congress of agricultural unions about the price of wheat. It would <span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_1973"/>have been much more effective to invite the co-operative societies to such a congress. They are the people who are actually concerned with the matter, and are much better acquainted with the position, because they represent the wheat farmers in general. There is one point which I would like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, and that is the provision on the estimates for the purchase of stock. It has already appeared for quite a number of years on the estimates, and I understand that the amount is only for the benefit of people in certain districts. I want to ask the Minister to extend it a little, and also assist other districts. Some districts are poorer than other districts, but does this mean that the individuals in the districts who are poorer cannot be considered simply because the district as a district is not so poor&#x003F; Perhaps there are many cases in the districts that are less poor where people can be assisted and saved by getting a few oxen, but because the district is not very poor such people are not given an opportunity. There is a very serious test among the sheep in various parts of the country. We spend thousand&#x2019;s of pounds for fighting scab, but there is a pest which causes much more damage to-day, viz., the bluebottles. We must thank the Government very much for the apparatus for fighting this plague which is recommended in &#x201C;Boerdery in Suid-Afrika.&#x201D; But unfortunately there are many people who do not read it, and I think it would be much better if an expert were to go round with the apparatus to show it to the farmers. The bluebottles are a pest that costs the country thousands and thousands a year, and the farmers will be very thankful if the Minister will give him the attention in fighting the plague.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>In the commencement of January I asked the Minister of Agriculture a question with reference to hominy chop. Unfortunately the Minister did not reply to me. I will read out the question: &#x201C;How much hominy chop was there exported in 1927, 1928, and 1929&#x003F;&#x201D; That information the Minister of Mines and Industries subsequently gave in answer to a question by the hon. member for Reitz (Mr. Conradie), but I asked in addition how much hominy chop was rejected by the buyers, because it did not comply with the conditions of the Departments. I understand that much of the hominy chop was rejected overseas because it did not comply with the certificates that the officials in Durban gave in respect of it. I would like to know from the Minister whether that is so. It is said that the officials did not make the usual inspection that ought to have taken place. The Minister shakes his head, but there was a falsifying of hominy chop and accordingly we lost the market. In 1928 the value of the hominy chop exported was &#x00A3;1,401,000. That was of the greatest importance to the maize farmers in South Africa, but on account of the officials not making proper investigation the hominy chop was impure by sawdust and it was rejected by buyers on the other side. It is a very serious matter because in that way we almost lost the whole market. The Minister gave as a reason for the market becoming so poor that it was the bad times, but I understand that it is not due to the bad times, but to frauds, that the export has so diminished. The department says that they are only obliged to see that there is not too much damp in the hominy chop, but that beyond that they have nothing to do with it. I should like the Minister to tell us if that is so. We expected that our export of hominy chop would much increase owing to the German Treaty because it was prophesied that we should be able to export millions of pounds worth to Germany, but that information was wrong because the exports have much decreased. In 1926 we exported &#x00A3;67,000 worth of hominy chop, in 1927 &#x00A3;336,000, and in 1928 &#x00A3;1,401,000. Last year the export decreased very much, and I understand that this year practically nothing has been exported. I should like to hear that the Minister will take action if the inspection by officials is not adequate. Hon. members will understand that if the Government gives a certificate that people overseas rely on that certificate, but when they find that a certificate is unreliable they will attach no further value to it, and will not want to buy any more. The result is that we lose the market, and it will be difficult and take a long time to regain the market. It is especially of importance to the maize farmers because the price of maize is so low, and they got an additional income out of the hominy chop.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Borlase) criticised the Government from beginning to end for having done nothing for the farmers according to him. Hon. members will have to admit that the Government has done more for the farmers than any pervious one. Did not the Government protect the sugar farmers and the stock farmers, and has not the Government now once more protected the grain farmers&#x003F; Hon. members now say that the bonus on beef has been stopped, but various members have already shown that that bonus did not go into the pockets of the farmers. Do hon. members now wish ns to continue benefiting the middleman, because that is the only object of their criticism&#x003F; We are going through a depression, and the farmers are suffering, but in the opinion of experts the Government is not responsible for the bad state of affairs. In any case, the position in other parts of the world is much more unfavourable than in our country, but it is clear that the Opposition is trying to make capital even out of the depression. We feel that we can be thankful to the Government for what they have done. The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) said that the present Government had increased the customs duty on implements.

<p>One does, however, expect commonsense from a member of Parliament. The hon. member knows that he is talking nonsense. I hope the Government will do all it can for the maize farmer, because we often have to sell our maize under production costs. We have heard a great deal of criticism to-day from hon. members opposite, but there was not a single suggestion that the Government could accept. One member constantly contradicts the other. When the Minister of Agriculture introduces something into the House it is something constructive in the interests of the farmers, and the world outside, and also members of the S.A. party admit that this Government has done much for the farmers, and if they take an interest in the future of our farmers, then they ought to strengthen the hands of the Minister. If there is one thing that we must not debate on political lines it is agriculture, but from the speeches we have heard from the opposite side it has clearly appealed that they want to make party capital out of these things.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOCKLY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to an item on the Estimates of &#x00A3;11,000 odd. I understand from the reply of the Minister given to members some time ago that about &#x00A3;8,000 was spent in the purchase of 124 sheep I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied with that state of affairs. I certainly am not. The position is this, that we have been spending for some considerable time a whole lot of money in buying sheep from Australia. They have been at the disposal of our experts, the best men in the land to advise the Minister on the breeding of these sheep. It seems to me that it would have been ten times better if we could have sold &#x00A3;8,000 worth of sheep instead of buying them. We were told that these had been bought because the department wanted a certain quality of wool. We are bringing stud sheep into this country costing a lot of money and I am not at all satisfied that we are getting adequate value. In years past, we had sheep, cattle, and horses sold at our agricultural colleges which would have been very helpful in assisting the farmers to get blood stock in the country. A deputation awaited on the Minister in order to get help for the goat farmers by putting a goat expert at their disposal. The Minister turned it down and said he had put a man at their disposal who was not used. The expert who was placed at the disposal of these men was put there at an unfortunate time of sever drought. The farmers in those days were not so well equipped with motor cars as they are to-day, with the result that they were not able to avail themselves fully of the services of this man. I think the goat farmers should receive more assistance than they have been given in the past, when much more attention has been paid to the needs of the sheep farmers. Now in regard to export, we should confine ourselves to the raising of pure-bred lambs, which we can produce in many thousands. We have a fixed type of lamb in the Persian which we can export. Why not find out the best time of the year to send these lambs overseas&#x003F; But we must be persistent in our efforts to build up an export trade, and the department should not send over a consignment of lambs and then forget all about them. I now want to take exception to what the Minister said regarding the remarks of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. Kayser). The Minister evidently thought the hon. member had a political motive in bringing the matter of sour oranges up, but it is the duty of hon. members to point out when they do not agree with the Minister. If the Minister is so saturated with politics that he thinks there is a political motive at the back of everything members say, he should not imagine that everybody else thinks in the same way. It is our duty to point out when we think the Minister is wrong, and the Minister should appreciate that. If there is any member in this House without political bias, it is the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North). I now wish to refer to the grievous injury which has been done to the orange industry. A greater harm could not be done to that industry than the permission which the Minister gave to allow the export overseas of sour oranges. What hope have we of ever building up a decent orange trade in view of the tremendous competition from other countries&#x003F; We can see that during the coming season it will be a hard job for these men to make ends meet. In the face of his co-operative bodies and his technical experts and the good he should do to this country, he, the Minister, allows sour oranges to leave this country. It is an industry he should rather have fostered and encouraged.</p>

<p>I just want to reply about the export of the so-called sour oranges. I said that I regretted this matter had been brought up. No one possibly regrets it more than the producers of the fruit, themselves, the chairman of the citrus <span class="col_3805-3806" refersTo="page_1975"/>exchange expressed himself as follows, about the debate which took place here recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You all know the matter was debated in Parliament&#x2014;an unfortunate debate&#x2014;and I want to make it clear that the exchange was in no way responsible for having the question brought up in the House. We are only growers &#x2014;not party politicians&#x2014;and I cannot think of any greater disservice to the industry than that a commercial question affecting our interests and farming should be the subject of a debate and vote in Parliament on political party lines.</block>

<p>Why do hon. members constantly bring up this matter&#x003F; I hear that the &#x201C;Star&#x201D; even sent a special reporter to White River because a vote of censure was to be moved on the Minister. There were only four votes in favour of it; the majority stood by what I had done. But what would the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Mr. Hockly) say if we laid down that only scoured wool should be exported and not coarse wool. Why should we, if sour oranges are properly packed and marked, prevent them being exported&#x003F; Why should we only benefit one section of the population&#x003F; We must find a market for all our produce. A deputation from the fruit exchange came to me and after I had explained the matter they went away satisfied. After what Capt Bartley said hon. members ought to be satisfied. They are certainly not speaking on behalf of the exchange. The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) again represented that we should make guano cheaper, but at the same time he admitted that the commercial value was greater than what it was sold for. The value is about &#x00A3;15. I want to point out to the hon. member that if we reduce the price the demand will be so great that the guano will not remain only in the parts he is pleading for, because other parts will want it as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member wants to keep it here in the interests of the wheat farmers. If the hon. member for Caledon can induce the commercial world to find the &#x00A3;22,000 that the country makes out of it the Minister of Finance will certainly be prepared to consider the matter. We must have revenue. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. Bekker) advocated compulsory cooperation for the chicory farmers. I think they are more protected than any other class of farmers, and if he were to introduce a motion in the House compulsory co-operation in their case would certainly be defeated. Then he pleaded for white labour at the agricultural schools. We are trying it at Glen, and I hope to extend it gradually to other schools. The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Borlase) might make the speech he did at Durban possible, but I do not think the members of this House treat it seriously when he says that all branches of agriculture have been a failure. The number of sheep has increased in five years from 20 million to 42 million. That means nothing to him. The number of cattle has risen from 9 million to 11 million. The production of butter has increased to such an extent that instead of an importing, we have become an exporting country. The same thing applies to cheese. The poultry industry has tremendously increased. The reason the prices of produce are low is on account of world conditions. He spoke about high tariffs, but this Government has decreased them by &#x00A3;1,500,000. He says that we ought to find a market for our cattle. Is that not the duty of the farmers&#x003F; He has presumably not read the report of the Board of Trade and Industries. After thorough investigation of cattle farming they have recommended that if the cattle farmers co-operate properly the Government ought to support them. The farmers, however, have not yet come to the front in this connection, and if the hon. member is so eager he should start an organization in Natal. The hon. member for Lydenburg (Mr. de Souza) said that I should pay more attention to the co-operative societies than to the agricultural unions. I think that I will just use my commonsense, and carry out the work of the department as in the past. Then the hon. member once more dealt with the bluefly pest, we are still experimenting with an insect with attacks and destroys the bluefly, but it will still be necessary to continue the experiments. South Africa is very liable to insects and we must enquire carefully whether by letting the insect lose on to the bluefly we shall not possibly be producing a greater pest than the bluefly. The hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) spoke about hominy chop, and said that the department was negligent, and had issued erroneous certificates. That is not so. We have now consulted the merchants, and prepared regulations under which there are two kinds that are exported at present, the one is only exported as fodder for stock, and the other only as hominy chop. It is not true that we have lost the market through neglect. We have not lost the market.</p>

<p>The Minister has had a gruelling to-night from all sides. His only friend seems to be the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) who says he has done well in regard to poultry. I am glad this industry is growing, and that the egg-laying tests show a profit. I rise to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the serious expenditure he has incurred without showing a proportionate result. The Argentine farmers are rather astonished to see what a large amount a country like South Africa with a small population, expends on agriculture. The total agricultural vote is &#x00A3;1,250,000 and travelling and subsistence about &#x00A3;110,000.

What value are we getting for this&#x003F; The number of stock inspectors has gone down, indicating that the country is being freed from scab, but the costs for less inspectors have gone up; I believe the Minister was told recently that a man reported scab and an inspector was asked for to come out to see the sheep. For telephoning instead of writing the man was fined &#x00A3;5. The man was so annoyed that he complained because other sheep in that district infected his stock, and he estimates 20,000 sheep are infected with scab.

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. McIlwraith) is rather difficult to satisfy. He said the other day that the farmers were getting more and more lazy, and now he says that the farmers are having such a bad time that they cannot make a living. The hon. member is an authority on all matters, but I do not think we need give much attention to what he says. I am glad of what the Minister said in connection with the fighting of bluebottles, and I am certain that the farmers are also thankful for the help that the department is giving to eradicate or at any rate to diminish them. Then I want to point out to the Minister that the position in the districts of Van Wyksvlei and Carnarvon is very serious owing to the drought. Some farmers are already trekking, and if we do not get rains within a month the majority of the farmers will possibly have to trek later on. I hope and trust that the Minister, as in the past, will in conjunction with the Minister of Railways, give facilities for trekking with cattle by means of the railway. I do not know whether the Minister has already received an official notice, but the farmers are engaged in preparing a petition asking for these facilities. As for the regulations, the Minister knows that the farmer cannot trek if they do not say beforehand where they want to go to. That is right because the danger otherwise exists that there may be a sudden accumulation of sheep at places where there is only a little grazing. That is, however, only the case in a large general drought, but we have to do with a drought which is isolated, and there is therefore no danger of accumulation. Therefore I think the Minister can suspend this regulation, at any rate temporarily. That regulation is only necessary when many farmers are trekking. By this I only mean to refer to the cases where the farmers trek from one clean area to another, and not of course to areas where scab prevails.</p>

<p>As the representative of the King Williamstown division which has come into the limelight to-night, I would like to make an explanation regarding the presence of scab in that district. The difficulty regarding scab lies in the fact that there are relatively very few large European-owned flocks with a very large number of native-owned flocks varying in number from 15 to 20 per flock to 300 per flock. There have been a number of outbreaks of scab among native <span class="col_3809-3810" refersTo="page_1977"/>owned sheep. The need is not so much for tightening-up the inspection by outside officials, but increasing the number of ordinary inspectors working in the district. It is utterly impossible for the present staff of inspectors to examine the large number of flocks in the King Williamstown district. Owing to the fact that there is very little fencing in the native area of the division, the sheep intermingle, and while the natives do their best&#x2014;for they appreciate the importance of keeping their flocks clean&#x2014;it is impossible to free the district from scab unless there are more inspectors. All the same there are not 20,000 infected sheep in the district. Recently an officer of the Agricultural Department made a survey of the Border from East London to Cathcart That officer has submitted a report to indicate the lines upon which a cure for our troubles might be effected, and what investigations are required for the border districts. He refers to the farming community being keen, progressive and intelligent, and only too willing to co-operate with the department in making that one of the best of the wool areas. He goes on to state the urgent need of the coastal areas for a botanist, and for a botanical survey of the indigenous grasses. You have any amount of grass there, but it is lacking in nourishing quality. He suggests it should be in next September, and stresses the necessity for a detailed extension advisory campaign, all arrangements could be made through the Border Farmer&#x2019;s League at Kei Road. The matter of liver disease in lambs requires investigation as well as a survey of indigenous poisonous grasses. The Minister&#x2019;s officer agrees that the Border area is one of great importance as regards wool growing and dairying. I hope it will not be necessary for any other member of the border constituencies to ask the Minister to give some attention to the needs of these districts.</p>

<p>I have been wondering whether there was anything I could say which would have the slightest effect on the mind of the Minister to impress upon him the seriousness which exists in respect to the cattle farming industry. I find it is all the more difficult through what has fallen from the Minister of Finance, who has told us that the cattle farmer has nothing to complain of, and the Minister of Agriculture, who assures us that he is getting more from his cattle today than he did before he became a Minister. All I can say is that these two Ministers are living a sheltered existence, and their experience is not borne out by the farmers of South Africa as a whole. The cattle industry has never been in a worse position than to-day. It may possibly impress the Minister what the importance of the position is when he bears in mind that the surplus cattle of the Union is 600,000 per annum over the demand. Now what is to become of these animals&#x003F; Again the farmers&#x2019; income in South Africa has fallen this year not far short of &#x00A3;25,000,000, which is easily proved by a reference to this year&#x2019;s output and prices compared with those of last year. The farmers&#x2019; income is falling, and the public revenue will shortly begin to fall at the same rate. In the course of 12 months the position will be very much worse than it is to-day. But we have an unique opportunity of placing the farmer in such a position that in 12 or 18 months&#x2019; time things will be very much more comfortable for him than they are at present. We have this annual surplus of 600,000 head of cattle, we have also the fact that our local markets are saturated, and yet notwithstanding this there is a world shortage of beef, and with this condition of affairs in South Africa, and with the demand for beef on the other side of the world, we are doing nothing whatever to get into that market. Here is the world crying out for an article which we can supply, and we cannot get the Minister to take, I won&#x2019;t say a sympathetic interest&#x2014;we cannot even get him to take an intelligent interest in the matter. The Nationalist papers say that the speeches made by the Right Hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) and myself on this subject are merely political speeches. What hope have we got when we treat a subject vital to the welfare of the farmers and our speeches are received in that way&#x003F; What is the effect of this inaction&#x003F; The farmers of South Africa, wherever they are in touch with the rail, or motor transport, are now getting rid of their beef cattle as fast as they can, and are going in for dairying, because it is the one thing in the cattle line for which they can find a market. But their market is confined practically to one firm, and that is Nestl&#x00E8;s. Nestl&#x00E8;s have stepped in at a critical time, and their factories afford an outlet; but the very fact that the farmers are paying the whole of their attention to the development of the milk side of their industry, to the neglect of beef, carries with it a grave danger. There cannot be an unlimited demand for condensed milk, and as soon as these factories reach the limit of their output and demand, we shall have the same re-action here as has been experienced in Australia. We have the cattle in South Africa to-day, a large number of which are ready for export. I should say if I were asked what are the difficulties in getting into the market that the sole difficulty is the Minister of Agriculture. I know of no other problem which cannot be overcome but the Minister&#x2019;s determined obstinacy. The Minister should try and realize that he has a number of alternatives by which he could help. The first is the preservation of meat which he has done all he could to stop. Then there is the adoption once more of the bounty system. The Minister has been sneering at this now for the last six years, and while he has been sneering, the farmers have been suffering. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>No, I cannot accept it. We have now been sitting the whole afternoon and the same thing is said over and over again in connection with cattle farming. I have repeatedly explained the matter, but hon. members, nevertheless, repeat it again. I do not think it necessary therefore to accept this motion.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to ask the Minister to withdraw from the position he has taken up on the ground that this Parliament is rapidly becoming a farce. We have to remember that the membership of this House has increased, and if the Government think it is a fair thing to ask the House to pass one vote a day, I think they are sadly mistaken. I have no recollection in my experience of the estimates going through at such a rapid rate, and I say it is not fair. There are a lot of things members would like to discuss, things which cannot possibly be discussed, especially in view of the method of selection of members speaking. I say that mechanically it cuts out the discussion of various points in connection with this and other votes in regard to people who have a particular point of view. The Government has no right to ask members of this House to sit here night after night. This is legislation by exhaustion with a vengeance, and it is up to hon. members who may not be sitting on the Government side of the House to protest in the strongest possible manner. And we have a right to appeal to members sitting behind the Government to support that in insisting that a fair thing is a fair thing, and members have a right to have these things more seriously and completely discussed than can possibly be done under the time limit imposed.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to remind the Prime Minister that when the suspension of the eleven o&#x2019;clock rule was moved by him some time ago, he said that the object was not to keep members here until long after eleven o&#x2019;clock, but that, if any matter was under discussion which might be ended by sitting a little longer, the House should sit a little longer. It was on that understanding and in that spirit that the motion was accepted by the House. I remind the Prime Minister that that was the spirit in which we accepted it, and in which we wish to act. There is no intention to delay the Estimates. The Estimates, in fact the business of the House and of this committee, have been going forward very expeditiously, more so than at any other time. It is the intention of hon. members on this side of the House and on the other side of the House, not to prolong the session unduly. We want to get to the end of this session within a reasonable time. I do not think any object is served by these late night sittings. Last night we were sitting until twelve o&#x2019;clock, and we have been working the whole day, and we are continuing to sit until well after eleven o&#x2019;clock to-night. Members are exhausted and their tempers get frayed and it really does not help the business of the House. In those circumstances, I ask the Prime Minister not to make us sit longer than we have already. It is well past eleven o&#x2019;clock. I do not think we really expedite business in that way. I hope the Prime Minister will carry out the undertaking which was accepted by all of us at the time, that the House by suspending the eleven o&#x2019;clock rule would not be asked to sit unduly late and prolong the discussion so late, which makes the work of the House impossible.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should, of course, be very glad if I could meet hon. members opposite, but then they must show that they are really not dragging out the work of the House unnecessarily. It is true that I said that it was not the intention in the suspending the 11 o&#x2019;clock rule to act unreasonably towards the House, but that I wanted to put the Government in the position that when some matter or other could be properly disposed of when we got to 11 o&#x2019;clock, we ought not to postpone it to the following day, and start again from the commencement. We have now been debating this point since three o&#x2019;clock. I have been here almost constantly, and have followed the debate, but what have we now found&#x003F; Quite half of the criticism from the opposite side was all a rechauff&#x00E9; of stale food, things which have been repeatedly debated over and over again, and not merely once or a few times in the past. Half of it amounted to nothing which could be at all useful, and the criticism was only intended in the first place to find a kind of pleasure in the sort of criticism which they think is unpleasant to the Government, and I also say, without the least doubt, a great deal of time has been wasted. I now ask the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) to show me one single point which has been raised during the last hour or two in connection with which further information is necessary. They cannot mention it. Then I say that we must put an end to the debate. If we adjourn now we shall only give another opportunity to-morrow further to waste the time of the House. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) states that he has had no opportunity of saying something he was anxious to say, but he has spoken over and over again. What is the new thing he wants to say now&#x003F; If he has anything new to say then let him speak.</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>This vote covers many different subjects and, therefore, in the past it has frequently been suggested that the items in this vote should be taken seriatim. The Agricultural Vote has never hitherto passed through committee in one day. I do not agree that there has been a waste of time by endless repetitions from this side of the House. Some of the most important work of the country comes under the aegis of the Minister of Agriculture, and the Prime Minister does not seem to realise that there are quite as many speakers on this vote on the Government benches as there are on the Opposition side. When the hon. member for Ermelo rose to ask for the adjournment, several members on the Government benches jumped up to speak. It is really an outrageous charge to make, that obstruction has come from this side of the House. I do not know whether the comments from his side are upsetting him so much that he wishes to stifle discussion from the Government as well as from the Opposition benches. The request to defer the discussion of the vote until to-morrow is a perfectly reasonable one. The remarks of the Prime Minister that he will keep us here until 8 o&#x2019;clock to-morrow morning are an invitation for us to obstruct. Five late night sittings a week and stifling discussion are making a farce of Parliament.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#madeley">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>If I understand that the Prime Minister suggests there is general obstruction, and I am participating in it, then I say that that is an untrue statement. The Prime Minister accused me of speaking over and over again, but I have spoken less than ten minutes on this question. The Prime Minister, however, is never in a position to judge whether there is obstruction or not. He is generally outside and comes in on occasions like this. I strongly object to the Prime Minister accusing hon. members of obstructing, when he has not the slightest opportunity of discovering whether they are doing so or not. The agricultural vote is a most important one. I have never known in the whole of my experience of Parliament of any other Government which has made such a use of its deadweight majority as in this case to force through their measures.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Chairman I draw your attention to Rule 62 (2)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A member whilst present in this House shall not converse aloud and shall not, during a debate read any book, newspaper, document or letter, except in connection with the business of such debate.</block>

<p>I ask you if the Prime Minister is in order in reading a book. We have submitted to this times without number; a debate arises in the House, the Prime Minister ignores everything that is said, leans back, and reads a book. I think I am correct in saying that the House is tired of this discourteous treatment.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear that that is the rule, but it has been allowed very often to hon. members, and I may say to hon. members on both sides on the front benches, to make use of books during debates, and to read them which are in connection with the work before the House; it is very difficult for any person in the chair to know whether these books are in connection with the work before the House or not.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">POCOCK</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but I do not fully understand the position. It is perfectly clear that it must cause grave concern to everyone interested in the subject. It is now found necessary to employ another seven experts to give advice on this question. The staff has increased by eleven, and the vote has gone up some &#x00A3;3,000. The whole of the expenditure has increased under this particular head, and I would ask the Minister if he would state whether any of this soil survey has taken place in connection with the new irrigation works. A statement was made some years ago that a part of the time of the staff was devoted to land coming under irrigation works, and it was proposed to employ further officers under the proposed irrigation scheme. I would like the Minister to indicate what surveys have been made and whether they include these new irrigation schemes, and it would be interesting if, in view of the vast sums spent on these works, the Minister would give us some report as to the value of the land of which a survey has been made. This question is of great interest and must prove of great value to the country. In view&#x2019; of the large increase, I think the Minister should make a very full statement to the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steytler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEYTLER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like just to add a few words about erosion. The Minister must not blame me for talking on it again, but it is an important matter, and I see that there is only &#x00A3;1,000 down on the estimates for it. I do not now want the Minister to say how the money will be spent, but I do want to point out that &#x00A3;1,000 is only a drop in the bucket for the combating of so great a danger. Sometime ago I think I saw in the papers that the Minister intended to convene a congress to discuss that question. It would possibly be the correct thing that, e.g., the farmers of every district should send a delegate and that public attention should be called to this great problem. I can assure the Minister that my constituency Burghersdorp feels very strongly on the matter, and that the people there are doing everything they can to stop erosion. I want to invite the Minister to come and see what we are doing there, and I shall be very glad if he can send his officials to advise us. When he sees what is being done there the Minister will agree that we ought to encourage the people, and we shall possibly even have to go so far as to give them a subsidy. Then there is another matter, and I am sorry to have to speak about that as well, but I have received a special mandate from the farmers in my district to introduce a motion in connection with the matter. I will not move it now, because I know that it will not be passed. It is in connection with bluefly, which is one of the greatest plagues of the sheep farmers. I may say that I think it is a worse pest than scab ever was. On various occasions I have already received instructions to bring up the matter for debate, and to move that, the Minister or the Government should make it compulsory to eradicate the bluefly. I know that the Minister is against compulsion because his argument will be that there are certain parts which are not troubled with bluefly, and that it would be unreasonable to make them suffer owing to compulsion. I know that the Minister has made it compulsory to destroy carrion. That assists a great deal, but I want to urge that if there is no time this session then at any rate next session legislation should be introduced to attack the matter in the same way as has been done with jackal proof fencing. Where in the district the majority of the farmers ask for compulsion to fight the bluefly then let it be done. It amounts more to co-operation and is no longer compulsory, just as fencing amounts to co-operation. Let the Minister introduce a Bill of that sort so that the farmers can fight bluefly, because if at present one farmer fights it, possibly his neighbour does not, and then all his work is in vain.</p>
