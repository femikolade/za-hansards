<p>We have been taken entirely by surprise this afternoon. We saw on the order paper that the first order was for the House to resume in committee of supply on the Mines and Industries Vote. For some reason&#x2014;no doubt good&#x2014;that vote cannot be taken this afternoon, and we come to something without hon. members having had the slightest warning that they would come to it&#x2014; the Posts and Telegraphs Vote. There are a number who, when that comes on, expect <span class="col_3985-3986" refersTo="page_2065"/>to take part in the debate, and to raise points, but they are not prepared this afternoon. We prepare our discussions in advance. I hope the Prime Minister will move that progress be reported and leave asked to sit again. Take the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley), he did not know. I suggest we go on wtih the Dairy Industry Control Bill, which, I understand, hon. members are prepared to discuss.</p>

<p>I want to point out that it is not at all unusual when the House is in committee on the estimates that a vote should stand over. I understand that certain hon. members were informed that Vote 35 would stand over, but apparently there was a misunderstanding, and hon. members were under the impression that the order would stand over. Hon. members will see that if we do that then towards evening we shall not have enough work. When we are in committee on the budget hon. members must be prepared to debate any vote. I am sorry that apparently a misunderstanding arose, out if we comply with hon. members&#x2019; request we shall get into a greater difficulty than by going on with the next vote on the estimates.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is perfectly true we sometimes pass over one vote, but the vote we are passing over is Mines and Industries, the debate on which might be expected in the ordinary way to last for several hours, and it is certainly one of the most important votes. It is a question only of a misunderstanding. We did not know the Posts and Telegraphs Vote was coming on. I was reading through the report of the Postmaster General. The danger is if that vote is taken now it will not be amply debated. I would suggest, if the committee will agree, that the Prime Minister will move accordingly, and that we proceed with the Dairy Industry Control Bill.</p>

<p>I must confess I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). It is not right, but it is a fact, that we live from hand to mouth nowadays, and we are kept going with our noses to the grindstone from morning to night, and to such an extent that we prepare for the day, and not the next day. Although we have the material ready, I know I have, we have not had it ready marshalled; for that reason I support the hon. member, so as to get something like a prepared debate on this, that or the other question. After all, there is nothing gained. If the Prime Minister will be agreeable to take some of these Bills now we can proceed again with the estimates to-morrow. That is the fact. We come along prepared to-day for the mines vote, and we have got that material ready. Now you suddenly spring upon us something for which we are not ready.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>General charges in the department, telegrams, telephones and postal. There is no intention whatever to reflect upon the Minister, or upon the department. One appreciates that he is new to office. This point has been raised for years, and so far we have not succeeded in impressing upon the Government that a change in their policy is desirable. We observe that the total turnover in the department for the year 1928-&#x2019;29 is &#x00A3;4,072,220. It shows a gross profit of &#x00A3;681,858, and, after deducting the cost of loans, pensions and contributions to various other funds, it leaves a net profit on the whole of the department of &#x00A3;99,168. When we dissect this it is at least interesting, and the Postmaster General in his report points out that they have had considerable extension, and that he regards the result as satisfactory. Of course we do not look upon this department as a money-making one. It is regarded, and I think rightly, as one of the service departments. No taxpayer would look for this profit of &#x00A3;100,000. But when we come to analyse this report we do not find that it is quite as represented. The increase over the previous year, the increase in the total turnover, is &#x00A3;130,683. In order to secure this increase the additional cost has been &#x00A3;112,700. or pretty nearly 90 per cent, of the increased revenue. For this increased expenditure no sound reason can be shown. There can be no sound reason why the expenditure should have gone up by &#x00A3;112,000. There is another feature in this report. We do not find sufficient details. We do not find a comparison with the previous year&#x2019;s report, and that is a very great weakness in any report, because if you are going to look at the position of any year there is no comparison so valuable as that of the previous year. Apart from the increased expenditure for this small increased turnover, when we come to the personnel employed in this service, <span class="col_3987-3988" refersTo="page_2066"/>we find that in the previous year we employed 12,805 persons, but in 1928-&#x2019;29 we employed 13,182 persons. So I think this goes to show that the increase in the work was not commensurate with the increased expenditure, and it is consequently bad business to show such a large increase in the personnel. We can understand that a certain amount of the increased expenditure will be caused by ordinary increments, but that would not account for the large amount of the increase. When we see this increase in the personnel we are justified in asking what all these new people are doing. There is no increase of work that warrants any increase in personnel, because a department of this character can well do this small amount of increased turnover without increasing the personnel at all and to increase it to this extent is unquestionably absurd. When we come to the results of the Posts and Telegraphs service we find that their total revenue is &#x00A3;2,500,000. This shows a remarkable position, in view of a loss of &#x00A3;330, and although the income has increased, there is a natural loss shown which I cannot trace in previous years. Consequently there seems to be no justification at all for pointing out to the country that the extension and trading of the department is satisfactory. The point I want to make is that the charges throughout the service are too high. We have traces of war charges that should have disappeared long ago. It is not as the Minister mentioned some time ago, a case of a penny here and threepence there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Is there any business that has come down to pre-war rates?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>At any rate I know of no business that is deliberately maintaining rates. It is only a policy of reduced prices that will develop a department such as this, and I maintain that the usefulness of the department is being checked by maintaining these charges which are for the most part war-charges. There is another section of the department which I want to deal with. We have a big investment in telegraphs and telephones and it is remarkable that although you have only &#x00A3;1,500.000 income you show a nett profit of &#x00A3;99,958. If you are right in your principle that this is a service department, which is not run to show a profit, is not this profit unwarranted. Of &#x00A3;2,500,000 revenue in the posts and telegraphs department a loss of &#x00A3;330 is shown, but where only 1&#x00BD; millions revenue from telephones, etc., there is a profit of &#x00A3;99,958. I want to give some reasons for suggesting a reduction in prices to support my contention that if the charges to the public had been less there would have been a more satisfactory development. Attention has been drawn to this matter year after year. I refer to the immense increase in telegrams and overseas messages in the past year. On Christmas Eve the number of messages sent from Johannesburg was 60,000 and from Durban 30,000. All the other large towns have had a corresponding increase. Fifteen per cent. of these were Christmas greetings, of which the cost was reduced, I think from 1s. 3d. to either 1s. or ninepence. I submit to the Minister that but for this reduced cost, you would not have had this increase in telegrams in every large town. The increase works out at 22 per cent, which is a very large increase. But to what is it due&#x003F; I do not think it could be claimed to be due to the normal expansion of the department. It is an increase in the country which one expects the department will benefit by. I submit that that increase is brought about entirely by more reasonable charges. I submit further, that if these reductions of charges were effected right through this great service department there would be a corresponding increase in business. It is an easy matter to drive away business and to drive away the development of the department by retaining charges such as we have. Another reason why I have brought this forward is because the country is up against a stone wall in this department. We get the same replies from the department in 1929 as we got in 1926. They have got into a stereotyped reply, having, apparently, made up their minds to retain these charges and not give the department reductions or the public better value. I have another point I wish to make. When I go into Natal into a telephone box I am charged 1d. for a call. But when I step over the border into the Cape Province I have to pay 3d. It has been suggested that this is because one is under the control of the municipality, and the other under the control of the Government. I cannot accept that. I am informed, not officially, because I could not get it officially, by responsible people in Natal, that this is the best paying part of the service. If the hon. Minister is able to get that confirmed officially I think he will agree that the department wants looking over, at any rate, in this particular connection. There should be no delay in giving the reduced price that they have in Natal throughout the service throughout the Union. It is distinctly wrong that because one is a municipal service and the other a Government service that there should be a difference of 200 per cent. A further point I want to put before the Government is this. The Minister of Finance will agree that there has been a request from time to time for an Imperial penny postage. I have not advocated it, but I do see a way out. The reply from the Government indicates that there is no desire not to give this penny postage save that it will cost some &#x00A3;30,000 to &#x00A3;40,000 a year. The Government is apparently in agreement on the principle. In this increase in telegraphs, I think you will find there is an increase of 22 per cent, which must be because the price is lower. If you extend this right throughout the service you will not want an increase of 22 per cent., but if you get an increase of 5 per cent, you will get more money and extra profit which I submit will pay for the cost of the penny postage. If you get down to reasonable charges and go into the matter seriously and bring about an increase in the <span class="col_3989-3990" refersTo="page_2067"/>turnover of five per cent., that is less than a quarter of the reduction in telegraphs, then I submit you have the means of giving the country Imperial penny postage. It may not be practical politics at the present time, but it will mean a tremendous lot in sentiment and sentiment does count in these days. I want to show how the Government have treated the people in this country in their demands from time to time for a reduction in these charges. The Associated Chambers of Commerce have honestly tried to help the Government and to encourage them to reduce their charges and develop their department in order to make it more satisfactory both to the department and to the public. Resolutions which were passed in 1926, and 1927, 1928 and 1929 were on precisely all fours. They drew attention to the extraordinary anomaly in Government telephone charges at 3d. and the municipal charges at 1d. The Government in their reply said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Union tariff charges, and especially telephone charges, compare very favourably with those in most other countries.</block>

<p>I do not believe there is a country on the earth where you get a call for a 1d. in one province and where you have to pay 3d. in another. I do not think it exists.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>We have an explanation for that, and the hon. member has heard it very often.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I should be glad to have the explanation. I am informed there is more profit at 1d. charges by the municipalities than the Government makes out of a charge of 3d. This leaves one bewildered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The 3d. is only charged in call boxes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henderson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter whether you charge 3d. to a man in his office or in his house, but you should charge the man in the street 1d. The man who goes to a call box can least afford to pay the 3d. This is the continuation of the Government&#x2019;s reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The profit in the general account for the year 1928-&#x2019;29 is appreciably less than that reflected in the previous year and it includes, moreover, a large and indeterminable amount which represents sales of postage stamps used for revenue purposes. In any case, the net profit is too small to admit of any reduction, and a reasonable margin must be maintained to meet any unseen eventualities that may arise.</block>

<p>These are arguments which can only be met by further arguments. Then with regard to overseas postage, this is the reply of the Government and I am reading it because I want to show the nature of the Government&#x2019;s reply and the stone wall attitude of the Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimated that a reduction of postage on letters to the United Kingdom and British Dominions from 3d. to 1d. per ounce would now entail a loss of approximately &#x00A3;35,000 per annum which cannot at present be contemplated.</block>

<p>Of course, you cannot, so long as you tie up the department as it is. The reply goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection in Great Britain they still maintain a minimum letter rate of l&#x00BD;d. per ounce to British possessions and the rates to foreign countries are fixed by the International postage union at 35 centimes per ounce.</block>

<p>We have to bear in mind that when a letter weighs more than an ounce the postage to Great Britain is higher than it is to foreign countries. The last resolution states that the regulations relating to book post require revision. The department might concede these requests very gracefully without any loss of revenue, but with considerable benefit to the commercial community. I have never known the price of an ordinary commodity being decreased without a resultant increased demand, and I take it that the same rule would apply to the post office. For instance, if the cost of sending a telegram were reduced from 1s. 3d. to 1s. the department would probably make more money. So I plead for reasonable reductions in the belief that they would lead to an extension of business. I see no reason whatever why the department cannot extend its great sphere of usefulness. As it is, it is one of the great service departments of the state, and is of considerable credit to the country.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>I find it incumbent on me rather to increase the amount of the proposed reduction in the Minister&#x2019;s salary, not that I want to lower the Minister&#x2019;s standard of living, for a moment, but in order to enable me to draw attention to certain items of his policy which react rather disadvantageously to the general condition of things in the country, and incidentally that more particularly applies to his own department. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To reduce the amount by &#x00A3;2 from the item &#x201C;Minister, &#x00A3;2,500&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In order to draw attention (a) to the intensive unemployment caused by the general introduction of the automatic telephones; (b) his failure to increase the number of postmen to cope with the work; (c) the increase in the hours of female duties to 9 p.m.; (d) the discharge of artisans from the Public Works Department when unemployment is rife and increasing and (e) in order to call attention to the Minister&#x2019;s surrender to the Wireless Company of South Africa by issuing it a licence to operate at a terminal rate of one penny per word, and by decreasing efficiency by degrading the engineering branch. [After consulting Deputy-Chairman.] I understand from the Deputy-Chairman that my efforts to reduce the Minister&#x2019;s salary do not quite meet with his approval in the extensive form in which I have moved <span class="col_3991-3992" refersTo="page_2068"/>it, and that the Deputy-Chairman suggests that the motion is somewhat discursive. However, I hope that in the course of my remarks the Deputy-Chairman will allow me to make some reference to these points. The Deputy-Chairman has confined the terms of my reduction to the Minister&#x2019;s determination to introduce automatic telephones, as a general policy. I have consistently opposed the introduction of automatic telephones, not because I have any great objection to them as such, and not that I have said they have proved a failure, but owing to the peculiar circumstances of the country where you cannot provide alternate employment for those either displaced by or being prevented from obtaining employment by the introduction of automatic telephones. We have no right to introduce automatic telephones unless it can be shown that they are far superior to the best class of manual telephone exchanges. Let me urge this upon the commercial community who are in this House, that if they think for one moment, as I have heard commercial men who advocate the introduction of automatic telephones say they believe, they are likely to get their telephones very cheaply, all I can say is they are making a very big mistake indeed.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>Without contesting that for a moment, if they are not so superior as to warrant men and girls being thrown on to the street, you have no right to urge the introduction of automatic telephones. All the reports I have had from England, particularly where, during the last two or three years in the London areas they are introducing automatic telephones, state that there have been numerous complaints, and that they are very unreliable. The &#x201C;Daily Mirror,&#x201D; which stands, I understand, very high in the opinion of England as a news distributing agency, has constantly drawn attention to their unreliability, and compared them unfavourably with the manually-operated ones. Those who think they are going to get their telephones more cheaply when they become automatic are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. In no country in the world has the cost been reduced as a result of their introduction. Whatever argument may be used when the country is prosperous, surely that argument cannot be used now. In addition to that it must be remembered you do not get your automatic installation as cheaply as your manual. The Minister will no doubt tell us that the capital cost is at least twice that of manual telephones, and I have yet to learn that the period of activity of the automatic telephones is any longer. My engineering experience tells me their life will probably be shorter. In answer to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs intimated that the tenders they have accepted for the installations of Cape Town and Johannesburg would be approximately &#x00A3;750,000. The interest on that would be more than double our interest commitment on the capital cost of manual installations at both places of an equal service, and assuming, as has been argued, that you must save at least 50 per cent, of your personnel at the exchange, you still have 50 per cent, of that interest left which you are paying out as dead money. Taking &#x00A3;750,000 at 4&#x00BD; per cent., the annual interest is &#x00A3;33,750, one-half of which is more than sufficient to pay the year&#x2019;s salaries of the whole of the telephone staff of either one of those telephone exchanges. The net result is not an increase in efficiency to the commercial man or anybody else. The only advantage they get, and it is a doubtful one, is instantaneous release, and that you are open at once to another call. Demonstrations were given to show how you got connection in half the time of automatics with the manual. I tested it myself. In a number of three figures you cannot dial in three seconds, which is the average service on manuals, and you yourself are liable to make mistakes. The Minister may argue that as to the Port Elizabeth system&#x2014;and he may be reinforced by the hon. members who represent that constituency&#x2014; that community is perfectly satisfied. That is very natural, because they are making their comparisons, or rather their contrasts, with their experience of the old manual installation they had there, which was, admittedly, one of the most unsound ones it was possible to have &#x2014;it was old and water-logged&#x2014;and the whole service was wrong. But I make bold to state that if they had an up-to-date manual system there, instead of an automatic, they would be just as pleased, and they would have a large number of people earning a decent living engaged in operating it. You have the service growing, and it would take anything from three to five years to introduce the automatic. The estimates of to-day reflect the system on the terms of girls and men. May I say a word about an item of information which reached me, which astounded me&#x003F; When I was in the post in which the Minister is now, I was fortunate enough to be able to bring about a reduction in the hours, and a state of affairs where no girl in the post office was to work after 6 o&#x2019;clock. I want hon. members to try to imagine a Labour man boasting of making it impossible for girls to work after 6 o&#x2019;clock.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>Is that not the natural corollary of what I am discussing&#x003F; I found that they were working till nine, and on the principle of having to tread very gingerly indeed, I reduced their hours to 6 o&#x2019;clock. It did not mean a reduction of three hours a day, but their shifts were so arranged that they worked until 6 o&#x2019;clock. Now, I understand that the Minister has re-introduced the 9 o&#x2019;clock arrangement. I think it is most undesirable for a girl to be working in these places until 9 o&#x2019;clock, especially in the case of the small exchanges, where there is one man and one girl. There is also the general distaste one has for girls to be working at a time when they should be off duty. I did without it, and this work after <span class="col_3993-3994" refersTo="page_2069"/>6 o&#x2019;clock could be done without as far as the employment of girls is concerned. And the way in which the Minister brought it about, if my information is correct, is worse still, because I understand that the cupidity of the girls was appealed to, and that they were put on overtime. Hon. members know that the salaries which these girls get are not overwhelmingly good. They got used to working till 9 o&#x2019;clock by being paid overtime, and after they had got used to this shift, it was instituted as an ordinary shift. I want the Minister to deny this, because I should hate for a Minister, who claims to be Labour, though he cannot establish the claim, to have done such a thing as to introduce a 9 o&#x2019;clock rule for girls after another Minister had abolished it.</p>

<p>I merely wanted to know whether the Minister was in a position to make a statement in connection with the wireless broadcasting service in South Africa. I mentioned the matter under this vote last year, and he promised to make further enquiries during the recess. I dealt with the financial aspect of the undertaking, and some people who are interested in the service are afraid that the broadcasting would be stopped. As the Minister knows, there are also many complaints that the service is not answering its purpose, or, at any rate, that the promises originally made have not been fulfilled to a great extent. I felt that it was very undesirable that the monopoly for broadcasting in this country should be in the hands of a company which, to a great extent, also has a monopoly with regard to places of amusement. The fear exists that it will be so manipulated that they will give the public the service which will not conflict or injure the amusements which they provide for the public in other places. Another grievance which is felt by the Afrikaans-speaking public is the little Afrikaans in the broadcasting service, a great portion of which amounts to Afrikaans. The way in which announcements are made is often in such poor Afrikaans that one prefers to close down the instrument. All the Afrikaans that there is, is, moreover, given when the people are tired of listening in; then a small bit of Afrikaans is added at the most inconvenient time of the evening. As the Minister is, to a certain extent, responsible and collects the money, I want again to ask him to go into the matter fully. It will be said that there are more English-speaking subscribers in the towns, but I do not believe that they know how many Afrikaans-speaking ones there are. In any case, a much greater use could be made of it on the countryside if the news were properly announced. I have met many people who say that they will buy a set when the broadcasting of the Afrikaans section is more satisfactory. Will the Minister enquire if we cannot have a kind of national broadcasting service&#x003F; There is great need in South Africa of an efficient service, and perhaps it is possible on the lines of the broadcasting service in England. There you have the British Broadcasting Corporation which has done a tremendous amount to make it a national matter of great educational value. A good service here may also be of great importance to the children and adults of the countryside. I would suggest that the Minister considers a possibility of making a semi-national service of it, like, e.g., the electricity commission, which is cheap enough to enable the farmers to make use of the service for educational purposes.</p>

<p>I want to bring up a matter in connection with the automatic telephone installations, but not on the same lines as the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley), because I think his objection is very similar to the objection raised to the introduction of railways, that they did away with primitive methods of transport. I want to raise an important matter. I asked a question in the House the other day as to whether it was a fact that the Government has entered into an agreement for the installation of automatic telephones in Johannesburg and Cape Town, without calling for public tenders, and the answer I got was that the Government had made an agreement with certain firms for the installation, over a period of five years, of automatic telephones in Cape Town and Johannesburg, at a cost of &#x00A3;750,000, without calling for public tenders. The explanation which the Minister offered was that, although they had not called for public tenders, yet they had asked for quotations from the only firms who could supply this particular kind of plant, and the Minister offered to show me the agreement. I am sorry I have not been able to see the agreement, but every morning all one&#x2019;s time here is occupied in select committee, and one has not the time to attend to anything else. But it is not the agreement that I want to attack. What I want to attack is that a contract of this magnitude should be entered into without calling for public tenders. I thought there was a regulation that contracts over a certain figure have to be submitted to tender, but apparently in a contract of this magnitude, it is possible to dispense with the usual formality. The Minister told me that he had asked various firms to quote, and that these firms were the only firms who could supply this particular plant. Well, I am informed by the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce&#x2014;who should know something about this matter&#x2014;that this is not the case; that, in addition to those manufacturers who were asked for quotations, there are three other well-known manufacturers, whose names I am prepared to give to the committee. I do not see why it should be a matter of secrecy. The names are, The Peel Connor Telephones, represented by the British General Electric Company; the Standard Telephone Manufacturing Company; and Ericsson&#x2019;s Telephone Company of England and Sweden, represented by a certain other company. My information is that there are several other telephone companies who have not been asked for quotations. I ask the Minister, what harm would it have done to give these other people an opportunity to tender&#x003F; If they were not in a position to supply this plant, I take it they would have replied to that effect, and if they were in a position to <span class="col_3995-3996" refersTo="page_2070"/>compete, their tenders would be rejected. This is a contract for &#x00A3;750,000 extending over five years. Until this question was brought up, I do not think anybody knew a word about it. It was done in the dark. I am not saying that there was anything wrong or improper, but I am criticizing the fact that the Government should be committed to a contract of this size without tenders being called for. Apart from giving these other people an opportunity of saying what they can do, it is a breach of treasury regulations, and I want to ask the Minister why it was done.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>We have heard a good deal this afternoon about the automatic telephones, and we wonder whether those people who are getting the automatic service have not already received many things. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley), moreover, says that those people will not get their telephones a penny cheaper. We should like the Minister to tell us whether automatic telephones will be cheaper than the present system. But my point is that I want to appeal to the Minister to bear in mind those thousands of farmers who have applied for telephones, and whose applications have now, for years, been delayed in the postmaster-general&#x2019;s office. I want to say at once that we appreciate what the Government has already done, viz., that thousands of lines have already been built during the past five years, but this does not detract from their great interest in the telephone and its development of the country, and, consequently, many more applications are being made. This is one of the things on which the farmer will never ask for any writing off, or in connection with which he will be in arrear with his payments, because the farmer knows that the telephone will be removed if he does not fulfil his obligations. It is, however, so valuable to the farmer to-day that he will never let it go that length. I understand that during the past five years about &#x00A3;500,000 has been spent on telephone lines in the Union, and if my information is correct&#x2014; I speak under correction&#x2014;then about &#x00A3;125,000 was spent on farm telephones, i.e., about one-quarter of the whole amount. All other money was used for the urban lines and main lines. We noticed in a photograph a few weeks ago how the Minister and the postmaster-general sat in the post office in Cape Town talking to Port Elizabeth. This was the first time that a through conversion took place with Port Elizabeth, and we observed that both were very much pleased with the connection. I should like to have a farmer photographed when he gets the telephone in his house for the first time, and I think if the Minister saw that photograph he would immediately comply with all the applications for farm telephones. I want to make an earnest appeal to the Minister to meet the farmers in this. Telephones are no longer a luxury to-day, they are just as necessary as motor-cars. I want to point out that the farmers, in many cases, only get their post once or twice a week, and that they live far away from the village and from the doctor, and if the Minister will try and put himself in that position, then he will certainly devote the greatest part of the &#x00A3;500,000 for those people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Henderson) in his appeal to the Minister to consider the reduction of charges. I think he has made out a strong case. You can post a letter in London to South Africa for l&#x00BD;d. but for the same service you have to pay 2d. in South Africa. I do not know if there is any sound reason for it. Perhaps the Minister would explain the matter. In regard to telephones, in Natal for many years past, people have paid 1d. whereas in other parts of the Union we have to pay 3d. I put this question to the Minister in January last with regard to both these charges. We ascertained then, and we know that a commercial man in Johannesburg pays &#x00A3;9 for 900 calls. For any calls thereafter he pays l&#x00BD;d. per call. The private individual pays &#x00A3;7 for 600 calls. That, in itself, appears to be very strange, why a man who has a store should pay &#x00A3;9 for 900 calls, and a man in a private house should pay &#x00A3;7 for 600 calls. Then we got an explanation of it which has puzzled me ever since I have had it. It points out that the calls are, as I have stated, &#x00A3;9 for a business man and &#x00A3;7 for a private house. Then the Minister goes on to explain&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This amount deducted from &#x00A3;9 leaves &#x00A3;3 7s. 6d., which is the ground rental for the telephone and associated apparatus and installation. Calls at 600 at l&#x00BD;d. amount to &#x00A3;3 15s. Deduct that from &#x00A3;7, it leaves &#x00A3;3 5s., which represents the ground rental for a residential installation. The differentiation is in favour of the householder and not of the business subscriber.</block>

<p>Let us go to school for a moment, and examine that. I am told that because I live in my house on the hill I pay &#x00A3;7 for 600 calls. Whether I exhaust them or not, the charge is still &#x00A3;7. The man in town pays &#x00A3;9, but not until he has exhausted 900 calls does he pay any extra amount. The Minister endeavoured to show me that the man in a private house pays less, and that he is not at a disadvantage contrasted with a man in business. That is one of the things which no one can understand. I have endeavoured to find out what was working in the mind of the Minister or of the gentleman who subtly supplied him with the information. I ask the Minister, and hon. members, to look at it this way. If a man goes into a store and buys something for &#x00A3;9, and another man buys something for &#x00A3;7, you are trying to convince me that the man who paid &#x00A3;7 for his calls gets off less than the business man. That is beyond my comprehension. I do not understand it. I do not see why a man should pay for his first 100, &#x00A3;1 3s. 4d. as against the man in an office who pays only &#x00A3;1. There is another matter to which I would draw attention. We find there is a figure set down in the estimates, a new item of &#x00A3;36,000 subsidy towards the Transcontinental Imperial Airway. If we refer to the item on page 192 of the estimates, we find <span class="col_3997-3998" refersTo="page_2071"/>an explanatory footnote which says that this &#x00A3;36,000&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">represents initial payment of 30 per cent, of first year&#x2019;s subsidy of &#x00A3;120,000. Further subsidies of &#x00A3;100,000, &#x00A3;80,000, &#x00A3;60,000 and &#x00A3;40,000 will be payable in respect of the second, third, fourth and fifth year, respectively, bringing the total amount up to &#x00A3;400,000.</block>

<p>I do not see where the other &#x00A3;64,000 for the first year&#x2019;s subsidy finds its place. It does not tell us here. It does not tell us where it is coming from. The first &#x00A3;60,000 is only portion of the first year&#x2019;s payment of &#x00A3;120,000. I think we should have a full explanation what the Minister means by a subsidy towards the Trans-Continental Imperial Airways. We have now an airway service every week from Cape Town, and vice versa to Cape Town, in order to meet the mailboat on its arrival, and in order also to get away mails by the Friday&#x2019;s boat. This is a very expensive service. Perhaps the hon. Minister will tell us how many letters or parcels, or whatever they are, are taken away on Monday on the arrival of the boat, to Port Elizabeth, East London, the Transvaal and other places, and what the cost of it is. Then I should like to ask what revenue we derive from it in return. Likewise, I should like similar information in regard to mails coming from the north to Cape Town. It seems to me from the little information I have got on the subject, that it is a very costly affair. Some people will get their letters in Johannesburg, it is true, late on Monday night or early on Tuesday morning, whereas the ordinary individual gets his letters and papers on Tuesday night. When the country embarks upon an expenditure of this nature, there must be some quid pro quo, some advantage to the country. This present arrangement, apparently, is only to the advantage of a few individuals, and this country has to pay this enormous sum in order to permit a few people to get their letters earlier than the ordinary individual. Of course, anybody can avail himself of the service by paying an extra fee, but is the country itself getting full advantage of the money spent&#x003F; I hope the Minister will give us the fullest possible information when he replies.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) has raised the question of automatic telephones. I knew nothing of the intention of instituting an automatic system. I so far agree with him as to say that I am in favour of calling for tenders. If the Government departments make more use of the tender system they will often save the state much money. What I feel, however, is that &#x00A3;300,000 is being here voted for automatic telephones in the towns while on the countryside there is a very great need for telephonic communication. I cannot see why this &#x00A3;300,000 should be spent in the towns while there are so many farmers who are not able to get a telephone, moreover, there are to-day hundreds of persons who work in the telephone exchanges, and they will of course have to be discharged if the automatic system is introduced. A number of them will be unemployed. I think this matter can stand over a few years longer, and I hope that the Minister instead of it will see that the farmers get better facilities from the Government. They do not want them gratis, and the state will get a good revenue from the lines that are built. I know of a case where a short line has to be constructed to connect a farmer with an existing line; he has been worrying for years, but he cannot get it. I hope the Minister will give attention to the matter of the farmers getting their rights.</p>

<p>I understand a notice has been served for the closing down of the post office at Thibet, district of Tarkastad, which is in my constituency. Although it has been there for very nearly 70 years. It serves one of the most progressive and up-to-date farming communities that we have in South Africa, and serious inconvenience would be caused if it were closed. I sincerely hope the Minister will cancel the order for its closing. At Queenstown, we have one of the best landing places for aeroplanes in the country, and we should like it to be made an official aerodrome for the aerial post. Its situation is unique and it would serve a very large area including Cathcart, Sterkstroom, Steynsburg, Molteno and Woodhouse, as well as a very large portion of the Transkeian territories. I thank the Minister on behalf of the population for erecting additional telephone lines in the Sterkstroom district. I want the Minister to do a little more and that is to have a linesman at Sterkstroom. At present if any of these telephone lines go wrong they have to send for a man to Queenstown, a distance of anywhere from 35 to 50 miles. This, I hope, the Minister will see will cause a considerable amount of unnecessary inconvenience.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset (Mr. Vosloo) spoke about house telephones, but I want to talk about telephones in my district. I have been doing so for years, and I have got one connection, and yet the state of affairs is still the same, that between Vryburg and Kuruman, two neighbouring villages, and Vryburg, and Schweizer Reneke there is as yet no direct telephonic connection. There is a connection by a detour, but no direct connection. My great complaint, however, is with regard to the countryside. Bechuanaland is a large, and extended area, and it can no longer be said that it is not occupied. It is fairly thickly populated to-day, and there are farmers who live 100 to 150 miles from the nearest village. What is the position of such a man and his family in the case of serious illness&#x003F; I believe that Bechuanaland is good enough for any man to live in and to make a living there, but the people are frightened away by bad communication. It has occurred there that a man has been seriously ill and sent for the doctor, but he has recovered or was buried when the doctor arrived. I admit that the Postmaster-General and his department are kindly disposed, and when I insist I get a few miles, but they should also bear the other districts <span class="col_3999-4000" refersTo="page_2072"/>in mind. When I get ten miles the district of Somerset, e.g., where there is already an extended telephone network, also has to get ten miles. I want to ask whether it is not fair for districts which have practically no communication to-day to be prepared a little. Let a little more be spent on those districts. The position with us is so serious that I appeal to the Government if they have to economize to start last on this vote. Telephonic connections throughout the Union are indispensable, but with us it is a matter of life or death. We must have them. Bechuanaland is still a few years in arrear of all other districts, and it ought not to be so. It is a magnificent country and I appeal to the Minister to help us.</p>

<speech by="#madeley">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg (Mr. S. D. de Wet) raised another very important feature with regard to the expenditure of public money on automatic telephone installations. His point was that the post office is allowed only a limited amount for capital expenditure, and obviously if an unduly large proportion of that amount is expended on automatic telephones, it is bound to react adversely on the countryside, as a smaller sum would be available for telephone extensions in the country. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) rather did me an injustice in suggesting that I was trying to be a reactionary in regard to telephones, but there is this to be said that all over the world this question of the wholesale introduction of labour-saving machinery is becoming a problem which is having a tremendous effect on labour. America, in fact, has opened an enquiry into the subject because it has been alarmed to find that no fewer than 3,000,000 people have been thrown out of work in consequence of the extended Introduction of labour-saving machinery. Personally I do not object to labour-saving machinery so long as it is used not to deprive people of employment, but to reduce the toil of people in work by reducing the number of their hours of labour. An agreement has been reached between representative employers and employees, in Cleveland, I think it is, so that in order to cope with the situation, to make the best use of labour-saving machinery and prevent people from being thrown out of work, they will reduce the hours of labour to five a day and have five working days a week. If they agree to that as a principle, they are going to work to that end. I want to use labour-saving machinery in the interests of the whole of the people, and not of a few. There is another matter with which I wish to deal, and that is the failure of the Minister to increase the number of the men engaged in postal delivery. The Minister may correct me, if I am wrong, but I am told that these had a longer round of delivery; instead of, as the work increases, making a few more do the work, they are worked harder. From my own personal observations&#x2014;and I took the opportunity of doing so when I was in office&#x2014;the postman&#x2019;s job is a very hard one indeed. He starts off with a haversack on his back of a tremendous weight, I think it is 30 pounds, and he has to climb up hills, footsore, weary, working all the day long delivering letters and often having to meet with the impertinence of some members of the public; he has a thousand and one difficulties, and is paid insufficiently at any time. I hope the Minister can reassure me on that point. If it is true that there are too few to do the work. I hope he will see the Public Service Commission and impress on them the necessity of their realizing that a Government department should at least have some claim to being humanitarian; that he will at once see that more are being employed. Another thing was the statement made by the Minister which alarmed me very much indeed in which he said he had entered into an agreement for seven and a half years to come with the Wireless Company of South Africa at one penny per word for telegrams&#x2014;the very thing about which I instituted arbitration proceedings. I wanted to recover &#x00A3;25,000&#x2014;a year&#x2019;s recovery at one penny per word&#x2014;which the department was losing through what I call, &#x201C;this iniquitous arrangement.&#x201D; The Minister has gone one further to make it considerably worse and to put the country under the disability of being &#x00A3;25,000 per annum to the bad. It is wrong and bad, and not looking after the interests of the public of South Africa. Whereas the average person has to pay a minimum of 1s. 3d. for every telegram of 12 words, the wireless company pays anything from 5d. to 1s., depending on the number of words of a telegram. We have to pay 1s. 3d. whether it is only three or four words, including the address. I am credibly informed the average message of the company is six words. The Minister has argued and may argue that you cannot have differential rates as between the Beam Company and the Cable Company. It is a fallacious argument, and all the more fallacious because of the merger which has taken place between the Cable and the Wireless people; it is to the detriment not only of South Africa, but to the whole British Commonwealth of Nations, which is in the grip of this merger. It has guaranteed a return to them which will make the mouth of every business man water if he could only see such a return on his business, big as it is. I want both sides of the committee to be cognizant of our being prevented from getting a revenue of at least &#x00A3;25,000 per annum&#x2014;which is constantly growing because of the increase of business. I want also to draw attention to the situation which is growing in the engineering branch. I find the Minister has so impregnated that branch with men who are not technical, not fully and properly qualified that he is making it a perfect, farce. Openings for our lads to be trained are becoming fewer and fewer, and they are being filled by clerical men. [Time limit.]</p>

It has been represented to me that five postmasters ranging from &#x00A3;700 to &#x00A3;900 per annum are in the larger cities, and they are very much underpaid, considering the large amount of business being done.

<p>I want to ask the Minister what his policy is with regard to the telephone system in Durban, the press of which is full of reports which go to show that the Minister has raised a feeling of uncertainty as to what his policy is. The telephone system in Durban is a municipal one, and so efficiently administered that not only are its charges less than in any other big centre in the Union, but it actually shows a profit. I make no claim for the accuracy of these reports, but I believe they are substantially correct; if they are wrong, the Minister can show where they are wrong. According to these reports the Minister has taken objection to the principle of municipal telephones, on the ground that they show a profit. Will the Minister let us know what his policy is in this regard&#x003F; I hope he has no intention of taking over the administration of the Durban telephone system as long as it can be shown that it is administered more economically than it could be by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot agree with hon. members who are so strongly opposed to the introduction of automatic telephones, which, in their opinion, would be injurious to the erection of telephones on the countryside. My view is that when automatic telephones have once been established in the towns it will mean such a great saving that the countryside will be all the sooner supplied with telephones. That is a fact because we take a second place to other countries in the establishment of automatic telephones. Other countries introduced it because it led to a saving. I want to congratulate the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on this step, but now I want to bring my own requirements to his notice. I have already, for several years, applied for certain telephone lines in the district of Laingsburg. Laingsburg is just as nice a country as Bechuanaland, only the people live closer together, but there are very few telephone lines. In some parts the people live a long way from a large village, and they are practically cut off entirely from the world. The lines which are particularly necessary are, e.g., from Danslaagte to Koringplaas, and another line from Anysberg to Sewefontein via Plathuis. Then the line from Muiskraal to Platriver is very necessary. I have repeatedly called the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this and promises are always made, but the matter is constantly postponed. I admit that my district has been very fairly treated on the whole, but these few lines are very necessary, and I want to bring them again to the Minister&#x2019;s notice.</p>

<p>I hope that the position of the Minister this afternoon, unsupported by his colleagues, is not an indication of his isolation in the party which he adorns. I want to refer to the ministerial telephones. It is somewhat difficult to follow the method which is adopted in the Minister&#x2019;s department, in recording Ministers&#x2019; telephones in the telephone directory. The first one is that of the Minister himself. In the private section of the telephone book he is described as the Hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. When I turn to the Prime Minister he is simply Gen. J. B. M. Hertzog. I notice that Gen. Kemp is styled in the same way, but the Minister of Lands is P. Grobler with no title at all, and the same applies to the Minister of Justice, who is simply called O. Pirow. When I turn to the Minister of Finance, he is styled the Hon. H. C. Havenga, and it is also repeated in Afrikaans. He is the only Minister treated in that way. When I come to the Minister of Railways and Harbours I see that he is down as the Hon. C. W. Malan, but his distinguished cousin is simply down as Dr. D. F. Malan. It is somewhat difficult to know why the whole title is not given to other Ministers as well as to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. A question was put to the Minister the other day asking what post is held by Mr. J. D. Renecke, and whether he is entitled to take an active part in politics, or in the work of a political party. The Minister said that J. D. Renecke is the chief inspector of postmen, and that he is not entitled to take an active part in politics. I have a pamphlet here, headed &#x201C;National Party, Pretoria West Provincial Council Election.&#x201D; It is addressed to the electorate of Pretoria West, and gives the main reason why Mr. de Vries was nominated, but I see that this pamphlet is signed " J. D. Renecke, Chairman of the National Party, Pretoria West branch.&#x201D; It is also signed by a second person who is a railway servant. What I want to ask the Minister, since he stated very definitely that this gentleman was not entitled to take part in politics at all, is, as to what steps the Minister has taken to see that this gentleman complies with the public service rules and regulations.</p>

He should have instituted enquiries to see what was behind it, and he could have found out what part this gentleman has <span class="col_4003-4004" refersTo="page_2074"/>taken. We know it is laid down very definitely that public servants shall not take part in politics, and I think it is a very wise provision indeed. The regulations are very stringent, and I venture to say an action like this&#x2014;a document signed as chairman of the branch&#x2014;has never been taken before, and if this gentleman had signed himself as chairman of a branch of the South African party, the Minister would have found that out, and steps would have been taken a long time ago. There is a feeling created that so long as you belong to a certain party you can take any steps you like knowing that no action will be taken by your superiors. It is a matter which has caused grave concern to a large section of the voters in Pretoria, and it seems to me that the Minister should not have waited for the matter to be raised in the House before taking action. That action should have been taken a long time ago.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister and his staff think more clearly than they express themselves. We have listened to a very confused answer to the question put by the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan), who asked the reason for the differentiation between telephone charges in connection with a business office and a private house. The Minister said that there was this differentiation, but that does not answer the question. I do not know whether the Minister&#x2019;s answer was &#x2018;intended to confuse the issue. I want to refer to the subsidy towards the Transcontinental Imperial Airways Mail and Passenger Service, Alexandria to Cape Town, &#x00A3;36,000. Then there is the convincing footnote that this represents the initial payment of 30 per cent, of first year&#x2019;s subsidy of &#x00A3;120,000. I want to ask the Minister, when did the service year commence&#x003F; There is a very large sum involved, and it is a new departure, and in view of the interest in this movement I hope the Minister will give us the fullest information at his disposal in regard to this new service. What proportion is South Africa paying of the total cost?</p>

I think the position might well be examined to see if a revised tariff can be introduced.

The sum on the estimates is only the initial charge, and the total reaches &#x00A3;400,000. I ask the Minister what will be the precise advantages to be derived by the Union in regard to the carriage of postal matter, etc. What control will the Government have in regard to the management of the company, and the application of the moneys voted&#x003F; Is the Union to have any representation on the board; is the Union a shareholder&#x003F; We are very anxious not to lag behind where developments of great importance are taking place; but would like to be very convincingly assured that the advantages we are to receive will outweigh the use we might have of the same sum spent on telephone expansion and increased postal facilities.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOCKLY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to the question of the construction of telephone lines in the country. We know that the system which has been adopted by the Government is to send big gangs into one area to clean up the application for telephones in that particular area. That is a sound and desirable method of procedure. I want to put in a plea for the individual man. We have got cases where these men are far away from any others, and it is not possible for the Government to send out these big gangs. It is hopeless for these men to think that the department can give them the service they want. I have an application which was made by a man 10 years ago. I would bring the whole thing out, but I am rather too shy. I would only like to point out that if the Minister was kept waiting for 10 minutes on the telephone there would be a row. But this man has been ringing up for 10 years, and has not got any reply yet. I think these cases should be treated on a different basis from what is the accepted method of the department to-day. I have put the suggestion to the House before, and I hope the Minister will now give it his most serious attention. That is to send one individual man with his assistants&#x2014;and war pensioners are eminently suitable for the purpose&#x2014;to clean up these individual applications all over the country. If this is not done, I can see no hope for these men. I take this opportunity of saying that I am not making any remarks which may be taken as a reflection against the officers of the department. I think, however, that the regulations of the department should be more elastic and adaptable to changing conditions than they are to-day. We have had the most earnest attention from the officers of the department, and we have to give consideration to these men in that they are struggling against difficulties over which, at the present time, they <span class="col_4005-4006" refersTo="page_2075"/>have no control at all. We appreciate the fact that there is an enquiry being made at the present time with a view to assisting farmers where distances are too wide. Some of us have near-by neighbours, and we have the advantage of paying a rental that is reasonable and not too heavy, but in other parts of the country farmers live from 10 to 20 miles apart, and I suggest that the department should assist them with a reduced rate per mile, so that they can have the advantage of a telephone. It is all very well for the man in the town, or the man who lives in a more favoured part of the country. He can get satisfactory service, but where you are living away in the back region without any communications, it is a decided advantage to be able to get into communication with the nearest town in order to secure medical assistance or any other aid that may be badly wanted at any time. If the department can arrange some method whereby a reduction of the charges would not apply to the more thickly-populated parts of the country, so that reductions could be made in the other parts I refer to, I am certain that the farmers in those thickly-populated parts would raise no objections if their rentals were not reduced in order to enable the department to give extra facilities to the farmers situated in the more widely-separated parts of the country. I will illustrate the unfortunate position of some of these officers. I put in an application in the case of a man who had a telegraph line passing alongside of his house. It only wanted one post to enable the line to be carried to his house. The department told me that I would have to have a public call office there. I agreed to that. Then I was told I would have to sign a guarantee that I would get &#x00A3;10 in wires sent through that office by the travelling public. I explained that it would be impossible to do that, but I was prepared to pay the &#x00A3;10 myself. The man told me that under the regulations of the department it was impossible for them to consider such a scheme. That gave me a pain in my side. I asked why that was, and they said that if they did it they would have applications from all over the country. I said that if they could run it as a business concern and get a man to part with &#x00A3;10 a year here and there, they should scoop it in. Why not&#x003F; It seems to me that half the time of some of the officers is spent building up obstacles and the other half in trying to get round them. We have the same trouble with small towns rated as third-rate post offices where there is no night service. By dint of importunities we got a service eventually, and quite a number of smaller towns elsewhere are now receiving a night service on this particular line. There are individual cases where officers of the department should have a freer hand in order to meet the wishes of the public. Where you can get revenue for the department you should get it, but do not let these men be tied up with red tape. Give them freer action to a certain extent and a little elasticity where you can give service. I mention that in Rhodesia they carried a line through a forest without a single pole, They chopped down the trees and used the branches as poles, and they carried the line over 60 miles in that way. That is what we want here. We should adapt ourselves to the conditions of the country, and give service to the farmers as far as it is humanly possible to do so.</p>

<p>I just want to bring a few things to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. The first is that at Riversdale the old age pensions are paid out in the post office. They are paid to about 400 people, and it causes great inconvenience, because on that particular day hardly anybody from the countryside can get into the post office. The office is very small, and the clerk cannot attend to the rest of the public. I shall be very glad if the old age pension can be paid out elsewhere. I specially refer to a place in my constituency near Wijdersriver, where there is a great need of public telephones. When we ask for the telephone exchange to be kept open two hours later the Minister tells us that it cannot be done, because it will mean &#x00A3;30 more expenditure. When, however, we look at the estimates, then we see that about &#x00A3;400,000 is being spent on airships. I should very much like to know what we get for that, because, as the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) has said, the farmers will ask us to give an account of it, and I shall be very glad if the Minister will tell me what I am to say when asked why the expenditure of &#x00A3;30 is too much in the case of the farmers. I should like to know whether we shall get value for that money.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MADELEY</person>:</from>

<p>When I sat down I was referring to the Minister impregnating the engineering department with the clerics. I wish to emphasize that by referring to the views of the South African Telephone and Telegraph Association, as expressed through their organ, &#x201C;The Live Wire.&#x201D; Incidentally, they take the Minister to task for saying that there is no longer any friction in the department. The paper states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If our Minister could see the true position he would have to admit that there is a serious demand for an adjustment that will logically result in the engineering branch being removed from the influence of the clerical side of the department, and being maintained from top to bottom by practical engineers, who have gone through a full apprenticeship. He would see that it is better to have first-class engineers, who may be amateur clerks, than first-class clerks who may be amateur engineers. The present policy of the department disregards that truth. On our side we are pledged to expose the fallacy which denies the practical man his proper place and responsibility. Evidence can be brought to show that friction exists and is being accentuated at the present time by the policy of depressing the engineering side. It would also show that the policy of giving facilities to clerks and telegraphists to enable them to supersede the practical man does not arise out of a proposal to give better service to the public, but that it originates solely in the desire of <span class="col_4007-4008" refersTo="page_2076"/>the clerk and telegraph operator to get promotion. The clerk may be transferred to the engineering side benefits, the service to the public is poorer, and the result may be disastrous.</block>

<p>When I first tried to divorce the engineering from the clerical side I was met with considerable opposition by this very society, but as the result of experience, they have come to the conclusion that I was right. Continuing, the &#x201C;Live Wire&#x201D; says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Madeley was right and the Minister was wrong&#x2014;there is friction to-day. At the present time the problems we have just gone over are creating friction which is lessening the value of service rendered to the public and the designs of the department will accentuate the position. If they are persisted in, they may easily lower the morale of the engineering branch to a serious degree that would inevitably attract the public attention.</block>

<p>No words of mine could convey so clearly and emphatically the position as it is being brought about by the Minister to-day. I do not say the Minister is to blame, for he knows so little about the department, but I think he ought to make the closest enquiry and stop the importation of clerks into the engineering side to do engineering work. I understand they are being sent into the department to learn engineering work, and they are thus depriving the engineers who have a legitimate claim to promotion. That reflects itself in another way in regard to apprentices. We have apprentices in the engineering side of the post office who serve for five years, during which they receive the finest possible training, but under the regulations they are required to work at least 12 months longer as improvers. The result is that when they ought to be regarded&#x2014;and paid&#x2014;as journeymen, they get only &#x00A3;210 per annum, which is less than that laid down by the Wage Board as the pay of a competent shop assistant. Let us abolish that indefinite period of improvership; the very most they can get is &#x00A3;240 a year. When they do draw &#x00A3;210 a year, men outside occupying similar positions receive &#x00A3;285. I heartily endorse the request that immediately they have finished their training, they shall receive &#x00A3;285. They are about 25 years of age when their training is concluded, and I am prepared to back them against anybody in the world in their own sphere. At 25 they are of marriageable age, and yet we expect them to work for the miserable wage of &#x00A3;210. It is not right. Both sides of the House will support any improvement in the status of our own trained engineers. Then do not place clerical people into the engineering side, thus blocking the promotion of the engineering staff. Executive officers in the engineering section should be drawn only from the ranks of competent engineers, the state has trained. As to the imperial airways, we are committed to pay them a subsidy of &#x00A3;400,000. I believe the Government has the impression by some peculiar twist that because this company calls itself &#x201C;Imperial Airways&#x201D; it is a state concern. It is nothing of the sort. When I was endeavouring to instil air-consciousness into the Cabinet and the country, my idea was that we should build up our own South African air service with a South African personnel&#x2014;and the latter point is laid down in the contract with the Union Airways&#x2014; and that our service should link up with the air services of other great countries.</p>

<p>I want the Minister to give an expression of sympathy to a section of the community which deserves well at everybody&#x2019;s hands. I understand that a broadcasting licence costs 25s., the Government&#x2019;s share being 2s. 6d. The blind section is the one on whose behalf I make this claim. In England it has received practical sympathy by the enactment of a Bill which makes it possible for every blind person in England, Wales and Scotland to receive a free listening-in licence. We know very well that one of the most popular appeals in the Union was that on behalf of sufferers in our state hospitals for wireless sets, and the public responded extraordinarily generously. In every bed, in every general hospital, there is a wireless set. The Government is receiving nothing for this, and I do not think it wants anything. It costs nothing for the instalment and for the arrangements. There are the blind people in their homes who have had no opportunity for real education in the past, and it was not possible for them usefully to occupy themselves. Wireless installation has afforded them the most wonderful opportunity, not only of being educated, but occupying themselves as well. In all big centres the public respond to appeals made to the various radio societies has been extremely generous, and they have provided very large numbers of listening-in sets, and placed them at the disposal of the welfare societies for the blind. They have asked them to establish them in the homes of blind people. I know the Broadcasting Society is sympathetic to the remission of all expenses of blind listeners-in. If the Minister would make an announcement that he is prepared to consider this sympathetically, the Broadcasting Company will see that they want nothing. All the blind person has to do is to erect an aerial, and the service is provided free. Most of our blind are normally not wealthy, and they would have to go without, as they cannot afford to pay. I ask the Minister, without laying any stress on his imagination and that of the Government, to visualize the difference that the service makes in a blind man&#x2019;s day. I know one has only to mention this to the Minister to receive his full accord. It will be giving to the blind something they very much appreciate.</p>

<p>Early in the session I raised the question of the tariff of telephone charges made to European traders in the Transkei, and the Minister replied that the rental was &#x00A3;94 per annum to each at a distance of, say, 15 miles from the exchange. There is grave dissatisfaction right throughout the Transkei amongst the traders at this exorbitant charge &#x2014;practically &#x00A3;8 per month, and very possibly the highest throughout the country. The Minister evidently thought the charge of &#x00A3;94 per annum looked very high, and the Minister&#x2019;s reply to <span class="col_4009-4010" refersTo="page_2077"/>my questions reminded me very much of the auctioneer who sold a horse. He asked the owner whether he could give any guarantee, and he said it did not look so well. The horse was sold and the purchaser found it was blind. He wanted to get out of his bargain, and the seller replied: &#x201C;I told you it did not look so well.&#x201D; The Minister, in his reply, suggested that if only three traders were to apply to come on to the same party line the telephone charge would be &#x00A3;31 6s. 8d. each. I imagine three men in competition being on the same party line! The thing is preposterous. I wish the Minister would give this committee some idea as to the basis on which he arrives at this tariff. These people render public services. The police are able to get into contact with them through their telephones, and if there is any disturbance in their neighbourhood the traders are in a position to get immediately into contact with the police. At 6 per cent, this rental represents a capital of practically &#x00A3;1,600. These materials utilized in the construction of the lines are not going to run away, and the telephone is still the property of the department, so that one would not describe it as a wasting asset. The Minister ought to take this into consideration with a view to reducing the charge. Representations have been made over and over again to the department, and the answer is &#x201C;plenty of sympathy,&#x201D; but we know the old saying: &#x201C;You can get a ton of sympathy, but not half-a-crown in hard cash.&#x201D; The traders, therefore, do not ask for sympathy, but something more substantial, and that is a substantial reduction in the annual rental.</p>

<p>I want to raise a couple of points and get information from the Minister. I am glad to see the Minister of Agriculture here. Earlier in the session, in answer to a question, the Minister said that the rates for export maize had been reduced up to next month, and after that, they would revert to the normal figure. The answer may have been given by some other Minister. I want to make use of this opportunity of urging upon the Government looking upon this as one of the matters to be dealt with if we have to come to the relief of our maize farmers, who are in a difficult position indeed. At the moment, maize farming is non-remunerative, and it is almost impossible to expect people to continue maize farming. The margin is such that there is very little left. Under those circumstances, the Government and the public will naturally try and see in what direction relief can be found. One direction, undoubtedly, is the cheapening of railway rates and shipping rates on the export of our maize, and I would ask the Minister whether use cannot be made of this opportunity, whilst the farmers are in this distress, to maintain the low rate. There is a low rate for export maize up to June. I am speaking of the mail contract, and, therefore, I am quite within my rights in raising the point here. I raise it to get information, to see whether it is not possible to secure the continuance of the low rate on maize, not only on the past crop, but also on the crop which is coming now. If our farmers are to be charged a higher rate, then it is sure to be a severe handicap upon them. In view of the situation in the country, which is very grave indeed, I would ask the Government whether they cannot move the conference lines to maintain the lowest rates possible. I do not know whether it is possible to reduce the railway rates. I cannot raise that point at this stage. No doubt it will be raised when we get to the railway estimates, but the proper place to raise the question of shipping rates is here. The rates upon maize, years ago, were less than they are to-day. The Minister knows that originally when the old Transvaal Government arranged rates, both railway rates and the shipping rates were very low indeed, and the shipping rates were lower than they are today. The emergency which has arisen is a national emergency.</p>

We are making contributions towards Imperial Airways, but the question is what stage has the matter reached, what progress has been made, and when can we expect this service to be in working order&#x003F; Arrangements have to be made at this end. I believe a cable tower has to be erected, and that aerodromes have to be constructed. A good deal in the way of arrangements has to be done at this end to inaugurate this service, but so far as I am aware, nothing has been done. Some time ago the Air Minister in England made a statement which was not at all understood in this country. The Air Minister seemed to adumbrate that within a very short period these Imperial Airways would be in working order, and that a regular service would be established from England to South Africa. Everybody here was astonished to see the statement, but no doubt the Minister will be able to tell us what stage this matter has reached, how far their efforts have gone, and when, more or less, we can look forward to this service making a beginning. I hope the Minister will be able to give information on both these points, which, I submit, are of very great importance.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) brought up the question of the position of the export of maize. When he made his statement and said that, according to a statement by me, the freights on maize would be increased again after the middle of June, I immediately denied it. I never said such a thing, and I cherish the hope that the freights will not only remain as they are, but that the Conference Lines will consider the position of the farmers and still further reduce their tariffs. As hon. members know, we have a shipping board which cooperates with the farmers, and I suggested to them to consult with the farmers and to make contracts with the shipping lines as soon as <span class="col_4011-4012" refersTo="page_2078"/>possible. I agree with the hon. member for Standerton that the position is serious on account of the low price of maize on the world market. The cause of that is that there has been large over-production in other countries, which is now being placed on the world market, and as we, ourselves have a surplus we have to sell our maize at the world price. For that reason it is our duty to assist the farmers as much as possible. During the course of the week there will be a deputation going to the Minister of Railways and Harbours in connection with the reduction of rates on the railways. I am sure the Minister will adopt a sympathetic attitude, but I cannot say, of course, whether it is possible to reduce the rates. As for the Government, however, I can say that everything possible will be done to assist the maize farmers, because if they cannot get a proper price for their produce, then the position will be very serious.</p>

<p>With regard to remissions of penalties to which contractors render themselves liable under contracts entered into with the postmaster-general, the auditor-general has called attention to the remissions made by the postmaster-general from time to time. In fact, every year we find him drawing attention in his report to the fact that penalties incurred are frequently remitted without good and sufficient reason. What are the considerations which influence these remissions&#x003F; The auditor-general stated that in his opinion the considerations are not good and sufficient. These remissions are becoming very numerous, and I would like the Minister to look into this matter. The auditor-general says that the waiving of these penalties incurred by contractors is decided by the postmaster-general with Treasury approval. The Minister might tell me upon what grounds recommendations for waiving penalties are based, and who is responsible for making the recommendations. The auditor-general states as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In ten cases of late delivery penalties incurred by contractors were waived either wholly or in part by the postmaster-general with Treasury approval, misapprehension as to the calculation of delivery dates, alterations of specifications, delay by the department in submitting necessary details and drawings and so on.</block>

<p>These reasons rather pointed to lack of efficiency on the part of officials of the department, which I think should be looked into. Now I come to the considerations under which contractors have secured remissions. Two of the reasons given are pressure of work and inability to secure materials. Are those good reasons why a contractor should be absolved from liability&#x003F; These are matters as to which the Minister should safeguard himself in the contract and are not good and sufficient reasons for waiving penalties under a penalty clause. Abnormal weather conditions might be a good reason, but not the reasons given by the auditor-general. I have raised the matter before in this House. The auditor-general calls attention to this question very frequently, and I think the attention of the Minister should be called to it as he may alter his views, in regard to his department&#x2019;s policy in the future in connection with the enforcement of penalty clauses.</p>

<p>There are a few matters which I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister. In various parts of the country districts there are certain local exchanges which exist for the purpose of connecting farmers with one central exchange, and these local or country exchanges have very few subscribers. In some cases there are only one or two party lines connected to them, and every time these people want to talk to their own village, they have to pay at the trunk call rate, 9d. a call. Can the Minister do anything for these people in the way of allowing them a certain limited number of calls to their nearest village free each month. I think in that way he would satisfy these people who are at present under a hardship. They use the telephone very infrequently while other people in the towns use the telephones all day and the department gets nothing out of it. I brought this matter before the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, but unfortunately he did not stick long enough to do anything about the question.</p>

<p>I want to refer to these tenders for automatic telephones. Surely the Government would not lose anything by calling for tenders. I do not agree that automatic telephones are unsatisfactory. At Port Elizabeth people are very pleased with them. The hon. member for Benoni said that we had very old-fashioned apparatus, but at any rate we do know to-day when the phones are engaged, while before we felt we were being imposed upon by some of the young people in charge at the exchanges. I would like to refer to the night service for outlying districts. It is a most unfair thing to ask private individuals to undertake this night work without payment. The users of the telephone cannot complain when the man says that he has to take a holiday sometimes, and was not in at the time of the call. That excuse does not help the subscriber, and it seems unfair to ask a private individual to do this work when we have a postmaster in the district and a railway stationmaster. Perhaps some arrangement could be made for co-operation between the Railway Administration and the post office. I would like to support the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Bowen) in what he said in regard to the blind, and I hope something can be done. I think also we have a just claim for reduction of telegram charges. Why not come back to 12 words for a shilling&#x003F; You will get more telegrams and the public will be more satisfied. Then there is the question of postage between the United Kingdom and South Africa. Why should we pay 2d. when people can send a letter here for three half pence. The same steamers are used and we have to pay one-third more for the service. I hope that the Minister will see what can be done to relieve these little matters. From what was said by the hon. member who spoke before me, there is no doubt that if you <span class="col_4013-4014" refersTo="page_2079"/>get a satisfied public, you will get less complaints and you are going to give a good deal more satisfaction to your own men.</p>

I refer to the instrument which is attached to the wall, and at which a person has to stand while he speaks into the trumpet. Why cannot we have the type of machine that we used to have prior to this installation&#x003F; If a farmer is prepared to pay for the type of machine that he requires, I think that it is up to the Government to try to supply him with something more suitable to his requirements. We want a machine to which one can draw a chair in the evening and sit down and have a comfortable chat to one&#x2019;s neighbour. For that we are prepared to pay. I understand that there is little or no difference between the price of one type and the other. Yet the farmers are put to the inconvenience, without any reasonable cause, of using this unsuitable type of machine. I am quite sure that if the type I refer to was imposed upon the Minister, or upon the postmaster-general, and that every time they were rung up they had to jump up and stand up against the wall, they would very soon have all these instruments out in the street. I think it is a reasonable request to make that the department should discontinue installing this unsuitable instrument and give us something which is far more adaptable to the requirements of the country.</p>

<p>I was engaged in seeking information in regard to the Imperial Airways. The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts] tackled the matter from another angle. I want to know whether the country is getting value for its money. I was demonstrating that I had hoped, when I was in control, that we would have established our own South African service, operated by a South African personnel, and training our own South African lads. Then having established our South African service on a sound basis, we should launch out for ourselves and capture these trunk routes instead of allowing a foreign person, whether from Great Britain or anywhere else, to come in and capture that trade through the medium of the control of the trunk routes. There is here a sum of &#x00A3;400,000 of our money which we are paying them to put them on a sound, financial footing, and we are thus giving them the opportunity to capture the trade of South Africa, whereas it should be the other way round. I believe that the contract, or the conditions under which this sum of &#x00A3;400,000 is agreed upon, merely covers, so far as the South African personnel is concerned, the words &#x201C;as far as possible.&#x201D; We all know what that means. One individual is enough, or even none at all. Our Union Airways&#x2019; contract carries with it an obligatory clause that they shall employ a South African personnel. They are doing so. They have established themselves in the case of tremendous difficulties with a mere &#x00A3;8,000 subsidy, and they have carried our mails for the last nine months without any hitch. They have brought our mails regularly under the most difficult circumstances, and I say that we ought to be turning our consideration towards helping our own South African industry, rather than helping an industry which is capturing our trade. We should be capturing it from them. Sentiment should come into this thing, personal sentiment, in addition to patriotic sentiment. In addition, this lad who started our Union Airways is a lad who deserves well of South Africa. He is a lad who has always put the aeroplane service of the country before himself. He has made nothing out of it yet, and he is devoting his whole life and soul to furthering the objects of aviation in South Africa, because he loves it. South Africa will remember what Major Miller did during the war. He not only put South Africa on the map from an air point of view, but he instilled subsequently into the country that air-sense without which you cannot bring an air service along. I know that the agreement has been accomplished and that you are going to help a foreign enterprize to come into South Africa with their own personnel, and with their workshops overseas. The merest skeleton will be introduced in South Africa on their part. They will be running one or two planes a week, if that, and the service will not he of very great value to South Africa. However, we have agreed to give them &#x00A3;400,000. If that is so we have the right to say that the time has arrived to be a little more generous in our treatment of our own aviation company in South Africa. Whilst I do not suggest for a moment that you should break your word, you should give them the &#x00A3;400,000, I urge the Minister to consider very seriously the desirability of doing something more for our own local aviation service. There is one point that can be done in addition to helping them with capital expenditure or credit for extending their service, and heaven alone knows we have learnt the value of an aviation service, and that is that the extension will be looked upon with pleasure by the vast majority of the people of South Africa. There is the question of the surcharge on letters. I was never happy about it when I instituted it. I did it on the understanding that before very long it would come down. The union airways have filled the Bill. They have done everything they undertook to do. Their contract has been completely fulfilled. There is not a person, other than a South African, employed by the Union Airways. Is it not time for us to consider this question of the surcharge and attempt to make the service a little more popular&#x003F; The hon. member who raised this point asked how people could afford it. He is quite right. We cannot afford the 4d. surcharge to carry a letter to Durban or to Port Elizabeth. It cannot be done. I suggest that it be a regular means of carriage; drop the surcharge altogether or reduce it considerably. I think the Government should go into the matter with the heads of the Union Airways with a view to helping them to finance themselves and be spreading this all over the country. Personally I would rather it was a state service but in preaching that in this House I am preaching to people <span class="col_4015-4016" refersTo="page_2080"/>who are prepared to laugh at the idea. As an alternative let us have something South African and not imported from abroad. Let us have a service run by South Africans born or by people who have lived here many years. Then let us have our own workshops and give financial assistance to South African aerial services. There is another matter; in other parts of the world, and particularly in England, portable flood lights are being installed at aerodromes to enable safe landings to be made at night. If the Government cannot do this itself, it should bring its influence to bear upon local authorities to provide flood lights. I understand the Government is going to erect a wireless station for Imperial Airways, but I would ask it first to turn its attention to South African air services and give them a little bit of help. As to broadcasting, I understand permission has been given to various churches to have their sermons broadcast. I also understand that the minister who was largely responsible for the introduction of this system is the very man who, singularly enough, has been deprived of having his services broadcast. I refer to the Rev. Mr. Balmforth, a brilliant, earnest and sincere man, and if anyone has the right to have his services broadcast, it is he Lots of people would very much like to hear his services and it is desirable that all churches should have a chance.

<p>I regret that the department is slavishly wedded to connecting farmers to small telephone exchanges. Supposing a farmer who is ten or twelve miles away from a central exchange, applies for a telephonic connection, should there happen to be a railway station exchange near him, he must be content to be connected with that. The use of the telephone to the farmer is, therefore, considerably curtailed, and its utility materially reduced as the hours at a small railway exchange are only from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and for one hour a day, the railway exchange is closed during the luncheon interval. On the other hand, if a farmer is connected with the Caledon telephone exchange, he has the use of the telephone from 7 a.m. to 12 midnight without any breaks for meals. His neighbour is compelled to go to the small station or to the small new exchange away from the main exchange, and has the same financial responsibility as the other. The result is many farmers refuse to be connected up. I know of a case where the large majority of farmers are connected with the main telephone exchange in Caledon, but other farmers who come along are told they must connect up with the station. The result is they refuse to do so. There is no postmaster at the railway station, and people who use the telephone there have to do so at the convenience of the stationmaster, who is often engaged. Take another case personally brought to my notice&#x2014;the seaside resort of Onrust River, four miles away from Hermanus, where an exchange was established at the hotel. People using the telephone have to go to this exchange, and the result is nobody connects up. Through force of circumstances I had to connect up, but could get nobody to speak to at Onrust River, which is a rising township. If I speak to Hermanus I have to pay my fee, and I have to pay from &#x00A3;7 to &#x00A3;10 for absolutely no service. That is not business. If you increase your staff it will be of great benefit to all the surrounding country. I hope the Minister will give this practice of the department his attention, and see that an alteration is brought about. It is one from which the department will not depart.</p>

<p>There is an item in the report of the postmaster-general I should like to draw attention to. It is under the heading of undeliverable mail matter. We find that there have been sales of undeliverable articles, which realized &#x00A3;264. Will the Minister say what steps are taken by the department to get into touch with the senders of the parcels&#x003F; We have all had experience of parcels having gone astray. I cannot find any trace of what has become of this &#x00A3;264 in the general profit and loss account of the department. Is it included in miscellaneous revenue&#x003F; We know that on the form filled in, giving the name of the addressee, the addressor, too, has to furnish his name and address. Surely it is possible for the department to get into touch with the sender of every parcel. The amount is very small, but there is a large principle at stake, and I hope the Minister will explain what is done in such cases. I want to associate myself very strongly with the appeal made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Bowen) with regard to the blind. I have always taken a very keen interest in the welfare of the blind. It is a small service that is asked for, but it will be very highly appreciated, and I hope the Minister will treat the representations made to him sympathetically.</p>

<p>There are a few places in my constituency that are particularly badly served with regard to telephones. For more than two years some people have been applying for telephone lines without success. We also have the same difficulty as that to which the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) referred. We have, e.g., a telephone connection six miles outside the village, and the duty hours are from 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., while other places, more or less in the same position, have the full service from 8 a.m. to late in the night, sometimes until midnight. We apply for connection with Robertson, so that we can have the full service, or, if that is impossible, for someone who can give his sole attention to the telephone service, so that everything is not left in the hands of the station-master who already has a very large amount of work. We applied to be joined up with Robertson after 5 p.m., but the answer was that it is not possible, because Swellendam is connected with Cape Town, and then we would conflict with them. I think the request is a fair one. I want to point out that Montagu in particular, a certain part of Swellendam, and Robertson are badly served with regard to telephones. People applied for them years ago, and some even deposited money which was repaid to them because the lines could not <span class="col_4017-4018" refersTo="page_2081"/>be constructed. I hope the Minister will give more attention to our requirements.</p>

<p>I want to call attention to the very serious position in regard to maize. Last year we exported some 6,000,000 bags, and had a surplus of 12,000,000 for consumption in this country. It is anticipated that there will he a 25,000,000 production, and if there is to be the same consumption, we shall have 19,000,000 bags in our hands. The consumption in this country may be even less, due to the fact that we have magnificent pastorage owing to the recent rains. The freight on maize to England is 22s. 6d. I remember the time when freight was 10s. per ton, and if freight can be reduced, there will be a better opportunity to compete on the world&#x2019;s market. Only to-day maize was offered at 7s. a bag ex elevator. This is a price which my farmer friends will agree cannot pay the farmer. There are bag charges, transport and threshing, and what will the farmer get&#x003F; Only 3s. or 4s. a bag. Can farmers produce at that price&#x003F; I suggest that the Minister should try to make better terms with the shipping companies. The country is in a parlous condition in regard to the prices to be obtained, not only for maize but also for oats, barley and even lucerne seed, which is 3d. per lb.&#x2014;an unheard of price. It is usually 5d. or 6d. Probably efforts are being made to get a reduction of freight rates, but I think that if stronger efforts are made the farmer will get relief. I want to associate myself with what was said by hon. members on the other side of the House in regard to telephones. I have had the honour of being in this House for seven years, and from the first year I have asked for several communications in my old constituency. I was told that they had been put down tentatively on the programme. It still remains tentative. That is not right. My old constituency and other districts are crying out for telephones, and they are prepared to pay for them. Here you have a huge province like the Western Province, which, I think, includes right up to the northwest, to Colesberg, and comes down to Oudtshoorn, and a paltry sum is put down on the estimates. That is not fair. Besides, I hold that the farmers should be acquainted with the various prices of produce. I, as a storekeeper, feel that if the farmer knows the prices at which produce is sold, it is conducive to him to get better prices. I agree with my hon. friends over there that something more must be done. It is a business concern, and I think it is about one of the only profitable concerns of a Government, There is every reason why money should be expended, and in any case, it will give a lot of employment to our own people in this country. I again appeal to the Minister that more determination should be shown by the members of the Government in regard to freight for our products.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Bowen) made a reference to the South African Broadcasting service. Quite a number of speakers this afternoon have approached this question forgetting, I think, that the question of the service is in the hands of a private company, and not in the hands of a broadcasting corporation as it exists in Great Britain where the Government, undoubtedly, have a very big say in the matter of the service given to the consumers. I want to point out to the hon. member and to other hon. members, that the Government did consider that matter when the Radio Act was passed in 1926. In sub-section (3) of section 8 they made provision in that Act by which &#x201C;a licence may, in the discretion of the poet-master-general, be issued without charge to charitable and educational institutions and hospitals.&#x201D; Provision is, therefore, made where a blind man happens to be in an institution, that the broadcasting company may waive the whole question of cost and give free service if they are so disposed. I know of instances where such services have been given at the present day, if not at a free cost, at least, at a nominal cost. If the hon. member means that the Government should instal a service for every blind man all I can say is, that that would be a very heavy financial liability upon the Government which they would have to consider very seriously. Arising out of the same matter, several hon. members have complained that the service is not given to the countryside to the extent they would like.</p>

<p>There were complaints that not sufficient Afrikaans services were broadcast and other seats alleged that they did not get enough of their services broadcast, and that generally speaking the broadcasting was unsatisfactory. The right or initiative to lay down what the programmes shall be is quite outside the pale of the Government, which can only bring its influence to bear in connection with the issue of licences. Whenever I receive complaints, I make representations to the company, but apparently the company does not pay very much attention to them. The hon. member for Winburg (Dr. N. J. van der Merwe) asks what I propose to do in regard to putting broadcasting on the same lines as in Great Britain, where it is operated by the Post Office and managed by a broadcasting corporation. We are by no means satisfied with the present service, and I think very few of the subscribers are satisfied that what was contemplated when the service was started has been performed, and we should all like to see a very much better service. Twelve months ago, under the rights given to the Government under the Radio Act, we inpected the finances of the company and found they were very unsound; in fact, we expected they would not be able to carry on very much longer, but somehow or other they have managed to jog along. The company has incurred very big <span class="col_4019-4020" refersTo="page_2082"/>losses, but we are not likely to have a better service so long as the company remains in its present position. In that event, we shall have to turn in some other direction, perhaps in that suggested by the hon. member for Winburg before the people are satisfied with the broadcasting service. So far the Government is not faced with the position of having to take broadcasting over. There were two or three attempts by private individuals and committees before the present company undertook the task. They failed; I hope I shall not be right in saying that the present company will also fail. But in that case we shall have to consider in what form it should be continued. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Henderson) asked why there was an increase of &#x00A3;124,000 in expenditure. A lump sum of &#x00A3;36,000 is being paid on account of the Imperial Airways contract. There is also a very large increase in the cost of the conveyance of mails, made necessary by giving better services, which I am sure the House will not begrudge. The rest of the increase is made up chiefly of the increases in scale increments, in addition to the increase of staff necessitated by the large volume of increased business, which has taken place in recent years. In the Postmaster-General&#x2019;s report the hon. member will see tabulated, not only under headings, but also the details, of the increase in the volume of matter, such as letters, parcels and matters of that sort. This has necessitated more persons to deal with them efficiently. The hon. member at the same time pointed to the income being some &#x00A3;300,000 less than a few years ago. I just want to remind him that we have written off some &#x00A3;400,000 and handed it back to the taxpayers by reverting to penny postage. This would appear as an obvious answer to all the other points the hon. member made to try and prove that by reducing the costs of the service we shall increase our income. It does not appear to me that we have got back the reduction we made then, by any increased number of letters we have carried.</p>

<p>I am ure we never got it back, only a very small percentage. The total profit made by the department in 1928-29 was something like &#x00A3;99,000, which is a very small amount on the big capital expenditure involved. I am sure that the hon. member and the committee will allow we should not run the postal services for the purpose of making profits. It is a public utility service, and while making things pay, we must give service without making profits. On a balance sheet made on a commercial basis the amount has been reduced to about &#x00A3;88,000 this year, and further analysis will prove that the profit is due practically entirely to telephones, and that this profit is confined to two places&#x2014;the Witwatersrand and Cape Town; the rest of the telephone service is non-paying and uneconomic. If we go further into the matter we shall find that by the extension of postal services&#x2014;all things very necessary to the development of the country&#x2014;we have a large number of our services which are also on a non-economic basis. As I told the House the other day, we are going in for a big development in the telephone services of the two paying places, and we are going to be in a position to give some thousands of subscribers the service for which they have constantly asked, but which we could not give them because we are at the end of our plant, or could only have done so under uneconomic expedients. We are building more exchanges on the Rand, and also changing gradually over to the automatic system; in five years&#x2019; time not only will we take over the subscribers who offer themselves, but will be able to canvass for new subscribers and at the same time meet the needs of the countryside. It is not only the countryside which will reap the benefit of this additional service, but the people in the towns and villages, who can get into touch with the people in the countryside and extent their trade. I think the committee will agree that if it is necessary to instal telephones it is the man who lives away from the towns and villages who should be first considered, but so low is the rate that if we are going on like this without paying attention to the plums&#x2014;the places which produce the profits&#x2014;I shall be coming out on the wrong side of the balance sheet, and the Minister of Finance will come down upon my chest for it. As to the unrest which was mentioned by hon. members, I think a good deal of it is due to too much overtime. The Auditor-General has drawn attention to the extraordinary amount of overtime worked in the post-office. In a good many cases it does not pay at all. Hon. members object when I try to effect some small economy with regard to delivery on public holidays and Sundays. Overtime is paid for at higher rates than the ordinary, and all this costs money. Very few people need a service on Sundays or Bank Holidays except in the larger towns, and if hon. members will try to assist me to effect these economies, and to cut down overtime, giving employees their Sunday rest, we can effect many economies and put the postal business on a better footing. There are many other things in regard to which economy can be effected, and which the department is paying very strict attention to the present time, in conjunction with the Public Service Commission. The hon. member has said that by lowering rates we can do more business. I have some doubt about that. It might increase slightly, but practically everybody uses the post office now, and I do not think that by reducing our rates, especially where we make no profit now, we shall turn the loss into a profit. The hon. member instanced the type telegram sent at Christmas, which the department itself initiated. We are prepared to give a low rate in that case because the wire itself is not sent; only a name and a number are sent. That is not a fair illustration to show that business would be increased. Various speakers have brought up the matter of the telephone rates in Durban. The position in Durban is that under an Act of the Natal Parliament, I think <span class="col_4021-4022" refersTo="page_2083"/>of 1876, permission was given to the municipality to instal a telephone system, purely as a borough system. They installed their plant, and they have run their telephone system, and it is true now that, with the capital and interest paid off, they are in a position to give a lower rate. I may point out, however, that the penny a call quoted here is confined to the call offices. As far as their unmeasured rate is concerned, it is practically identical with the unmeasured rate in the Union. It is no cheaper to the Durban subscriber than to the Union subscriber. Durban is in the position temporarily to charge a very cheap rate in that one respect at the call offices. They popularise the call offices, and look upon them as a form of advertising. That is what I am given to understand. Now they are faced with the position of having to replace their plant and desire to change over to the automatic system, and consider ways and means of doing it. Under the Post Office Act of 1911, this service of providing telephones is entrusted to the Postmaster-General, and the work can only be continued by the Durban Corporation through a licence obtained from the Postmaster-General. Various responsibilities are thrown on the Government by the Post Office Act, and it is the duty of the Government to see that, when a licence is issued, to see that the service given to the public is of a proper nature and charged at proper rates. Furthermore, full power is given to us to go carefully into the accounts, and to satisfy ourselves that the work is giving satisfaction, and that it is done efficiently.</p>

<p>That is the call office rate; elsewhere in the Union it is 3d. A little while since, when my attention was called to the fact that the Government was responsible to a considerable extent under the Post Office Act, and to the fact that Durban has one of the plums in the telephone service, without responsibility to the outside public, I communicated with them. The fact was also brought to my notice that we have had to build around Durban a number of exchanges, and that as Durban intends to expand its boundaries, it will then incorporate our exchanges, which at present are just outside the borough. Complications must arise. Besides, we are giving trunk service to Durban, which will be unsatisfactory if the Durban system fails, and the Government postal department will get the blame. As I have said, I have communicated with Durban. I approached the town council, seeing that they had set up a committee to consider this matter, asking them to consider the taking over of their service by the Union Government or, if they were not agreeable to that, to let me know how far we could help them to see that an efficient service is installed in Durban. The only reply I have had is a point-blank refusal to agree to the taking over of the service. Personally, I think it would be in the best interests of the people of Durban.</p>

<p>I do not think you could run a telephone service in the country if the municipalities owned the plums, and the Union was left with the trunk lines. Anyway the position is that Durban peremptorily closed the door, and said nothing about what they intend to do themselves. I have had to point out to Durban that I regret very much that they have taken this step, and that my communication was not in any way of the nature of a threat. That is the position to-day. We have offered our services to Durban. We feel there is a responsibility upon the postal department to see that an efficient service is given at the lowest possible rate in Durban. Durban cannot use all the services which the Union renders merely for the purpose of developing its own service. It is very unsatisfactory. No conclusion has been come to. The door is open for consideration, and I do hope that we shall get a proper system. The present system is not a proper system. When the people of Durban are confronted with a huge capital expenditure to instal an automatic service they will have interest and redemption to meet, but apparently the people in Durban do not see this at the present time. There is another alternative in regard to Durban. We have our exchanges there, and Durban municipality has no monopoly, so that there is nothing to prevent our coming into competition with Durban municipality. I think the idea we should aim at in this country is one penny per call, but you certainly could not do that with your present lines. With regard to automatic telephones, I have explained to the House on former occasions why I introduced these, and that this indecisiveness on the part of the department was due to my predecessor in office who left the telephone service in its present condition. Many years ago the department came to the conclusion that a gradual change over should be made from the manual system to the automatic system, but the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) disagreed with that for the reasons he has stated, and that was why the development did not take place. I do not want to enter into the technicalities of the question. He said that when we get automatic telephones, we shall not reap any advantage from them, and they will probably cost us more. I have the experience of Port Elizabeth and Pietermaritzburg to refer to, and there it has been found more economic and more efficient, and to give more general satisfaction than the manual system. Other countries too are not satisfied with the manual system. A change has been made in London, from the manual to the automatic, and the same change is being made in the big towns all over the world. The hon. member also said I had been instrumental in extending the hours of girl telephone operators. When the hon. member took office, I think the system was that the girl telephonists worked in shifts so that there was continuous service up till nine o&#x2019;clock at night, <span class="col_4023-4024" refersTo="page_2084"/>but not by extension of working hours; simply by arrangement of shifts. The hon. member came along and instituted a system by which all girl operators should leave at six o&#x2019;clock and a part-time night operator&#x2014;a male&#x2014;should carry on between six and nine p.m. When I took office, I had a request from girls at Pietermaritzburg and Port Elizabeth that we should revert to the old system. They said that, under the old system, they got hours off in the morning to do their shopping, but they did not value those hours at night at all. I then put it on a voluntary basis, and if the girls wished to go back to the old system, they could do so, but I have never enforced a reversion to the old system. If the hon. member had to listen to all the complaints I hear about the service during the period from six to nine p.m. in some of the large centres, I think he would agree that the old system is by far the best. We engage a man from six to nine, which is not a full-time job. He works only three hours in the evening, and cannot be expected to have the same interest in the job as a girl who is constantly employed at it. Furthermore, he has not got the same experience. The constant complaint is that, during these hours, you cannot get a number within a reasonable time, and often you cannot get the exchange. Some change, I am afraid, will have to be made in that regard, as the present position is not satisfactory. In all other services when duties are spread over a long period, it is always done by arrangement of shifts. I am quite sure the hon. member used the word &#x201C;trick&#x201D; without meaning it. He said we had tricked these girls into going back to the old system. I want to assure him that in every case the change has been made at the request of the girls themselves.</p>

<p>I want the hon. member to regard that 1923 Act as entirely dead. It is dead because it was not carried out, and the present company is working under the Radio Act. If he will read Clause 5 of that Act, he will see that the postmaster-general may issue licences in regard to radio telephony and a licence has been issued under that Act which incorporated most of the conditions which were laid down. This clarified the question of the charges to be made for transmission of inland telegrams. We have laid down the same rate as the cable company has paid us from the beginning, viz., 1d. per word. I may say that I have been approached recently by the Wireless Company, who have pointed out good reasons for allowing an amalgamation between the Cable Company and the Wireless Company to take place. Both these services are controlled by Communications Limited, a company formed by the Imperial Government in England to incorporate the cable and transmission services throughout the Dominions, and throughout other parts of the world. I have been approached by them recently, to allow them to combine at this end so as to effect economies. These economies can be effected, and I see no reason why they should not be permitted to affect these economies, provided the public get something out of them. I asked the company what they are prepared to give us. As the hon. member knows, the position is that Communications Limited, are not permitted, under the Act, to make more than 10%. Any further profit beyond 10% comes under the consideration of an advisory board on which we are represented, to apportion what reductions should be effected throughout the various services of Communications Limited. In the first place I intend to make the period of both licenses equal, viz., until 1944. Hon. members will understand that this does not constitute a monopoly. I can grant another similar licence to anybody to-morrow to run the same services. In consideration of this I have been able to get them to agree to a reduction of rates. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to-night to state exactly what the amount of that reduction will be. It will be a considerable reduction on the cable rate and it will also be a reduction on the present wireless rate. As soon as I know definitely what the amount will be, and it is under consideration now, I shall let the House know. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) has referred to the reply I gave the other day to a question which he asked me. It was a reply I gave when he asked why public tenders were not called for the apparatus required for the installation of automatic telephones. I had better just give him the history of that as I know it. The position, as I understand it, is this. There are two automatic systems in vogue. One is called the &#x201C;rotary,&#x201D; of which type there are one or two exchanges in Durban and the other is called the step-by-step system. The department, owing to the success of the exchanges in Maritzburg, Port Elizabeth and elsewhere and after expert advice, have followed the lead of London in regard to this matter and have adopted the step-by-step automatic system as the standard type for installation in the Union. There are five manufacturers in the world of the step-by-step automatic system, one of whom cannot supply in South Africa. I think this one is the Standard Automatic Telephone Company. They have not the right to supply these telephones in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>Because it is a proprietary article. <span class="col_4025-4026" refersTo="page_2085"/>The four chief manufacturers of this article are the proprietors of all the patents and they share these patents among the four manufacturing firms, and the terms under which the fifth firm is allowed to supply are dictated by the proprietors. One of these firms is in Chicago. Two are in Great Britain, Siemens Bros, and the Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co. and the other is Siemens, Halskey of Berlin. We approached these firms sometime ago for prices on which to frame our estimates. The quotations of the Chicago firms were far too high, far higher than the two firms manufacturing in Great Britain. The fourth firm, the German firm, gave no quotations at all in response to our request. They said they were prepared to come to South Africa to advise us as to what we should do here. They were asked again to give a quotation but they did not do so. The only satisfactory prices we received were from the two firms, I have mentioned in Great Britain, with whom the British Government have also entered into a contract through the Post Office for the installation of this system in London. We have therefore entered into an agreement with these two firms to supply our requirements at prices that compare very favourably with the prices at which they are supplying the British Government, and which will allow of certain discounts being given on account of our exchanges being worked in with those manufactured for the British Government. Of course I know there are certain treasury regulations to be complied with in ordering plant but there was no benefit to be gained by calling for tenders for this proprietary article when we would be more likely to get satisfactory prices by negotiating. In this matter treasury sanction was obtained for this departure from the regulations quoted. The hon. member for Somerset (Mr. Vosloo) has asked for farm telephones to be made cheaper, and many hon. members have also pointed out this necessity. The hon. member complains that I did not spend the sum voted last year. That is news to me, because if he will turn up the additional estimates, he will find in regard to telephone construction, farm telephones included, that I exceeded the sum of money which I was voted last year and I had to come to the House to pass additional Estimates for a large sum of money. The hon. member is wrong when he says that I did not spend the sum of money which was voted last year. In regard to the costs, as the hon. members knows, at the present time a good deal of construction is being carried out at &#x00A3;3 10s. per mile on farm lines, and it is certainly not a paying rate. It is distinctly uneconomic, but it is a special rate the Government laid down to assist farmers, and we are carrying out installations at a greater speed now than we have ever done in the past. We have quite a distinct loss occasioned to the postal department in that connection. I am quite sure of this that nobody in this House will begrudge that amount. Above all we desire to give telephone service to the farmers in this country at the lowest possible rate, and if we lose money in that regard we know that the farmers generally and the country&#x2019;s development, benefit by virtue of that expenditure. We desire to give the farmer the cheapest possible service we possibly can. I should also like to say a few words in answer to those who have brought up the question of a letter costing 2d. to post from South Africa to Great Britain while only three half pence is charged from Great Britain to South Africa. I do not know whether the three half-penny rate pays Great Britain or not, but there are no signs to show us that we are justified in going back to the penny overseas rate. Will hon. members who talk of anomolies explain to me why the inland rate in Great Britain is three half pence, while in he Union it is only a penny&#x003F; It appears to me that with the high cost of the mail contract, and things of that sort, We are not in a position to reduce the overseas postage rate with the small amount of profit we get at present. The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan) returned to a question which I replied to some little time since. He asked why a business man pays &#x00A3;9 for 900 telephone calls, whereas the rate for a private residence is &#x00A3;7 for 600 calls, but in his calculations he leaves out of consideration the question of the rental of the apparatus. Suppose the question of calls did not enter into it, and the apparatus was merely rented, the difference is &#x00A3;3 7s. in one case, and &#x00A3;3 5s. in the other.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>If you take 600 calls at three halfpence and 900 calls at three halfpence, you will find that the totals come out exactly in accordance with the charge made by the department. The difference between the &#x00A3;3 7s. and the &#x00A3;3 5s is probably to make the total a round sum. There is no mystery about these charges. I have been asked to explain the arrangements made with Imperial Airways. I distinctly remember the Minister of Finance giving the House these details last year, but I will repeat them. The British Government entered into a contract with a company for air development including a service to the Cape via Egypt. It is anticipated that the service will start some time in January. The British Government approached all the administration whose territory will be served by the service asking them to contribute on the basis of population, income and benefits to be derived. We were asked to contribute &#x00A3;400,000, payment to be spread over five years. We agreed to that. Over and above this sum there are other commitments, for instance, we have undertaken to keep the machines in touch with landing places by wireless from Rhodesia southwards and to provide aerodromes. The company have agreed to employ as far as possible Union mechanics in their workshops at the Cape and Germiston. I might point out to the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) that we are not the only country to be considered under this scheme, and we have no more right to say to the company that our workmen must be employed at the aerodromes than any other country has. The point arises, too, whether we have men with sufficient technical knowledge to repair these huge aeroplanes. <span class="col_4027-4028" refersTo="page_2086"/>I think we have gone as far as we possibly can in that direction seeing that we are not the only contributors.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The idea is to have a weekly service, and the time to be occupied is, I believe eleven days from England to Cape Town and vice versa. I take it we did not go into this scheme expecting that it will become a payable one for many years, but in the hope that it will lead to the further development of South Africa and the Union. Our income from the service will be a small one, but the idea is to aid the development of South Africa, to encourage aviation and to support a scheme which may eventually develop into something very much bigger. We have been able to induce municipalities, and in fact laid down the policy that municipalities should provide landing grounds within their boundaries where they desire these services to call. That answers the question, I think, which was asked, whether the Government would provide an aerodrome at Queenstown. It is not the policy of the Government to provide aerodromes at municipalities. Municipalities are readily responding to the call of the Government, and installing landing places themselves. Cape Town, with the aid of the Government, has been able to get a perfectly satisfactory terminus here. An hon. member complained that somebody he knows had been kept waiting for a telephone for ten years. Some complain of being kept even longer. I have stated already the policy of the department in that regard. When the department goes into a district to do the work which they have to do, they are confronted with new applications which sometimes equal the work they went to do, and it is not right to come out of the district until it is &#x201C;cleaned up&#x201D; of all applications. An hon. member asked me about the advisability of attending to individual applicants who have waited for a considerable time by detailing individual officials for this service, and availing myself of the help which can be given by applicants. I will consider his proposal on this basis&#x2014;where we set out to give individual service it cannot be expected to be done at the same rate as where there are 40 or 50 people in a district all close to one another. If such persons will give an undertaking that they will bear the whole cost of construction, and the extra cost to which the department is put to serve the individual customer, we may consider detaching a technical officer to do that work; but certainly not at the present rate for farm lines. The hon. member for Bechuanaland (Mr. Raubenheimer) complained of the lack of telephone facilities granted to his constituency, and said there were places 100 miles away from any town. I wonder if he had worked out in his mind what that is going to cost in construction. We are already in his district constructing a very of thing. All these lines are uneconomic, and big losses are entailed. When they get the service we get no thanks. They then want a whole 24-hour service, or things of that sort. Look at the large number of employees we would have to employ for all these services. The people deserving of greater sympathy perhaps are those farthest from a town or village. There is no doubt that the charge of &#x00A3;3 10s. per mile becomes a very expensive luxury to them I have already considered it, and there is a departmental enquiry going on at present into the advisability of seeing whether some reduction cannot be given to men who are at long distances. We may have to consider whether we cannot reduce those charges by perhaps charging a little more to those who are nearer towns and have more facilities. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) dealt with the long distances postmen have to traverse in the course of their duties, and charged me with neglect and asked me to see that these men were not overworked. I have no evidence at present on that, nor have I received any complaints from the Postmen&#x2019;s Union; but I will enquire into this; it is quite a legitimate complaint. I do not know what rule is laid down with regard to the walks; the post office has been here so long now that some principle must have been laid down to regulate these matters and see that these men are not overburdened, and that the walks are so apportioned as not to entail too long distances. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Mr. Giovanetti) complained that certain postmasters were not getting enough salaries. In face of the present balance sheet I do not know what more the hon. member would expect them to get; after all, these are matters relegated to the Public Service Commission, and the salaries provided by them are similar to those of other public servants performing similar work. In these matters we have to bear in mind not only the postal service, but all services. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. Pocock) asked me about the Transvaal telephone directory, and asked whether the loss cannot be reduced. The department effected the only possible economy by contracting and printing the directory on fewer pages. The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. Pocock) also pointed out that the names of ministers were not printed in a uniform manner. I may say that in the Johannesburg directory my name appears as H. W. Sampson. The position is that by saving lines, the number of pages has been reduced.</p>

It has been asked whether the Union airways service pays. It was never anticipated that the service would pay. We simply took the routes which we thought were best. The whole object of that Vote was to encourage the development of civil aviation, and as to the complaint that we are spending too much money, I may point out that we are constantly being asked to spend more.</p>

<p>Various members have complained of the lack of accommodation in post offices for old age pension work. Our post offices cannot be stretched, and it is quite true that when the people come for their old age pensions, there is some inconvenience. It is only one day a month, however, and I do not think that that warrants our extending the size of our post offices. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) complains that I have put men from the clerical side of the department into the engineering branches. That was done before I entered office, so far as I know. An agreement had been come to, probably instigated by the hon. member himself, by which it was agreed that no persons from the clerical side should be allowed to change over to the engineering side; but I am given to understand that an arrangement was made before that to the effect that when some certain six persons on the clerical side had the necessary technical knowledge and certificates, they would be afforded an opportunity of going into the workshops and securing a practical knowledge of engineering. Anyway I found six individuals greatly grieved because these promises had not been carried out. I think promises of that kind should be carried out, and I have agreed that they should be allowed to take the course promised to them, but I have not disturbed the arrangement come to that in future persons employed on the clerical side are not to be allowed to transfer to the engineering side. With regard to the points made by the hon. member for Benoni respecting improvers, I have given a good deal of thought to this matter. The complaint is that in the engineering trade in private employment a boy is apprenticed for five years, and then works as a journeyman while the apprentices inside the post office are required not only to undergo five years&#x2019; apprenticeship, but also to go through one year&#x2019;s improvership or longer before they are appointed as journeymen. The complaint is based on a comparison of service inside and outside the postal service. As a matter of fact, however, every apprentice who serves five years in private employment does not get a job as a journeyman on the expiration of five years. The dull boys in all trades are required to serve a further period as improvers, though there are apprentices quite able to take up appointments as journeymen at the end of five years. A real comparison brings us a little closer. It is not a comparison with a universal five-year apprenticeship system outside. I take it that each trade knows its own requirements best as to the period required to train the individual for a particular occupation. Some trades require ten years, some five, and some three. Some think that five years is the proper period for engineering. But what evidence have we as to what is the proper period in the post office except the experience of those associated with it&#x003F; According to our heads of departments, five years plus one year&#x2019;s improvership is the proper period and postal needs cannot be compared with trades outside the service. If, at the end of his apprenticeship, the boy is unwilling to enter an improvership the contract is at an end, and he can leave the service. If he is to continue in the employ of the state, after his apprenticeship, but he has to serve a year&#x2019;s improvership and then to wait until there is a vacancy as a mechanic or an electrician. If we automatically passed every boy through at the end of five years as a tradesman, we should find ourselves with a larger number of tradesmen than we could employ. I regard this improvership as a sort of niche, not available to boys outside, where a boy can continue his training and wait for promotion to a definite post. Now how can we do away with that system&#x003F; In the post office, he is kept in a waiting place until there is a vacancy for him in the postal service. He is not compelled to stop there, nor does he lose anything. He is just as free as an outside apprentice to go out into the trade if he wants to. There is one way I am prepared to help. Very often these improvers are sent to out-stations and do mechanic&#x2019;s work without supervision at an improver&#x2019;s wages. I am making representations to the Public Service Commission with a view to increasing the wages paid to these improvers, who go to out stations.</p>

<p>That is the provision made for them by which, instead of cutting themselves off from the postal service and waiting for employment, they can at least remain in the same position until a journeyman is needed. I have seen many hardships occasioned through lads after apprenticship having to wait to secure work as a tradesman, and I would welcome, even in private employment, a position where a boy could remain in a post at the wages of his last year <span class="col_4031-4032" refersTo="page_2088"/>until he is able to find a suitable job. The hon. member for Cathcart (Mr. van Coller) dealt with the question of traders and wants to know why they pay more than farmers. But I do not know any difference between traders and the rest of the community. Everyone in this House knows that a definite rate was laid down for farmers and we cannot extend that uneconomic rate to other members of the community&#x2014;to traders for instance&#x2014;who are not performing the same development work as farmers. The hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson) wants to know what consideration postal officials have in regard to penalties inflicted for non-delivery of mails.

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Col. M. S. W. du Toit) pointed out that services are given to one section at a higher rate than to another section. That often comes about through the original exchange becoming overburdened and subscribers having to be taken a longer distance to another exchange. When they apply for these things this is all explained to them. It is only by this method, until reorganisation takes place, that this service can be given. In regard to better night services for outside districts, the hon. member points out the difficulty of private persons attending to these telephone exchanges. He says that we ought to find some permanent employee to do it. I have just been reading a report of the postal department in New Zealand. They have an enormous system of small exchanges in the country districts and they are entirely in the hands of the community themselves. They get service at cheap rates, but they are dearer than they are here. Very often the community itself has to provide a person to run these exchanges. It is only by that method that you will get such development. New Zealand has encouraged co-operation amongst the people in the districts to provide themselves with telephone services, and things of that sort and to run them according to their own requirements, until the exchanges are put on a paying basis. Then they expect the Government to come along and provide full time servants. Here you ask, as soon as you are given a service, that the Government should provide full time servants by the department. The hon. member for Aliwal North (Mr. Sephton) complains of the type of instrument he has to use. I sympathize with him. I agree that these things are out of date. I would, however, tell him that we are not installing those instruments now. The question has been raised of the lighting of aerodromes. I think the various municipalities are fully alive to the necessity of lighting up aerodromes. We know that all sorts of machinery of that kind is being installed by the municipalities in the different places. After all flying is a small thing yet. No doubt the municipalities will provide other services that are required when development demands it. The hon. member for Swellendam (Mr. Wolfaard) complains that there are very few telephones in his district. I can only say that we are getting on with construction everywhere as rapidly as possible. We cannot give any guarantee to any particular place beyond the programme we have entered into for the coming year. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) mentioned this afternoon the question of freight rates. We have a freight board in South Africa at the present time and we are watching very closely the question of freights. I would like to point out that, personally, I am not too optimistic that any overtures to the present contractors are likely to result in the reductions which he hopes will be effected. The present contract was only effected after great difficulty and after several breakdowns. The proper time to go into this matter is when we are making another contract. All I can promise is that when that time comes along to make another mail contract I shall do my best to secure the reductions which I think are necessary.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the question of the service on trunk lines between the large cities. I understand that the policy of the department is that until telephone calls have increased on the trunk lines it will be impossible to decrease the charges for that service. I commend to the hon. Minister the opposite method. That is to take the capacity of the line and satisfy yourself as to what quantity of messages that line can carry and then put down a rate, which, when that line is working to a reasonable extent, the line will pay. I feel that the lines are not paying because the charges are too high. If the hon. Minister will take that point of view and make the rate much lower I think it would induce business. I do believe that at the right price a lot of business on the trunk lines will result. I also want to ask the hon.

<p>I congratulate the Minister on his very interesting review of the position and on the very temperate manner in which he made his reply. I was delighted, and I am sure so were all the other hon. members, and with very much of his review I entirely agree. In fact, he has had much the same experience as I had myself, but I must join issue with him on two or three points. With regard to the telephone supply question, he rather hinted that I was somewhat to blame, but it was not so. I had the same experience he is probably having to-day in regard to the getting of money, and if he will go back into the records he will see that the Chief Engineer was constantly making representations that this, that and the other should be provided as soon as possible. I rather backed up the Chief Engineer for I found that some blocking influence was in the way. In regard to the introduction of the nine o&#x2019;clock part-time operators, I was never in favour of it as it is against trade union principles and my own principles. I wanted to increase the number of men employed as night operators and a re-arrangement of the shifts. Part-time is a temporary arrangement to meet the transition period. Unfortunately I left before we had an opportunity to put it into force, but I am not here to defend my administration. With regard to the apprentices, the Minister seems to find himself up against a brick wall. It is most desirable to shorten the waiting period, for when you keep the improvers on at &#x00A3;210 a year rising by annual increases of &#x00A3;15 to a maximum of &#x00A3;300, you are actually employing fully qualified men at improvers&#x2019; wages and so you are making use of cheap labour. I tried to get the waiting period shortened, and I hope the Minister will succeed in that direction. It is not right to make a comparison with payments outside the service. The comparison made by the association was made in order to draw attention to the tremendous difference in wages, and they asked that after one year, as journeymen they should reach the &#x00A3;285 scale. I cannot accept the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in regard to wireless, for that is an old story and the present British Government is having a very big fight to prevent the wireless company getting all wireless communications into their grip. The Minister should call a halt, but I am afraid the force of circumstances will make him agree with the company&#x2019;s proposal. The Minister will have to wait the company&#x2019;s good time for a reduction in rates. That is a very illuminating illustration of how we are at the disposal of big finance. But the Radio Act is not dead, and the Minister before he can allow the Wireless Company to go on with the Beam system will have to have the original Act amended, or he will find himself &#x201C;in the soup&#x201D; through having made an arrangement and having to come to Parliament for ratification. I suppose, after all, this is only another instance of the Government&#x2019;s abuse of the privileges of Parliament. I agree the Act must be amended as Beam has taken the place of Radio so far as commercial messages are concerned, but in time of national difficulty, we must have a radio system so that we can communicate with all parts of the world. The Minister is wrong in giving the Wireless Company a licence under the Radio Act. I take umbrage at what the Minister says in regard to South African aviation, and in agreeing that Imperial Airways shall &#x201C;collar&#x201D; our internal aviation. India was also asked to do the same thing, but it made a contribution to the cost of the trunk route from England and insisted that the Imperial Airways service should stop at Karachi, and India is doing internal distribution herself. That is what I ask should be done here, not that we should cut off any hope of aerial communication between Britain and South Africa. We would be fools indeed if we allowed Imperial Airways with the assistance of our own money to &#x201C;collar&#x201D; our internal means of aerial communication. When the Minister rather hints that we have not qualified men to deal with large aeroplanes I join issue with him. We have some of the finest human material in South Africa that it is possible to find in the world&#x2014;pilots and ground engineering staff. I believe all our Union pilots at one time belonged to the South African Flying Corps. What they do not know about it is not worth while. I do ask him to reconsider the position, not from the point of view of stopping Imperial Airways, but to see that our own people get a square deal.</p>

<p>I think the Minister should tell us under what conditions night operators are working. I have been told that some of these unfortunate men have been in the service for 15 years, and have been night operators during the whole of their official existence. They never come on in the daytime. They lead an unnatural owl-like life. We know that a man who has to sleep in the daytime does not get the same amount of rest as he ought to. If it is as I have stated, it is a serious defect in our system. Another question I would like to ask the Minister is what firm does the contract for our postage stamps, because the same objections and grievances we heard two years ago as to the non-adhesiye nature of these stamps still hold good to-day. I have frequently to use a pot of stic-phast in order to put on the stamps. It is so unfair; a stamp drops off, and your correspondent is mulcted 2d. which the department charges for its own negligence, besides getting the penny for the stamp. Whoever is the contractor ought to be pulled up. An hon. member two years ago said that what was wanted was the same adhesive dualities as the Minister himself had. Then it is common cause that postmen are very seriously overworked, and if the Minister would double the supply of post-boxes and halve their price, he would go far to lighten the work of these postmen. The man who has a postbox acts as his own postman. I think business men ought to be forced to rent post-boxes. I have to send a letter, say, to a dairyman every month, and so have others, and the postboys have to go perhaps 15 times with letters to that business man who is too stingy to rent a box. Then the postboys have to go back with the receipts, each bearing a half-penny <span class="col_4035-4036" refersTo="page_2090"/>stamp, so that this human vehicle is run at less than a penny a mile, less than a Baby Austin. The man who rents a postbox probably saves the department &#x00A3;10 a year, and it would be an absolute saving, I believe, if you gave a man a postbox free. I simply make this suggestion to the Minister for digestion; if he could double or treble the number of postboxes, he would largely lighten the labour of the postmen and post office boys.</p>

First of all, are these two subsidies going to continue concurrently, and, secondly, what are we getting for this &#x00A3;8,000&#x003F; Are we getting any return, or is there likely to be any in the future&#x003F; With regard to the &#x00A3;400,000 to the Trans-continental Imperial Airways, what do we expect to get out of that?</p>

<p>I must say it was startling to listen to the Minister defending an expenditure of something like &#x00A3;400,000 referred to just now by the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) in favour of Imperial Airways, an expenditure which, if it had been incurred by the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) or his Government would mean that the welkin would have rung by those who spoke of South Africa alone. The point to which I want to draw attention is that it seems to me an unbusinesslike arrangement, where at one and the same time we are paying a subsidy of &#x00A3;8,000 per annum for the development of aviation in the Union, and towards the maintenance of an aviation company run by South Africans, and we are committed to &#x00A3;400,000 in favour of a company who, whatever useful work they are doing towards opening up the continent, are likely to freeze out our own South African company; running a service to Cape Town, and making it unpayable for the South African company to exist. When the Minister is asked about imposing a condition such as I have suggested, he tells us that he does not think we nave suitable people in the Union to carry out this work. I do not think we should allow the South African company to be frozen out. The South African company should be allowed a clear run. That is an ordinary business proposition, and to-day we are faced with the position that the Government in a most unbusinesslike manner is paying two subsidies, to two competing companies.</p>

<p>The Minister seems to be under the impression that when I pleaded for telephone service for the individual farmer, that I was asking for increased expenditure. What I intended was that the farmer who put in his application would have to supply all the transport, and the labour for digging holes for the poles and so forth. In other words, the service that would be rendered by the farmer would go against the cost of that particular line, so that the department would get the work done for less than under the old system with the gangs. The Minister can go on with that work with a cheerful heart. I do not think there is any government service more appreciated by the farming community than the construction of telephone lines throughout the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) has suggested that we should initiate an enquiry into the rates on trunk lines, and ascertain what the full capacity of a line is, and what the charge would be if it were reasonably used. I do not see how you are going to make the trunk lines pay in that way. It means that when the lines are only moderately used, we shall be losing money. With regard to the Transvaal telephone directory, I am asked whether it cannot be made to pay. The fact of the matter is that the directory is too large. With a small directory it is quite easy to canvass for advertisements, and to make a profit and a profit is made out of the smaller directories. No one wants to use a very large directory, and the difficulty is in getting the number of subscribers into a directory in such a way that it will pay. If the hon. member thinks that he could get a printer in the Transvaal to take the thing on as a speculation, and present a directory which is not too bulky, I am afraid he is mistaken. We tried it, and we did not succeed. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) has asked me to see that the progress of the apprentices is not stopped. I would like once again to point out that there is no comparison between State employment and private employment. A journeyman in the post office does not stop at a journeyman&#x2019;s wages for his whole period of service, and he is allowed to count his pension from the third year of his apprenticeship. The hon. member asks that when an apprentice or an improver is asked to perform journeyman&#x2019;s work without the supervision of a journeyman, he should receive a higher rate of pay, if not a journeyman&#x2019;s rate of pay. I promise the hon. member that I will make representations in that regard. I want to read section 5 of the Radio Act for the information of the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley), who says I had no right to issue a licence to the present Wireless Company&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(5) (1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the Postmaster-General shall have the exclusive privilege of transmitting and receiving radio telegrams. (2) Under such conditions as he may deem fit to impose, and on payment of such fee as he may in the particular case or generally by regulation prescribe, the Postmaster-General may grant a licence to any person to accept, transmit or receive radio telegrams, and to make in respect of such transmission or reception such charges as may from time to time be authorized by the Postmaster-General.

The origin of the zoo was a certain collection of animals which Mr. Rhodes left on his estate. Somebody suggested that the animals should be brought down to the main road. They were brought down and the result has been some cruelty to the animals and a very unsightly zoo. On the other hand, the question is what to do with the animals. Strong representations were made to us by the municipality to house the animals in the proper way. We did not agree to that. We offered to give the animals to the municipality to take away. But finally we agreed to pay half the cost if the municipality would pay the other half, so that the animals could be taken further back and given proper quarters.</p>

<p>I wish to know under whose authority Gruut Schoor Avenue has been closed. From time immemorial the avenue leading up to Rhodes Drive from the Rondebosch Main Road has been open, but now there is no access to it. There are a couple of gates on the Groot Schuur side, flanked by a kind of sentry box, so seemingly it is more difficult to reach Groot Schuur than it is to get to Buckingham Palace, for at any rate you can drive up to Buckingham Palace in a taxi-cab. Now our Prime Minister is entirely secluded in his official residence. On the main road side a public road has been entirely closed, and a pair of gates has been erected. A number of celebrated men have lived a Groot Schuur in past years, and they did not seem to suffer any great inconvenience because the public had free access to the place. Rhodes lived there for years, and the public were allowed to go there freely. Jameson and the leader of our party also lived there, and, during their residence, the access of the public was not restricted, but now the place is secluded for the benefit of the Prime Minister.

They adopted the expedient of dismissing their men and then re-engaging them after some weeks, so that men who had been getting &#x00A3;6 6s. a week were taken on again at &#x00A3;5 a week. They were Government contractors, and had a contract with the Education Department, and in this contract there is a fair wage clause. Will the Minister go into the matter and, if there is no fair wage clause in these contracts, see that one is introduced&#x003F; There is our old friend who supplied tents to the postal department. I had a little breeze with that firm when I was in office because they were imposing unfair conditions on their employees. I got to the expedient of going to the tender board and getting them not to accept any tenders from this firm until it had convinced us it had returned to the good old conditions which obtained previously; and they came to heel. The tender of that firm was not accepted, but a higher one was which conformed to trade union conditions, and Fram Brothers came to heel like a shot. They came to see me and with Mr. Andrews a board was set up, they became enthusiastic about the new conditions and took quite a leading part in that direction&#x2014;of having fair wage conditions &#x2014;but now they have gone back bang to the old conditions.

<p>In reply to what the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) has said regarding the closing of the road leading to Groot Schuur, this was done by our district engineer after the Prime Minister had expressed the desire that there should be greater privacy. Conditions have changed since the time of which the hon. member speaks, and since Cecil Rhodes was there. It is now a public holiday resort and all sorts of cars use that road for joy rides and other purposes until it has become necessary to close it; it is only closed when the Prime Minister is not in residence. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Madeley) has taken me to task for dismissing, as he said, 80 men employed by the Public Works Department, but I wonder what he and the rest of the House would have said, if I had continued to employ them without any work to give them&#x003F; The position is, the Public Works Department performed all the work for the Transvaal provincial authorities, but the <span class="col_4041-4042" refersTo="page_2093"/>administrator notified the department that he did not desire them to give service in certain regards in the future. The province told us they were going to engage a private architect and private contractors to do their work in future and the school boards and school committees would make their own arrangements. By this we lost at least 50 per cent, of the work we have been doing. In the long run the provincial authorities will be convinced that they did the wrong thing, but am I to carry a staff on the Witwatersrand for whom I have no work, and for whom I have no vote on the estimates&#x003F; I do not think the hon. member is entitled to say that I deliberately dismissed these men at a time when unemployment was rife in the country. It was for a very good reason. We have carried on negotiations since with the administrator, and we are waiting to see what modification there will be of the administrator&#x2019;s original proposal. The hon. member complained with regard to the supply of furniture. That is a supply of furniture to the provincial education department, and I have no right to step in there. With regard to the other matter mentioned by him, when I looked into it I found that the complaints of the trades union were not borne out.

From my experience at that time, I am satisfied they have done the same thing again. Mr. Andrews does not speak without his book. He satisfies himself as to the absolute facts before he makes any charge. As to the discharge of the men, what I complained about was that the Government have been curtailing public works activities in a time of depression when everybody else is sacking men. A time of depression is a time for the drawing up of a programme of public works by the Government, and the Minister in the past has preached that with me. I am not asking the Government to agree to a programme of public works that are not required. The public works I am speaking of are required. Buildings are required all over the country. He could employ his 80 men with the plant, thus rendering the useless plant very profitable in doing that work.

<p>I would like more information about the closing of the Groot Schuur Avenue. I have always regarded it as a public thoroughfare which it used to a considerable extent by the public and I would like to know whether the Government took legal opinion before taking steps to restrict the public right of way. There are houses on one side of Groot Schuur Avenue and I take it the occupants of those houses have a right to access to the main road. That avenue has always been the main method of access to the Groot Schuur estate. People arrive in great numbers by tram and walk up the avenue towards Groot Schuur. If that is closed to them, the only other reasonable method of access to the estate is by Newlands Avenue, or via Mowbray. The only reason the Minister has given for closing the road is that the Prime Minister requires greater privacy&#x2014;that there is a daily pilgrimage of the public up the avenue. This, from a member of the Government that professes it came into power to protect the interests of the people, is most amazing.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words on this matter because I do not want any doubt to exist about it. What, in the first place, is the position of Groot Schuur&#x003F; By the will of the late Cecil Rhodes, Groot Schuur was bequeathed to the Prime Minister of the Union. It was left to the trustees under the will to see that Groot Schuur was maintained on a certain basis, viz., that the gardens, buildings, etc., were kept up in the condition they were in at his death, and also that certain things were to be kept in order. That was the mandate to his trustees, who had to find the necessary money out of his estate. The trustees subsequently preferred to be relieved of their trust, and they came to the Government to transfer the obligation to the Government. The Government agreed, and the money was transferred to the Government. It is now the duty of the Government to maintain that estate in a proper condition, as the trustees did before them, and as the will instructed them to do. The property practically belongs to the Prime Minister of the day. As long as he is there he is practically the trustee to see that everything remains as it is for his successor. Since I entered into possession, I have considered it my duty to see that that estate, in the first place, is kept in proper condition, and let me say that in order to do that, various improvements have been made during my time which became necessary to maintain the estate in the same order that it was left in. The duty of the Prime Minister of the day is also to see that the position does not become worse, i.e., that rights are obtained against that property which no one is entitled to. What is the position now&#x003F; The road consists of two parts, one section is known <span class="col_4043-4044" refersTo="page_2094"/>as Grand Avenue, which runs from the main road for at most 300 yards; from there the road to De Waal drive is a private road. As for the Avenue, the properties either belong to the Government or will very soon do so. That Avenue is not a public road either. At the sale it was stipulated at the time that those who had plots adjoining it would have the right to use it, and nothing more. But, as I have said, all those properties already belong to the Government practically if not formally. So much with regard to the 300 yards. The rest of the road is private property. What then is the position of affairs&#x003F; Since I have been there, and before my arrival, use has been made of that road as if it was a public road, with the result that prescriptive rights might have come into existence very soon. As trustee I considered it my duty to see that no prescriptive rights were acquired to that road. That was not all. In the meantime that road was not only used as a public road, but it was even more used than the De Waal drive. Everybody went here and there along it to get to and from the main road and the De Waal drive. The position was such that it was impossible for the Governor-General to be on the road behind his house without incurring the danger of being run down. On one or two occasions he was almost run down because the people race with reckless speed past the house. I immediately stopped it, and let me say honestly that if I had to occupy Groot Schuur on the condition that anyone who wanted to see anything in the Peninsula should have the right to come there, then I would respectfully decline, and no Prime Minister would like to live there in such circumstances. Accordingly I went to the Department of Public Works to do something to stop prescription from being acquired over that road. There were only a few more years to run and any member of the public would have been entitled to plead prescription. Well, I went to the department to say that something must be done to stop that, and also to stop an improper use being made of the road. Two gates were put up, one at the lower end, at the main road, and the other at the top road, the De Waal drive. No one is stopped who, in a proper manner, wants to go and view the property, or to drive past there, but everyone is prevented from using it as a public racing track. The position was such that it was no longer possible to walk about the paths without your life being in danger every minute, as long as the Governor-General lives there the closing at night and during the day is maintained in such a way that if anyone wants to enter he must first stop, or approach more slowly. There is an ordinary road, the ordinary street which is merely a detour of a few hundred yards, and rather than stop or of almost stopping, the people now drive round the other way, as they ought to do. I also believe that when the Governor-General and I have left there it is the intention of the Public Works Department to open the road again. Both objects are therefore obtained. Groot Schuur is maintained as a decent place to live in, and in addition, the rights thereof as entrusted to the Prime Minister of the day, will not be taken away.</p>

<p>There appears to be some inconsistency between what the Minister of Public Works said and what the Prime Minister said. I understood the Minister to say that this road was closed to the public to ensure greater privacy to the Prime Minister. Now the latter&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister put it on that ground, but now the Prime Minister says that if the public are prepared to use the road in an orderly manner, they are not prevented from doing so. Certainly, those gates have diminished the use the public made of those roads. The Prime Minister is not quite consistent when he spoke of the provision in Rhodes&#x2019; will that this estate should be kept open to the public.</p>

<p>The estate is used very generally by the public of Cape Town for the purpose of recreation. As for the public acquiring prescription over that road, it does not seem to me necessary to close the avenue for five months of the year; it would be amply sufficient to have it closed for one day in the year at the very most. If a man was stationed there for one day in the year to prevent people going through it would be ample to preserve that road as a private one.</p>

<p>I accept all responsibility for as long as I am there, but I wish to say that the Prime Minister of the day and not the Government or the Parliament has all the say. The Prime Minister of the day is the only person who has any authority in the matter and I do not see with what right the hon. member, or anyone else in the House, can dictate to me or any Prime Minister of the day what we are to do. As long as I am there Groote Schuur will not be used in any way to the detriment of any future Prime Minister who will have to live there. I am not only there to maintain my own rights, but also to see that those who come after me will be able to live there in the way the late Cecil Rhodes intended. The hon. member speaks as if the rights were granted under the will to the public to come there. The public have not the least right and if they are allowed during the absence of the Prime Minister, if the public obtain the fullest rights to wander about the garden and to go in and out of the house then it is a privilege which is granted by the Prime Minister of the day and nothing else. It is not true that on previous occasions, or under previous Prime Ministers the public have had the right of going there during the period of residence of the Prime Minister. Every time the Prime Minister went there it was the custom to put up a notice stating that as long <span class="col_4045-4046" refersTo="page_2095"/>as the Prime Minister was in residence access to the grounds was prohibited. Moreover, it would be an unheard of thing to allow the whole of Cape Town to be trotting about your garden. I do not know whether the hon. member has had any experience of what this means. It has happened in my case, that when I came out of the house the public were sitting on the benches on my back stoep.</p>

<p>I am glad the Prime Minister has made the explanation he has, and I recognise that he, not being of that democratic nature that his predecessors were, objects to constant traffic on this road. What I suggest to the Minister is whether he could not investigate and see if another road cannot be obtained so that access can be given to the estate from the main road without going past Groot Schuur house. I quite agree with the Prime Minister that it is rather distressing to see the way people exercise their right of walking about the grounds and the garden, and that is why I make this suggestion for the finding of another road to the Minister.</p>
