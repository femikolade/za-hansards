<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>In moving the notice of motion standing in my name, I propose to omit the name of Mr. Nieuwenhuize, and to substitute the name of Mr. Scholtz. The position is that the Select Committee to which the <i>Precious Stones Bill</i> was referred during last session, dealt with matters concerning the Gold Law, whereas matters affecting alluvial diamonds will now have to be considered. The hon. member for Lydenburg (Mr. Nieuwenhuize) has approached me and suggested that his name should now be omitted from the Committee, and as the hon. member for Barkly (Mr. Scholtz) takes a great interest in the question of alluvial diamonds, I shall propose that his name be substituted for that of Mr. Nieuwenhuize.</p>
