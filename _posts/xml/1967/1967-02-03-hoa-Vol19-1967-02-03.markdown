<from>Mrs. C. D. TAYLOR asked the Minister of Sport and Recreation:</from>

<p>What are the requirements for a body in order to be considered as a sporting body for the purpose of the allocation of <i>ad hoc</i> grants by his Department in terms of the announcement made in Pretoria on 12th December, 1966.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_sport_and_recreation" to="#taylor">

<from>The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION:</from>

<p>In order to qualify for grants by the Department of Sport and Recreation, a sports body is in the first instance required to furnish evidence that it is a <i>bona fide</i> amateur sports body. Other requirements are that it must give reasonable assurance that it is able to conduct its affairs in a proper manner&#x2014;this includes the control of finances. On account of the fact that there are thousands of sports associations in the Republic, preference is given to applications by national governing bodies of amateur sport or applications which are sponsored by them. The criteria which are applied when projects are considered are as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_0310"/>(i) the need for the project;</li>

<li>(ii) the extent of participation in sport;</li>

<li>(iii) <i>per capita</i> cost of participation;</li>

<li>(iv) achievements of representatives selected;</li>

<li>(v) international standing of the sport concerned;</li>

<li>(vi) influence that participation in specific sport or recreational activity will exercise on the general health and fitness of the nation;</li>

<li>(vii) financial contribution the applying body is prepared to make;</li>

<li>(viii) extent to which the organization can rely on steady sources of income; and</li>

<li>(ix) extent to which the aid sought will ensure continuity and comprehensiveness of functioning.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the case of non-White sporting bodies, applications should be made to the government department under which the particular population group falls. If requested to do so by the relevant department, the Department of Sport and Recreation will evaluate applications and make recommendations as well as provide technical services in the field of sport and recreation.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned, I was explaining why this side of the House was of the opinion that a person who is <span class="col_607-608" refersTo="page_0321"/>a communist should not be entitled to practise. I pointed out that a person who does not respect the norms of the society in which he practises was not entitled to practise. Therefore, although he may be an honest and a very competent person, it is undesirable, on account of his philosophy of life, to allow him to practise as a representative of the legal profession. We should not lose sight of the fact that in terms of the Suppression of Communism Act any person is given the right, before his name is placed on the list, to object to it and is then afforded an opportunity to prove why his name should not be placed on the list. The concept &#x201C;Communism&#x201D; is defined in the Act as the doctrine of Marxian socialism as expounded by Lenin or Trotsky, but the definition goes further and I should like to read it to show in what a serious light the danger of Communism should be regarded. Paragraph (b) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which aims at bringing about any political, industrial, social or economic change within the Union by the promotion of disturbance or disorder, by unlawful acts or omissions or by the threat of such acts or omissions or by means which include the promotion of disturbance or disorder, or such acts or omissions or threat.</block>

<p>We can therefore never allow any person who is set on disregarding the laws of the country or on overthrowing the Government by the use of force, to be entitled to practise.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have now spoken about the listed person, but where we come to the case where the person concerned has already committed an offence against the law, then naturally the position is much worse, because such a person has already been found guilty of a serious offence by the court. In that case, therefore, the position is much worse and it is obvious that such a person should not be entitled to practise. But we must remember that if that person&#x2019;s ideology, his view, were to take root in our country&#x2014;in which so many different races with so many different degrees of civilization are living&#x2014;it would cause indescribable misery not only to a few individuals, but to millions of people. Unfortunately, however, I have to return to a point which I raised yesterday, and in my opinion it is really the crux of this entire debate, namely the Opposition&#x2019;s request that such a person should be taken to court. I think that is what this whole debate is about. The Opposition will say that, seeing that I am so sure and we on this side are so sure that Communism is such a danger, a court will surely also decide that a communist may not practise. Then they ask why we do not take them to court, because according to several members on that side of the House they also say that they are against it that a communist should be allowed to practise. But they say, and that is also stated in their amendment, that such a person should be taken to court, and unfortunately I have to furnish a few more details about this point.</p>

<p>If, according to their amendment, the Attorney-General goes to court to apply for the removal of the person&#x2019;s name from the roll, the onus rests on the Attorney-General to prove that that person is a communist before the court will remove his name from the roll.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that he was against it that a communist should be allowed to practise. In other words, he agrees, and the hon. member for Green Point also said that he agrees, with the Bar Council of America, which has decided that a communist is unfit to practise.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is not the only reason, but I am only dealing with the reasons which we want to include in the Act. The onus of proving that that person is a communist will rest on the Attorney-General. Now I want to ask the hon. the Opposition whether they think it is possible to prove in a court that a person is a communist, because we have to do with an ideology here. How can a man&#x2019;s line of thought be proved in a court, except in the case where it can be proved that he is a member of a communist party. In that case, of course, there is the necessary evidence, but there are so many thousands of persons who have resigned as members. As a result such a person&#x2019;s name is not on the list of members and consequently his membership cannot be proved. His guilt can be proved in two ways only. In the first case there is the position that the person has already been listed by the liquidator, but the superior court cannot base its judgment on the finding of an inferior court. The result is that the superior court cannot take into account the finding of the liquidator in arriving at its decision. That is clear. The court must make its own finding; therefore all the evidence itself must be led in the court. When the case came up before the liquidator, on what information did the State base its case? In the first place, the State made use of spies. If such a spy&#x2019;s identity is revealed in court, the State loses his further services, but in order to place the person concerned on the list, it was not necessary to reveal the spy&#x2019;s identity. In addition, when the case came up before the liquidator, use was made of the person&#x2019;s colleagues who gave him away. That person who has given him away is afraid to appear in a public court, because he will have his other fellow-communists to contend with and he is afraid that they will take revenge. Then the hon. member for Pinelands interupted me and asked me why there had been other cases in connection with Communism <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_0322"/>in which persons were found guilty in certain instances. What was the position there? In those cases the State also made use of these two methods. In the first case the State made use of the spy, and by so doing revealed his identity and consequently lost his services. But it was worth losing his services, because the ringleaders could then be brought to book. The leaders of the communists were brought to book and sent to gaol for years. But it is not worth revealing such a spy&#x2019;s identity in order to disqualify a person from practising. That is the difference.</p>

<p>What is the difference as far as the witnesses are concerned? When a man is tried in public, we make use of his accomplices if we can, persons who committed the crime along with him. How does one get evidence from such persons? You get their evidence by virtually bribing them, by indemnifying them against imprisonment for many years. That is the only way in which you can get such a person to give evidence in public. It is worth the risk for the person to give evidence because he is indemnified against prosecution. He has committed a crime and could also have been sentenced. This does not apply in the case of the fellow-communist who has supplied the liquidator with information against his colleagues. One cannot use him because one cannot reward him. One is not concerned with a crime in that case. One is only concerned with a person who has to come and give evidence that someone is a communist. Consequently one cannot give that person any reward for his evidence in public, because he is not liable to imprisonment. Why would he then give information in public against his comrade, who is also a communist? Therefore it simply is the position that in practice it is quite impossible to carry out that proposal put forward by the Opposition. In other words, if such a proposal were accepted, the action we are allowed to take would be watered down to such an extent that it would be quite useless.</p>

<p>The Opposition will recall that in all the debates on the principal Act&#x2014;most of us were probably not here, but I was here when various amendments were subsequently made &#x2014;they always declared that they too were against communism, but they are always making suggestions to water down action to such an extent that it would be hopeless to act.</p>

<p>Sir. all that the hon. member can prove is that that proposal can work in the case of crimes. With that I agree. As regards the last part, namely the crimes, the Attorney-General can go to court and have the person disqualified in that way. That is so. But, to tell the truth, in that case it is not even necessary to have this in the Act, because the Law Society ought to act in the case of such offences. I am, however, speaking about the first part now, in connection with listed communists.</p>

<p>This Act was passed in 1950. That is a good many years ago. It is 17 years ago. Several amendments were made subsequently. I shall accept that in this period of 17 years hundreds of persons were listed. I remember that whenever the Opposition raised objections to the effect that a court should decide upon the matter, the hon. the Minister of Justice pointed out how impracticable it was to go to court, as have also done now. The hon. the Minister invited the Opposition, if they heard of any person who had been invalidly listed, to mention that person&#x2019;s name here in Parliament. The matter could then be investigated. It is now 17 years since that was said, and in those 17 years the Opposition has not mentioned one person&#x2019;s name who has been invalidly listed.</p>

<p>Surely the man will tell you what the circumstances are and that he is completely innocent. It would be a member&#x2019;s duty, if a person makes a statement under oath, to mention the name here and to ask that the matter be investigated. But that has never been done. Not in one case out of hundreds. The result is that we may safety accept that those persons are in fact communists. That is why we are now introducing this legislation, because we can in fact classify them as communists. I think I have said enough in connection with the court and in connection with the Opposition&#x2019;s approach. I just want to say that we are very grateful for the way in which the Departments of Justice and Police <span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_0323"/>have repulsed communism in this country, but the threat is still there. Whenever we see that there is any loophole, it is our duty to close it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have many objections to this Bill and they go well beyond the objections which have so far been voiced by the official Opposition. To a great extent, in fact almost entirely, the objections of the official Opposition have centred around clause 2 of the Bill. I too, of course, object to that clause, which is the clause that is going to disqualify lawyers and advocates who have been listed or convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act. My objections, however, go much further than this. I also object strongly to clause 1 of this Bill. I have objections to clause 3, which places a further onus of proof of innocence on the accused and I dislike the additional powers taken under clause 4. In other words, since this is a four-clause Bill to all intents and purposes, I object to this Bill in its entirety.</p>

<p><i>In toto.</i></p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. <i>in toto</i>, as the hon. the Minister has interjected. I shall give my specific objections in a moment, but first there are one or two objections in principle which I wish to voice against this Bill.</p>

<p>The first and most important objection is in regard to the retrospective nature of this Bill. I object most strongly to legislation being introduced which makes people subject to penalty for actions which were perfectly legal when they performed those actions and now in retrospect, when a new Act is placed on the Statute Book, they are in jeopardy because of something which they did in the past.</p>

<p>In America such an Act would be unconstitutional and would not be allowed on the floor of Congress, nor would it be allowed to appear on the Statute Book. So I have the greatest objection to Bills of this nature. I object, too, on account of the fact that this is another one of those Bills extending the vast powers already held by the Minister of Justice under the Suppression of Communism Act. Since the original Act was passed, way back in 1950, we have had no less than seven amending Bills dealing with more than 80 amendments. Every time a new amending Bill came before the House and every time amendments to the original Act were passed, further powers were granted to the Minister, powers which enabled him to act, in many cases without the supervision of the courts of law.</p>

<p>The Bill we are dealing with is another Bill of this nature and, consequently, I object to it <i>in toto.</i> The trouble is that when we put measures like this on the Statute Book, nobody realizes how far and how widely they are going to be used. Whereas originally they might have been confined in their application only to people who were in fact members of the Communist Party and actively engaged in Communism as such, over the years one finds that those powers have been used in ever-widening circles until people who do not have the remotest connection with Communism can, simply by the whim of the Minister acting&#x2014; and this is the point I shall stress&#x2014;on the advice of the Special Branch, be made to suffer all the penalties of real communists. There are people to-day in South Africa who have been banned or are being restricted, people who have had to leave South Africa on exit permits but who have never had the slightest connection with Communism. Their only sin has been that they have objected strongly to the racial policy of this Government. Yet the Anti-Communist Act was used against those persons to restrict their activities in fields which had nothing to do with Communism but merely were aimed at the racial policies of the Government. As I have said, unfortunately one finds that the Minister has to act by virtue of these wide powers in terms of recommendations which are made to him by the Special Branch.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing in this Bill about those people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. there is. It is on the instructions of the Special Branch that people get listed. I think it is no exaggeration to say that as far as this section of the Department of Justice is concerned, it is the Special Branch who run it. Nobody else has any say. The Special Branch hands down its recommendations and the Minister acts upon them.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said, this Bill has four clauses and although I object also to the last two, I particularly object to the first two. I should also like to say something about clause 1, a clause which has so far largely been neglected. To my mind, this clause is just as important as the clause dealing with the disqualification of lawyers and advocates. As the clause reads, it extends powers which the hon. the Minister already has under section 5<i>ter</i> of the principal Act and enables him, by notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, to prohibit all persons whose names appear on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in section 8 of the Act, that is the liquidator, or any person who has been served with a restriction or prohibition notice under the Suppression of Communism Act, or any, person who was at any time&#x2014;here again the retrospective nature of this provision&#x2014;an office-bearer or officer or a member of any organization which has been declared to be an unlawful organization, from becoming office-bearers of certain other organizations, also published in the <i>Gazette</i> or&#x2014;and these are the extending provisions&#x2014;making or receiving any contribution of any kind to the direct or indirect benefit, or participating in any way in any activity, of any particular organization, or any organization of a nature or class specified in the notice, without the special permission of the Minister. As I have already pointed out, nobody has thus far examined this clause in any detail but I wish to do so now. Already we have had such a <span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_0324"/>notice gazetted. Such a notice was gazetted some years ago but nobody took a great deal of notice of it. It was gazetted in 1962. Thereby the then Minister of Justice, in terms of the powers he then had, prohibited all persons whose names appeared on any list in the custody of the liquidator, or who were office-bearers or members of any organization which was banned or declared an unlawful organization, or in respect of whom any prohibition had been issued under the Suppression of Communism Act, from becoming office-bearers of certain organizations which were then listed. There were 36 of these organizations, including the Civil Rights League, an organization which, to my mind, is certainly not a communist organization, and the Students&#x2019; Liberal Association. In the second part of that notice &#x2014;and this to me is the overbearing part of it&#x2014; they were prohibited from becoming officebearers or members of any organization which in any manner was affiliated to a subsidiary of any of the listed organizations, or which was calculated to promote any of the aims of these organizations. This is very wide indeed. Furthermore&#x2014;and this is the most important of all&#x2014;they may not become members or take part in any activity of any organization which in any manner propagates, defends, attacks, criticizes or discusses any form of State or any principle or policy of the Government or the State, or which in any manner undermines the authority of the Government or the State.</p>

<p>This prohibition can extend, in fact, to anybody who was at any time a member of an organization which was perfectly legal when he belonged to it&#x2026; Let me take one such specific organization, namely the Defence and Aid. This was a perfectly legal organization which had operated for several years quite legally. Yet every person who was a member of this organization in the past may not now take part in any way in any organization which even discusses Government policy. But what has this got to do with Communism <i>per se?</i> What has this to do with the dangerous people referred to by the hon. member for Heilbron yesterday? What has this to do even with the people the Minister specified? The hon. the Minister was not even aware that listed people were included. But this goes much further than listed people. I say that clause 1, as it will now read in its amended form, is so widely worded that anybody who was a member of, let us say, Defence and Aid, a perfect legal activity at the time, can now be prohibited under severe penalties&#x2014;up to three years&#x2019; imprisonment&#x2014;of taking part in any activity of any organization which discusses or criticizes State policy. Is this a measure aimed at Communism, or is it aimed at intimidating people the Minister is advised to take action against by the Special Branch? Interestingly enough, although the notice was gazetted way back in 1962, it was only recently, I think in December last year, acted upon. Then the Commissioner of Police drew this notice to the attention of a selected group of people&#x2014;a small group, five or six of them. He also assured the country in a Press statement that the incident concerned only specific individuals in Port Elizabeth and that no nation-wide operation was being contemplated against people in that position. Well, that is all very assuring, no doubt, but the law is on the Statute Book, and there is nothing to prevent it being used at any time. It is a very dangerous and far-reaching provision. So I should like to ask the Minister just how far he intends using this provision and whether the already gazetted notice&#x2014;I think it was notice 2130&#x2026;</p>

<p>May I, with respect, Sir, point out to you that clause 1 of this Bill refers to this gazetted notice. It refers to a notice which must be gazetted. My point is that such a notice has already been gazetted. This clause extends the Minister&#x2019;s powers in respect of the gazetting of that notice. What is worrying me is whether the existing notice which has already been gazetted, in retrospect now can be considered to contain the additional clauses which are going to be passed by this House? Is there going to be a regazetting, does the existing notice hold, or what is going to be the position? People are anxious and want to know what their position will be. I repeat, I object very strongly to clause 1 because I think it goes far beyond anything contemplated when the original Act was passed. I believe it is aimed against people&#x2014;amongst whom are the most respectable citizens of this country&#x2026;</p>

<p>People, for instance, who supported the Defence and Aid when it was still a legal organization. Its aims were to provide for the defence of people charged with certain crimes. For anybody who understands anything about normal democratic practices, this is a normal function. The provision of defence for an accused is a normal function. Nobody is guilty until he has been charged in a court of law and found to be guilty. Therefore anybody who is accused is entitled to defence. The State itself provides defence for people accused of murder, or of crimes carrying capital punishment. The State takes upon itself to provide defence for people accused of the most far-reaching crimes. And I say that people who are accused, are entitled to defence. Indeed, we have had other instances in South Africa in the past&#x2014;the hon. member may be too young to know that&#x2014;of organizations having been banned during the war for which a defence fund was set up to provide defence for those people who suffered under that ban. At that time nobody thought there was anything wrong in providing defence for those people. [Interjections.] Here, too, we have people who often are not given the opportunity, <span class="col_615-616" refersTo="page_0325"/>because when one is banned or listed under the Suppression of Communism Act one has no opportunity of defence. The Defence and Aid undertook to provide defence for people who were accused and who were to be charged in the courts of law. Very many of our respectable citizens were members of that organization, or contributed to that organization, but now are in jeopardy by virtue of the retrospective nature of clause 1 of this Bill. I do not know whether hon. members in this House sufficiently realize the implications of this very far-reaching clause of this Bill.</p>

<p>Naturally, I also object to clause 2. I do not think there is any necessity for the Minister to take powers to disqualify legal men. I believe this can be left with safety in the hands of the responsible profession itself and/or to the courts of law. I agree with the Opposition as far as this is concerned. I might say that the previous Minister of Justice also had something to say about this profession when he moved the Second Reading of the Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Amendment Bill in 1965. On that occasion he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The respective law societies have given ample proof in the past that they are prepared at all times to keep their house in order and so far as it has been within their power to do, they have always taken vigorous and active steps against offending members of the profession.</block>

<p>I think this comment, which was made as recently as 1965, could surely equally well apply in 1967. So I object very strongly to clause 2. It is not only the disqualifying aspect which worries me, but the intimidating aspect. Unless one has followed closely, as I have done, the operations of the Special Branch under the powers of the Suppression of Communism Act, it is difficult for people to realize how wide that orbit is stretched and the numbers of people who have been banned and restricted in terms of that Act. Nobody knows the real figures; they are hard to get. A consolidated list was issued a couple of years ago. Since then other people were put on the list and some were taken off and it is almost impossible to know who is banned and who is listed.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that, but anyway, several hundred have been banned and restricted. The law is applied to ever-widening circles. People are becoming intimidated in this country and the legal profession is not, I regret to say, insulated against this intimidation. The result has been that it is increasingly difficult to find legal men who will take cases and who will defend people charged with so-called crimes against the State.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know of a single case where they could not find counsel to defend them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is very difficult and I must say that with the banning recently, the putting under house arrest of one of the most active people in Defence and Aid, Miss Heyman, it will become even more difficult to find lawyers to take those cases. I believe that a Bill such as this, which gives the Minister powers to disqualify people, will make it more and more difficult to find anybody who is prepared to undertake the defence of people accused of &#x201C;political crimes&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I am glad to hear the hon. member is prepared to do it, but he must be careful or he will find the beady eye of the Special Branch fixed on him one of these days. Every time I raise anything like this in the House I am always accused of being a subversive agent. Clause 2, as I say, goes very far indeed. It goes beyond listed communists as such, because on the list referred to in clause 2 there can be anybody who was at any time an active supporter&#x2014;not even a member, but an active supporter&#x2014;of a banned organization. There were many legal men who in fact contributed to Defence and Aid because they took the view that an accused person was entitled to a defence. Now those people could be listed. I admit that they have one protection, that the listing must be on the instigation of the Minister, and they must be given an opportunity to explain why their names should not be on the list. But if in fact they committed that &#x201C;offence&#x201D;, and they have been an active supporter of Defence and Aid by giving it a contribution, there is no excuse for them and they can be listed. Retrospectively these people will have committed a crime which was not a crime at the time they gave that donation, and their whole future livelihood can be jeopardized as the result of this clause. So clause 2 goes much further than people who have been convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act and it goes much further than people who have been listed as Communists, because the list referred to is the list in the custody of the officer and that list in turn can contain the names of people who were at any time active supporters of a banned organization such as Defence and Aid. Therefore I object strongly to clause 2.</p>

<p>Clause 3 is another one of the growing number of provisions which place an undue onus of proof on the accused. Yesterday the hon. member for Heilbron had a lot to say about the onus of proof and about this being part and parcel of British law and South African law. I am not concerned with that. I only know that this is wrong in principle, to place the onus of proof on the accused, and we have far too many Acts on our Statute Book which go far beyond those in Britain. The <span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_0326"/>only example the hon. member could quote was the Official Secrets Act. Otherwise the burden of proof is not on the accused but on the State to prove guilt, and the burden of proving innocence is not on the accused. In this particular instance it goes very far indeed because a person can be accused of communicating with a listed or restricted person. It is very difficult indeed to keep track of all these restrictions, as I have already said. How an individual will keep track of it I do not know. It was difficult enough for me to get information about it. I am told that it is too difficult to assemble the statistics and that a consolidated list was supplied and that it will be very difficult to supply other consolidated lists. So how anyone can prove that he did not know that a person was on the restricted list is beyond me. I think this is a very unjust provision indeed.</p>

<p>Clause 4 lists a large number of offences under the Suppression of Communism Act, which could not only lead to normal penalties under this Act but also to deportation if the person is not a South African-born citizen. I must admit that offences which are listed are serious offences, but some are petty offences. I do not know why the Minister has included in the list of offences which can result in instant deportation such a petty offence, for instance, as a person carrying or displaying or being in possession of anything whatsoever indicating that he was in any way ever associated with an unlawful organization. For instance, if someone did at one time subscribe to Defence and Aid and has anything in his possession showing that he ever made a donation to Defence and Aid, or that he ever received any literature from a banned organization, he can immediately be deported, if he is not a citizen born in this country. [Interjection.] If he is an alien and does such a terrible thing as to give a contribution to Defence and Aid, which at the time was a legal organization, and if a receipt is found in his possession from that fund, such an alien can be deported instantly. What, may I ask, is the justification for this? Can the hon. member for Heilbron really justify the inclusion of these petty offences carrying such very stringent penalties? I do not believe he can, and therefore, because I believe this whole Bill is adding to an Act which in any case is far too wide and is used in ever-widening circles, and because it affects people who often have no opportunity to defend themselves, and against whom no production of proof of guilt is necessary and no charges need be laid and no sentence need be pronounced by any court, and because the penalties are extremely high, I am going to move that this Bill be read &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;, the most stringent amendment I can move. I am not only concerned with clause 2, which is a bad clause. The other ones are equally bad, if not worse. I believe this is a miserable little Bill, in the tradition of other miserable little pieces of legislation affecting the freedom of people who may well have acted in good faith at the time they supported certain organizations. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is why I say the hon. member is still a child in politics. That is an absolutely irresponsible statement to make in this House. The only explanation I can find for that is that it appears to me as though the hon. member is quite blind and totally unbalanced as regards current problems in our country. The hon. member has an eye for one thing only, and that is colour. Apparently she is under the impression that she has a tremendous reputation overseas and that everything she says is broadcast over there as the truth.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not true. And on top of that she almost insulted the legal profession as well. She said this law was there purely to intimidate people. To intimidate them against what? Not to participate in communistic activities? I want to express the hope that it will in fact persuade people to abandon any communistic activities because of the possibility that they will not be allowed to practise the legal profession. I have never met a person who was in any way intimidated by any of the laws. [Interjection.] Furthermore, I think it is disgraceful of the hon. member for Houghton to say that if an advocate were appointed to defend a person charged under the Suppression of Communism Act he would draw the eye of the Security Police upon himself. I want to give her the assurance that as far as advocates are concerned, they are quite prepared to defend people charged under the Suppression of Communism Act, but the hon. member for Houghton will quite probably dissuade them from employing advocates who have no association with any liberalistic influences.</p>

<p>But allow me, Sir, to refer briefly to yesterday&#x2019;s debate. I should like the hon. Member <span class="col_619-620" refersTo="page_0327"/>for Transkei to tell me the following. Yesterday he virtually reproached us that this Act had not been placed on the Statute Book earlier. He said: That Bill of yours has been pending since 1965, and every time it is postponed. In fact, I was under the impression that the hon. member felt that we had been too slow about it. Then I heard to my surprise that the hon. member for Transkei would like us to do away with the entire Act. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei asked us: &#x201C;Seeing that you have postponed it so many times, why is it necessary to place it on the Statute Book now?&#x201D; I may just tell him that it is necessary because Communism is the worst anti-social cancer in all the Western countries in the world, and the history of Communism in South Africa in the past 15 years should have convinced hon. members on the opposite side that this Act is not merely necessary but essential. I am surprised that now, after everything that has happened in South Africa, hon. members are still opposing this kind of law. I should like to know what the attitude of the Opposition is, because it has not been stated clearly. Some of them say that it is only clause 2 they do not support, but that they support all the other clauses. Is that the official policy of the United Party?</p>

<p>That is the reply I wanted, because it appears to me&#x2014;and I make the accusation&#x2014;that the United Party is actually opposed in principle to all the clauses of this Bill. It is typical of the United Party to adopt that attitude. They blow hot and then they blow cold, because they are unfortunate in having liberalists as well as somewhat more conservative people in their ranks, and they must try to present an image to the outside that will satisfy both factions. [Interjections.] That is their attitude to the principles of this Bill. To the people outside this House the United Party want to pretend that they are opposed to Communism; that is why they say: &#x201C;We are against Communism&#x201D;, but in the same breath they say: &#x201C;We are only opposed to clause 2, but we shall nevertheless vote against the entire Bill.&#x201D; Let us just consider some of the objections.</p>

Take Nokwe, an advocate who is now in Britain and who is a recognized communist. Was any application made for his banning because he was a communist? Take Joseph Slovo, one of the most rabid communists. South Africa has ever known. He was a practising advocate when he left the country. Was there ever any application for his banning? Does the hon. member expect the profession to apply? What about Harold Wolpe? What about Roley Arenstein in Durban? Surely the hon. member comes from Durban.</p>

<p>I will admit that I did not know that. The hon. member is the member for Transkei, but I was under the impression that he lived somewhere in Durban. Mr. Speaker, here is a list of 15 names, and the professions did absolutely nothing about those people. How could the professions be expected to take action? Surely it is the duty of the State to act, and the State will act.</p>

<p>I now come to the amendment of the hon. member for Transkei. He wants the courts to have a discretion, but he did not tell us exactly how that discretion was to be exercised, and in what way the case was to be brought before the court. I looked at this amendment, and it appears to me as though it is once again the Rule of Law principle which is slipping out, the Rule of Law principle of which we hear so much and of which many people know so little. The hon. member for Houghton, in particular, is always concerned with the rule of law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish you would concern yourselves with the rule of law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>But there is a very important rule in law which the hon. member for Houghton has never mentioned here, and she must tell us which rule she considers the most important. Which does she consider the most important, the Rule of Law or the security of the State? The security of the State is the highest law; it is also a legal principle from our Roman-Dutch law. The security of the State is the highest law, and the interests of the individual must bow to the security of the State. Would the hon. member for Houghton agree with me that the security of the State is the highest law, and not the Rule of Law as such&#x2014;not the fact that individuals should appear before a court? Now the hon. member is silent. I do not understand that. I want to put this question to the hon. member for Transkei as well. Yesterday he told us about the war years. I am not one of those people who are touchy about events in the war years. Those things happen, and those among us who were on the other side and who opposed the Smuts Government are not complaining of what happened to us. But I want to ask the hon. member whether he will agree with me that during the war years many people were put behind barbed wire without any trial in a court&#x2014;quite correctly&#x2014; and what principle did the United Party apply in those years? The security of the State is the highest law, and I am not complaining of what happened. I ask the hon. member for Transkei to tell me now what happened between 1942 and 1967 to make him change his opinion so that he now wants to give the discretion to the courts when the security of the State is at stake?</p>

<p>The machinery of the courts is not at all times adapted to the task of pinning down this communistic serpent. In the modern world there is a struggle in all countries of one ideology against another, and in that struggle it is not possible to drive that serpent from the tissue of national life merely by using the machinery of the courts. It is an ideology which opposes us. The hon. member may laugh, but it is a fact. Communists are not people who act in public; they are not easily caught. It is not easy to obtain proof against them. They are organized groups, but apparently the hon. member for Transkei does not know that. Does he know nothing of the bloody history in South Africa in the past 15/16 years? Does he not realize that this country was saved by this Suppression of Communism Act, which was placed on the Statute Book in 1950? This country was saved because we gradually broke Communism in South Africa by means of that Act, and we are still doing that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<p>Communism may still be there, but by means of this Act, by means of the self-same provisions to which the hon. member for Transkei wants to object, we have broken the back of Communism. The hon. member need only recall what happened in Paarl and at Rivonia. He need only recall what happened everywhere in the country where bombs were exploded and violence committed. Under which laws were we to track down those people? But the hon. member gets up here and says that the legal profession should not be touched; there communists should be allowed to flourish.</p>

<p>Surely that is what the hon. member implied. The hon. member realizes what is going on in this country, and yet he brings such senseless opposition against this clause. Mr. Speaker, the administration <span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_0329"/>of justice in South Africa is one of the cornerstones of our republican democracy. We have our State President, our executive authority, our legislative authority and our administration of justice, and as I see and understand the administration of justice, it is there to interpret and duly apply the laws made by the legislative authority. The administration of justice brings balance to a country. The administration of justice must regulate the relationship between State and subject; it has to regulate the relationship between one subject and another, and that has to be done equitably. Justinian said: The maxims of the law are: To live honestly, to hurt no one and to render to each his due. That is the task of the administration of justice. In practice we find that there are many advocates and attorneys who support the communistic ideology. The legal practitioner, as was said here yesterday, is just as much part of the administration of justice as the officials and the judges; that is axiomatic; and the question is: What is the attitude of the legal practitioner with communistic tendencies? To define that, I just want to quote from the book &#x201C;Justice in Russia&#x201D;, by Harold J. Berman. On page 21 the learned writer states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the abolition of the market and of economic individualism there will come in Pashukanis&#x2019;s words&#x2026;</block>

<p>Pashukanis is a Soviet jurisprudence writer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; &#x201C;the withering away of law in general, that is, the gradual disappearance of the juridical element from human relations.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Then this writer continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Stuchka, President of the Supreme Court, wrote in 1927 that &#x201C;communism means not the victory of socialist law, but the victory of Socialism over any law, since with the abolition of classes with their antagonistic interests, law will disappear altogether.&#x201D;</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is what happened in Germany.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>That may have happened in Germany, but I want to prevent it from happening in South Africa, and the hon. member for Transkei will not help me. Mr. Speaker, this is what David Caute says in &#x201C;Communism and the French Left&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The communist lawyer, like the communist deputy, carries the Party&#x2019;s voice and struggle into the heart of the enemy camp, the one into the courts, the other into the Chamber and Senate. And just as the deputy professes to have little faith in parliamentary democracy, so the lawyer, if he be a true Marxist, regards all law as class law. His function is nevertheless to extract the last ounce of tolerance from the &#x201C;ruling class&#x201D; and from the system, claiming each legal victory as a victory for communism and each legal defeat as a vindication of communism.</block>

<p>That is the attitude of the communist in the administration of justice. Let me remind hon. members on the opposite side, who seem to have forgotten it, of what an attorney wrote in South Africa. This document was seized and used at the Rivonia trial. It is in Nelson Mandela&#x2019;s handwriting, and he wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Communist movement still faces powerful enemies which must be completely crushed and wiped out from the face of the earth before a Communist world can be realized. Without a hard, bitter and long struggle against Capitalism and exploitation, there can be no Communist world. A good Communist is therefore one who is a member of the Communist Party, who is absolutely faithful and loyal to the Party, who obeys without question all Party rules and regulations and who carries out all instructions issued by the Party.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] Yes, I thought the hon. member would say that. The difference is that it is loyalty to the Communist Party, a party which disseminates an alien ideology in our country. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<p>The people of South Africa, led by the S.A. Communist Party, will destroy capitalist society and build in its place socialism.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member agree with that? I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hence the transition from capitalism to socialism and the liberation of the working class from the yoke cannot be effected by slow changes or by reforms as reactionaries and liberals often advise, but by revolution. One, therefore, must be revolutionary and not a reformist.</block>

<p>That communistic philosophy was in fact practised in the legal world in South Africa. There were people like Harold Wolpe who did that. There were also people like Joe Slovo, like Abram Fischer, a man who was honoured by his profession, who passed us every day in his toga and with his charming face. In court he advocated law and justice and used the corner-stone of a modern democracy, Sir. And to what end did he use it? He used it to cover up his communistic innermost soul. He used it as a cloak around him while he was undermining us. In this measure we are now asking that that kind of thing should no longer happen. I want to say this to hon. members on that side. Abram Fischer&#x2019;s actions and the Rivonia trial did incalculable harm to the legal profession. That is the point, and that is why I want to ask hon. members on the opposite side to support this Bill in its entirety. The public outside are entitled to know that we as legal practitioners are in actual fact also administrating our country and our people, and are running our organization as it should be run. They should know that we as advocates and attorneys are in fact doing our duty. It is therefore absolutely essential that we correct the image, and we can correct it only by banning the communistically inclined advocates from our profession. Therefore, Sir, I support this measure.</p>

<p>Is it not the Law Society&#x2019;s job to have removed from the roll persons who are unfit to practise in that profession? What nonsense the hon. member for Prinshof speaks.

<p>But not only is it the prerogative of the Law Society to do so, it is also the duty of every single member of that profession to call upon the Law Society to have them removed, if that is what he feels. We have heard from the hon. member for Prinshof to-day that he did nothing in respect of these persons, and yet he comes to this House and says that the Law Society should have removed them from office. This is the sort of irresponsible attitude of the hon. member for Prinshof. It is quite obvious that this sort of speech is merely for propaganda purposes for the benefit of the newspaper reporters up above.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister and the other hon. members who spoke have emphasized continually that it is for them a matter of principle that a communist should not be permitted to practise in our courts. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus gave several reasons why this is so. We, of course, entirely agree with this, as has been said by speaker after speaker on this side, from the hon. member for Trankei onwards. But this, of course, is not the point of difference between us, and that is why it seems to us so pointless for these hon. members to continue to emphasize this point when we entirely agree. We entirely agree with the hon. member for Prinshof, strangely enough, when he describes the Communist ideology as one which we cannot allow to survive in this country. This is just about the only thing about which I do agree with the hon. member for Prinshof. The point of difference between the Government and this side of the House lies in the attitude of the Government as to who is or who is not a communist, and who should have the right to decide this question. These are the two points of difference between us, and we are indebted to the hon. member for Omaruru who tried to deal on its merits with this point of difference. He is the only hon. member on that side of the House who has tried to do so. Others have tried to throw a smoke-screen up in this House to obscure the debate and to suggest that we are trying to protect communists. For that reason I want to deal with the arguments of the hon. member for Omaruru and to show why we think that his explanation is incorrect, although obviously sincerely given to us.</p>

<p>In regard, first of all, to the persons convicted of the serious offences referred to in the section, our amendment makes it clear that we accept that those should be grounds upon which a court should be entitled to remove a man from practice or to disbar him from entering the profession. But, Sir, as we have said, the reason for the conviction in some cases may be technical, there may be genuine reformation, and that is why we believe that even if there has been a conviction it should be left to the Court to decide whether or not that person should or should not be admitted to practise or continue to practise. Not one single hon. member on that side of the House has suggested that our courts are unfitted for this particular task, and there can be no question that our Judges are perfectly competent to decide whether a man who has been convicted of such offences should or should not be permitted to continue to practise. That deals with those convicted of the offences.</p>

<p>As we have pointed out, the clause goes much further than that; it also includes persons who are on the list. It is perfectly clear that, despite what the hon. member for Heilbron has said, listed persons can include persons who are not communists. The former Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, <span class="col_627-628" refersTo="page_0331"/>readily conceded that in this House, so that I find it strange that some hon. members throughout this debate have tried to suggest that nobody can be on the list if he is not a communist. The hon. member for Houghton pointed out that listed persons can include, for example, persons who contributed to the Defence and Aid Fund. It could well be that the Liquidator could refuse to remove from the list such a person, a person who may have no connection with the Communist Party, no communist leanings, no support for the communist philosophy. It could happen. The Liquidator is a human being, he can make mistakes, just as in the same way as Judges can make mistakes. That is why it is so important that the court should have some say in such matters.</p>

<p>If the case which the hon. members made was that the Judges could not be relied upon to act properly in such matters&#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron has not understood what I have just said. I said, for his benefit, if the case made by Government members was that the judges could not be relied upon properly, to carry out the task which we suggest they should carry out then this would be an entirely different matter, and we could deal with it also on its merits. But obviously it has not been suggested, because in fact the Government members know that they can be relied upon.</p>

<p>Next I want to deal with the argument of the hon. member for Omaruru who suggested that to bring matters of this sort before a court of law would either defeat the object or would make it impossible to prove. He was the only one who, as I have said before, dealt with this matter on its merits and tried to put forward a reasoned argument, an argument I shall now endeavour to meet. The hon. member&#x2019;s entire approach was directed at this type of hearing as if it was a criminal case which had to be proved&#x2026;</p>

<p>Oh yes, Mr. Speaker. Although the hon. member did not say it in so many words, he nevertheless implied that the issue would have to be decided beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore he suggested that it would be almost impossible to prove who was a communist and who was not, or who was a communist sympathizer and who was not. But this is not the case. This is a civil application to decide whether or not a man is a fit and proper person to be admitted to practise or, if already admitted, to continue to practise. This is the issue&#x2014;&#x201C;fit and proper&#x201D;. And in order to decide whether a man is a fit and proper person to practise it is not necessary for a judge to decide beyond reasonable doubt that he is a communist, or a saboteur, or anything like that. If there is evidence before him which suggests that this is the type of person he is, and the judge is satisfied with such evidence, he can accept it and decide in his discretion that this is not a fit and proper person. The judge has a discretion and no court of law will upset that discretion, the decision taken, unless it can be proved that he had acted <i>mala fide.</i> If there is evidence showing that a person has communist tendencies &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is quite right that the onus is on the Attorney-General to show why he considers that this man is not a fit and proper person. But as I have pointed out to the hon. member for Omaruru, that onus does not have to be discharged beyond a reasonable doubt&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, on a balance of probabilities. The issue which the judge has to decide is not whether this man is a communist or whether he is a saboteur&#x2014;in other words, the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities is not one or other of these, but simply whether this man is a fit and proper person to practise. And if a judge has evidence which he accepts as being reliable, evidence showing that this man has a tendency towards Communism, or subversion, or towards that type of ideology, it is sufficient upon which a judge can properly exercise his discretion.</p>

<p>That is where the hon. member is wrong in his approach. If he was right in his approach and if it was so difficult as he made it out to be, to have these things dealt with by a court of law, then we may be persuaded to review our attitude. However, we are satisfied that this is not a task which cannot be carried out relatively easily.</p>

<p>Another point the hon. member for Omaruru made and with which I should like to deal is that these would be public hearings and that evidence could, therefore, be made <span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_0332"/>public, evidence which it may be in the interest of the State to divulge. But under the common law the court has the power to order a particular hearing to take place <i>in camera</i> or to order that a particular witness shall be heard <i>in camera</i> if the evidence which he is about to give could prejudice the interests and safety of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this argument must be seen in its proper perspective. There have been numerous trials&#x2014; such as the Abram Fischer trial, the Rivonia trial and others&#x2014;of a political nature before our courts. In these trials some people were acquitted but many were convicted. But the evidence led there has not created any danger to the safety of the State. I think the hon. member for Omaruru is exaggerating the position when he suggests seriously that this is a reason why the court should not be given the power to intervene in such matters.</p>

<p>In the little time that is left to me I should like to revert to an argument used by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. That hon. member seems to suggest that there was in the Suppression of Communism Act a section entitling a listed person to apply to court to be removed from that list. In this connection the hon. member referred to and quoted Section 8<i>bis.</i> Well, there is no doubt that the proviso to this section does suggest that a person on the list can apply to court. However, if the section is read in its entirety it becomes perfectly clear that it does not give a right of appeal to a court of law. It does not. Let me point out that under the common law there is always the right to apply to a court of law if an individual, such as the liquidator, has acted <i>mala fide.</i> That is a right under the common law. However, to prove <i>mala fides</i> in such cases is virtually impossible and I am sure this will be conceded even by the hon. member for Prinshof.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus referred to Section 8<i>bis</i> and it is with this section that I am now dealing. In the case of <i>mala fides</i> there is a common law right. Section 8<i>bis</i> does not give any greater rights. On the contrary. It limits this common law right because it provides that the application must be made within a certain period of time. Therefore, the point I wish to emphasize is that there is no legal right of appeal against a decision of the liquidator as to who is or who is not a person who should be on the list&#x2014;that is to say a communist. There is no right of appeal.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, deeply concerned at the serious effect which periodic seasonal and country-wide droughts have upon the economy of the country, and convinced that the steps which are being taken to avoid serious losses are inadequate, requests the Government urgently to consider plans which will, <i>inter alia</i>, include practical measures for the rehabilitation of afflicted farmers and for the restoration of grazing as well as the reclamation of land in order to alleviate the effects of such droughts.</block>

<p>I think that we here in South Africa are in a more fortunate position to-day than was the case a few months or even a few weeks ago. At that time large parts of our country were still being subjected to the worst strangle-hold known to us, drought. With the exception of certain parts in the interior of the Cape, where the drought has been prevailing for quite a number of years, there are indications to-day that we have most probably come to the end of a prolonged disaster. It would be only natural therefore if most of us were overjoyed at the new development. I hope however, that we will not allow our joyful feelings to run away with us to such an extent that we will overlook the urgency of the steps which are being advocted in this motion. I hope therefore that we shall not be blinded by the rosy prospects which are at present prevailing in large parts of our country as a result of the rains.</p>

<p>I have taken the trouble to go through the newspaper reports since 1958, and let me tell you that there was not a single year in which we were completely free from drought. Not a single year. Practically every year therefore we have been faced with drought conditions, whether localized or country-wide. I am convinced that if we went further back than 1958 we would find the same disturbing state of affairs. That is why it would only be reasonable to assume that this will be the case in the future as well. I do not know whether it will again assume such serious proportions, but that we will have to prepare ourselves for more droughts is virtually certain. That is why this motion is such an urgent one. There are so many people who have been so hard hit by the drought that they will find it very difficult to recover, and the prospects are that they will barely have been rehabilitated when they will once more be overtaken by calamity. I do not <span class="col_631-632" refersTo="page_0333"/>have the figures at my disposal, but I will not be surprised to learn that the rate of depopulation of the rural areas during the past two or three years has been the highest in our entire history. What effect this has already had and will still have on the economy of the rural areas can scarcely be defined. During the past year or two we have seen how, time and again, commerce and industry have asked that steps be taken to help the farmers.</p>

<p>Commerce and industry have done this because they were aware of the difficult circumstances in which these people had found themselves. The drought entailed a loss to our country of millions of rands&#x2019; worth of foreign currency. It was also the primary cause of our having to spend millions in order to supplement deficits in the production of agricultural products in our country. During the past few years, for example, we have not been able to export maize. Our wool clip has suffered considerable damage&#x2014;not only was the weight less, but the quality of the wool was lower. Our wheat harvests were poorer, and consequently we had to import larger quantities of wheat. I do not even want to talk about the quantities of dairy products which we have had to import during the past few years. It ought to be clear to all of us that South Africa has, directly and indirectly, suffered millions of rands&#x2019; worth of damage as a result of the great drought which we experienced. It is also certain that, as a result of the drought, the contribution of the agricultural sector to the national income in relation to other sectors will decrease even more. Droughts are quite unproductive. Not only do farm labourers and expensive machinery such as trucks and tractors have to be put to daily use to supply millions of head of cattle with fodder, but all other farming activity comes to a standstill when a drought is prevailing. Nobody can doubt that indirectly the drought has also led to great expenditure. Such a state of affairs has necessarily entailed steps on the part of the State, It has also entailed greater steps on the part of the farming organizations, in order to help one another as never before. Everybody is grateful for that, but in spite of State aid as well as mutual aid amongst farmers, it was often either too late or insufficient.</p>

<p>I do not want to minimize the aid which was rendered by the State. The farmers are tremendously grateful for that aid which took the form of rebates, subsidies and loans. It was either the one thing or the other. Either the drought was so prevailing and protracted that whatever help could be given was inadequate because the veld and the animals were exhausted too soon, or because additional fodder was not given in time. Never before have our supplies of fodder in the country been so deplenished as they have during this drought. Our supplies were entirely inadequate for such conditions, with the result that fodder was almost unpurchaseable for the average farmer.</p>

<p>I am referring particularly to lucerne. There was a tremendous shortage of lucerne and it became too expensive for the average farmer. I want to express the heartfelt wish that we in this country will be given a chance to recuperate before such a disaster strikes us again. In my opinion our plans are at present still too confused to be able to deal with such a situation should it reoccur. I am not blaming anybody for that. I have already said it can be that the drought was either too prolonged, so that in spite of any aid which was given one was not able to deal with the situation, or otherwise the aid given was not enough. However, the great question now is whether South Africa is going to be prepared to learn from this experience. There are of course certain people who believe that additional shifts of population from the agricultural sector is a natural phenomenon. They will therefore be satisfied with emergency measures which are established on a temporary basis only. The people who regard a flow from the agricultural sector to another sector as a natural phenomenon will be satisfied with that, but unfortunately I am not one of those who accepts that it is a natural flow and that it is something one can do nothing about.</p>

<p>The rate at which people are leaving the rural areas is alarming. That is why our planning should be adjusted to a stable, prosperous and satisfied agricultural community. One of the ways of achieving this is to safeguard them as far as possible from the consequences of droughts. Unfortunately I cannot to-day discuss one of the causes of droughts, the shortage of water, because there is another motion on the Order Paper. That is why I want to confine myself to the ways in which a satisfied and prosperous agricultural community may be ensured. That may be done by safeguarding them as far as possible from the consequences of droughts. It is wrong to say that no losses will be suffered in droughts. If there is a drought one must expect losses of one kind or another to occur. Even if the farmer has at his disposal all the capital and means of withdrawing all his stock from their natural grazing and feeding them artificially, with pill rations for example, he still suffers tremendous damage because his land will yield no interest. I believe that the biggest mistake which is being made, however, is to keep animals on the veld, particularly in large camps, and then in addition feed them artificially there. There are a number of considerations which must be borne in mind.</p>

<p>In the first place we shall have to try to let the animals manage as long as possible on natural grazing without incurring large-scale losses. In other words, the onus will rest on the farmer himself to become conservation-conscious so that he, by following the correct practice, will be able to resist the drought as long as possible without assistance. The farmer himself will have to make that sacrifice. But, in the second place, I believe that over and above central fodder storage places, every stock farm should have extra supplies of hay and maize in silo for at least a year in advance, <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_0334"/>even in the Karoo. I hope to indicate how this may be done, even in the Karoo. The other consideration is that as soon as the grazing becomes exhausted the animals must be removed and must receive artificial rations for the rest of the drought and for at least&#x2014; and here I am not quite certain whether this is correct&#x2014;a number of months after rains have fallen. If they are still being fed then it will not be necessary to return them to the veld. I shall tell you why. With this drought it was our experience that the moment it rained the people returned their animals to the veld, and what happened? Tribulosis and quick-sickness broke out and tremendous damage was done. I do not blame them for doing that. They were forced to do so as a result of the fact that the drought was so prolonged. When the rains come the farmer is only too glad that he will not have to spend any more money on fodder and returns the stock to the veld immediately.</p>

<p>The ideal state of affairs would be for each stock farmer to be organized in such a way that withdrawn stock can be fed on his own land in kraals or in small camps. When this feeding takes place there is at least no further exhaustion of his land. If we agree that feeding in the veld should not take place during droughts then I believe that the following things should be done. In the first place, the farmer must be assisted to build up his own fodder bank. Barns for storage purposes should be subsidized. I am also certain that where kraals have to be built for the feeding of animals, where water has to be laid on and feeding troughs built, that should also be subsidized. It is a tremendously expensive undertaking for a farmer to organize his affairs in such a way that he is able to feed 3,000 sheep or 5,000 head of cattle under those conditions. I think that it will require tremendous capital liabilities from most farmers in order to safeguard themselves from the next drought and at the same time tackle such an undertaking themselves. We know that the erection of barns for the storage of lucerne and fodder is not being subsidized, and I believe that the State should pay attention to this matter and see whether it is not possible to do so. Furthermore the planting of lucerne or other fodder on every stock-farmer&#x2019;s land, if it is possible to do so, should be encouraged so that he can build up his own supplies in the event of such a contingency, and I believe that this should also be subsidized. They must be helped to plant grazing from which hay can be made. If a farmer has no irrigation land he should be given a 50 per cent subsidy in order to purchase lucerne from elsewhere. It should be done so as to enable him to build up enough fodder for one year and in that case additional State aid will only be necessary after a year of drought.</p>

<p>I have more or less indicated all the things I consider can be done before a drought. I do not want to discuss what can be done during a drought because we know what emergency measures the Minister introduced and it is not necessary to discuss them any further. I shall deal with the other points in regard to the different financial aid schemes later on. But the point I want to make is this. We have suffered such tremendous damage over the past four years that I think the stock farmer in particular, as well as the State, will have to make a choice. Either we are prepared to suffer these losses every year, or we are prepared to say once and for all that we are going to spend enough money now to help the farmer to manage to the best of his ability so that we do not suffer these direct losses which we have suffered over the past few years.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister might say that this is the ideal state of affairs, but I cannot understand at all how South Africa, the national economy as a whole as well as the tax-payer, can stand by and watch while we suffer greater and greater losses each year because we do not have enough agricultural products to export, thus entailing our having to spend more money on the importation of agricultural products, whereas it is possible for us here to make provision to safeguard ourselves from the consequences of such droughts. I should like us to give some attention to that point to-day. I think South Africa is capable of making that sacrifice and that the tax-payer is also prepared to do so. If it is possible for us to spend more money in order to minimize the consequences of droughts, I think that the country will be prepared to make those sacrifices.</p>

<p>But what happens after the drought? Then there is the question of the rehabilitation of the land and of the farmer himself. Although the rehabilitation of the land is an important question, the rehabilitation of the farmer is in my opinion of greater value. Many of them are broken in body and spirit and it will also be necessary to build up their physical and spiritual resources. One of the easiest ways of building them up spiritually is by giving them as little to worry about as possible. Particularly after this drought I am more than ever of the opinion that a national emergency committee should be established, and if it is necessary to consolidate the burden of debt which a farmer owes the State or to place a moratorium on that burden of debt, then such a permanent emergency committee should be able to do so. Farmers who have already left the land as a result of the drought will have to be brought back, if they choose to do so, at the earliest possible opportunity, when we are able to give them State-owned land again.</p>

<p>The Government has already admitted the principle that the removal of stock in terms of its veld reclamation programme in drought disaster areas is a very good principle. We on this side admit that it is an exceptionally good principle, but in regard to this matter I should just like to ask the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, who introduced this scheme, to consider these few thoughts on the matter. There are certain flaws in that <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0335"/>scheme. In the first instance it will only be applied in a disaster area. I wonder whether it should not be made to apply much further afield. In the second place I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I think that the R8 per head of cattle or R8 per six small-stock units is totally inadequate under these circumstances. There are few farmers who have gone in for this scheme, they can see no advantage in it. If those amounts were increased I think more people would be prepared to go in for that scheme.</p>

<p>Over and above the question of land therefore, I think that the most important rehabilitation work which can be done is the rehabilitation of the farmer himself. The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services must do everything in their power, not only to free those people and leave them free, but also to win them back to our agricultural industry, for we simply cannot lose them, nor do I believe that the country can afford to lose them. I believe that now is the right time to build buffers against the next drought which South Africa will again have to face. It is in this spirit that I am moving this motion here to-day, not in order to make political capital from a serious state of affairs which has arisen but in order to make an honest appeal to the hon. the Minister for steps to be taken now. If we on this side of the House can give the Government any support in this respect then we shall do so with the greatest of pleasure because we know that it is very definitely the gravest domestic question with which South Africa is faced at the present moment.</p>

<p>Before replying to a number of ideas expressed by the hon. member for Newton Park I should like to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its gratitude to the Government for the measures it has taken to enable farmers during one of the most severe droughts ever experienced in our country to&#x2014;</block>

</ol>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park introduced his motion in a very calm way, but I am disappointed by the fact that he did not really say anything constructive. He spoke about the serious effect which the prolonged drought had had on our economy; that is general knowledge, but he also said that the drought was of such long duration that nobody could do anything about it even though they had wanted to. He made a study of the duration of the drought and he quoted from a number of newspaper clippings to prove his statements. He suggested that there should be a removal of stock from the grazing lands, but he did not tell us whether coercive measures by means of legislation should be applied or whether it should take place by means of instruction. Yet, instruction is always available to the farmer and very good instruction is being supplied. He put forward an idealistic suggestion in connection with a permanent 50 per cent subsidy on lucerne, a suggestion which is of course totally impracticable.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the rehabilitation of the farmer. He said that it was essential, as a result of the droughts experienced, that attempts at rehabilitation would have to be made and that farmers who had had to leave the rural areas would have to brought back, but he did not say a single word about the rehabilitation measures which alread exist. He also lost sight of the fact that the Marais Commission is at this moment instituting an inquiry into the entire agricultural industry. We cannot anticipate that Commission&#x2019;s report at this stage, can we? All these things which the hon. member mentioned here will surely be covered by that thorough inquiry, because the Commission is investigating the entire agricultural industry in all its facets, and it would be entirely uncalled for at this stage to tackle new rehabilitation measures apart from those which have been in force for years.</p>

<p>Actually the hon. member&#x2019;s motion emphasized three points. In the first place it emphasized that the present steps being taken to avoid losses are inadequate; he also said that the assistance which had been rendered, although the people were grateful for it, had come too late and had been insufficient. In the second place he asked for steps to be taken to rehabilitate the farmer; he did not have much to say about that. In the third place he asked for the rehabilitation and reclamation of our soil.</p>

<p>I just want to go into a few of these arguments briefly. The hon. member stated that the assistance was inadequate, that it had come too late and that there had not been enough of it. If that had been the case, then surely the results would have been reflected in the present conditions; then it would surely have been reflected in the number of livestock in the country at this stage after the drought. It is unfortunately so that we do not at this stage know precisely how many cattle and sheep we have but we do have a general idea of what the numbers are to-day. In July of last year the number of cattle, as far as the White farmers only were concerned, totalled 8,279,000, and there had been a very small <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0336"/>decrease&#x2014;I think it was less than 2 per cent&#x2014; in comparison with the position a few years ago, and that despite the fact that the number of cattle slaughtered during 1964-&#x2019;65 had increased by 5.7 per cent. Let us consider the number of sheep. In spite of the serious drought, our total number of sheep has not decreased, it has increased. In July, 1964, our total number of sheep was 37.5 million and in July, 1966, it was 39.8 million, more than 2 million more, and that in spite of what was perhaps the most serious drought in this country in living memory.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about the poor wool yields, but is the hon. member not aware of the fact that the 1965-&#x2019;66 wool season produced a record yield of 328 million pounds? The fact that our total number of cattle and sheep has either remained constant or increased is undeniable proof that stock losses as a result of the drought have been restricted to an absolute minimum in comparison with stock losses in previous droughts. It also proves that in the past few decades or more a very much greater degree of efficiency has been introduced on our farms; that our farms and farming operations are very much better planned. It also proves that our marketing methods are better, but for me it is also proof of the very excellent effectiveness of the emergency assistance which the Government rendered in order to combat these serious drought conditions. The hon. member for Newton Park said that this was not the right time to discuss the State aid schemes, but he said that that aid had come too late and that it had been insufficient, and because he has made that accusation I am compelled to discuss that question of State aid. I want to prove that that State aid was not only adequate and effective but that it was directly responsible for making it possible for our agricultural industry to keep functioning on a very sound economic basis. Mr. Speaker, what are the steps taken by the Government? Let me indicate briefly what they were. In the first place we had the Railway rebates on the transportation of cattle and fodder. Those rebates were not less than 75 per cent. Railway rebates are an old principle; they have been applied in the past but various adjustments were made in connection with this emergency aid. A year or so ago rebates were also introduced on the private transportation of cattle and cattle fodder. In addition new loan schemes were introduced to help the drought-stricken farmers. Loan schemes were for example introduced for the purchasing of cattle fodder and cattle licks. Loan schemes were introduced in respect of fuel for the farmer&#x2019;s own vehicles to be used for the transportation of cattle or cattle fodder. Loans were made available to compensate private contractors for the transportation of cattle or cattle fodder. Loans were made available for the hiring of grazing for sheep and cattle, for cattle licks, etc. But the Government went much further, further than ever before. Loans were made available for the rations of farm labourers in certain districts where it became necessary. Loans, up to a certain maximum, were made available for farmers themselves to cover the maintenance costs of the family itself. Those were new steps. Those steps were not only very welcome, they were also very effective and they helped to keep the people in the rural areas and on the farms. If the hon. member wanted to criticize this assistance, and if he wanted to label it as being too little or having come too late, then I would have expected him to have said what other steps should have been taken, steps which would not have affected the autonomy and the independence of the farmer, nor hurt his sense of honour. The steps which were taken were effective and did not harm this essential principle in any way.</p>

<p>Many more emergency schemes were established and many old schemes were expanded. During this drought, production loans were made constantly applicable and they will in future continue to be constantly applicable. Those production loans were increased to a maximum of R4,000 per unit, because the drought, as it increased in intensity, had to affect a greater number of people. A subsidy scheme for the purchase of fodder was established, a scheme which contributed a very great deal not only to the preservation of the farmer on his farm but also to the preservation of the cattle on his farm. This subsidy scheme of 50 per cent was of very great assistance&#x2014; even more so than any other scheme in my opinion&#x2014;in keeping the people on their farms and helping them to retain their self-respect. Considerable amounts were made available to organized agriculture for the organization of fodder schemes which would enable people to help themselves. In regard to emergency schemes tremendously large amounts have been made available and spent during the past three years alone. In this way almost R10 million was made available to drought-stricken farmers during 1965-&#x2019;66 alone.</p>

<p>What has been the result of all this assistance? Numerous farmers who would otherwise not have been able to remain on their farms, owing to the long duration and seriousness of the drought, were able to continue with their farming activities in the normal way. They were able to continue with their agricultural activities. As I have already said, the direct result of this emergency aid was that stock losses on the farms in the drought-stricken areas were restricted to an absolute minimum.</p>

<p>I should now like to learn from Opposition speakers in what respect this emergency assistance was insufficient and in what respect and when did it come too late? What I heard from the hon. member for Newton Park was a mere generalization and allegation, but no proof whatsoever was adduced in support of his allegations.</p>

<p>I come now to the next point of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, namely that of rehabilitation attempts. We have just had magnificent <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0337"/>rains, and I think the hon. member must have prepared the wording of his motion as well as his speech before we had these magnificent rains in the northern provinces. I am afraid that the criticism from hon. members on the opposite side is going to be doused, as in the case of many of the other things which they have attempted. The hon. member is now asking for rehabilitation measures. What does the hon. member want now? General rains have just fallen in large areas of the drought-stricken parts of our country. However, rain has not yet fallen in all the drought-stricken areas. Does the hon. member want these emergency measures or rehabilitation measures to be announced immediately?</p>

<p>That hon. member wants it now. The Marais Commission which is investigating those conditions, no longer counts as far as those hon. members are concerned. They also requested a Commission, but now hon. members on that side want the Commission to be ignored. Apparently that investigation must now be a mere smokescreen for the farmers. I now want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) who, as he states, is interested in agriculture, whether he has submitted a memorandum to the commission of inquiry.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. C. VAN R. SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not, but I am quite satisfied with the inquiry as it is taking place at present. I am quite satisfied with the way in which organized agriculture will give evidence before that Commission. I am also prepared to accept the report of the Commission. I refuse to anticipate the Commission and to ignore them.</p>

<p>In the meantime there are very important rehabilitation measures which are being introduced. What did the Land Bank do? What does it envisage for the rehabilitation of our farmers; let us glance at a statement made by the Land Bank in its latest report. I am quoting from paragraph 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as conditions have returned to normal and there is a measure of clarity in regard to the prospects of a farmer&#x2019;s existence, the Board will similarly give sympathetic consideration to the possibility of consolidating his arrear interest liabilities with his capital debt, so that he may be afforded the opportunity of rehabilitating himself, free of the burden of arrear payments as far as the Bank is concerned.</block>

<p>That is the policy of the Land Bank Board. What is more, the Land Bank has already during the past number of years made tremendously large amounts available, not only in the form of loans for the purchasing of land and not only for the redemption of loans.</p>

<p>It has also made large amounts available for hypothetic loans, for the purchase of stock, for equipment, and for improvement to farms, etc. I have a wealth of figures here to prove all these things, but unfortunately there is no time to quote them all.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say a few words in regard to rehabilitation measures which were introduced by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, an Act which was passed by this Parliament last year, and which is specifically intended to rehabilitate people in the rural areas. The way in which this Department is setting about its task, although it has not yet had a chance to endure the test of time, is furnishing clear promise that it is going to take very effective action. The amount which it has made available is enormous, and will, more than anything else, contribute towards the rehabilitation of our farmers.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion put before the House by the hon. member for Newton Park. I think that we must commend him for moving this motion at this very critical period in the history of the agricultural industry in South Africa. Very often as one listens to speeches of hon. members on the other side of the House, one gets the impression that all is well in the field of agriculture in this country. I listened with great interest to the speech of the hon. member for Winburg. His speech took the normal pattern in that he indicated that this Government in his opinion has done all that is possible to help the farmer in South Africa. I got the impression that the brightest industry and the brightest undertaking in which one could take part in South Africa, if I am to judge by the speech of the hon. member, is agriculture. I am surprised also when I hear these speeches by the hon. member. Then I think back to some of the Nationalist Party congresses of previous years and I think of the uproar that took place at those congresses and the degree of dissatisfaction which was expressed at those congresses. It was not surprising that, as a result of all the intervention on the part of the farmers, we ultimately had our late Prime Minister intervening and deciding that the complaints of these farmers were in fact valid. He seemed to create the impression that his Government had not done everything for the farmers that it should have done. In the light of what was said there he took the decision to appoint a commission to investigate these matters. We of the United Party can only say that we endorse in the strongest terms the action taken by the late Prime Minister. If ever there was a crying need for proper investigation, it is for an investigation of this kind.</p>

<p>We have only to read the terms of reference of this Commission to get an indication <span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0338"/>of how serious the matter appeared to the late Prime Minister. The terms of reference say that this Commission &#x201C;must investigate and try to determine in which respect, in which branches and in which regions the present agricultural system falls short and why, and must make recommendations for the elimination of these shortcomings&#x201D;. Obviously there are shortcomings and we on this side of the House endorse this as we know of these shortcomings.</p>

<p>It is an English newspaper. Mr. Speaker, the article continues:</p>

<block name="quote">To make an investigation into and to make recommendations for the reconstruction of agriculture in areas affected by the drought.</block>

<p>These are matters on which we on the Opposition side of the House have been hammering year after year. The Government has apparently ignored our recommendations and that is why we find to-day that the farming community has lost confidence in agriculture as a way of life. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I am not saying things which are incorrect. Being a farmer and moving amongst the farming community, I hear these references day after day: &#x201C;What is our future? How are we going to get rehabilitated? How are we going to make a living?&#x201D; and so on. I make bold to say that at the present time the greatest responsibility that this Government has is to take the steps that are necessary to restore confidence in the farming industry. I make bold to say that they have only got to listen to the Opposition and they will know what steps to take. They have heard of the responsible steps they ought to take. But if they do not take them, we shall in the very near future find ourselves in the position where we have not got sufficient food to feed the population in this country. The point is that many of the countries from which we in the past have imported foodstuffs are finding that their supplies are drying up. It has been said by the hon. Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing that there is no need to give a great deal of attention to putting our dairy industry onto a sound foundation because we can import these products far more cheaply from other countries. I make bold to say that the time is not far distant when those products will not be forthcoming from other countries. We must take these steps now and as energetically as we can to see that not only the dairy industry but also every other aspect of agriculture is put on a sound foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to answer that question, but I do want to say that after a speech which I made in this House the hon. the Minister in reply to a point I raised in connection with the dairy industry indicated that dairy products were more cheaply available from overseas and therefore the importation of these products seemed a better proposition. The</p>

<p>matter which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister is that of trying to establish a basis whereby the farmer is guaranteed a stable price, a stable income for agriculture for at least five years ahead.</p>

<p>A stable income. The hon. the Minister mentions the question of price. We are more interested in the question of a stable income because we know to what extent the purchasing power of the rand is going down. We know to what extent under this Government labour costs are going up and to what extent production costs are going up. What we therefore want and what the farmer wants is a stable income for the foreseeable future.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>If the Government is able to do that and I believe that if they take the advice of the Opposition they will be able to achieve that result, then there will again be confidence restored in the agricultural sector of our community. What is happening to-day? The young people who should be our future farmers have lost faith in agriculture and they are streaming to the towns by the hundred. They are the people whom we in the agricultural sphere can ill afford to lose. In my own district alone I know of dozens who because they have no further faith in the policy of this Government, have no further faith in the future of agriculture and are leaving the land. I believe that the Government must take steps as soon as possible to reverse this process.</p>

<p>Another great problem with which we are faced in the sphere of agriculture is the question of distribution costs. I believe that the time has come that the Government must take urgent steps; I will even go so far as to recommend that they must appoint a commission to get on with the job and investigate the great problem of the distribution of agricultural products. I was told only a few days ago of a case in Ermelo where a farmer producing milk was getting 25c per gallon. That very same milk was being bought in Johannesburg at the cost of 64c per gallon. Surely occurrences of that nature cannot be tolerated and allowed to continue. In what way is this Government trying to assist the farmer in respect of housing for his non-European labourers? What assistance do they get? What <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0339"/>happens in the Cape Province, Sir? We provide bigger and better houses for our non-European employees and then the divisional council comes along and puts an extra tax on these houses. There is no assistance given to the farmer, unlike his friend in the city, to allow these houses to be built on the same basis of credit and assistance. The farmer has to paddle the canoe himself.</p>

<p>In the field of education, we need a better qualified labour force to deal with the more technical side of farming. Farming has become a more technical undertaking. We need better qualified labourers. What steps is this Government taking to assist the farmer to get a better qualified labour force? I think that there is a wide field open. There is much to be done in regard to this particular matter.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of the matter is to keep our production costs lower. What is this Government doing to provide cheaper electrification for the rural communities? Very little has been done. Just think what a great role cheap electricity could play to keep the cost of production down. There is another matter I should like to raise, namely the question of soil conservation. I think the Government has taken a very wise step. I see now that in terms of the Soil Conservation Act they have introduced a system whereby farmers can become part-time assistant extension officers or employed personnel. They are paid R11 per day and their travelling expenses are paid. The trouble has been that soil conservation cannot be implemented sufficiently well to bring this matter under control, because there has been a shortage of personnel. Now the Government has made what I call a very good move, but as usual, Sir, this whole system, as splendid as it is, like all other aspects of the administration of the Soil Conservation Act, is being bogged down by red tape. Hundreds of forms have to be filled in and it takes a very long time before a man can be appointed. [Interjection.] The hon. the Minister laughs but these are things which deserve his fullest attention, because if they do not receive his attention, soil erosion will continue to play havoc in this country. What we want is more action on the part of this Government and far less talk and, I would say, a little less laughter. What we want is liaison between the officials of the Department and the farmers, and that is not taking place. I wonder if the hon. the Minister realizes to what a small extent the officials in the Departments of Agriculture are making effective contact with the farmers in this country. They should be out on the farms discussing the farmers&#x2019; problems with them, advising them and helping them. What is actually happening is that they stay in their offices and do clerical work.</p>

<p>I believe that these people can make a great contribution if they could get out, help the farmers, and encourage experimentation by the farmers. There are many farmers in this country who are thoroughly capable of making a valuable contribution by means of the experiments which they are undertaking. The Government is making no use whatsoever of the experiments those farmers are making. Very often the efforts which they do undertake are absolutely stifled by the inaction of this Government. Those people can serve a useful purpose and I appeal to the Government to make better use of the experiments which those farmers are making on their own initiative.</p>

<p>I hope. Sir, that the motion which has been moved here by the hon. member for Newton Park will be given due consideration by the Government and that the steps he has recommended will be taken into account fully.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition has not even the courage to say what that hon. member said, because he does not believe in that, and the hon. member does not believe in that either. The hon. member is propagating something in which he does not believe.</p>

<p>The hon. member made the further statement that at the congress the late Prime Minister had to promise the appointment of a commission of inquiry into agriculture. He made much ado of the fact that the commission of inquiry was appointed to prove how poor the position of agriculture was. That request came from various quarters, perhaps from the Opposition in the first instance, and from the agricultural unions and others. The commission was appointed. Now the agricultural departments have to beg the farmers&#x2019; organizations and the United Party to submit memorandums to the commission. We have to extend the period allowed for the submission of memorandums by three months, because no memorandums were submitted to the commission. If the inquiry was so terribly essential, I should think the first people to submit a memorandum would at least be the United Party. They are the ones who have been making accusations all these years. Here they have the opportunity of submitting such memorandums to the commission, whether as individuals or as a party or as a farming group in their party or through the agricultural unions. Why have they not done that? Why did we have to allow three months&#x2019; grace to get some memorandums submitted to the commission?</p>

<p>To-day, for a change, the hon. member for Newton Park showed a fairly objective grasp of the position of agriculture in our country. In the past I frequently asked him: When you introduce this kind of motion, try to make somewhat less political gain from the situation and try to contribute something positive to the agricultural industry, then you would be doing something. But the propaganda mongering of the United Party has never gained them anything. It has merely made them lose more and more all the time. It is time they made a contribution in the interests of the industry and not of their party. I agree with the hon. member that we are all grateful that such good rains have fallen in large parts of the country. It is a relief. The rain is most important, and its lack is one of the reasons why many farmers had such a hard time. In his motion the hon. member referred once again to the lack of planning in agriculture. This is not the first time we have heard that. We have been hearing that story for some years. I just want to refresh the hon. members&#x2019; memories.</p>

<p>Do you remember, Sir, how the same hon. members got up two years ago and said that for lack of planning all the dairy herds were being slaughtered, and that as a result of thatthere was a shortage of butter? The hon. member for East London (City) spoke of all the auctions where dairy herds were being sold, and he said that was the result of the Government&#x2019;s policy. Fortunately the people did not believe the United Party, otherwise everybody would have thought we were heading for the greatest catastrophe as regards dairy production. I told hon. members that the steps to be taken in drought conditions should be such that they did not undermine the entire structure of agriculture. If one takes ill-conceived steps and conditions improve afterwards, one may undermine the entire structure of agriculture to such an extent that it will never recover. In the past hon. members said that there was not enough planning and that there was no incentive to make people keep their dairy herds. They brought the charge against the Government and myself that we were to blame for the fact that there was not enough butter and cheese in the country. I just want to ask: And now? On 14th January, 1966, a year ago, the weekly cheese production in South Africa was 577,000 lbs. In many parts of the country we have not even had enough rain yet. In many dairy districts it is still dry. In January, 1967. the cheese production was 963,0 lbs., or 80 per cent higher. Where did the cows come from? If there are no cows, I must say the extension work done by the hon. the Minister for Agricultural Technical Services must be wonderful, to increase the production of the cows so tremendously. But let us consider other figures. Take butter. On 14th January, last year, the weekly butter production was 1.7 million lbs. What is it now? It is 2.5 million lbs., an increase of 760,000 lbs. of butter in the corresponding week.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, for the corresponding week. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has become so confused by the statements made by his members that he no longer knows the difference between a year and a week. It was in the corresponding week. The figures will increase even more after those dry regions have also had rain. But my point is that the United Party made the accusation that the dairy industry was not receiving adequate assistance, and that the Government did not encourage it, and that the cows were all being slaughtered, and here we have the position that within a week, compared with last year, our cheese production increased by 80 per cent and our dairy production by almost 40 per cent. Let the hon. member take out his auction pamphlets again and show us what became of the cows that were all sold. Where have the cows come from now?</p>

<p>The other accusation made against us was that the Government did not make adequate credit available to agriculture to enable the farmer to produce. That is what the hon. member said last year. Unless new circumstances arise, we are going to harvest at least 80 million bags of maize this year. Now I ask you, if <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0341"/>there was no credit for agriculture, where did the farmers get the money to sow such a crop? I do not want to bore you with figures, but do you know what it means? If the maize crop is true to its promise, it may mean that the income of the maize farmer will exceed that of last year by R90 million&#x2014;the gross income. But the hon. members said the farmers could not get credit from the State to produce, and that the State failed to plan. No, I think the hon. members on the opposite side should not act like a weathervane when they criticize, and that is what they have been doing for the past years. When it was dry, they were like a weathervane. They reminded me of that little couple who indicate the weather. Aunt Sannie van Niekerk always emerged as the wife who predicted storm clouds, and now the hon. member for Walmer appears as the husband who indicates fair weather. No, it is the way in which the Government handled this matter and enabled the farmer, under these most difficult circumstances, not only to increase his production once better times had come and to retain his stock, but also enabled the crop farmer, by means of credit advanced by the Agricultural Credit Board and by the Land Bank and guaranteed by the State, to produce once times improved. Obviously, if it does not rain, it goes without saying that one cannot harvest those crops, but the Government did everything in its ability to enable the farmers to keep producing once times improved, and nobody will deny that.</p>

<p>In his speech the hon. member said once again that markets should be sought for the possible surpluses that might arise, and the Government should provide the markets. I agree with him.</p>

<p>It does not matter in which debate you said it. It so happens that the hon. member is always speaking. That merely goes to show what a difficult industry agriculture is in South Africa, under the climatic conditions that obtain here. Whereas, last year 15 million to 20 million lbs. of butter had to be imported, the position may easily arise that before the end of the year there may be a surplus of 20 million pounds if production is maintained on the same scale as at present, and then that butter would have to be exported, and it has no market abroad because nobody wants it. If that happens, some plan will have to be devised. One cannot seek a market for a product which is not there, and that is what I have always wanted hon. members on the opposite side to admit. One can seek a market for a product only if one has that product to export.</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition came up with a grand gesture to-day and said: &#x201C;We want to thank the Government for the mite of assistance given to the farmers, but the assistance which is given is usually too little and too late.&#x201D; I think I have now given enough examples to show that where it rained the assistance was timeous and not too little to yield the required production in the cases I mentioned.</p>

<p>Apart from the first point raised in his motion, the hon. member made some proposals as to what should be done in future in the event of further droughts. The hon. member devised some fine-sounding suggestions, but unfortunately those suggestions are not practicable. I do not want to argue politics with the hon. member; I am hoping that for once in a while we can debate this matter like grown-up people across the floor of the House. The hon. member suggested that farmers should be enabled to store a year&#x2019;s supply of fodder on their farms, and that such storing should be subsidized. That is a very fine idea: I agree with the hon. member, but how would the hon. member apply that in practice? Once a farmer has stored a year&#x2019;s fodder on his farm, how is he going to ensure in practice that that farmer will keep the fodder until it is dry again, in order to use it then? What guarantee can the hon. member offer that the farmer will not use that opportunity to keep more stock on his farm and to have the farm over-grazed even further? [Interjections.] No. I just want to show the hon. member how impracticable his suggestion is. The hon. member knows the farmers, and I know them too. Is he trying to tell me&#x2026;</p>

<p>But I want to go further in connection with that statement made by the hon. member. I am not saying it is all that impossible to put it into practice, if one does what I mentioned at a meeting some weeks ago, and what the hon. member criticized in this House. I said that once this drought had passed and drought relief had to be granted again, we should grant the relief more on an achievement basis, in correspondence with the achievement of the farmer himself. The hon. member got up here and tried to poke fun at that. I now want to ask him, what is wrong with that? If one gives the farmer a subsidy on soil conservation works and a subsidy, as the hon. member advocated here, to erect buildings and to store fodder, and if one gives him a subsidy on the transportation costs of that fodder, and he failed to carry out his soil conservation works or overstocked his farm, would the hon. member still say that he should receive assistance?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must listen. Let us presume the State gave a man subsidies and loans to carry out soil conservation works, and that the State gave him a loan to erect a shed for storing fodder, and that the State gave him a subsidy on the transportation of that fodder, and that there has now been a year of drought and that fodder is exhausted; now the man comes along and asks for a subsidy on fodder, but in the meanwhile he has not looked after those soil conservation works he carried out, he has over-stocked his farm, etc. Would the hon. member still plead that he should get assistance unconditionally, without an achievement test? That is a simple question; I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member. The hon. member need simply reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But let us go further. The hon. member is only concerned with agricultural problems here in Parliament, apart from his own agricultural problems. But I am not concerned with them only here in Parliament; I am concerned with the implementation of the policy, and I want to make this statement: When State assistance is given, as happened during this drought, particularly in the form of subsidies, then the farmer who made least provision gets the subsidy first, and the one who made best provision is the last one to get the subsidy. The farmer who did most over-stocking gets into trouble first; the farmer who made no provision for fodder is first to qualify for fodder; the farmer who restricted the stock numbers on his farm and who made provision for fodder is the last person to receive a subsidy. In the hon. member&#x2019;s opinion, is it right that that should be so? What I said was that in future the farmer who over-grazed his land and who failed to make the necessary provision where he had the chance to do so, would be judged according to his achievement. In this regard I just want to mention one example. A certain district in our country applies for a fodder subsidy; it is dry, not as terribly dry as in many other parts, but it is dry, and the farmers in the district are having a hard time. I said I should like to see what the position was in that district and what the position had been in recent times. I then caused an analysis to be made of that district. The analysis was made in respect of the eight-year period from 1958 to 1966. For five of those eight years that district was on the drought list of districts qualifying for transport rebates, etc. In 1963, when we had a fairly good maize crop, one of the largest we had ever had, that district produced 820,000 bags of maize. Last year, when it applied for a subsidy on fodder, it produced 940,000 bags, i.e. 120,000 bags more. In 1960, during this eight-year period in which the district experienced five years of drought, its stock numbers totalled 66,000, and last year when it applied its stock numbers totalled 84,000. In 1960 its sheep numbers totalled 240,000 and last year, when it applied, the figure was 420,000.</p>

<p>What about the Soil Conservation Act?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely why I mentioned an achievement test, but the hon. member was opposed to it. Let me ask the hon. member this question: Can a Minister use the tax-payers&#x2019; money to subsidize people who over-exploit their district in such a way? Is that what the hon. member propagates? That is why I said that in future such a district or such a farmer would qualify for a subsidy on fodder only if he has rendered proof that in the preceding years he kept his stock numbers within limits, that he carried out his soil conservation within limits and that he provided for fodder within limits. But the other day, during the debate on the motion of <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0343"/>no confidence, the hon. member got up here and asked: &#x201C;What does the Minister mean by that?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course you did.

But such control is absolutely impracticable and impossible.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is practicable. It will not be possible to exert hundred per cent control over every possible detail, but it is practicable. The assistance the Government gives the agricultural industry in South Africa from time to time is the most economic assistance possible, not only from the point of view of the State and of the tax-payer, but also from the point of view of the farmer. The most economic assistance that can be rendered is that which is rendered under the present system. There is so much talk of fodder banks. Surely we have fodder banks. Listening to all that talk of fodder banks, one would think we had nothing like a fodder bank at all. We always have 7 or 8 million bags of maize at hand in South Africa for any contingency.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But last year it was imported.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We imported to prevent the supply in hand from being depleted. That merely shows how we build up the maize fodder bank. Surely it does not matter in what way the reserves are accumulated&#x2014;they are there.</p>

<p>Allow me to say something about our roughage. When roughage has to be stored for long periods and transported for long distances, it is the most expensive fodder one can get. For that reason the policy followed by the Government and by the Department has almost always&#x2014;and that despite the fact that we had an extraordinary drought which of course aggravated matters even further&#x2014;had the result that there was roughage available somewhere in South Africa. That has always been the case, except for the past few years, and more specifically the past year. It very seldom happened that roughage was not available some</p>

<p>where. It is much cheaper for the buyer and also for the concern that has to finance him &#x2014;whether the tax-payer or the State or someone else&#x2014;to have fodder transported at that stage at cheap railway rates. That is why we subsidize the railage by 75 per cent, in order to make it possible to transport that fodder. But if we were to do what the hon. member suggested, namely that every farmer must always, under all circumstances be subsidized by the Government to enable him to store a year&#x2019;s supply of fodder, and that the State should subsidize him in respect of railage, etc., problems may arise. Can the hon. member not understand that the fodder may perhaps be stored for as long as eight years before the farmer will need it? What does the hon. member think it will cost if one considers the building in which the fodder is stored, the insurance premiums payable on it, if the fodder has to lie there for seven or eight years?</p>

<p>As I said, Sir, these proposals are impracticable. Practical proposals must be made, proposals that one can apply in practice, that will work. But the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal will simply not work in practice. I do not want to criticize the hon. member for making these proposals. He is not the first to think about such things. Many people have thought about those things. But such proposals are simply not practicable and economic in their application, neither for the consumer nor for the farmer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>What else would you suggest as a solution? Do you think the present position is ideal?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I maintain, Mr. Speaker, that the farmer&#x2019;s primary duty, if he is able to do so, is to grow fodder on his farm. If he cannot manage that himself, he should store fodder for himself in the good years, that is when such fodder is available to him. The hon. member knows that the latest drought is not a normal drought, and it then goes without saying that extraordinary steps have to be taken, which has in fact been done, to subsidize fodder. But in normal times and under normal circumstances one cannot take extraordinary steps. We must bear in mind that agriculture in South Africa is practised in a country which experiences periodic droughts. In many cases the latest drought has been a disastrous drought. If a person starts farming in a region visited by periodic droughts, he knows that he has to provide for the inevitable droughts. He must provide for them. If the drought continues for too long, then he can expect the State to help him. But under reasonable, normal circumstances the tax-payer cannot be expected to carry the burden of this kind of assistance to agriculture. One cannot expect that, nor will the tax-payer tolerate anything of that kind.</p>

His Vote will still be discussed&#x2014;at present we are only dealing with legislation. The hon. member for Winburg proceeded and said that statistics proved that there had been an increase of 2 million in our sheep population over a certain period in spite of the severe drought and that the statistics in connection with our cattle population were not available as yet.

<p>I am now speaking about the hon. member for Winburg. The hon. the Minister should listen for a change instead of making so many interjections. For how many years have we not been speaking of a fodder bank, something to which the Minister referred so disparagingly only a few minutes ago, as being one of the methods of combating drought conditions? A short while ago, however, the hon. the Minister mentioned the large quantities of mealie concentrates stored by us as being one such method. He also mentioned roughage, railage and storage costs. Roughage as such went out of fashion many years ago and the hon. the Minister knows it. Surely he knows that at present we mix and compress pellets and that these pellets take up less space. [Interjections.] Hon. members opposite may all make a noise at the same time; it will not put me off my stroke. The fact remains that we in this country have been searching for fodder amongst the mealie stalks and that it has been necessary for the Transvaal Agricultural Union to have such stalks cut along the roads because conditions regarding roughage were so critical. There was a time when the hon. the Minister interjected that I was speaking nonsense when I spoke of the heaps of chaff going to waste on the fields of the Western Province. Had all that chaff been compressed with lucerne and mealie-meal into pellet form, we would have been able to save large numbers of the stock which perished during the drought. But that is not all, we went further than that.</p>

<p>I want to come to the methods by which we would possibly have been able to be more successful in combating drought conditions and preventing stock from perishing, because that after all, is the first point of the motion moved here, namely whether there were methods which could have been employed to better advantage or more effectively in preventing stock losses from ever assuming such major proportions. We made repeated recommendations to the hon. the Minister that it was possible to design a scheme in terms of which it would be possible to finance a person who had grazing but no money and to lay down that when he sold his stock he would do so through the agency of a controller or a corporation or agents appointed for that purpose, because of the necessity to save large numbers of stock which were not saved during recent times. The fact remains that if a person had provided fodder for his stock until such time as he was no longer able to do so, he no longer had money, and his animals became scraggy, he no longer had a market for his stock either. If, however, he had had a market, that market would have been of such a nature that he would never have been able to rehabilitate himself, because he would practically have had to give away all his stock for nothing. The fact remains that buyers are financed, not in one country only but in many, to enable them to buy stock in districts where farmers are finding it difficult to keep their stock. What can the State lose by financing people to buy stock, people who have water and fencing, if these operations are conducted through proper marketing agencies and the first income is used for repaying the Government?</p>

That, after all, constitutes a dividend on his investment. The hon. member could not have meant anything else. Was it necessary for the hon. the Minister to dwell on that point for so long and to ask whether he should take the mealie-farmer&#x2019;s income for last year as a basis and whether that was the stable income of which the hon. member spoke? That was a farcical question.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister too referred to the untimely proposals made by us at this stage in connection with rehabilitation. I shall deal with that in more detail shortly. First I want to say a few words in connection with the question of dairy produce. It is a privileged position to be in to be able to make use of one&#x2019;s Department&#x2019;s statistics for ascertaining what the production of butter and cheese was over any particular week while grazing was new and every milch-cow was producing at her best. The hon. the Minister knows as well as any other farmer in this House that when it comes to the month of August he will have to sing a different song. He mentioned a week in January when the entire dairy farming area&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, after the entire dairy-farming area has had abundant rains and while the pasturage was new and at its optimum. This is the week and the production which the hon. the Minister took as an example. The Minister knows as well as we do that when it comes to August and September he will have to sing a different song. Then these wonderful optimum conditions are something of the past and then it is a case of cows yielding perhaps 30 lbs. of milk per month instead of 300. As regards dairy production, the Minister referred to optimum conditions in an optimum period of production. Does the hon. the Minister want to tell me that no dairy herds have been sold and destroyed? There used to be so many dairy herds that we could afford to have them slaughtered and the Minister wanted to ridicule us for having said that conditions in the dairy industry caused dairy herds to be sold. [Interjections.] There can be no argument about that.</p>

<p>I have already referred to fodder banks. In the same spirit as that in which the hon. the Minister approached this matter a short while ago, I too want to say, &#x201C;Let us look across the floor of this House to see whether we can find methods for improving this situation if it is not satisfactory enough&#x201D;. It is not possible for me, nor will it be for the Minister, to say that everything has been done which can be done in connection with the drought and in connection with the rehabilitation of the farmers who have nearly been ruined.</p>

<p>I asked the hon. member to make practical suggestions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If he will only give me a chance I shall try to do so. I have already mentioned what our views are and have been for a long period as regards measures to be taken in respect of drought conditions. As far as the rehabilitation of agriculture is concerned. I should now like to refer to the sheep-farming area of Dordrecht and the area along the mountain range as far as the higher-rainfall areas and up to the West Coast as far as Springbok. There are regions which have not had a single drop of rain up to now, for example Victoria West, and from the coastal region in a northerly direction up to Prieska, an area which measures 300 miles by 250 miles. Our hearts go out to them because they still find themselves in this predicament in the month of February. For those people a great deal will still have to be done as a result of prevailing drought conditions. I want to deal, however, with the large part which has had splendid rains, something about which we are all very grateful. How can we rehabilitate these people? I should like to divide these people into two categories. I want to speak of the crop farmer and of the stock farmer.</p>

<p>As regards the crop farmer, quite a number of methods have been employed for his rehabilitation. Facilities regarding his loans for seed and for fertilizers have been created for him by the corporations and by other bodies. Credit facilities have been created for him by means of credit loans and if he is able to pay 30 per cent of the amount in cash he can obtain the balance on credit from the corporation at a rate of interest as low as 5 per cent. The rate of interest is 5 per cent which in turn is financed by the banks. This is an arrangement by the banks for the corporations. I want to suggest, Sir, that agriculture finds itself in a reasonable position to try and rehabilitate itself. 66 per cent of a person&#x2019;s expenditure in this connection becomes a loan at 5 per cent, even though he has to pay the rest. If he is able to pay the rest, or if he can obtain the rest from loan funds at 8 per cent or 9 per cent such person can try and rehabilitate himself. However, I want to deal with the person who may not even be able to do that, who may not even have the facilities at the commercial banks to do so. He has to go to the Land Bank and we know about the procedure of consolidation, etc. In this way he then has to try and find assistance. If he is not able to get assistance there, he has to go to the Department of Agricultural Credit. I wonder whether we realize how long, in view of valuations and other related matters, that takes a person in the agricultural industry who needs to be rehabilitated? This is something which must take place fairly rapidly.</p>

<p>I want to go further and speak about the stock farmer. This man falls into an entirely different category. There is no agricultural corporation to which he can go and say, &#x201C;I have now come to the end of my resources with stock loans which I have had to take up and stock which I have had to purchase. I have lost half of my stock. I have to rehabilitate myself and I have to buy stock. Where do I find the funds to do so?&#x201D; In another debate the hon. the Deputy-Minister of Agriculture said, &#x201C;You know nothing about agriculture. You are a stranger in Jerusalem. The facilities do exist&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that a farmer&#x2019;s position must be fairly critical if he wants to become a successful applicant at the Department of Agricultural Credit. We need not argue about that. We want to rehabilitate these people. Is the best person to rehabilitate not that person who has not yet reached the stage where it is necessary for him to go to the Department of Agricultural Credit but who still is the best asset to this country as a farmer? Is he not the person we should like to rehabilitate the most because he is our most likely candidate to remain on the land as a farmer? Is there any assistance for him, or does he simply have to pay that 8&#x00BD; per cent if he is still solvent? Why should he be placed in a different position to another person if he is perhaps a better farmer? In <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0347"/>nine out of ten cases he will be a better farmer. That is why he has succeeded to remain in that position. But then drought conditions were experienced, and it was because he had to use 25,000 bales of fodder and 1,000 bags of mealies that he has landed in this position where he is in need of assistance. This is the man for whom I am pleading. This is the man I want the Minister to take into consideration. We cannot lag behind and say that we have no scheme for people who have had rains on their farms, who want to rehabilitate themselves and who purchase or want to purchase stock. We cannot say that such a person has to pay what he can for such stock and has to finance that as best he can. We cannot say that if he is unable to finance such purchases he can go to the Department of Agricultural Credit. No, Sir, we do not want him to descend that far down the ladder before we assist him. We must assist him before such time&#x2026;</p>

<p>I understand that my time is getting short. I now come to one of the most important points as regards the rehabilitation of the agricultural industry, and that is the rehabilitation of our soil. I want to reverse the order. The most important thing of all is the soil itself. We are only here temporarily. We pass on but our soil remains and must continue producing for mankind.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, even if I did, this is how I state it now, namely that the soil is the most important thing of all. We now have the position that the person who still has funds at his disposal will tend to overburden his soil in an attempt to rehabilitate himself. The person who is not assisted cannot restock his farm in the balanced way in which that ought to be done. Sir, I am aware of the Department&#x2019;s attempts to let portions of farms lie fallow so that they may subsequently be used as grazing on a basis of rotation. The fact remains that the rehabilitation of the grazing and the fertility of the soil are the most important items with which any state and any government is concerned. We are pleading for this and that is the reason why this motion has been framed in this manner, namely to advocate the rehabilitation of the farmer and of the soil. That is why I cannot understand how anybody can speak against this motion. These are the important factors in the agricultural industry. I should like to see the Minister get up some day and say without indulging in politics, &#x201C;Let us see what methods we can employ on a long-term basis to combat drought conditions and to rehabilitate farmers who have virtually been ruined by droughts&#x201D;. We are still waiting for that day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park as well as the hon: member for Walmer and to a certain extent also the hon. member for East London (City) raised quite a number of matters regarding subsidies. They expressed views as to how the State should give even more assistance. The hon. member for Newton Park said that money was being made available for subsidies of up to 50 per cent for the purchasing of lucerne. He spoke about money to keep the farmer on the farm in times of drought. But he did not say how one was going to keep him on the farm with money during times of drought when dams and watering places were empty. It would be useless to give the person money in circumstances such as those which prevailed in the country during the past two years, when lucerne was unobtainable. The hon. member for Walmer asked for subsidies on electricity and on farm labour: Heaven knows how many more subsidies they are going to ask for. I am concerned about this question of subsidies, because we are more and more inclined to ask for subsidies. The pride and the prestige of being a farmer is gradually disappearing. Eventually the position may arise that a man is no longer the lord and master of his holding or farm. That sense of pride will disappear.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) spoke about adequate assistance and assistance which should be given in good time. I just want to tell you, Sir, what has been done in this country by the Department of Agricultural Credit during the past nine months. I am not mentioning old figures. I am speaking of the period from 1st April to 31st December. During this period the Agricultural Credit Board rendered great assistance to category 3 farmers, that is to say, farmers who could no longer obtain assistance from their own commercial banks, agricultural co-operative societies or the Land Bank. We must remember that these are farmers who were on the verge of collapse, farmers who were almost insolvent. Over a period of nine months these farmers obtained long-term loans for 25 years at 5 per cent interest to the amount of R3,054,000, as well as production loans to the amount of R2,444,000 to sow the maize crop of almost 90 million bags, while another R10 million was made available to agricultural cooperative societies for the purpose of financing farmers. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>That was done within a period of nine months, and that is the amount that was paid to those farmers about whom the hon. member for East London (City) is so concerned. That amount was paid to 3,768 farmers. I am not talking about the amount that was approved; a considerably larger amount was approved. The hon. member referred disparagingly to the rations totalling R37,000 paid during that same period of nine months, but in addition thereto loans amounting to R4,469,000 at 5 per cent interest and repayable over a period of five years were granted in respect of stock feed. Over a period of nine months a total amount of R10.5 million <span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_0348"/>was granted in the form of loans to assist needy farmers. But the hon. member asks whether it was given in good time and whether it was enough. Can you believe it, Sir! What more does he want? I am not even mentioning the financial assistance given by the Land Bank to farmers who do not fall in category 3 nor all the other rebates and subsidies on artificial fertilizers, for example. Let us think realistically. Mention was made here of increasing agricultural prices. I agree that the prices of agricultural products should be brought into line with the increase in production costs. We all accept that, but we must remember that we are living in a country which has a wonderful ability to recover. Sir, if you visit the areas where trees have died as a result of the drought, you will be surprised to see what those areas look like after the rains. It is a pity though that the rains were not country-wide. But those people rehabilitate themselves because the country is able to recover so rapidly. But what will happen if one increases the price of meat to an unrealistically high level, as the hon. member for East London (City) asked should be done when he held up a piece of meat here? Fish, roasting chickens and quite a number of other products, such as pork, which can recover rapidly, will become readily available as substitutes for that meat, and then we will be creating artificial shortages and surpluses. We must view the matter in its entirety. The hon. the Minister said that we should reason like adults and should not try to derive political gain from the matter.</p>

<p>A member representing an urban constituency will gain nothing by spreading this kind of story. This side of the House speaks on behalf of those who gain their livelihood from the land in the rural areas, and I think hon. members opposite are skating on thin ice.</p>

<p>I just want to ask the hon. member for Newton Park, what would happen if we increased agricultural prices out of all proportion? He was concerned about the stock position to-day. The stock-farming areas would then be converted into agricultural areas. Maize would be produced in areas where it should not be produced, and we would be encouraging over-cropping. That is what would happen if the prices were too high. [Interjections.] The hon. member for East London (City) said so many things a few moments ago which I simply cannot understand. During the no-confidence debate the hon. member for Newton Park said that 80 per cent of the farmers in the country had an income of less than R3,000 per year. Why make such a statement and leave it hanging in the air? Surely he knows that the farmer with an income of R3,000 has already paid his living expenses. He has already paid for his groceries and has paid his current expenses.</p>

<p>While mention has been made here of the chaotic circumstances in which the farmers find themselves, let me just give the figures for the years 1946 to 1965. In less than 20 years, with the number of farmers reduced by one-third, 75 per cent more food was produced, and that while agriculture was supposed to be in such a pitiful state. The monetary value of our agriculture was R262 million in 1946, while it was R980 million in 1965. Now they will say that the value of money has decreased. Very well, over that same period of 20 years the number of tractors increased from 20,000 to more than 130,000. Is agriculture faring so badly?</p>

<p>Speaking of prices, I want to stress once again that unrealistic prices is the surest way of causing the rural areas to be depopulated.</p>

<p>The hon. member has mentioned overseas prices. He poses as an expert on conditions in Australia, but when we speak of overseas prices, we should always view the entire matter in the right perspective. We cannot compare this country, with its own peculiar circumstances, with other countries. I shall read you only one sentence from an article entitled: &#x201C;The Wage Hour Law and Agriculture&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Act established a minimum wage of one dollar an hour beginning 1st February, 1967, for workers employed by farmers. This minimum wage jumps to one dollar fifteen cents an hour on 1st February, 1968, and to one dollar thirty cents an hour on 1st February, 1969. This wage escalation is not projected beyond 1969.</block>

<p>Those are the wages paid in the country to which some of the hon. members referred and where they said the farmers were getting so much for a pound of meat. I say one should first make very sure of one&#x2019;s facts before one says things like that. Let me just mention one more point. While conditions in our country are being criticized so much, do you know, Sir, that as far as I have been able to ascertain South Africa is the only country in the world where a farmer need not pay income tax provided he keeps his wits about him? Are the hon. members aware of that? [Interjections.] The farmer who makes profits can plough those profits back in the form of camps, fences, soil conservation works and dams. He can do all those things in order to carry out your suggestion without Government assistance. South Africa is the only country in the world where that can be done, but it is nevertheless being alleged that our agriculture is in a pitiful state. There are very few people who pay so much in indirect taxation as the farmer. He pays indirect tax on fuel, tyres, implements and so forth. The farmer contributes his share. I am speaking only of direct income tax.</p>

<p><span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0349"/>I now want to deal briefly with the final part of the motion introduced by the hon. member for Newton Park, viz. the restoration of grazing and the reclamation of land. We are living in a country where years of drought follow upon years of rain as the winter follows the summer, and we should plan our agricultural pattern accordingly. We should not always run to the State for assistance. Cannot hon. members on the Opposition side use what little influence they still have in the rural areas to help us to propagate the idea that we as farmers should search our own hearts instead of constantly trying to belittle the Government in a negative manner in this type of debate?

<p>&#x2026; a son that causeth shame&#x201D;. I almost said &#x201C;like the hon. the member for East London (City)&#x201D;. Are we going to put aside pastoral areas this summer for the difficult winter seasons that lie ahead? South Africa is divided into 70 climatic regions, of which 16 regions suffered from drought 20 times in 60 years; in other words, one drought every third year. Let us be prepared to see to it ourselves that fodder is stored up, as was suggested by the hon. the Minister, and let us prepare ourselves for the difficulties that lie ahead. We get R8 a head for the withdrawal of stock. The hon. member for Newton Park said that R8 was too little and that the State did not take into consideration the breeding quality of the cattle. I say that I cannot make R8 a head out of my cattle farming and here I get it from the State. If the hon. member says that that is too little, how much should it be then? Why does he not suggest how much it should be?</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing this thought: the preservation of our soil is the function not only of the State or of the farmer; it is the function of the city dweller as well; it is also the function of the non-Europeans of the country. Every inhabitant of this Republic should have the preservation of the soil at heart and should show his love of the land. During the recent drought the ordinary man on the Witwatersrand realized what the value of water was, and I am grateful to be able to say that where we have societies for the protection of animals, interest is also being aroused in things such as the National Veld Trust to mobilize those people and to make them interested in the preservation and the protection of the soil with its trees and its shrubs. The result will be that we shall make true patriots out of people.</p>

Has the hon. the Minister asked himself why they are unhappy? Has he asked himself what is wrong with this sick industry in South Africa, because, let us face it, this is a sick industry. This is the industry which is being sacrificed for every other consideration. The Minister likes to boast that we have the cheapest agricultural produce in the world. We have that, and we are proud of it, but at what expense to the industry itself? I want to repeat to the hon. the Minister the question put to him by the hon. member for Walmer when he asked why, if the farming industry was not sick, as it is to-day, if the farmers were satisfied, the late Dr. Verwoerd took it upon himself to appoint a commission to inquire into the position of this industry in our land?

<p>Sir, he mentioned earlier that perhaps we were suggesting that mealies should be planted in uneconomic areas. I want to remind the hon. member of the action which was taken a few years ago by this Government in the issue of additional quotas for sugar in Natal. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, in his wisdom, allowed appeals by all but one farmer for additional quotas and for new quotas, in areas where that hon. Minister had been told that it was not economic to grow sugar, in areas where he had been told that the risk not only of drought but of frost and other climatic conditions were against the establishment and the economic growing of sugar cane. That hon. Minister in his wisdom decided to issue these permits and what is the position to-day? We have Mr. Barnes, chairman of the S.A. Canegrowers Association, saying in a report to the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 29th January of this year&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0350"/>The individual grower&#x2019;s position has become desperate. I don&#x2019;t know whether he can take much more.</p>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been fashionable to lay the blame on the farmer. This hobby-horse has been ridden too far and too long. The farmer is just as much part of the community as anyone else and most of the costs which he has to incur are ones over which he has little or no control.</block>

<p>This brings me to the next point that I want to raise. During this address to the annual congress of the S.A. Agricultural Union, the chairman, Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers mentioned what he called two man-made disasters for agriculture; one was the increase in the interest rate and the other was the increase in rail tariffs. Sir, he called those man-made disasters. I feel that he was just being polite at that time and that they should rather have been called &#x201C;Government-made disasters&#x201D;. I want to add some further disasters to the two mentioned by him. The first one I want to add is the Government&#x2019;s policy of protecting secondary industries in South Africa at the expense of the farmer.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>This is another example of the sacrifice of the farmer on the altars of prosperity and expansion in South Africa. The latest report of the Economic Review has admitted that prices of locally produced products have increased twice as much as imported goods. We find to-day that the farmer is being asked to use chaff-cutter blades, harrow discs, plough shares and irrigation equipment manufactured locally which in many instances are inferior to the imported product and cost very much more. Mr. Summers went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The farmers are paying heavily for the nation&#x2019;s desire to become independent of overseas supplies. We would not object to this, if it was taken into consideration when prices of dairy products are fixed, with a view to becoming independent of imports of butter and cheese.</block>

<p>I am the last one&#x2014;and hon. members on this side are the last people&#x2014;to derogate from the efforts of this Government to make South Africa independent of overseas supplies. But is not our primary aim to feed our people? Must we not stabilize our own farming industry? What is the good of having munitions, of having oil, of having everything else that we might need, if we have no food? Because, then, Sir, we cannot exist.</p>

<p>This brings us to the next point, namely the failure of the Government to fix an economic price for agricultural products. We have heard talk this afternoon of stabilizing income and not stabilizing prices so much. The Minister put a direct question to the hon. member for Walmer. Now, I want to give the Minister the answer of Professor Du Plessis, the consultant economist of the S.A.A.U. He says, according to a report before me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The farmer does not share fairly in the economic growth of the country, and when he does receive higher prices for controlled products to meet higher costs these increases relate to a position one or two years ago. During that period the farmer has had to carry the burden. If the authorities when fixing prices agreed to include the further factors of the real increase in the national wealth over the year ahead and the loss in purchasing power of money then farm incomes would be more stable and related more closely to the state of the nation.</block>

<p>Professor Du Plessis&#x2019; answer to the direct question of the hon. the Minister is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some hard bargaining will take place to choose mutually acceptable basic starting prices for the new scheme.</block>

<p>Not based on last year&#x2019;s income, or last year&#x2019;s price, or the income of any one particular year. This must be done by negotiation, by consideration of figures over a period, and not based on one year only&#x2026; He continues:</p>

<block name="quote">Thereafter, as graphs prove, farmers who produce controlled products would be much better off than they are now.</block>

[Interjections.] We can have the figures for August last year, but I do not think they will compare with those for January this year. However, Sir, the point that I am trying to get at here is that we had a drought period prior to 1960. In 1961-&#x2019;62 production figures of dairy products in South Africa reached a peak, they reached the highest figure that they have ever attained. And what was the outcome? This Government reduced the producer&#x2019;s price of that product.</p>

<p>I ask the Minister, what was the effect of that reduction in price? The effect was a reduction in production. The comparative production figures of butter show that in 1963 South Africa produced, in round figures, 97 million lbs. In 1964 the figure was 87 million lbs. In 1965 we produced 81 million lbs. We have not been able to receive exact figures for 1966 but it was estimated at 80 million lbs. Therefore there was a reduction in production over four years of 17 million lbs. of butter.</p>

<p>These are the Minister&#x2019;s figures. As far as cheese is concerned, the comparative figures are as follows: From 1963 to 1966 they dropped from 34 million lbs. to 30 million lbs. Why was there this drop, Sir? Because the farmer lost confidence in the industry. Farmers went into more remunerative branches of agriculture.</p>

<p>During the same period, that is from 1963 to 1966 the production of cheese in this country dropped from 34 million lbs. to an estimated 30 million lbs., a drop of 4 million lbs. But what happened to consumption in that same period? Consumption of butter went up from 100 million to an estimated 108 million lbs. per annum. The consumption of cheese went up from 35Â¾ million lbs. to an estimated <i>36&#x00BD;</i> million lbs. So while the consumption of butter in this country rose by 8 million lbs. production went down by 17 million lbs., in other words, there was a difference of 25 million lbs. This hon. Minister told us during the last session that there is plenty of cheap butter, cheap dairy products available in other parts of the world. The inference that we drew from his statement was that it was cheaper to import butter, that it was in fact more profitable to import butter and other dairy products than to subsidize&#x2014;not necessarily to subsidize but to assist our dairy farmers to get on to their feet, to assist our dairy farmers to find their level. Has the Minister taken cognizance of the warnings that have been issued by the W.H.O., by the U.N. Food Organization, by every similar organization throughout the world? The warnings given are that throughout the world the demand for food is increasing. With the enlightening of former backward countries the demand for all these products has increased. But production is not increasing, and the time is coming when this Government will not be able to get the cheap dairy products that it has been able to obtain so far.</p>

<p>What is the answer here? We have asked that this Government should introduce practical measures for the rehabilitation of farmers. Not only the rehabilitation, but also the re-establishment and the consolidation of our farmers. We have asked that this Government assist the farmer to be more productive per unit. During the last session I personally pleaded here in support of an application made by the Natal and East Griqualand Fresh Milk producers&#x2019; Union to the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services to allow organized agriculture to establish their own research centres and to assist them to do so because it has been found that notwithstanding the good work done by this Minister&#x2019;s Department, somewhere there is a breakdown between the Department and the farmer.</p>

<heading>CO-ORDINATION OF HEALTH SERVICES</heading>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to move the motion standing in my name, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of achieving greater and better co-ordination between the health services which are undertaken by the Central Government, provincial administrations and local authorities.</block>

<p>I am very well aware of the fact that this matter is not being discussed in this House for the first time. The topic of public health and the endeavour to achieve greater and better co-ordination among the services rendered by the Central Government, the provincial administrations and local authorities, has been discussed in this House before. But it is also a fact that this has been a topic for discussion over a period of many years and also around many other conference tables. Ever <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0352"/>since olden times conferences have been held on this matter, and commissions of inquiry have been appointed on many occasions. I do not want to go too far back, but I want to start with the year 1886 when, for instance, a commission was appointed at the Cape to inquire into venereal diseases; a similar commission was appointed in the Transvaal in 1906. In 1911 an inquiry was instituted into the health of Bantu mine-workers; in 1925 to 1926 a special inquiry was instituted into the incidence of plague; in 1930 to 1931 an inquiry was instituted into malaria. The Gluckmann Commission of 1942 to 1944, to which reference will be made again later, and the Havenga Commission of 1949 ate two further commissions which were appointed. In 1959 a commission of inquiry was appointed into ionizing radiation. In 1960 a commission was appointed to inquire into the high cost of medical services and medicines. There have also been commissions on health conditions in Ban&#x2019;u homelands, an inquiry into chiropractic, commissions on dental services, on fluoridation, an inquiry into nursing, an inquiry into safe-guarding man against poisons, and so one can probably add many others to this list. Then there was the Borckenhagen Commission and the Schumann Commission which dealt with financial relations amongst the Central Government, the provincial administrations and local authorities; and then the discussions held by provincial administrations and local authorities themselves on many aspects of health services.</p>

<p>Nor do I believe that this will be the last time that this topic, namely achieving better co-ordination between the health services, and other aspects of health will be brought to the attention of this House. If there had been an easier recipe for achieving greater co-ordination, we would already have finished talking about this matter. But since we are unable to find an easy or simply obvious recipe for realizing our ultimate ideal, we shall neither be able to settle this matter by discussion today, nor find the wonder formula for achieving that which we are aspiring to. But it is my conviction, Mr. Speaker, and this is also a conviction which is endorsed by others, that under the present system of providing medical and health services, we are not conforming to the highest medical requirements, and that we are not providing the most efficient and the most economic health service. We are not serving health, and our public health in particular, as well as it is possible to do so. To-day I am touching upon this matter again because I should like to serve health and because my aim is the maximum we can render to public health in South Africa. That is the point at issue and that alone! It is also for that reason that I thought it fit to raise this matter in the House again.</p>

<p>Should I sound critical and refer to certain aspects of the rendering of services by several administrations, then I shall only do so in this spirit and in this attitude of mind, namely that it is aimed at serving health. If I refer critically to certain aspects of the rendering of Services, I shall not do so with the intention of being derogatory. Nor is it at all my intention to speak disparagingly of the services rendered by the various authorities. On the contrary, it is with the greatest appreciation that I take cognizance of the work they have done, and I shall also mention the work they have done. Even with the defective liaison which exists, with the little co-ordination I observe and the inevitable overlapping which must occur, we have made a great deal of progress and we are appreciative of that.</p>

<p>I also Want to say that it is impossible for me to touch upon every aspect of this matter, and I am leaving it to some of my colleagues to refer to certain aspects&#x2014;one of them will refer to local authorities in particular and the other, a physician who practised medicine, will refer to the particular problems experienced by&#x2019; the medical practitioner in this regard. At the end of a discussion such as this one in this House, one usually expects the Minister to reply and to state the Government&#x2019;s point of view in respect of such a matter. I know that the Minister will give us a reply to-day and that he will elucidate some of the aspects of the matter we will have touched upon, but I am also thoroughly aware of the fact that there are reports of commissions of inquiry which are still being considered. There are various State Departments which are busy on these reports. In addition there are further negotiations which have to be conducted with the provincial administrations, and many of these matters have not nearly reached finality. At this early stage it would also be unfair and unreasonable of me&#x2014;and I realize this&#x2014;to expect the hon. the Minister to give us the necessary replies in respect of everything which will have been touched upon. Nor shall I charge him with that because, as is customary, he will not be able to furnish us with information in that regard, since other bodies and persons will have to be approached about these matters first.</p>

<p>In the motion there is mention of three bodies which are rendering service: the Central Government, the provincial administrations and local authorities. The fact that these three bodies are engaged in providing health services in the country, is not a mere coincidence. The entire framework under which we operate, the entire set-up, namely that there is no unitary authority, is for several reasons very easy to explain. It is bound up with our history, our entire process of political development, the nature of our geography: a large country with a sparse population, except for certain major concentrations of people. It is therefore necessary to pay some attention to the historic process, to note how we came to have the set-up we have at present. Before the Union of South Africa came into being, each colony had its own health laws. The responsibility of dealing with the outbreak of infectious diseases and other matters relating to health <span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0353"/>rested with the colonial governments. By means of legislation local authorities were established and they were also vested with powers in respect of sanitation and health services within their areas of jurisdiction. Health matters which were not of a purely local nature&#x2014;such as the construction of hospitals, health regulations at seaports and other incidental matters&#x2014;remained the responsibility of the colonial governments.</p>

<p>With the merging of the four provinces into a single political unit by the South Africa Act of 1909, only passing mention was mde in that Act of the health of the inhabitants of South Africa. The colonial governments which had been converted into provincial administrations, were permitted to retain some of their functions, such as the control <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0354"/>over local governments, the construction and maintenance of hospitals as well as education&#x2014;with the exception of higher education, of course&#x2014;and strangely enough, in the latter case it was the traditional interpretation that this also involved medical inspection of schools and school hygiene. Public health is not mentioned in the South Africa Act, but by virtue of such colonial legislation as was not repealed by the South Africa Act, local authorities could still proceed with these services within their areas of jurisdiction. The prevention of the outbreak of infectious diseases was deemed to be the task and function of the Central Government. Since the Act had not given any emphatic and clear definition as to public health, and since there was doubt as well as confusion as to the extent of the services each of the service-rendering bodies had to provide, overlapping resulted; friction even resulted and occasionally there was evidence of certain aspects of our health service being neglected. This was still the position at the time of the outbreak of the influenza epidemic in 1918. This particular event proved to be a rude awakening to the authorities and pointed a finger at the particular inadequacy of the legal machinery which existed for controlling public health. The result was the convocation of the National Health Conference in Bloemfontein in 1918. The Conference had to try to eliminate defective legislation and to place the control over and the administration of health services in South Africa on a sound basis. The three service-rendering bodies&#x2014;medical and welfare organizations, mining concerns, and so forth&#x2014;were represented at this big conference.</p>

<p>The Public Health Act. Act No. 36 of 1919, resulted from the work of this conference. The establishment of the Department of Health or Public Health, as it was previously called in section 2 of that Act, also resulted from the work of that conference. Over the years it has been necessary to amend this Act, as necessitated by changing circumstances or as experience in regard to many matters was gained in the course of years.</p>

<p>But the machinery which was established by that Act, is in the main still the machinery which takes care of public health in South Africa at present. Mr. Speaker, I am going to quote you an extract from <i>Medical and Health Legislation in the Union of South Africa</i> by Cluver: &#x201C;The original Public Health Act of 1919 thus placed varying degrees of responsibility on three different authorities, namely the Central Government, the Provincial Administrations and local authorities, and this situation still obtains to-day. The basic principle of local responsibility for the control of infectious diseases and environmental sanitation has not been altered.&#x201D; But since those far-off days of 1919, the enlightened public opinion, the opinions of professional people and even that of the lay-man, has insisted on the country&#x2019;s health services being re-orientated on a more realistic basis. Next we come to a further significant development in 1942, namely the appointment of the National Health Service Commission. For the first time an attempt was made here at viewing public health, and the needs in that regard, in its entirety. Accordingly this Commission recommended that personal health services and non-personal health services should be separated, and in this process it appeared as though they wanted to eliminate the provincial administrations. Their recommendations were not accepted, and the conclusion at which one arrives, the summary of what one can in fact call the result of their attempts, is that the responsibilities of the three service-rendering bodies&#x2014;the Central Government, the provincial administrations and the local authorities&#x2014;were merely confirmed. Arrangements in regard to outpatients, district nursing services and the subsidies payable by the State, were in fact defined more closely.</p>

<p>In 1949 we had the Havenga Commission. The Commission recommended as a long-term policy that the Central Government and/or the provinces should gradually accept full financial and executive responsibility for personal health services, with certain provisos and agreements in respect of the subsidies the State would grant the provinces and local authorities. In the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, too, the service levels which had been undertaking the rendering of health and medical services in South Africa since 1910, were retained without any changes.</p>

<p>Now I just want to mention to you the various spheres in which these three service-rendering bodies act. I mention the Central Government first. Apart from its general functions, namely to advise, to inspect and to assist and, in the case of local authorities, even to coerce, it has the following functions: (a) the maintenance of institutions for lepers; (b) the construction and maintenance of sanatoriums for tuberculosis patients; (c) the construction and maintenance of hospitals for venereal diseases as well as hospitals for the mentally ill; (d) the maintenance of port health services; (e) the construction and maintenance of laboratoriums not only for exercising control over public health, but also in regard to the control over therapeutic substances, X-ray and other units which have to be maintained; (f) district surgeon services, whether full-time or part-time, and (g) inspections in terms of the Food, Drugs and Disinfectants Act. Then there are certain laws of which one may mention a few just in order to illustrate further what the task of the Central Government is in respect of health. I mention to you the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, the Dental Mechanicians Act, the Post Mortem Examinations and Removal of Human Tissues Act, and the Nursing Act; there are many more still, but by mentioning these names, a clear indication is given of the matters with which they deal.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, I come to the provinces. Their functions are the construction, control and administration of hospitals&#x2014;excluding those for which the State is responsible at present; subsequently, also as a result of several factors, a greater measure of responsibility which they accepted for out-patients and district nursing services. In view of the fact that it is not possible for the provincial administrations to defray all these services out of their own funds, arrangements were made for financial support to be given by the State in the form of subsidies. Another function of the provincial administration is the control over local authorities, especially where it concerns health services, of course. The functions of local authorities are as follows: (a) the provision of hospitals and institutions for isolating persons suffering from infectious diseases, and in this case the Minister may also require a local authority to provide such a service; (b) the rendering of the usual services: providing unpolluted water, milk and dairy products; (c) the provision of sanitary services&#x2014;i.e. the non-personal health services, and (d) the provision of housing as well as meeting certain other requirements in regard to the Housing Acts. In this respect, too, certain financial relations obtain between the local authority and the State. For instance, in many cases the State also provides part of the salary of approved health officers, and the scale which is applicable in general and in most cases, is a scale of 87&#x00BD; per cent of such salaries.</p>

<p>I also realize that a Central Health Services and Hospitals Co-ordinating Council, established in terms of Act No. 51 of 1946, does exist. Representatives of both the Central Government and the provinces serve on that Council. The aim and object of this body is to achieve the effective correlation and co-ordination of hospital and other personal health services in our country, and to bring about better collaboration in this regard between the Central Government and the provincial administrations, for the general benefit of the community. It is not my intention to talk with contempt about the work done by this body. They have been doing great work over many years and one is grateful for what they have done. But I also believe that they are engaged in an almost super-human and impossible task, namely that of trying to correlate and co-ordinate health services when there are five authorities, each with its own sphere and each following its own policy.</p>

<p>Now that I have given you these particulars, it will be fair to ask whether this service arrangement on three levels&#x2014;five levels, really &#x2014;is the best method for achieving our goal, namely retaining and restoring good health and preventing ill-health. Is that the most advantageous method as viewed from the service angle as well as the economic angle? The best reply I give to such a question, is to quote from the Snyman Report, 1962, on page 29&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Taxation is levied on three levels, State, provincial and local authority. Part of this is devoted to health services and an effort is made on four levels to provide health care, a care which fundamentally cannot recognize barriers whether cartographic, economic or political, since disease and health are intrinsically not divisible along these (or similar) lines.<br/>It is a fundamental fact that the afflicted and the community cannot receive the maximum or adequate service through the medium of such a divided system which artifically divides the patient into preventive and curative sections, and further between the physical and mental sections; he is also sub-divided in accordance with infectious diseases (yet not all) and finally also divides his financial obligations. Yet the retention and restoration of health should be the starting-point and primary test of a medical service while other considerations should be subservient.<br/>This duplication unquestionably creates not only an inadequate service but also extra expenditure by the overlapping agencies. There is the duplication of out-patient services, the diverging pattern, placing, staffing and management of hospitals; the separate purchase of supplies, especially instruments and pharmaceutical goods; the lack of standardization of items in common use.</block>

<p>I think that this is an almost conclusive reply to the question I have just asked. However, let me now mention specific examples to prove that what has just been said about a divided system and how such a system cannot possibly result in our population being provided with the best, is the true state of affairs. In the case of the Central Government, health services are provided by the Department of Health, but in addition to the main services provided by that Department, services are defrayed and sometimes also provided by nine other State Departments. I am taking the Estimates for 1960-&#x2019;61 as an example, and I mention the following Departments with the amounts involved: Prisons, R250,000; Justice, R1,366,000; Public Service Commission, R224,000; Mining, R870,000; Defence, R420,000; Social Welfare, R480,000&#x2014;a total <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0355"/>of R3,939,000 in respect of all these State Departments. The total Estimates for the Department of Health amounted to R26,532,000 for the same period. If we take this amount spent by the Department of Health, the expenditure of other State Departments I have mentioned as well as the provincial <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0356"/>administrations&#x2019; expenditure in respect of health, the expenditure for that year amounts to approximately R97.5 million, and for the total population it works out at <i>per capita</i> expenditure of R6.50. I must add that local authorities have not been included. If I say R6.50 <i>per capita</i> for the total population, then it is interesting to note that for the same year the <i>per capita</i> expenditure amounted to R4.53 in the Cape Province and R2.49 in the Free State. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain the figures for the Transvaal and Natal. So much for the State.</p>

<p>Now we come to the provincial administrations. &#x201C;There is a striking difference between the expenditure from own provincial revenue sources in respect of the range of medical services, the size and composition of their population as well as their sources of income. In 1960 the provincial expenditure on hospital and health services took up the following share of the provincial income from own sources&#x2026;" Expenditure on hospitals and health services in 1960, amounted to the following percentages of their income. In the Transvaal it was 56 per cent; in the Cape Province, 57 per cent; in Natal, 72 per cent, and in the Free State, 40 per cent. The expenditure, expressed as a percentage of the total income, including Government subsidies, was as follows: Transvaal, 27.67 per cent; Cape Province, 25.78 per cent: Natal, 37 per cent, and the Free State, 14.8 per cent. If one listens to these figures, it almost sounds as though we are not speaking of one and the same country, but of various countries in which there are such diverging differences.</p>

<p>As far as the building of hospitals is concerned, each of these service levels proceeds on its own and provides its own hospitals. Not nearly enough use is being made of building research, planned sizes of hospitals and the standardizing of building materials or basic equipment. We must bear in mind that the capital funds required for the construction of hospitals are being made available by the Central Government, i.e. from Estimates approved by this Parliament. But subsequent to that the Central Government has no further say in this matter and the province may do with that money as it pleases. I know about a case&#x2014;I am not going to mention the provinces&#x2014;where a particularly luxurious nurses&#x2019; home was built for Bantu nurses. In the case of another province&#x2014;one may almost call this a waste of money&#x2014;part of these capital funds were used to finance additions to a certain large hospital. Experts were of the opinion that that hospital <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0357"/>should never have been built on that particular spot, because its maintenance costs on that particular site were three or four times higher than the average; nevertheless, R.4 million was spent on major additions to the buildings and these additions did not effect any increase worth mentioning in the number of available beds. This merely goes to show that funds voted by the Central Government come into the hands of the provinces, and that the provinces do with that money as they deem fit. We do not always condemn the way in which they act, but the Central Government has no further control over those funds.</p>

<p>Moreover, each of these service levels acts independently and individually as far as purchases are concerned. In this regard I am thinking of instruments and medicaments in particular, and as far as running costs are concerned, these two items are particularly important. If there had been a common system of purchase, the cost as regards these two items in particular could have been reduced a great deal. In view of the fact that every authority has its own system of purchase, there is quite a variety of the same locally manufactured equipment, and in spite of the efforts of the Bureau of Standards, for instance, to help local industries manufacturing steel tube equipment for hospitals to standardize, the requirements of the various authorities are quite different. For instance, at the moment five different standardized bedside cabinets are available to hospitals, and it has become known that one of the provinces did not decide on one of these five cabinets, but on a modified form of these five types. Add to this the overlapping as regards staff. I shall mention to you the chief officials in particular: chief regional health officers with their staff&#x2014;not distributed on a provincial basis; four provincial directors of hospital services with their staff; the chief medical officers of health boards in the Transvaal and Natal; the chief medical officer of the divisional councils in the Cape Province, each with its own staff and his own pattern, and the medical officers of larger cities and some towns with their staff as well as their own framework in which they provide the public with medical services. Among these major groups there is no compulsory liaison, no common control and no integration of services.</p>

<p>Agreements do in fact exist among them, voluntary agreements relating to provision of staff and conditions of employment, but even if such voluntary agreements do exist, it is also known that continuous competition occurs as regards the recruitment of staff. A good example is that of clerks. Although agreed salary scales do exist, the Natal authorities require a Standard 8 certificate only, while the State and the Transvaal require matriculation as a qualification for the same type of post. One notices different requirements everywhere, especially in those categories of officers and staff of which our country has a particular shortage. And so one can continue. There is the matter of the prestige of each of the provincial administrations. It is probably a fine thing to aim at something of that nature, but it may also facilitate uneconomic rendering of services in the sphere of health, because whatever one of them has, the others would also like to have; not one of them would like to compare unfavourably with the others. This results in the duplication of highly specialized divisions with certain specialized equipment; the capital invested in such divisions is extremely high, but then there is also the duplication of highly specialized technical staff, which entails higher costs. You also know, Mr. Speaker, that some of the provinces experimented with free hospitalization schemes for a few years; the Transvaal had one from 1948 to 1958, the Cape Province had one which started in 1950 and lasted a few years, but Natal and the Free State had no such services. In the various spheres with which my colleagues will deal, there are other anomalies which they will probably point out. Having referred to these matters, one asks oneself: What is the solution? One feels that, after so many years of discussion and commissions, one cannot assume to oneself the right to say that one has found the miraculous solution, nor is it my intention to assume to myself that right. However, the fact of the matter is that we must find a solution. We must find a solution in order to realize the ideal we have set ourselves, namely the best health service for the population. If the solution is not to be found in the course taken by the present bodies which are to co-ordinate and correlate with one another, then, as far as I myself am concerned, the Central Government should simply exercise its authority and take that right into its own hands by way of enforcing authority, if need be. It is possible to continue and to refer to statements made in the Snyman Report so as to show how this fragmentation of services is viewed by many people and how they expect something else. Mr. Speaker, owing to political development a line was drawn from 1909 right through to the Public Health Act of 1919. The pattern of that Act was continued and we are still saddled with that pattern. I believe that we must break away from that pattern at some time or other, because if we do not break away, we shall never achieve the ideal we are trying to realize, namely to obtain the best for our people. I believe that our people deserve nothing but the best, and we must try to give them the best.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to compliment the hon. member for Germiston for bringing this very important matter to the notice of the House. The hon. member has given us a fairly clear history of what has taken place during the past 40 to 50 years. He has emphasized how many commissions of enquiry have already sat to deal with this very difficult matter. But what is surprising is that after we have had available to us the findings of the various commissions which have investigated this matter, we are in an even worse position to-day than we were when the first commission sat. Something must be wrong somewhere. The fact that the hon. member for Germiston has had the courage to bring this matter to the notice of the House and virtually to condemn the administration of his own Government is something to be admired. For that reason alone we on this side of the House will not move an amendment. We would rather support what the hon. member said and perhaps elucidate the matter a little further. Sir, after listening to the hon. member for Germiston I would say that the machinery which is available to-day is not bad machinery, but it is obvious to me and I think to all members here that the persons manning the machines are at fault. We must find out where the fault lies. There is some sort of liaison between the Central Government, the provinces and local government. Some sort of liaison is obviously present but it is poor liaison. There is no real connection between the provinces; there is no standardization. Not only is there poor liaison between the various levels of government and each province but there is also very poor liaison, as far as health matters are concerned, between the Department of Health and other State Departments, particularly the Department of Education, Arts and Science and the Department of Social Welfare. If we can devise some sort of stimulus, not a change of machinery, but a stimulus to see that the machinery that we have at the moment works well and in harmony with each branch of the service, then I think we will have solved the problem. To-day health has virtually become a luxury, and for a person who is ill it becomes almost an impossibility to exist. If we do not devise some scheme or other to alleviate the position of those who suffer illness and the consequences of illness, one will always be able to point a finger at the Department of Health in this country and the head of the Department and to say that those people particularly are inefficient and that they are not carrying out their duty to the public properly. I think that the hon. member for Germiston was a fair critic, and I think if he had had more time he would have elaborated even further, but let me carry on from where he left off. Let us first discuss the question of the availability of bed-space for the ill. That is basically the important stage at which to start. The State has 3,352 beds available for tuberculosis; and for mental diseases 20,244 beds; for other diseases such as leprosy, etc., 2,120. The provincial administrations together with the isolation hospitals have approximately 29,000 beds available. The private hospitals and the mission hospitals have almost got the same number; they have nearly 26,000 beds available. Sir, what is important about those figures is that the private hospitals and the mission hospitals are well-staffed; they have sufficient nurses, but the provincial hospitals and the State hospitals are under-staffed. That is something which should never have happened because it is the provincial and the State hospitals which are the sources of supply; they are the teaching hospitals; they are the hospitals which have been supplying the material, in the main, for the private hospitals, and whereas the private hospitals are flourishing and are always full and there is a demand for accommodation because of the nursing services that are available, what do we find in the provincial hospitals? We find, especially in the Transvaal, that wards are empty, not because there are not patients for those wards, but because there are not sufficient nurses to look after the patients who should be in those wards. So I say then that basically we must start and make sure that we devise a plan whereby we can retain the nursing staff that we teach. The nursing profession should be made attractive, more attractive than it is now, not only as far as salaries are concerned but also as far as facilities and other perks are concerned. We must say to the ladies who come to our provincial hospitals that we are going to teach them and train them, and that it is expected of them to stay with the hospitals for so many years after they have qualified. If we can start and get that part of the machine operating, then we have something to go by and something on which we can build.</p>

<p>The next difficulty we find is the fact that we have not got enough doctors in the country. I have repeatedly said this. In 1958 when I first came to this House I warned the then Minister&#x2014;and I said to him that something had to be done; otherwise we were going to be in serious trouble. The present Ambassador in London sat on the Government benches then, and he felt that we did have sufficient doctors but that they were maldistributed. I pointed out that not only was the distribution bad at the time&#x2014;and it is still bad to-day; that was not the fault so much of the State as of the individual, but there was an overall shortage as well. To-day there is a shortfall of over 2,000 medical practitioners in the country. We find that even if we had sufficient nurses for all the beds that would be available in the various hospitals, we probably would still find difficulty, because we would not have enough doctors to look after the patients that came into the wards. I thereupon said to the Minister of Education, Arts and Science that he must start to devise ways and means of getting more students to enter the universities. There has indeed been a slight increase. But, Sir, one cannot possibly admit students to a university and teach them to become doctors unless a whole, new schedule has been worked out. In the first year there has to be sufficient space to accommodate the students. In the second year there must be sufficient material for the students to work on. After that there must be sufficient beds for them to do their clinical work. The Minister of Education, Arts and Science said to me then that the bottleneck was in the hospitals because there was not sufficient room in hospitals to take in the students when they reached their clinical year. I investigated the matter and found that the universities complain that the subsidies which the Government gave them were insufficient for them to build, so that they could accommodate more students, and the major block was therefore there.</p>

<p>The two oldest hospitals in the country today are producing virtually the fewest doctors. It is quite strange that the figures last year for admission to Witwatersrand University and Cape Town University&#x2014;I shall exclude Natal University because no White medical students train there&#x2014;were as follows. The University of Cape Town admitted 140 first-year students while Witwatersrand University admitted 118. Pretoria University, which is one of the newer universities to train doctors, admitted 495. Stellenbosch, which is still newer, admitted 172 students. I want to make it quite clear that I am not saying that it is wrong for Stellenbosch to have such high numbers, and I am pleased that Pretoria University is able to accommodate those people. But I should like to see the Witwatersrand University, where they have all the facilities to train doctors, coming nearer to that mark. That is the shocking part of the whole basis of our health services today, namely that at the Witwatersrand, where we should never turn students away from the hospital gates, the students are limited to a selected few. Fortunately the selections are good. But, Sir, who is to tell me that the boy who does not obtain a first-class Matric pass will not make a good doctor? As far as I am concerned a boy or a girl who obtains a second-class pass, or who just passes and gets a plain Matric exemption pass, very often turns out to be a first-rate student. But they are excluded to-day, and what disturbs me is that many of these children come from poorer homes and they cannot afford to go to another town for their advanced studies. As a result they are forced to enter some other profession, or drop out of university life entirely. Others go into business and other spheres of employment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to tell you how this debate ought to be conducted, but I should like to say, Sir, that without knowing what the basic faults are, it is no use discussing liaison and co-ordination of the services. We first have to find out why there is a failure in this regard, and we can only do that by going into the basis of the failure. Then we will knit it all altogether.</p>

<from><span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0358"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>This point is very important, but if you think that I should go on to something else, I shall gladly do so.</p>

<p>So we see, then, that there is a fault basically in the provision of sufficient medical staff and sufficient nursing staff in our health services. Once that happens, one finds competition amongst the provinces and one finds that if one does not take the advice of the hon. member for Germiston, then one province will start to pay&#x2014;if it is not already doing so&#x2014;higher salaries than the other provinces. I have a cutting here which bears out my contention that there is a serious threat that salaries in the Cape Province will go up so that they will be more than those paid in the Transvaal. The hon. the Minister must correct me if I am wrong, I have the cutting here, but I do not want to waste time by reading from it. Because of the shortage, there is also competition between the private hospital and the provincial hospital. The private hospitals pay more in order to attract nurses from provincial hospitals. Unless the Minister can devise ways and means of balancing salaries at a reasonable level, then he will find a drift away from the provincial hospitals. Liaison between one province and another will fail and liaison between private enterprise and provincial enterprise again will clash. These are very important problems. The Minister has never been able to face up to them. But the time has come now for him to look into the matter. As I say, it is not the machinery that is bad, but it is those who work the machinery who are at fault. We have to see to these things. I want to say then that the position as regards provincial hospitals for ordinary illnesses is a complicated matter but we have further complications. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s position as regards getting staff both medical and nursing for his mental hospitals has become a great headache to him. It is fortunate that because of modern treatment there is not such a demand to-day as there was a little while ago for the beds that are available for mental diseases. We have said to him over and over again that he must make better provision in the provincial hospitals to treat the mentally disordered and we do not necessarily mean that they must be housed in the hospital. The out-patients departments of these provincial hospitals must be expanded and extended. That can only be done if there is sufficient personnel to treat these people. The hon. the Minister knows that there are 300,000 mentally disordered people at some stage or other in South Africa. Those are the figures of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene. Not all of them are given treatment, not all of them have to be given treatment but they are at some stage of mental disturbance. It may be an emotional upset which lasts longer than it should. It may be mild schizophrenia or it may be a very badly demented case. But the treatment of the mentally disordered has become an important part of our lives. These people can no longer be separated from the ordinary type of illness, so that we want to see more liaison between the Central Government and the provinces in the treatment of mentally disordered persons. There is difficulty in obtaining sufficient nursing staff for mental hospitals. Nurses do not like to get themselves tied to a mental hospital. It does not attract them. There is very often almost a stigma attached to the girl who works in a mental hospital&#x2014;people say she is a mental nurse&#x2014;as if it were a grade below an ordinary nurse. I think that the people who do the work in mental hospitals are to be admired. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think that,, that is one branch of the nursing service that should receive special attention. If necessary they should receive a higher salary than other nursing personnel because their work is a difficult branch of nursing. These girls who work in mental hospitals do not even wear the same epaulettes. They used to wear a blue epaulette to signify that they are working there and I hope that that sort of distinction will disappear.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, if he wants proper liaison and if he advocates that, he must do something as far as the Transvaal is concerned. They are making a hash of every department that they run. They have got a concrete skeleton standing on Hospital Hill that has been there since 1962 and nothing has been done about it. The most disgusting sort of comment is being made about it. I find that the information officer of the Provincial Council says that it was started prematurely and that the only reason why it was started in 1962 was to give impetus to a fading building trade. Is that why you start a hospital&#x2014;to give stimulus to the building trade? Since then it stands there without a brick having been added to this concrete structure which is a disgrace not only to the town but to the administration of the Transvaal. At the South Rand hospital we have wards that are being left empty because they cannot get sufficient nurses there. In our day we had free hospitalization; to-day the reverse is almost taking place. The patients are paying and the nurses are going there on a voluntary basis to help keep the hospital going. That is what is happening. We have a voluntary band of nurses and it is just as well we have them. We must admire those ladies who go there to assist. That is what is happening. There is a hospital at Auckland Park which has been completed and is now standing functionless. It is not a teaching hospital; it is not a healing hospital. We have the walls and we have the floor space and no staff. Those are the sort of things which show that liaison has been breaking down. The machinery is not being used and it is time that the Minister took some sort of action. If he does not want to do it, I would say to him: Let him appoint a central co-ordinating board which will see that this machinery does work properly. It will not take the work out of the hands of the provinces but it will oil that machinery and it will get it going properly.</p>

<from><span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0359"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to tell the truth I felt quite satisfied with the hon. member for Rosettenville at the outset. It is true that he did discuss the large amount of work which had already been done by the commissions in attempting to effect better co-ordination on the three levels of health services. He concluded with the words, &#x201C;we are in a worse position than before&#x201D;. Perhaps he is entitled to that opinion. He also raised problems in regard to which I am in agreement with him. Naturally they are problems which do exist to-day. They are also problems for which no one is really to blame, but I would like to bring him back to something which we know to be a State administrative matter. I do not think it was necessary, even though it was only for five minutes, to introduce a degree of bitterness in his speech when discussing a matter of administration and while the entire motive behind this motion was for everyone just to make a contribution. That is why I should like, just for a moment, to remind him of what we are really dealing with. In the book <i>Public Administration</i> Dimock and Koenig state that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Along with administrative policies and procedures, the framework of organization also must be constantly adjusted to new requirements and emphasize as goals, those of the Government as a whole, of particular segments of the economy, of particular agencies, of individual programmes.</block>

<p>That is co-ordination and that is what we are discussing. Co-ordination is one of the fundamental principles of good organization. It is not a static process. It is a universal and a dynamic principle. It has no bearing on politics, that kind of politics which the hon. member introduced towards the end of his speech. Health care knows no political dividing line. As one colleague to another I want to tell that hon. member that it is not divisible along those lines. Neither do I think that that was the view held by the successive health departments which we have had in this country over the years. That is how this motion must be viewed. In order to throw light on certain problems which have arisen in our health services and which are being experienced, the view taken must be a consistent one when these ideas are raised in order to make a contribution. That is so because the matter of health in a country like South Africa is a Herculean task in the first place because of its heterogeneous population where the nature of our services in respect of Bantu, Coloureds, Indians and Whites differ so tremendously. Since our State structure functions on three levels, which is not my fault or his, and since we have to deal with tradition and with experience of participation in and the handling of a service on various levels, there are certain existing rights and existing organizations which we must always bear in mind. Now someone may perhaps ask why we are discussing the problem. We have heard the historic background. We have heard about the former Colonial Government and how their powers were delegated, but we know that initially, after the coming into existence of the Union, there was a lack of clarity in regard to what public health actually meant. It led to confusion in the views on what public health was, and even to a confusion in regard to what the functions on the three different levels, namely that of the Central Government, the Provincial Administrations and the local authorities should be. In those days there was no strongly organized medical profession, as is the case to-day, which could help with the drafting of the Act of 1919. This Act nevertheless clarified the functions and position of the central health authority considerably. In that Act of 1919 the principle of decentralization was acknowledged. It forms the basis of our organization to-day. Co-ordination is just one of the number of principles of good organization. But that is where the root problem began. This root problem&#x2014;I do not want to repeat the entire story again&#x2014;has become aggravated after 45 years. That is why, after 45 years, we read in the Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the High Costs of Medicine and Medical Services (R.P. 59/1962), on page 29&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The opinion was repeatedly expressed in local evidence that the existing complicated pattern of medical services in the Republic contributes to the high costs of these services. Serious doubts were also raised about the efficacy and serviceability of this system seen from the viewpoint of both the community and the individual. The need for a centrally co-ordinated health service with local executive functions, which was indicated professionally as well as economically, was disregarded in the division of authority in terms of the constitution.</block>

<p>The problems we are experiencing to-day are not therefore the legacy of the Department of Health. It penetrates to all levels. We have today our Central Government Which, through the Department of Health, is responsible for the main service. Our purpose to-day is to offer constructive criticism, to make some contribution. I just want to mention that we have nine other Departments which offer health services. in collaboration with the Department of Health. We have six kinds of hospitals, provincial, local and central hospitals amonest others. We have out-patient services and District Surgeonaes. We have problems of coordination in regard to instruments and drugs and all those aspects of medical services. The division is carried through, just as in the case of the hospitals of which there are six categories through all the levels and to the patients as well. Each control group has its own planning. Its own planning and administration is usually different from that of others. That leads to problems at points of <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0360"/>contact. Where one has co-ordination in the various units which have to work together as a whole for the best results, one finds friction at the points of contact if people still have different policies. We are seeking uniformity. It leads to duplication, the duplication of services, in respect of which I shall still have something to say. It also leads to the injudicious utilization of manpower. People may be used at various levels at various places, and one man may have done one type of work, but he may not have done another type, etc. It leads to a lack of standards in training and in those kind of standards which the hon. member mentioned and in regard to which I agree with him. That is why opinions have been voiced to this Commission by people, people who have had experience as employees, we could almost say, or as suppliers of medical services. They have given certain evidence on their own view of this particularly grave problem of divided control and lack of co-ordination. On page 196 of the Snyman Commission (R.P. 59/1962), the Nursing Association states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But purely from a nursing point of view, one person can do more work in a particular home than a number of persons controlled by different departments. There is tuberculosis for example, which is the responsibility of municipal staff and of health visitors. There is also school nursing, which comes under health services. Apart from that there is nursing under the Provincial Administration. It could happen that four persons visit one home in order to care for a single patient in the family concerned.</block>

<p>The Cape Hospitals Department gave the following evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But if all these services could be joined or be placed under a single executive, it should be possible to eliminate the large-scale, unnecessary overlapping.</block>

<p>They conclude with these words which I find very revealing because in my two decades of medical practice I have often been saddled with this problem. They stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; just do not know at a certain stage who exactly is responsible for the patient.</block>

<p>Sir, I just want to illustrate this for the House. If a district surgeon is called out to-day to a patient lying sick in the veld and the patient is in Provincial Council territory, then the patient will be loaded into a motor car and transported to the nearest provincial hospital. While he is being transported he is the patient of the State Department of Health. The moment he is taken out of the motor car, he is not only the responsibility of another surgeon, he is also then the patient of the Provincial Administration. If he has a contagious disease and they have to isolate him but there is no contagious disease hospital available, the Divisional Council must pay for those services. Then he is really a patient of the Divisional Council. The real difficulty occurs if he should die. It is not as easy here as it would perhaps be in Venice, where they have a large river. We have to give our people a decent burial. If the patient dies and the corpse was found in a Divisional Council area, and he was indigent, they must bury him. It is their duty. But suppose they could not establish the cause of death. If that should happen he would then become, temporarily, the patient of the Department of Justice.</p>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You mean the corpse</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>No, a corpse still remains a patient in a certain sense. But let us not be flippant. Let us now bring this matter to its logical conclusion. For a time the patient is the responsibility of the Department of Justice while an autopsy is being held. Then the Divisional Council must take over and bury him. But if he is found in a district where there is no local authority, the magistrate is the agent responsible for his burial and he may claim the money from the Provincial Administration. It was actually their patient all along. This all goes to show how one can in reality be sent from pillar to post. We as individuals and even a person when he is no longer there, in respect of the handling of the remains, are entitled to our self-respect. [Interjections.] My hon. friends must not address me directly now. I am busy addressing them.</p>

<p>Good co-ordination with the minimum of friction will eliminate many of these problems. But just consider how many points of contact there are. There is also the very irksome system of subsidies from one board or one body in regard to another. There is the irksome control measures and the differences which arise between officials. I shall mention another example or two. There are the duplicated services. It has happened that divisional councils and the municipalities of medium sized towns have both of them kept an ambulance in operation as a result of the obligation imposed upon them by provincial ordinances to do so. They then compete to see who reaches the patient first. Now I ask you, is that necessary? It is an unhealthy form of duplication. I feel that ambulance services are an integral part of the provincial departments&#x2019; duties in regard to general hospital services. Let me put it clearly. That is my considered opinion. In order to illustrate this matter a little further, I should like to say that as far as immunization, i.e. the inoculation against diseases is concerned, I want in the first place to express my thanks and appreciation for the particularly excellent service, a unique service in fact, which the Department of Health rendered in causing the number of cases of poliomyelitis which amounted to 2,240 in 1957 in this country, to be reduced to 101 in 1962. <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0361"/>This was excellent service, but even here it was found that after 1962 there was no absolute certainty as to whether it had been the district surgeon who was to have inoculated all the people, or whether it was the officials of the local authorities. We find therefore that in 1963 these numbers had again risen to more than 300 and on investigation it was found that many of these people had not received the oral inoculation.</p>

<p>These few practical points from my own experience demonstrate adequately I think the problems which are being experienced by those who have to render these services. I may as well omit to mention a large number of other examples which I know about, but the faulty co-ordination is emphasized throughout in the evidence of persons appearing before commissions, and some of them even submitted specific representations in regard to how this problem could be solved. That is why we also received, in the evidence of the Orange Free State Hospitals Department this request for a centrally co-ordinated department or body, and from Natal, believe it or not. Sir, we received the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would rather see each province manage all those services with co-ordination.</block>

<p>Yes they are not referring to the Central Government, but to the Provinces. So it went on. The State is beginning to accept to an ever-increasing extent that the individual must be dealt with as an entity and not just restored to health and then abandoned. Co-ordination pre-supposes a balance between division and unity. Specialization in our modern technological world must be encouraged. One constantly feels that one must integrate into that global unit in order to render one&#x2019;s service. Medical development to-day has led to many of our concepts on treatment being thrown overboard. I mention in the first instance just the question of communicable diseases If one takes a communicable disease such as leprosy, for example, one finds that the patient was isolated completely in the past, pushed to one side, and no one came near him. To-day medical science has developed to such an extent that one can take the leprosy patient and treat him and cure him completely in a hospital inside a city. Surely we all remember Robben Island, where the leprosy patients were kept, and that people were very afraid to go there. In that respect we have made a very good change by using Robben Island to-day for people who suffer from ideological ills. It was a very good change. The present methods of combating contagious diseases are also a matter in regard to which medical science has developed a great deal. To-day it is not necessary to have ambulance services for contagious diseases, and I think the time is rapidly approaching when we will no longer have isolation hospitals. We will be able soon to nurse all kinds of cases in general hospitals.</p>

<p>The three levels of government are there and we cannot remove them now. We know that friction and problems will decrease if those levels were not present, but they are present and I just want to express my appreciation for the Health Commission and for the co-ordinated health services and hospital board which the hon. member requested, and which his Government established as far back as 1944 and which did nothing. It was nevertheless a fine attempt. I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the many other attempts which he has made, as well as that Conference on Health Instruction which was held in 1962 and where discussions with all the persons and bodies took place so that there could be better co-operation. There is much to say thank you for, including the co-operation within the Department with other legal bodies such as the S.A. Bureau of Standards, the Joint Matriculation Board, the Nursing Council and the C.S.I.R. My final vote of thanks is for the fact that an Act has been introduced to control the sale of drugs. This Drugs Control Act is also an attempt to obtain better co-ordination, because there was an entirely chaotic state of affairs, in the way in which even general practitioners were exploited by sending them certain types of drugs. I foresee that the sound attempts which have been made to obtain better co-ordination will soon be given new impetus and make new progress because we are also awaiting the findings of other commissions such as the Borckenhagen Commission. which will specify and make recommendations on the financial relations, and this must necessary lead to a better and a juster division of functions. I am inclined to agree with one of the bodies which gave evidence before the Snyman Commission. That Department was absolutely convinced that if there was one authority controlling all the health services in the country, it would be a very good thing. That is an opinion which, to my way of thinking, deserves serious attention.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The House, as the hon. member for Rosettenville said, is indebted to the hon. member for Germiston for having introduced this motion this afternoon. I do hope that although the two hon. members on the Government side who have spoken have carefully avoided the question, we will have a clear indication from the hon. the Minister that this motion is not a forerunner to a move to centralize the control of health services in the hands of the Central Government and to deprive the provinces of their responsibilities in the handling of health services. I trust that the hon. the Minister will be kind enough to give us an answer when he participates in this debate this afternoon.</p>

<p>Sir. I enter this debate not as a medical practitioner, nor do I suggest that there is a ready answer to the problems which face any attempt at co-ordination. But what concerns me is whether or not machinery at present exists whereby many of the difficulties which do exist and the problems to which reference <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0362"/>has been made this afternoon, could well be resolved. There have been several attempts, as has been mentioned, to assess the position regarding health services and the control of health services. The latest of those, of course, was the Schumann Commission, which was appointed on 8th April, 1960. It was the first commission which had elastic terms of reference. May I remind you, Sir, of the terms of reference of that commission. It was directed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To inquire into and report upon the financial relations between the Central Government and the provinces, with particular reference to the efficacy of the present division of functions between the Central Government and the provinces, with due regard to the extent to which the exercise of their functions by the provinces, particularly in the fields of health, education, and roads, overlapped with the powers and functions of the said Central Government and (2) the desirability or otherwise of a re-allocation of those functions.</block>

<p>That specific instruction was given to that particular commission, and so far as I am aware the commission has reported, and had that report been released for the information of hon. members, we would not be debating this matter <i>in vacuo</i> but we would have concrete proposals and we would have information about the evidence and the opinions of those who are directly concerned with the administration of health services. When I asked the hon. the Minister last year whether he could make this available, he indicated to me, quite correctly, that this was a commission appointed by the hon. the Minister of Finance and that the matter was in the hands of that hon. Minister. It seems at the moment that no success has been achieved in prevailing upon the hon. the Minister of Finance to make this very important report available to members of this House. Sir, nearly seven years have elapsed since the commission was appointed. The report of the Gluckman Commission was in the hands of the Government and was published within 18 months of the appointment of the commission, and it was a very comprehensive report. It seems to me that there is no reason why, in a matter of this urgency, we should have to await further the report of the Schumann Commission. Sir, the hon. member for Germiston offered the fact that this report had not been published as a possible reason why the hon. the Minister may not be able to reply to this discussion at length this afternoon. I do hope that that will not be the case. Sir, we have heard here this afternoon the history of the divided responsibilities and how they have grown in the medical services. Here again there are many interesting reasons for this division which now exists. But the fact that there is a division of responsibility does not in itself mean that co-ordination is impossible. Surely there are four facets of health and it is quite impossible for the control and the direction of all four facets to be vested in the hands of one person or one department. Sir, if one takes the question of health and the promotion of health one is immediately involved with nutrition, with education, with mental health&#x2014;all matters which arise long before illness occurs in the accepted form, but they are part of the health services of the country. One comes to the second aspect and that is the prevention of ill-health. In that particular field one has the periodic school inspections by medical inspectors and dentists attending to the general health of school-going children. There is maternal and child health guidance; there is the T.B. screening which should be done and is being done throughout the country; there are the processes of vaccination and inoculation, which one realizes are essential. It is co-ordination that is required and not necessarily in all cases a change in the controlling authority. Then when one comes, thirdly, to the cure and alleviation of disease and injury, one has the hospitalization, clinics, dispensaries, after-care facilities. Here again a wide field must be covered and it is the question of co-ordination which is paramount and not the direct control. Finally one comes to the fourth aspect and that is the rehabilitation, the occupational therapy, vocational therapy, invalidity and disablement-grants and the vexed problem of the re-employment of those who physically are not completely active. Sir, I think it is without doubt a fact which cannot be disputed that in this country we have medical and technical knowledge of the highest order. I think as South Africans we are all proud of the achievements of South Africans in the fields of medicine and surgery. We have enthusiasm and we have the human material. We have human material of the highest quality to provide health services. One has cause for criticism when one finds that there is a break-down in those services when those facilities are available. I believe that the machinery does exist. I believe that under Act No. 51 of 1946, in terms of which we have the National Health Council and the Central Health Services and Hospitals Co-ordinating Council, the machinery does exist. The question is whether that machinery is being effectively used. I have had little experience on the Co-ordinating Council and I have the utmost faith that that machinery is capable of dealing with these problems, but there is a breakdown beyond the actual meetings of the Co-ordinating Council. First of all, reference was made here this afternoon by one of the hon. members to the costs of building. The hon. the Minister will know that the council several years ago referred the question of building and building costs and types of buildings to the C.S.I.R. for research and report. The provinces have asked for it, and there is no reason to blame the provinces if they are not building to correct specifications when those specifications have not been made available to the provinces.</p>

<p><span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0363"/>Let us consider the question of staff raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. He raised the aspect of competition for the services of trained personnel, be they nursing or medical personnel. The machinery is there to prevent that under this Co-ordinating Council if it functions properly because there is an agreement that the salaries or the wages or remuneration to be offered will be agreed between the provinces and the departments of Health and provided the contracting parties, the members of that Council, abide by the decisions which are arrived at, there should be no difficulty; there is no competition. But when one comes to the basic provision of the staff&#x2014;for instance the provision of an adequate number of doctors&#x2014;we suddenly find that in the Government itself there are four Government Departments which are concerned with the question of the co-ordination of the training of medical personnel for the provision of health services. Sir, when I referred to this matter last year and suggested to the hon. the Minister that I thought that co-ordination was necessary, as suggested here to-day by the hon. member for Germiston, the hon. Minister was annoyed with me. May I refer him to Hansard. The Minister spoke on 20th September, 1966, and said (Hansard Col. 2512)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place I have to point out to him&#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;the Minister was referring to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the Schumann Commission was not appointed by the Department of Health but by the Department of Finance, and that the Department of Health therefore has nothing to do with the report or with submitting the report. His uncalled-for attack was therefore merely an offensive attack on the Government. In the second place his attack was based on the shortage of medical doctors, as though it is the task of the Department of Health to train doctors. But that is the task of the Department of Education, Arts and Science.</block>

<p>I then interjected&#x2014;&#x201C;Do you not co-ordinate the health services?&#x201D; The Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That has nothing to do with the matter. The hon. member knows that a government functions through various departments, and that each Minister has his own responsibility.</block>

<p>The Minister of Health was prepared to say to me last year, when he replied to me, that it was quite in order to have the Minister of Education responsible for the training of White doctors, the Minister of Coloured Affairs responsible for the training of Coloured doctors, the Minister of Bantu Affairs to look after Bantu doctors, and the Minister of Indian Affairs to train the Indian doctors.</p>

<p>Surely, Sir, that is not co-ordination. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will forgive me for raising this matter again, but I cannot understand how, with the necessity for complying with the policy of the Government there can be such an absence of correlation and co-ordination as regards that aspect of medical services. The Minister of Bantu Education has very excellent plans to provide health services to replace to a great extent the health services which are now in the hands of the Cape Province and missions in the Transkei. But the Minister cannot execute those plans until there is a co-ordinated plan to provide the medical personnel necessary to run those hospitals and to staff them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned the shortage of nurses. That again is a problem which can be overcome by co-ordinated action, and I believe that to a great extent this problem has been overcome in the Cape Province by the adequate opportunities which are given to the Coloured community to enter the nursing profession. I believe that to-day there are very few, if any, vacant nursing posts in the Cape Province. These Coloured nurses are readily making use of their opportunities. At the recent graduation at the Somerset Hospital, for instance, there was a pass list of 114 nurses, of which 61 were general nurses and 53 midwives. Out of 76 honour passes amongst all races in the whole of the Republic five honour passes were attained by Coloured nurses of the Somerset Hospital.</p>

<p>Let me turn to another matter now We have to-day received the report of the Department of Social Welfare. What do we find? We find that the Social Welfare Department is subsidizing the South African National Council for Alcoholism to the extent of some R12,500 per year. It also maintains institutions or retreats which are subsidized. According to the report it also spends on and is active in the field of education and information services. But at the same time the province is busy with psychiatric treatment of and hospitalization for alcoholics on an entirely different approach, namely not that of providing retreats but of providing curative treatment. These matters can be co-ordinated, and I want to say that I believe that the machinery does exist.</p>

<p>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister. I know that the demands which will be made because of the necessity of more direct and personal contact with the Council will be heavy. But I believe that if a concerted effort is made, and if there is determination to make the machinery work which does at present exist, such as the National Health Council and the Co-ordinating Council, we will be able to iron out very many of the problems which have been referred to this afternoon. I am sure they can be ironed out. I am sure the ability is there to iron them out.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to two other matters. Firstly, there is the frustration and <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0364"/>delay caused as regards the building of provincial hospitals. The position at the moment clearly illustrates not the existence of co-ordination but in fact a complete breakdown of co-ordination. Before one brick can be placed upon another to change the accommodation at a hospital other than a single race hospital, the plans must first of all be passed by the provincial administration who drew them up. they must then go through to the Coloured Affairs Department for approval, then to the Bantu Affairs Department for approval, and then they go to the Community Development Department for approval before the province can start with the building operations. I hope that machinery will be established to obviate the long delays involved in passing the plans from one department to another. Certain rules and regulations should be observed in the planning of buildings.</p>

<p>The last aspect which, I believe, requires urgent attention is the co-ordination of clinic services and the demand for out-patient services at hospitals. We have clinics where district surgeons have certain responsibilities and district nursing is provided. But there seems to be a growing tendency, particularly amongst our poorer classes, for people to swarm into our hospitals for treatment and attention. I have here figures for certain local hospitals. At the Groote Schuur Hospital there are some 45,000 out-patient attendances per month. People who come to the hospital by means of public transport are attended to and then they return to their homes all over the Peninsula. At the smaller hospitals such as the Red Cross Children&#x2019;s Hospital and the Somerset Hospital they have 700 to 800 out-patient cases every day. It is thus clear that the demands made on the staff at those hospitals are enormous. It would therefore seem that some measure of co-ordination between clinics, district nursing services and the hospital organization itself is necessary to ensure that more home attention is available for these people so that they do not come crowding and streaming into our hospitals. I believe this pattern is common throughout the country and it leads to enormous difficulties, for instance the provision of sanitary arrangements and so forth, at the places where they are treated.</p>

<p>For these reasons, Sir, we welcome the opportunity which has been given for us to discuss this matter this afternoon, and I am sure the hon. the Minister will find in the machinery, which he now has, the facilities to co-ordinate these services so that they might be satisfactory in all fields of operation.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am aware that this House is in a hurry to adjourn and therefore I have only a short time at my disposal in which to deal with this difficult but nevertheless interesting problem. This is not only a difficult and interesting problem but unfortunately also a very delicate problem.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to thank all hon. members who participated in this debate for the fine spirit in which they viewed and expounded this entire problem and everything related thereto, and in particular the hon. member who moved the motion and the hon. member for Gordonia for their really excellent expositions.</p>

<p>I think the discussions we have had here have illustrated one thing and that is that there has been grave concern for many years, not only in this House but throughout the country, about the consequences of this divided control amongst the various bodies, particularly amongst the provincial administrations, the Central Government and the local authorities. This concern goes back a long way. For many years now this problem has been giving various governments food for thought. Even in 1944 when the Smuts Government was in power there were proposals by the Gluckman Commission, which made an inquiry into this divided control and its evils.</p>

<p>They tried to find solutions to the problem. Subsequently there was the Havenga Committee and in recent years&#x2014;in 1956&#x2014;we had the Borckenhagen Commission, which has not yet concluded its business. All these things illustrate the fact that we in South Africa feel unhappy about this divided control. We are a small nation with a small White population and with limited means at our disposal and we are concerned about the fact that our services for this small nation have been fragmented to an extent hardly ever encountered in other countries in the world. We all have to admit that up to the present time we have had very few results, that very few results have flowed from a great deal of consideration and from all the attempts at co-ordination. We have to take cognizance of the real reason therefor. What is the reason why we cannot succeed? The hon. member who has just sat down stated the real reason admirably. It is the human reason. The reason is to be found in the fact that when a person serves on a body or has certain influence or power, it is extremely difficult to get him to surrender any of that power or authority. Everyone clings to the power he has. Even if it is not in the eventual interests of the common good or the country as a whole to do so, one is inclined, as a human being, to cling to that power. That I think is the basic problem. For that reason this is a delicate problem because one would so much like to accommodate all bodies which have something to do with these services; this is what makes this problem so delicate. Nevertheless, I think there is one conviction we all share and that is that this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue much longer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately public health services were regarded as minor services at the time of Union. No consideration was given to them. In our Union Constitution, the Constitution of our first South African State, health services were not even mentioned. These services were virtually regarded as being charity. The slaughter <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0365"/>amongst the population which was caused by the 1918 epidemic of Spanish flu made us realize for the first time that it was essential to introduce health services in South Africa. In the haste to introduce these services use was made of existing machinery, namely of the city councils and the provincial councils, and whatever remained was handled by the State. This is the unfortunate beginning, namely that health services were divided amongst various authorities as a matter of urgency. That divided authority has continued to exist up to the present time. To-day we have the position that this authority is divided chiefly amongst three bodies, but as the hon. member said, it is in fact divided amongst even more than three bodies. We still find the strange position that the local authorities are responsible for contagious diseases but that the Central Government is also responsible for contageous diseases to a large extent. In that one finds an inconsistency. One finds a similar inconsistency in the fact that the provincial administrations are responsible for certain general hospitals whereas the Central Government is also responsible for hospitals. These hospitals also have sections for general medicine. Each one of the large, special hospitals controlled by the Central Government, for tuberculosis or for the mentally ill, etc., also has a small section which virtually is a small general hospital. In this way we find duplication. Now. we must admit that when a service has been fragmented, it is a problem and an enormous task to fit those fragments together, as one would a jig-saw puzzle, to form a whole which is correct in all respects. There is one requirement for all co-ordination and that is authority. The hon. member who sat down a short while ago pointed out to us the co-ordination of health services in hospitals and mentioned the Co-ordinating Council. This Council has been in existence for years but at present it virtually has one task only, and that is to try and co-ordinate salaries. Even in this respect though, it is defective because it is dependent on voluntary co-operation. There is no authority. The Central Government does not have the authority to tell the provinces that they have to accept this, that or the other. One has to get them to agree with one and if one cannot get them to agree then one has four provinces against one Central Government which means that the provinces always determine what is to happen. That, unfortunately, is the position. If there is one factor in connection with co-ordination of which we may not lose sight, it is the factor of authority. Authority must be vested somewhere and it must be possible for such authority to enforce co-ordination. If there is any overlapping it must be possible for that authority to eliminate it, because it is essential to do so. If we are to have a good service, there must be no overlapping. It is essential that the one should not compete with the other. It is essential that the one should not derogate from the other.</p>

<p>It is essential that the one should not take away the staff of the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we cannot deny that what I have just said are things which do happen constantly and to an annoying extent. Overlapping is annoying; it is extravagant. Constant conflicts do occur. Co-operation cannot be achieved. Numerous charges have been levelled against us. I do not want to go into specific cases; it is neither pleasant nor right to do so. Nevertheless, I want to point out that often, when attempts have been made for the Central Government to co-operate with other bodies, it has simply been impossible to effect that. In other words, health services have to suffer and they suffer as a result of a fragmentation which can only be eliminated if the basic principle, namely that of a central authority, is put into practice.</p>

<p>As I said at the beginning of my speech, Mr. Speaker, I am aware that there are bodies and persons who are always afraid that they will be pushed aside and that they will have to disappear. I am nevertheless convinced about one thing and that is that when the essential goodwill has been created, when there is a willingness to co-operate and to integrate and when there is a central authority, it will not be necessary for any of those bodies to surrender any of its authority. Then it will be possible for all of them to co-operate but what will be absolutely, inexorably essential is the central authority.</p>

<p>After receiving the report of the Schumann Commission the Government is engaged, as this House knows, in carefully considering the entire matter. It will not only be necessary to consider the matter, it will also be necessary to negotiate in a spirit of goodwill with the relative bodies and persons who render parts of the health services. Therefore, because of the very fact that this matter is under consideration by the Government at the moment, I know that this House will not expect me to say a great deal more to-day apart from saying that I am convinced that we shall not be able to get any co-operation unless we have one central authority which can enforce such co-ordination.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take up the time of this House any longer. I just want to assure this House of my appreciation for the views which have been expressed here. I am sure that what has been said here, will assist in bringing about a more rapid solution of the problems.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In this Bill the House is being requested to approve the appropriation of an amount of R535 million for the administration of the country for a period from 1st April of this year until the Appropriation Act is promulgated, which is expected to happen early in July.</p>

<p>The Bill makes provision for R400 million on Revenue Services, R9 million for Bantu Education and R126 million on Loan Services. These amounts can only be utilized for those services for which funds have already been voted during the current financial year or for those services for which statutory authorization already exists. However, hon. members are requested not to try and calculate at this early stage what Government expenditure for the new financial year will be since Government expenditure does not follow any fixed pattern, and margin should be allowed for a possible delay in the publication of the Appropriation Act. In view of my Budget speech on 22nd March hon. members will not expect me to give a full summary of the economic conditions in the Republic at this juncture. There are. however, a few aspects of the economy to which I want to refer.</p>

<p>In his Budget speech last year my predecessor said that apart from the renewal of existing loans he expected to draw approximately R15 million by way of new overseas Government loans in the current financial year. Conditions in overseas markets during the past year, however, were exceptionally unfavourable, and credit&#x2014;both short- and long-term&#x2014; is both scarce and expensive. From the point of view of our own anti-inflationistic policy it is advisable under the present circumstances to finance our capital programme out of domestic loans&#x2014;that is out of our own savings &#x2014;rather than to do so by means of overseas credits, and we have succeeded in obtaining more than enough domestic loans for that purpose. Consequently we have decided to assimilate only a limited amount of foreign capital and to do so as far as possible in the form of stand-by credit on which we do not have to draw until we need it.</p>

<p>In terms of this policy two credits of approximately R7 million each from German and Italian banks have been paid back and have not been renewed. A credit of &#x0024;10 million (approximately R7 million) from an American bank was paid back in July 1966 (on the due date) but was replaced in October by a new credit of a similar amount for a period of 11 months at a rate of interest of &#x00BD; per cent above the highest rate which the bank pays to foreign central banks for 90-day fixed deposits, with a minimum of 6&#x00BD; per cent, and a commitment fee of Â¼ per cent on undrawn amounts. We have not yet drawn on this credit. The recurrent credit of &#x0024;40 million (approximately R28.6 million) which we have had for many years with a group of American banks was replaced last month by a new credit of the same amount for a period of slightly less than a year at a rate of interest of 6&#x00BD; per cent per annum plus a commitment fee of Â¼ per cent. Recently we have made relatively little use of this credit and at the moment there is nothing outstanding, in other words, we are merely paying the Â¼ per cent to ensure that the money is available if we should need it.</p>

<p>In November 1965 a French bank made a loan of R50 million French francs (approximately R7.2 million) to the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank transferred this loan to the State; 20 million French francs was repayable in November 1966 and the remainder in November 1967. However, the French bank agreed to postpone the first instalment of R20 million French francs for a year, i.e. until November 1967, at a rate of interest of 7 per cent. The original rate of this credit was 6 per cent, which is an indication of how rates of interest overseas have increased during the past year.</p>

<p>In 1966, apart from Government credits, the Republic received large amounts of private capital from overseas. During the first three quarters the inflow was R119 million, of which R61 million was long-term and R58 million short-term. Figures for the fourth quarter are not yet available but according to provisional indications there was a further small inflow. It has been alleged in the House that our statistics in respect of the capital inflow were poor, but in reality there are probably few countries, comparable with the Republic, whose statistics in this respect are better than ours. Few countries, too, have these statistics available sooner than is the case in the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0367"/>It also seems to me that there is quite a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to the nature of this capital inflow. It can assume many forms, some of which are never reported to the authorities and only show as a balancing item in the statistics. Suppose, for example, an overseas parent company were to send machinery or supplies to its subsidiary in South Africa, but subsequently informs it that it does not have to pay. An inflow of capital has taken place, but naturally such an influx does not necessarily come to the attention of the authorities. Ultimately the figures will indicate that the value of our imports has increased by RX, while our&#x2019; reserves have not decreased by that amount, and the RX is then indicated as a capital inflow in the statistics. Although the considerable capital inflow of the past year made our struggle against inflation more difficult, it was not so easy, therefore, to do anything about it. The situation is quite different from that in certain overseas countries such as West Germany and Switzerland, for example, where large amounts are deposited by foreigners in the West German or Swiss banks or other financial institutions&#x2014;mainly for reasons of speculation, i.e. out of fear of the devaluation of their own money, or merely to take advantage of the higher rates of interest. The West German and Swiss authorities have, quite rightly, taken steps to discourage this kind of capital inflow. But in South Africa the capital inflow has not taken this form, or has done so only to a small degree, and the measures taken in West Germany and in Switzerland would be quite uncalled for here.</p>

<p>The classification into long- and short-term capital in our statistics is at times, for unavoidable reasons, somewhat misleading. All capital inflow not identifiable as fixed for more than a period of a year is classified as being short-term. We know from experience, however, that a great deal of unidentified capital, and even a great deal of the unidentified capital which in the first instance enters the country as short-term capital, really remains here for much longer than a year. An overseas company may perhaps lend money to its subsidiary in the Republic on demand, or for an unspecified time, and that capital can remain in the Republic for years, but according to international usage the capital inflow is regarded as being short-term.</p>

<p>The inflow of private capital has, as I have already said, aggravated our inflation problems, but for reasons which ought now to be clear I am reluctant to take direct steps to stem that flow. South Africa can still put that foreign capital to good use, and it would be inadvisable to discourage it. It would be quite a different matter if we were to receive large amounts of flight capital which were simply being deposited here without contributing anything to our development. This did happen in 1947, but I cannot recall the Opposition taking any effective steps at that time against this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The best way of countering the undesirable consequences of our capital inflow is the measures which my predecessor and I announced on 7th December, particularly the relaxation of import control and the measures to absorb excess liquidity. It is still too early to say to what extent these measures have succeeded &#x2014;in fact, in no country in the world are statistics so quickly available that they can demonstrate the full effects of such measures only two months after those measures were taken. It is significant, however, that a complete change in the short-term money market recently took place. Until recently the money market institutions had a surfeit of money, but the position has changed entirely and they are now having to borrow considerable amounts from the Reserve Bank; in fact, the Government is having to assist them by investing surplus Treasury funds with the institutions in order to enable them to pay off their debt to the Reserve Bank in part. At the same time the tender rate for Treasury bills rose from 4.34 per cent on 2nd December, 1966, to 4.86 per cent last Friday, and this increase ought to be of assistance in counteracting the grey market. The narrowing of the money market is a good sign for our anti-inflationary policy. Apparently it is attributable in the first place to the higher level of our imports and consequent drop in our foreign reserves, and in the second to the policy of the Government in withdrawing and sterilizing the excess funds of the private sector. The latter policy is reflected in the large balances which the Government have built up with the Reserve Bank&#x2014;R196 million on 31st January.</p>

<p>In respect of savings, too, the indications are favourable. The new savings obligations have been favourably received and an amount of almost R12 million has already been invested in them. The Post Office Savings Bank has also fared considerably better since the rate of interest on savings deposits and savings bank certificates was increased. In other countries the small saver invests considerably more in the State than in South Africa, and I think we should see to it that the State receives its fair share in this respect as well. I want to repeat, however, that it is still too early to be able to deduce to what extent our measures have succeeded, and definitely too soon to consider any relaxation. We are watching the position and if it is necessary the Government will not hesitate to take further steps. I move.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Finance has indicated that it is as yet early to judge the effect of the anti-inflationary measures which were introduced in December. I can appreciate that. What he has said will be carefully studied by those who devote themselves more particularly to finance on this side of the House. Of course, it is as yet early to give any opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise or the effectiveness of the steps which have been taken. On that account, I know the Minister will forgive me if I do not follow him immediately in a financial <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0368"/>discussion. It is because it is my belief that it is not only the financial policies of this Government which have led to inflation, but also its obsession with ideologies often to the detriment of the economy that I propose moving an amendment to this Part Appropriation Bill. In doing so I want to indicate that it is probable that the Opposition will move a second amendment later in the debate to cover another subject which we are anxious to discuss. I wish to move the following amendment this afternoon:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill unless and until the Government gives assurances that <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) it will base a policy for the decentralization of industry on sound economic and strategic reasons and not only on ideological considerations that often fly in the face of the true economic and strategic interests of South Africa without even achieving the ends they are intended to serve; and</li>

<li>(b) it will not abuse influx control laws and regulations to exclude workseekers from employment opportunities in existing industrial and farming areas when they are not assured of work elsewhere and when their exclusion will retard the healthy and desirable development of those areas&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to say that for years now the whole economic position has been influenced by the Government&#x2019;s obsession with the idea that it could reverse the flow of Bantu labour into White areas and turn it back again into the Bantu areas. One of the ways in which it sought to do this was to establish industries in the so-called border areas regardless of whether this was the most economic form of development or whether it was in the interests of the national economy or not. When we face the Government with labour statistics and population statistics contradicting the suggestion that the flow of labour could be reversed, Government spokesmen have for years fallen back on the forecast that whatever was happening now, by the year 1978 the turning point would be reached. From that time on they would start reducing the number of Bantu employed in the White areas. Government spokesmen took this disturbing line. That was before the advent of the new Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. When he came on the scene with all the enthusiasm of a convert, he decided to go one better. In June last year he told a meeting in the Von Brandis constituency that he would stake his political reputation on the prophecy that there would be fewer Africans in the cities by 1978. That of course means that if the turning point does not arrive in 1978, it has to come very much earlier. What is much more serious is that the hon. the Minister started to act as though he really believed this was possible. After a few months experience, I am happy to say that he changed his tune quite a bit. In an interview with <i>Die Burger</i> he seems to accept the late Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s prophecy that 1978 would see a turning point in the inflow of Bantu into the White areas. Sir, that is progress of course, but I am not sure if it is satisfactory progress. I am not sure that it is good enough because, despite repeated challenges to the late Prime Minister from this side of the House and despite repeated challenges to the former Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and his then Deputy, the present Minister, there has never been one iota of proof put before this House that there is any scientific justification for the claim that 1978 could or would see a turning point&#x2014;not one iota, Sir. In fact, all the evidence before us has been the other way.</p>

<p>You will recall, Sir, that when last we discussed this matter in this House, <i>Die Burger</i>, the Government-supporting newspaper in this city, had a report the following day that yesterday in the House an old friend was laid to rest&#x2014;the year 1978. There have been continued attempts to revive that old friend. I make no excuse for reopening this matter, because while the Government continues to pursue this myth with customary obstinacy and ineptitude, so long is it bound to continue to force up costs artificially and to hamper the economic development of the country to the entire detriment of the whole population, in other words to do what the Minister of Finance warned he was prepared to do, namely to bend the economy for ideological reasons.</p>

<p>When you look at this Government&#x2019;s scheme against the background of the economic development of South Africa and its history, it is an extremely ambitious scheme and it is an extremely dangerous promise to start making to the public of South Africa. If you look at our history over the past 50 or 60 years, our development has been very largely one of rapid economic and mining growth and consequently rapid urbanization throughout South Africa. Just look at the figures. In 1911 only 53 per cent of the Whites were in the urban areas. The figure at the last census was 82.6 per cent. Take the year 1911 again. Only 13 per cent of our Bantu were urbanized at that time. To-day 31.8 per cent are urbanized according to the census of 1960. That means that we have moved from a position where in 1911 there were 153,000 more Whites than non-Whites in our urban areas to a position where to-day there are 889,000 more non-Whites than Whites in our big urban areas.</p>

The problem is that this process is continuing because under this Government&#x2019;s policy there are going to be very few large urban areas developing in the reserves for a very long time to come. As a result our White cities are going to go on becoming blacker and blacker, possibly faster than ever.

<p>Tell us what you promised at Britstown.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>What I promised at Britstown was to keep a proper control and to keep the Bantu population in the White areas to a reasonable minimum. I did not promise that I would reduce them by 5 per cent a year as this hon. gentleman did. I did not promise to disrupt the economy of the Western Cape as this gentleman is setting out to do. But, Mr. Speaker, we will deal with this hon. gentleman when the time comes. Obviously if you cannot turn the flow back by 1978 then you cannot turn it back earlier. You realize, Sir, what it means to bring about a reversal of the flow of the Bantu from the reserves into the White areas. Do you realize what it is going to mean in respect of our labour force? The economic development programme expected that in the year 1964-&#x2019;65 32,800 more Whites and 106,800 more non-Whites would be in employment. When you allow for the Malays and the Coloureds it probably means that 75,000 more Bantu were expected to be in employment in that one year. Did you realize, Sir, that they underestimated by nearly 73,000 for that one year? Do you realize what a change there has been and how very much greater that inflow has been in the year 1964-&#x2019;65 despite all the efforts of hon. gentlemen opposite and the loud noises they have been making as to their achievements? Do you realize what that means, Mr. Speaker? It means that if you are to reverse the flow, we would have to start doing without two-thirds of our labour force. Where are we going to get it from because the moment that flow is reversed we cannot take one single extra Bantu in employment. We have to reduce and not bring any more in. That is what is meant by reversing the flow. Where are we going to get the 140,000 or 150,000 extra Bantu who were put into employment in the year 1964-&#x2019;65 alone? We can replace those that move back but we cannot take on extra Bantu and where do we look for the 75,000 who are required for new jobs if we cannot find Bantu to take their places? What is going to happen to our industries under those conditions? What is going to happen to the efforts of the hon. the Minister of Finance to keep South Africa on an even keel? Let us look at the picture again in respect of the forecast for the four years 1965 to 1969. Our labour requirements were estimated at 158,000 more Whites and 485,000 more non-Whites. It is quite clear already that that is an underestimate and a very serious one. These numbers are however required if we are to maintain our growth at the 5&#x00BD; per cent per annum which the Minister of Finance has set his heart upon and which is so vitally important to maintain the standard of living in South Africa. At least two-thirds of that labour force is going to be Bantu. But if we are to believe the hon. gentleman opposite then eight or nine years after that we are suddenly going to find that we do not need that number of additional workers. Where are we going to get them from and how are we going to maintain our rate of growth and development? The only reply that we have had from hon. gentlemen opposite is that we shall maintain our rate of growth by the use of mechanization and automation. I think we ought to be clear about what we mean by mechanization. I take mechanization to mean the position where a machine does the work which was previously done by human beings and that machine is minded by human beings.</p>

<p>Automation means that the machine takes over the minding work as well and takes the place of the human being who was minding that machine. Are we going to mechanize to the extent that we can do without two-thirds of our labour force? Are we going to reduce our requirements to that extent? You see, automation is a most expensive business and for us to have automation on an economic basis in South Africa, we require very much larger markets than we have at the present time. The only way we can get those markets is either by export or increasing our internal markets. The only way in which we can increase the internal market is by having more Bantu in gainful employment. I must say that I do not see this as anything of an answer at all. The experience overseas has been that while automation increased production, it did not necessarily reduce the labour force. In fact, the experience in most countries has been that despite automation, there are still the same if not greater numbers of workers in employment.</p>

<p>This may well be but they are still in employment and they still need jobs and they still have to be <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0370"/>fed. It does not seem to me that that offers a solution at all to this problem. Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that if hon. gentlemen opposite are right, then you have to find jobs somewhere else for 90,000 Bantu every year who are looking for new jobs? How is this going to be done? That is what their population growth is and it will mean 90,000 new jobs every year for Bantu. Where are we going to find those jobs for them? It is all very well to talk about mechanization and automation. What are you going to do with those whom you send back to the reserves? If you are to create new industries in the reserves for those people, then you require capital. Where is this capital coming from?</p>

<p>Look at what has happened in our economic development programme. We calculated that with a gross capital formation of R1,653 million in 1965, the total labour demand would be 140,000. If you are going to find new jobs for 90,000 Bantu in the reserves at the same time, it means that you have got to divert R 1,000 million to the reserves to create industries to provide these people with jobs. Where is that capital formation coming from for the reserves&#x2014;R 1,000 million a year, not only for one year but each year, and growing every year with greater demand. I say that this year 1978 and the promises made about it, repeated not so long ago by the hon. the Deputy Minister, have bedevilled our thinking for a long time and there has never been a scientific basis for that forecast given to this House, nor have we had proper indications of who are responsible for it. It has been a great mystery. I asked the late Prime Minister who did this work and who was responsible for it. I never got a clear answer. The last time we talked about it he mentioned amongst others the name of the late Professor Fourie. The late Professor Fourie was very well-known to me and I wrote to him on this subject.</p>

<p>I received from him a copy in his own handwriting prepared by himself of the projection that was made in 1954-&#x2019;55. Here it is, signed by him, drawn up in his own handwriting, a copy of the work that was done in 1955. He draws attention to the conditions which he endorsed upon it. Let us now look at that forecast on which the former Prime Minister apparently based some of his predictions. We find that already its forecast as to population growth is hopelessly out. It expected a growth in total Bantu population in the years 1951 -&#x2019;61 from 8,500,000 to 9,900,000. Do you realize, Sir, that by 1960 the Bantu population was already 10,900.000? So that that forecast was already a million out. Secondly the forecast expected an increase in the Bantu population outside the reserves in that same ten-year period, namely 1951 -&#x2019;61, of 420,000. Do you know what the figure turned out to be according to the last census? Over a period of nine years&#x2014;not ten years&#x2014; the figure was 2,380,000. In other words, the growth was approximately six times greater than what they forecast in this projection. Why has that happened? I will tell you why it has happened, Sir. It has happened because the three conditions which they laid down as the fundamental for their graph when they forecast the possible change in 1976 or 1978 have not been fulfilled by this Government.</p>

<p>Now, what were those three conditions? The first was that the development programmes proposed by the Commission would be put into operation in 1956. You know, Mr. Speaker, that those programmes were not accepted, and they were never put into operation in their entirety. The work did not start with any enthusiasm or any zest in 1956. We know that the Government turned down some of the fundamental recommendations. The programme that it did put into operation never kept pace with the time-table laid down by the Tomlinson Commission in 1954-&#x2019;55 on which this projection was based. That is the first thing. If that is the position, how can these people still claim to attach any importance to the forecast for the year 1978?</p>

<p>The second thing is that the relationship between the numbers of Bantu in and out of the reserves according to this projection should remain the same in 1965 as in 1951. There has been a small change, but not a very great one, so I do not propose to labour that point.</p>

<p>They laid down a third condition, and that is that development be undertaken at a tempo which results in the population of the reserves growing at a steady rate to reach 8 million in 20 years&#x2019; time, that is by 1976. What has been the position? It is now over ten years since that projection was made, and according to the forecast there were to be 5.3 million Bantu outside the reserves in 1961. In fact, by 1960 the figure was 7 million. Not 5.3 million but 7 million Bantu were outside the reserves. Where we expected 4.6 million in the reserves by 1961 the figure is only 3,800,000&#x2014;close on 1 million less than it should have been. Although it is very difficult to obtain accurate figures, my belief is that the population of the reserves is not growing very much. My belief is that it is remaining fairly static. Because what is happening is that we are getting an overflow into the White areas which is exactly what the Tomlinson Commission forecast would happen unless development took place at the rate and the tempo which they suggested and which they recommended.</p>

<p>I do not think that that projection can be relied upon by the Government as being scientifically accurate after those facts have been drawn to the attention of hon. gentlemen on the other side. I make bold to say that I do not think that any hon. gentleman on the other side is going to make use of this projection again as suggesting that 1978 is going to see the turning point.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are strange people who rush in where angels fear to tread. To return to the point I <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0371"/>was making, Sir&#x2014;if that is no basis, what other basis is there? Who else has done the work? Where has this come from? When last we discussed it in the House the then Minister drew my attention to a graph which had been published in the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report itself and was used as a projection in volume 16 of chapter 47, at page 19. If one looks at that Commission&#x2019;s report and one looks at the legend attached to that projection, what does one find? I will quote what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Word &#x2019;n sodanige program nie aangepak nie en die huidige toestande duur voort, kan dit nie verwag word dat die Bantoegebiede ooit veel meer mense sal bevat as wat op die huidige oomblik hulle woonplek daar het nie. Die aanname in die bevolking aldaar sal eenvoudig oorloop na die blanke gebiede.</block>

<p>My hon. friend asks what is wrong with that. He is not suggesting that they accepted the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report in its entirety. He is not suggesting for one moment that they have developed border industries at the rate which Tomlinson requested, to give employment to 30,000 a year over the first ten years. Where are they heading? After 11 years even the optimistic new Deputy Minister can only claim that they have given employment in border industries to 41,000 Bantu. There are some of us who wonder whether that figure is correct. That is exactly what is happening at the moment. The odd thing about the projection is that if one goes through it one finds it is based on a total Bantu population of 9,900,000 by 1961. As I have said, that forecast is already proved to be more than 1 million out. I believe that it is possibly due to wrong counting. I believe that the census in 1951 was not properly made, and I believe that in 1961 it was more accurate. That may account for a small part of the discrepancy, but it cannot account for the whole, and there is a very big discrepancy indeed.</p>

<p>If one looks at it one finds that in making this estimate the committee responsible for drafting the projection lay emphasis on the difficulties that could arise from the shortage of capital. Have I not drawn attention to that already? I referred to a capital formation of probably R1,000 million a year to take up the surplus labour. They lay emphasis on the educational revolution that will have to take place amongst the Bantu people. They lay emphasis on the vital importance of developing their skills in various trades and industries in order to give these reserves an opportunity of carrying a population of that kind. Those were the conditions they laid down.</p>

<p>If one looks at the projection, even though those conditions are accepted, then there is no indication in their projection that the number of Bantu in the White areas will start decreasing from 1978. If one carefully works out what the projection means, one finds that there are going to be 4,600,000 Bantu in the reserves in 1956, and 4,300,000 outside the reserves. They forecast that by 1966 there would be 6,000,000 in the reserves and 5,000,000 outside.</p>

<p>May I accept, Sir, that the hon. the Chief Whip is admitting defeat on behalf of the Government? He cannot say that he is going to succeed; all he can say is that the position would be worse if we were in power. Sir, how can they go on making these statements and basing their policy on it when according to this projection the number of Bantu in the White areas goes on increasing year after year&#x2014;well after the year 2000&#x2014;and shows no indication of ceasing to increase? Sir, that is no justification for the claim that the number of Bantu outside the reserves can ever be decreased. Nobody knows better than this Minister that the conditions laid down by the commission were not accepted by the Government, and I believe that nobody knows better than this Minister that the rate of development in the reserves has been infinitely slower than that projected or asked for by the commission. I think nobody knows better than the Minister that what in fact is happening is that quite ten years before this turning point the Bantu population of the reserves is hardly growing at all, it is virtually remaining constant, and the increase has been outside the reserves. Sir, nobody knows better than hon. members opposite that this Government has accepted an economic development programme which provides for a 5&#x00BD; per cent growth in the economy annually, and that means additional employment over the next five years for approximately 600,000 non-Whites. Tell me, Sir, where are they going to come from? If that rate of development goes on, then the number of Bantu outside the reserves is going to increase even faster than in the past. Now, Sir, what has happened? This Government has been faced with a break-down of its theories. It is unable to bring any scientific proof to establish scientifically the basis for its claim&#x2026;</p>

Sir, when he makes statements of that kind he ought to be ashamed of himself, because he is telling me now that he does not know what the figure will be, and yet he is prepared to go on to a political platform and promise a reversal of the flow by 1978. Despite the limited numbers of unemployed Coloureds, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education talks of recruits from amongst the unemployed Coloureds here and elsewhere. Sir, when you look at the area of the Western Cape, you find that it is variously described but it seems to consist of everything west of the Eiselen Line, that is to say, the Humansdorp/Colesberg line, but I understand that now it is going to be extended even further to the Fish River/Aliwal North line if one is to accept the statement made by the hon. the Minister of Planning some time last month. But, Sir, let us work on the old line because we have not got the figures for the new line. Perhaps the Cabinet Committee concerned can give us the figure for the new line in due course. If you work on the old line, I think there are approximately 255,000 Bantu in the area; that is excluding Port Elizabeth and the Uitenhage complex. But if you look at the figure of unemployed Coloured males in the whole of the Republic, according to the last figures given in answer to a question in this House on the 31st January, then the total unemployment figure for the Republic in respect of Coloured males is 2,451 and 1,095 in respect of Coloured females.

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that he knew it would create a crisis. I wonder if he knew just what the crisis was going to be because it has been very interesting to see some of the statements which have been made. First there was Mr. Barrett, the chairman of the Western Cape Development Association. Presumably he knows what he is talking about, and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Much of the Bantu labour force in the Western Cape is not replaceable by Coloured labour and would have to be retained if disruption in certain industries was to be avoided.</block>

<p>Then there was Mr. Mossop, retiring President of the Cape Chamber of Industries. This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd, when Minister of Native Affairs, and his successor in that portfolio, Mr. de Wet Nel, had declared that the reduction of African labour in the Western Cape should not be over-hasty and should not disrupt industry. What is being done at present is hardly in accord with this dictum and stated policy because the action taken is hasty and disruptive. He pointed out that the Railways had increased their intake of Africans, which they were justified in doing because like various manufacturing industries they could not find any local alternative for certain manual work.</block>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister of Transport will agree that he has taken on between 700 and 800 extra Bantu in the Docks because he could not get on without them. [Interjections.] The Minister of Transport brought them from the Transkei and put them in Bishop Lavis. [Interjections.] Mr. Mossop goes on and talks about the higher education of the Coloured people and he emphasizes their unwillingness to do certain kinds of work. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This, occurring at the same time as the active drive to decrease the number of Africans in the Western Cape, was having a sharp but tragic effect on industry to carry on normally, let alone to increase at the planned national rate. The Chamber was being flooded with reports of cut-backs in production and firms are explaining to customers that delivery dates must be extended.</block>

<p>But this hon. gentleman tells me that he has the support of industry; they are all on his side, according to him, but this is the report we find in the Press. Then there is the official statement of the Cape Chamber of Industries of 8th December&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Executive Council of the Chamber considered the directive concerning the reduction of Bantu labour in the Western Cape. There is evidence that the formula would disrupt the productive capacity of the area. There is ample evidence that such a step at this stage would disrupt industry in the Western Cape with grave consequences not only to the area but for the economy of the Republic as a whole, as the Cape is the second largest contributor to the national economy and the majority contributor to the export trade.</block>

<p>Wait a moment. I am coming to that interview. It seems that the Deputy Minister is becoming apprehensive. Then we had a statement from Mr. Goldberg of the Cape Chamber of Industries. He deals with the difficulties of particular employers and industries, stressing the position of the quarry and brick-making industries, and he emphasizes that cuts in the Western Cape production will very soon have an adverse effect on the whole national economy. Then there was the statement by Mr. Lee, the Director of the Cape Chamber of Industries. He expected matters to become chaotic if the Government did not ease its policy. He pointed out that normal industrial growth has in the past steadily driven up the demand for Native labour by an average of 1.45 per cent a year. He pointed out that replacements would have to be found for a large number of Natives who would, but for the Government policy, have come here in the next year. He also pointed out that under pressure from the Government many employers had already reduced the proportion of Natives working for them. One firm had cut the percentage of Native labour from 80 to 30 per cent. Another had reduced its Native work forces by 40 per cent. A third had replaced 100 out of 250.</p>

<p>He agreed to the appointment of an advisory committee which was to advise him on how to replace Bantu with Coloureds and also to advise him in respect of which industries it was essential to have Bantu labour. I want to know whether he will accept the advice in that regard. You see, Sir, this is just dealing with industry, but the manufacturing industry does not employ such a very large percentage of the Bantu in the area. In fact, the Minister, when he spoke to the Chamber of Industries, told them that they were good boys who had been carrying out his policy, but the number of Bantu was still increasing. You see, Sir, the big demand has been in the service industry, and that is where costs have been pushed up. The Railways have had their troubles. The building industry has tremendous troubles because it can keep its contract labour for a certain period only. The Bantu do unskilled work, it is true, but they no sooner get used to the work, after a period of about 12 months, when they have to go back to the reserves, and the building industry has to take in a new man and train him again. That adds to their costs. Then there is the brick industry, and here there is a statement made by Major Hare, the Chairman of the Western Province Brick and Clay Manufacturers, and this statement was made after the interview on 20th January&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present the brick manufacturers in the Western Province are not carrying excess stocks of bricks as is the case on the Witwatersrand. On the contrary, there is a general shortage of bricks in the Western Province, caused mainly by the scarcity of unskilled Bantu labour, as the result of which normal production has been curtailed. One of the leading manufacturers of face bricks has lost two months&#x2019; production due to lack of labour, and only through the sympathetic intervention of a local authority has his position been relieved temporarily for four months. Stock bricks are in short supply. A large manufacturer of stock bricks who does not employ Bantu labour is operating with a shortage of 40 per cent of the required labour complement because suitable Coloured labour is not available.</block>

<p>His production is reduced by 40 per cent. Then lie goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A serious situation in regard to the supply of bricks will ensue unless the brick industry is allowed access to Bantu labour. No suitable Coloured labour is available.</block>

<p>Then there is the Cape Dairymen&#x2019;s Association. They are up in arms.</p>

<p>Something else is happening in this area. The Department of Bantu Administration has now blocked the creation of certain further industrial areas in the Peninsula because it fears the influx of more Bantu workers. That will be dealt with by other speakers, but you see already the disruption that has been caused by the threat. We have seen the Minister having had to change his policy already, but he is determined to go ahead and keep the pressure up. It is not only on industry that it is having an effect. What about the farmers in the Western Cape under this policy? As early as 1965 the farmers were already in trouble. There was a statement from a Mr. J. J. de Villiers, who was chairman of the Durbanville Farmers&#x2019; Association, who said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. J. J. de Villiers, chairman of the Durbanville Farmers&#x2019; Association, expressed the feelings of many Boland farmers when he said that the matter of Coloured labour on the farms was extremely critical. On some farms in the Western Cape there were no Coloured Workers at all, only Natives. The drift of Coloured farm labourers to the towns and cities was continuing. These workers went to more attractive jobs in industry. They also preferred the social life in the cities. Mr. De Villiers said that the Coloured labour would have to be supplemented with Native labour for a long time to come. This was especially the case with the dairy and grain areas around Malmesbury. Durbanville and Philadelphia.</block>

<p>Then he spoke about salaries on his own farm having doubled in a period of about two years. So the position last year was very much worse. Here is a letter published by <i>Die Burger</i> at length from a farmer at Vredenburg. I want to read just two passages from it because they are so typical of my own experience when visiting those areas. He says:</p>

<block name="quote">Graanboere van die Swartland en omliggende distrikte het rede om die toekoms met diepe besorgdheid tegemoet te gaan. Sekere verwikkelinge aan die Weskus werp hul skaduwee in &#x2019;n toenemende mate oor &#x2019;n streek waar &#x2019;n intensiewe boerderystelsel reeds geruime tyd met groot welslae toegepas word, &#x2019;n streek wat met trots daarop aanspraak kan maak dat dit &#x2019;n hoÃ« persentasie van die koring wat in die Republiek geproduseer word, lewer, en ook reeds verbasend veel op die gebied van die veeteelt <span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0375"/>tot stand gebring het. Waarom voel die boere bekommerd? Omdat hulle nie weet of hulle in die nabye toekoms nog &#x2019;n enkele Kleurling op hulle plase sal hÃª nie.</block>

<p>He goes on:</p>

<block name="quote">Waarheen ontwikkel sake aan die Weskus? In die distrikte Malmesbury en Piketberg is daar soms tot 6,000 Bantoes in die diens van sowat 520 werkgewers. Van hierdie getal is sowat 1,200 in diens van die walvisstasie by Donkergat en die visfabrieke terwyl sowat 1,100 as kreefvangers in diens geneem word. Indien hierdie Bantoe verwyder word, wie sal dan hulle werk doen? Kleurlinge? Indien wel, waar sal hierdie Kleurlinge vandaan kom? Daar is slegs een moontlike bron van Kleurlingarbeiders en dit is die boereplase van die Swartland in Wes-Kaapland.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that gives you an idea of the difficulties. What did the farmers do? They got together in the Durbanville/Philadelphia area and they formed their own co-operative in order to get Bantu from the reserves to come and work on their farms. They did it with the full approval of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. They were quite successful for a while. Several other cooperatives were formed. Last year at the end of November or the beginning of December two new organizations, one from Paarl and the other from the Worcester/Hex River area, went on a deputation to the Deputy Minister and were very satisfied because they got certain concessions from him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have never said that it is my policy to give it to them on demand. I am, however, not going to restrict it so artificially that I force up labour costs in the area. I am certainly not going to restrict it in such a way that development on the farms is prevented. I am certainly not going to restrict it in such a way that a new <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0376"/>young farmer buying a farm and wanting to start cannot get labour.

<p>No. The hon. the Minister knows very well that the farmers in this area are accustomed to Coloured labour. They are not anxious to change to Bantu labour. They are being forced to change to Bantu labour by the draining away of Coloured labour by the industries, especially the fishing industries on the West Coast and the manufacturing industries in the towns. Their costs are being forced up. What this Minister is doing is making the position infinitely worse for them.

<block name="quote">Om te sÃª dat Kleurlingarbeid nie beskik-baar is nie, is die grootste onsin ter wÃªreld.</block>

<p>Do you know, Sir, I can see him employed by any farming organization to canvas Coloured labour for them. He would starve, because he would not get it. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So het die SpoorweÃ« byvoorbeeld met groot welslae Kleurlinge buite Wes-Kaapland gewerf.</block>

<p>The poor Minister of Transport, Sir. We know what trouble he has, and yet the hon. the Deputy Minister makes a statement of that kind. He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Volgehoue ontwikkeling kan ook verseker word deur groter meganisasie. Dit is eenvoudig skokkend dat nyweraars kan sÃª dat &#x2019;n vermindering van 5 persent per jaar in die Bantoe-arbeidsmag die oorsaak sal wees dat hulle nie sal kan ontwikkel nie. Dit is &#x2019;n geval van absolute intellektuele luiheid.</block>

<p>That is what this hon. gentleman said. The report continued&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, but how are they going to compete with their cost structure forced with higher Railway rates and because of the difficulty arising because of the distance from their markets? Does the hon. member know what the position is as regards industrial townships in this area? Does he know how much development there has been? He has spoken of having industry on his side and his advisory committee. Is he going to listen to them when they tell him, as they will, that in certain industries it is impossible to do without Bantu labour or is he going to force the issue? Is he going to listen to them when they tell him that if the Western Cape is to go on developing, the probability is that they are going to need more Bantu labour? Has he done a survey of this area to find out what labour is necessary and where it is coming from? The hon. member does not even fetch his milk every morning, and I doubt whether he will fetch his newspaper. What is the reaction of business circles in Cape Town? I will tell the House what the general reaction of business circles is to this activity. It is that the Minister&#x2019;s action is weakening the ability of this part of the country to contribute its rightful share to the economy of the country and secondly that it is increasing inflationary influences which must have an effect upon the whole country.</p>

<p>There are four points to which I want to draw attention. Already planning in the area has been stultified and the proclamation of <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0377"/>new industrial areas is being held up by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. Secondly, there is an additional burden to the Western Cape, over and above its existing competitive difficulties, as a result of the increasing of Railway rates last year. Thirdly sections of Cape industry are not achieving optimum development and the region is industrially not keeping pace with the development achieved elsewhere. It is interesting to note how much of the land zoned for industries in this area remains undeveloped. At Worcester the seat of the former Minister of Finance over 70 per cent of the industrial township is undeveloped. That has been the progress! Lastly, the whole idea of the business community is that this concept of removing all Bantu from the Western Cape is an impossible pipe dream that can seriously disrupt the economy of the area at a time when it may be hard hit by Britain&#x2019;s entry into the common market. For all those reasons I believe I am justified in moving the amendment which I have already read to the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the motion of no confidence the hon. the Prime Minister said that he and the Leader of the Opposition were not the two leading economists in this House or in the country. Now I am quite convinced that the Leader of the Opposition is definitely not. Let us consider one of the statements made by him. He said that we were aware of the extent to which prices of farms in the Western Province had been increasing. Why are those prices increasing? Is it because I am ruining the farmers so much? Who buys that land? The farmers who I am ruining so much? He admitted that the economy of the Western Province had never been more sound than at the present time. His entire argument was that I was ruining the economy of the Western Province. What an absurd argument. I want to congratulate him on having scraped up the courage to get round to Bantu policy. In course of time I was beginning to feel disheartened. We are a Minister and two Deputy Ministers and during the motion of no confidence we waited for him to get round to that subject. I said to my friend next to me that it seemed to me that he did not want to get round to that subject and that we seemed to have worked ourselves out of our jobs.

<p>Yes, we shall come to Worcester. I am going to make no secret about it and for as far as you, Sir, will allow me to do so&#x2014;and to me you seem to be in a good mood, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;I am not going to count my words. I am not going to beat about the bush. I am going to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition exactly what he is trying to do to the Western Cape as well as to the rest of the Republic of South Africa. He wants to try to make it Black in a way which must lead to the downfall of the White man in South Africa. [Interjections.] I am telling him that his entire argument this afternoon was for the unlimited inflow of Bantu labour into the Western Cape. The industries must get as much as they demand. The farmers must get as much as they demand. When I asked him whether he was going to supply Bantu labour on demand, he said that it must be controlled. That is what I am trying to do. I am controlling it. I shall tell him how I control it.</p>

<p>It is not my fault if there are certain farmers or certain industrialists who take notice of the nonsense published in his newspapers and who make deductions which are not justified. Who said that that 5 per cent was inflexible? No one is so stupid that he would have said that. That much is obvious. I am trying to control it. I told farmers recently that if they wanted seasonal labour they had to come to me. Up to the present time I have had six applications for additional Bantu labour. Where are the farmers who have such a shortage of labour? However, there are farmers who did not have a single Bantu labourer last year but who now want 50. There is one farmer who did not have one such labourer last year and then wanted 150 but after he and I had finished our discussions he was quite satisfied with 15. That constitutes control. There is no objection to seasonal labour, but that is something we can settle at Worcester, and I shall tell the rest of the country, also the Western Cape, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party want the Western Cape to become totally Black, not only as far as Bantu labour is concerned, but also as far as the families of those Bantu are concerned. He wants to allow Bantu labour in on a family basis. Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wants to <span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0378"/>deny that. That leading expert on the U.N., wants to deny that! The hon. member for Wynberg shed crocodile-tears here the other day about the Bantu who were here without their families. The hon. member for Bezuiden-hout wanted to cry with her, but he has become so cynical that he can no longer cry. Now I challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, or any other speaker opposite, to tell this House whether it is their policy to bring Bantu labour into the Western Cape at the demand of industries and farmers and whether they want to allow that to be done on a family basis. This is a fair question.</p>

<p>If I have the answer, the hon. member for Pinelands will surely not mind repeating the answer for me. That is their policy and that is what we shall rub in at Worcester and everywhere else, and we shall see what consequences that will have. I make the statement, and I repeat it, that the United Party wants to allow Bantu labour into the Western Cape on demand and it wants to allow that to be done, on a family basis. They do not want to separate the husband from the wife, they do not want to separate families, they cannot find it in their small Christian hearts to do so. But at the same time they maintain that the inflow should be controlled. Yet they do not have a single word of pity for the many thousands of Bantu mine-workers who have been coming to South Africa for many years on a contractual and single basis, because as long as the friends of hon. members opposite can make money from that, they are perfectly satisfied. The mine-workers may be without their wives and families for 18 months, but as long as the friends of hon. members opposite can make money from that, there is no objection in principle, there is no moral objection.

He is seeing that he is losing the support of organized industry in South Africa. He lost the support of organized agriculture long ago. At the moment he is losing the support of organized commerce and industry. He spoke here about border industries and said that the Government was establishing border industries on ideological grounds and not on economic grounds. He also said that organized industry was against the Government. I should now like to read to him from the latest report of the Natal Chamber of Industries in respect of border industries&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, decentralization, of course. What is the difference? They went further and expressed their satisfaction with the way in which border industries were now being established. However, I am not going to let the hon. member escape from what I am going to read now. I am quoting from the report of the Natal Chamber of Industries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reference to paragraph 4 of the Chamber&#x2019;s 22nd Annual Report for the year 1959-&#x2019;60 will show that your then Executive Committee reacted to the announcement with a great deal of misgivings&#x2026;</block>

<p>that means to border industries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; because the announcement created a distinct impression that there was a danger that these industries in the border areas might be allowed to upset the normal expansion of industries in the metropolitan areas&#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;that is precisely the hon. member&#x2019;s objection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to the detriment of the long-term economic <b>interests</b> of the Republic of South <b>Africa. Gradually, your</b> Executive Committee has come to recognize that the manner in which the Permanent Committee for the Location of Industry and the Development <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0379"/>of Border Areas has set about its task is one which can be commended because the fears expressed in 1960 have not materialized to any extent whatsoever. It is a development which will continue to require watching because the dangers foreseen in 1960 could still occur if matters are allowed to get out of hand&#x2026;</block>

<p>I agree entirely with that, because it is always necessary to watch matters of course.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; On the other hand, we feel it only fair to admit that up to the present, development in the border areas has been to the economic advantage rather than the detriment of the Republic.</block>

<p>This is what the Natal Chamber of Industries said, and I now challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;he has the entire day at his disposal and may telephone&#x2014;to obtain an official statement from any other Chamber of Industries in South Africa to the effect that they are opposed to the establishment of border industries. I challenge him to do so. He complained here that this industrialist and that industrialist were complaining. Now I challenge him to obtain such a statement from one of the chairmen of one of the chambers of industries. He will not obtain one and that is what is hurting him so very much.</p>

<p>As regards the year 1978 I repeat what I said&#x2014;and not what the hon. member read in certain newspapers&#x2014;and that is that I stake my political reputation on the turning point coming by 1978, and I agree with the hon. member for Krugersdorp that it may come earlier than 1978.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the Western Cape, and I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that this decrease of 5 per cent suggested by me has been wholly accepted by the Chamber of Industries of the Western Cape. I attended one of their meetings and explained the position. We discussed the matter for a long time and one after the other they rose, for example, Mr. Mossop, Mr. Marx, Mr. I. L. Back and others whose names I cannot recall, and said that they supported that policy. I have here a statement which they were prepared to issue in conjunction with me, but I refused to sign it because I did not like the last part. They wanted me to accept the recommendations of the advisory committee. Why should I do so, Sir? After all, I am the Deputy Minister and not them. I am a reasonable man, and I shall listen to them. They were prepared to sign, with me, the following recommendation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Deputy Minister wishes to make it clear that the formula is not to be regarded as inflexible. The main object is that there shall be an average reduction of Bantu labour in the region of not less than 5 per cent per annum. Where a definite and essential economic need exists,the reduction may be less than 5 per cent in a particular year. In other cases, where feasible because of increased availability of Coloured labour (or of mechanization) for the work to be done, replacement of Bantu labour may proceed at greater rate.</block>

<p>Of course, &#x201C;feasible&#x201D;. The Chamber of Industries was prepared to sign this statement with me.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that it is not the policy of this Government, and I shall not do so, to supply Bantu labour to industrialists or to farmers or to dealers on demand. I shall simply not do so. I say here now that there is a fantastic waste of Bantu labour in the Western Cape, just as there is a fantastic waste of Bantu labour in the rest of the industrial areas in South Africa. I say to the industrialist that they will have to eliminate the fantastic waste of Bantu labour, because they will get no mercy from me. I shall give you an example, Mr. Speaker. I do not want to mention any names, but there is a large industry in the Western Cape, a respectable industry, decent people, who wanted 80 Bantu from the Transkei. They had 80 last year and wanted 80 again. They came to see me and explained their problems to me. I said to them that they could not get 80 but that they could in fact get 76. They said that was fine and thanked me. I imposed the condition, however, that they had to accommodate the Bantu themselves. I undertook to give them the necessary land at Langa and Nyanga but said that they had to accommodate the Bantu themselves and that they themselves had to pay for the accommodation. They thereupon went to the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner and told him that I had said that they could get 76 Bantu. He replied that I had informed him accordingly and because they had to provide the necessary accommodation he asked them to submit the necessary plans and the engineers reports on when the houses would be completed, whereupon he would issue the necessary permit for the Bantu to come here. Their application arrived ten days later but then they no longer wanted 76&#x2014;they were quite satisfied with 42 only. To-day they are still satisfied with 42.</p>

<p>Of course it is. We have exactly the same problem in the Transvaal. I have addressed many farmers&#x2019; associations in the Vaal Triangle in an attempt to calm them. One has the same problem on the entire West Rand and in the Middelburg/ Witbank area. The industries there are drawing labour away from the farms and one simply has to face up to the problem and the farmers will simply have to devise some plan or other; there is nothing we can do about that. That problem is precisely the same in the Boland. Mr. Speaker, this now is the kind of thing which the hon. member is saying before the Worcester by-election. I want to prove to him how industries can succeed in decreasing their Bantu labour. After my announcement in connection with a decrease of 5 per cent I received a long letter from the Chamber of Industries in which they stated that they would do everything within their power to assist. In this letter they gave examples to illustrate what progress they had made in their attempts to eliminate Bantu labour. They boast that they are eliminating Bantu labour but the hon. member nags about it; he wants to know how the industries should decrease their Bantu labour. The Chamber of Industries mentioned the following examples and they boasted that they had succeeded in decreasing Bantu labour&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A cigarette-manufacturing industry reduced its number of Bantu workers by 252 from 1962 to 1966. A packaging firm reduced its Bantu labour force from 75.3 per cent of their entire complement total to 30.1 per cent in 1966. A plaster-board industry reversed a ratio of 80 Bantu to 30 Coloureds to 30 Bantu and 80 Coloureds. A textile firm recently reduced the number of Bantu employed from 190 to 140. Another textile firm in the last few years has reduced its Bantu total from 333 to 171.</block>

<p>And, Mr. Speaker, here is the curious fact of the matter: In each of these industries production has not decreased but increased. One can manage with less Bantu labour here and on the Witwatersrand without any prejudice to the economy of the country.</p>

<p>Because more industries are coming into being; because there is greater economic development. We are going to stop the influx of Bantu labour; we are going to change that process without prejudice to the country&#x2019;s economy, as I shall indicate in a short while. Hon. members of the Opposition simply want to let things take their course; their policy is a <i>laissez faire</i>policy. They want the Bantu to stream in; they want to allow industrialists to employ as many Bantu as they like; they pay no attention to the social problems. They reason in the same way as the sugar farmers in Natal reasoned when they could not get labour and allowed Indians and Chinese into the country, and just look with what problems we are saddled to-day. The United Party at present wants to follow that same policy and we shall destroy it on the basis of that policy. Our people have sufficient courage to realize that they cannot sacrifice the future of the White man here for the sake of making a little more money and for the sake of enabling Graaffs&#x2019; Trust to pay bigger dividends. We simply will not allow that. But when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition visits the rural areas he is quite prepared to say this type of thing&#x2014;and he must tell me whether I am quoting him incorrectly&#x2014;namely that his aim is (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The retention of the number of Bantu in the White areas at a minimum in order to maintain a satisfactory numerical balance between White and non-White&#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, if he is going to supply Bantu labourers to the industrialists on demand, how is he going to succeed in maintaining that balance or ratio? What is his plan? How is he going to achieve that? But then the hon. member for Yeoville came forward and said that we were more and more dependent on Bantu labourers. I am quoting from what appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know where we are establishing industries without Bantu labour. The other day I approved an industry situated between African Explosives and K.O.P., an industry with an investment of R1 million. That industry employs 65 Whites and 42 Bantu. I can mention another industry here in the Cape. There is for example Killarney which does not employ a single Bantu and which produces 30 million bricks per annum. It does not employ a single Bantu. Nylon Spinners, one of the largest factories in the Cape, does not employ a single Bantu. Then there is the other case I mentioned the other day, namely that of Brickor which made 60 million bricks with a labour complement of between 600 and 720 Bantu; at present it makes the same quantity of bricks with a Bantu complement of 60. These things can be done.</p>

<p>Sir, this is also the trend in the rest of the world.

That is what is happening in London. I can also mention the case of Mr. Campbell Pritt of Nortan Abrasives. I have his permission to mention the case here. He said that they wanted to extend their factory in London on their own land and that the British Board of Trade told them, &#x201C;Not a single brick on another; if you want to extend you must go to Northern Ireland, to a depressed area&#x201D;.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The reason was that London&#x2019;s traffic problem was beginning to become impossible, and our social problem regarding the presence of Bantu in one&#x2019;s White cities is beginning to become impossible. This social problem is strangling and destroying the White nation in South Africa. We will simply not allow it, and I make this gift to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, with a view to the Worcester by-election: Our policy is to decrease the flow of Bantu labour to the cities; I admit that we have not yet succeeded in doing so. Our policy therefore is to arrest the flow and after that has been accomplished to reverse the flow with the least measure of economic sacrifice possible, but even if that would mean economic sacrifice, we should still be able to do so. The Government would like the national growth in South Africa to be somewhere between 5 per cent to 5&#x00BD; per cent. What merit is there in Johannesburg growing at a rate of between 7 per cent to 9 per cent each year; why should Johannesburg not grow by 3 per cent and East London by 9 per cent? What is wrong with that?</p>

<p>Yes, of course, because East London is situated on the borders of a Bantu area; and then there is the development of one&#x2019;s Bantu homelands. Unfortunately I do not have the time now to deal with the development of the Bantu homelands but the Government is determined to promote such development to an ever-increasing extent. I do not have the time to go into that now, but the Government is determined to do so and to develop them on a larger scale. And why can that not be done? We are engaged in that and have already made more progress than England has made in Lesotha in 50 years or in Botswana or in Swaziland&#x2014; the beloved England of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and his beloved Wilson. [Laughter.] You can always defend them but never your own country. We have made more economic progress over the last five years in the Transkei under the Bantu Investment Corporation and the Xhosa Development Corporation than they have made in those three countries put together, and I think I may throw in the Congo as well. Of course this thing is going to demand sacrifices; of course it is going to exact its toll of hardships. I have been engaged in it long enough to know that it is going to cost blood, sweat and tears. It is going to be no easy task. [Interjections.] I would rather speak like Churchill than like an old fatty like you. The hon. member for Durban (Point) has Churchill&#x2019;s figure but I have his intellect. [Laughter.] Of course it is going to take hard work and demand sacrifices, but while I was listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his prophecies of doom I said to myself that they were the same prophecies of doom which he made at the time of the referendum and which I made along with them at the time when the Nationalists took over&#x2014;the banks would close and the industries would come to a standstill and there would be unemployment and &#x201C;vote for the right to vote again&#x201D;, and now they stand in mortal fear of an election. However, they will have to fight in Worcester. I say we know the task we have tackled. We know how enormous that task is and we know how difficult it is, but the difference between us and that side of this House is this. If they were in power they would follow a policy which would allow the White nation to survive in this country &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D;. We reject that policy in its entirety. We say the White nation will not survive here &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D; only; it has an inexorable right to survive here, and as far as the National Party is concerned, and as regards my modest share in that, I shall do so by day and by night.</p>

<p>This is the speaker the Government has put up to deal with this question, and all we get in the way of a statement of policy is this type of thing, &#x201C;Ons kan die getalle verminder as ons dit in die regte rigting stuur&#x201D;. This is the type of generalization: &#x201C;Waarom kan dit nie gedoen word nie?&#x201D; &#x201C;Dit gaan opoffering eis.&#x201D; That is the typical sort of thing we have been getting from them for 18 years. For 18 years they have had this great ideal of increasing the separation between the races. For 18 years this has been their glorious policy, but far from greater and greater separation we have had less and less separation. The rough figures for the towns were that there were two million Natives in the towns in 1948 and there are four million now, but this does not discourage a man like the hon. the Deputy Minister. He thinks he is achieving his policy most beautifully when he says farmers came to him in the Western Cape and said they needed 150 labourers in one case and 60 labourers in another case, and they went away satisfied with ten or 20 Native labourers. But the numbers are going up all the time and we realize that they have to go up. The whole deceit of the policy is that they keep on feeding the people of South Africa on the deception that these numbers will be reduced and that we will live happily ever after in this snowy white land, when they should know by now that the very opposite is happening. And of course to cover it up we have to get the bluff Deputy Minister to come and crack jokes by the dozen to keep his supporters in good humour. This may be all very well to win a debate or to win the Worcester election, and it may be possible to win some future elections on that basis, but it is not going to give us one iota of respect for the Government or its policy, and the way they carry on is not in the interests of South Africa at all.</p>

<p>I said they were totally misrepresenting our policy: this typical stuff that we stand for the complete &#x201C;verswarting&#x201D; of the country; and the Deputy Minister has the nerve to say that in this attitude our policy was one of &#x201C;hensop&#x201D;.</p>

Indeed, it was the United Party which introduced influx control.

They may be able to cheer them up for some time, but there are thinking members on their side who are not smiling at his tactics and who are not impressed. We have had the Deputy Minister repeating again that he stakes his reputation on the fact that the numbers will be less in 1978 than they are to-day. I ask him to tell me now how many Natives there are in the White areas to-day. I do not believe the Government has the figures, so his reputation is not exactly being put at stake. I ask him and other members to tell us how many Natives there are to-day, and we <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0383"/>will hold him to it and we will laugh at him when we are in power, and I am glad to say that that will be in my lifetime. [Interjections.] I am glad to say that it will be in the lifetime I hope of almost all of us. I have got more faith in the electorate of South Africa than to believe that they will for ever follow a Government who said that its policy was ever greater separation and it became more and more obvious that it was ever greater integration. We heard from the hon. the Deputy Minister that there was a &#x201C;fantastiese vermorsing van arbeid&#x201D; in South Africa to-day. We have had this Government in power for 18 years and what has it been doing? This is a cornerstone of their policy and why have they done nothing about it if it was so?</p>

<p>Yes, that is probably why. They have certainly expanded their Cabinet to a great extent and there is a great deal that could be cut out in that regard without any loss to anybody. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see how they chop and change their policy. We remember well how they went steadily for 18 years and how the numbers increased in the way we have indicated. Their late Prime Minister himself said that it is not a violation of his policy if the Natives are present here or even if there is an increase in the number of Natives here. The hon. member for Heilbron in his famous statement said that whether we had 5,000 or 50,000 or five million Natives in the White areas, if we accept their policy, this is no violation of it. It probably cost him a Cabinet post for having said that, because the cat is not meant to be let out of the bag quite as clearly as that. That is what he did and that was their policy then; but in August last year we had the sudden turn of the tide and we had the new hon. Deputy Minister saying he staked his reputation and that the Government was really in earnest. This was of course a complete change. We welcome their trying out their policy and coming up against the facts, so that they can see that this policy of theirs is stupid. We welcome a test with facts and we have indeed now been having it here in the Western Cape. We have been able to see how things are developing and we can see that they are extremely serious indeed. We have had the situation that the quotas are being frozen as from the 31st August. This has two effects. Firstly, nobody who actually employed Bantu labour, may after that date take more into his service. Secondly, nobody who at that date did not engage Bantu labour may take any into his service. There has thus been this very serious limitation placed upon employers. Then there is to be this annual reduction of 5 per cent. Now we have heard here to-day how the farmers are already crying out for labour and approaching the hon. Deputy Minister in order to obtain permission to get this labour. He has now imposed these quotas and frozen the labour. He has moreover said that certain categories of work may not be done by contract Bantu. The clear result of that is going to be that there will be far more Coloureds required in the Cape area to be taken into employment. What will be the result? Clearly, these Coloureds will have to be brought in from the farms with a new and greater twist to the shortage of labour on those farms.</p>

He thinks that is impressive. <i>Die Burger</i> also featured this quite a lot. I want to tell him that it does not impress me at all.

These firms have increased their numbers and others have doubtless lost members of their labour force. But you get back to the basic situation that there is no Coloured unemployment here. The hon. Leader of the Opposition gave the figure for Coloured unemployed in the whole country. I should like to add that as far as the Cape Province is concerned the total number of Coloureds, both male and female, unemployed at the present time is about 2,200. It is pure deception to suggest that because certain firms have increased their proportion of Coloured labour they are getting any nearer the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>He said that it would be kept to a minimum, and it will be; but there is no definite ratio of one to two or one to three as the case may be. It will be kept to a minimum. Quite naturally the policy of those hon. members, where they have stated that by the year 2000 the ratio ought to be fifty-fifty Black and White, requires them to do something about it. Of course they are only getting further and further away and they become more and more the laughing stock of everybody in this regard. [Interjections.] This whole situation, if it were not so serious, would be funny and one could even laugh at it and the hon. the Deputy Minister and his jokes. But we know that in the Western Cape there is a brick shortage developing. We know that the dairies are having difficulty to find people to deliver the milk. We know that there is a growing shortage of stable boys. We know that there is a shortage of farm labour. I am not at all certain that one of the reasons why Cape Town is not always as clean as it should be, is not because of this policy of the Government. It is not possible for the City Council to take into its service the requisite number of people to keep the city clean.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I have the figures here from the City Engineer&#x2019;s Department and they make use of hundreds of Bantu. [Interjections.] I have got the figures here. I have mentioned the shortages which are already with us but now we have the situation that development is being hamstrung. We know from letters that there have been attempts to increase the industrial area in the Cape Peninsula. If you do not increase the industrial area available, you merely push up the cost of the existing industrial land and this in turn pushes up the cost of the products of the Western Cape and, therefore, reduces their competitiveness. In accordance with natural development an attempt was made to open up a new area to industry, known as Athlone Town Extension No. 9. What do we find here? As far as I can see this has been vetoed by the action of the Government because here we have a letter from the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development saying that they oppose this because it will cause the influx of large numbers of Bantu in the Western Cape, should the industrialists insist on Bantu labour and allege that Coloured labour is not available. This is proof that they are not even prepared to approve the establishment of new industrial land even when a clause is incorporated that Bantu labour may not be used; because they are so aware that there is no Coloured labour and that therefore consent will have to be given to allow Bantu labour to be substituted. This area is obviously already suffering under the heavy hand of the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know from the interjection of the hon. member for Heilbron that in fact the whole country is going to feel the pressure of the dead hand of this policy because he has told us&#x2014;and there have been glimmerings in other statements from the Government side&#x2014;that in fact they are going to apply this reduction in regard to the whole country.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Of course we said so. We pointed out that the platteland was becoming blacker and blacker. We certainly say so, but we are quite able to control the position, even though it is as it is, and it is not in conflict with our policy, whereas it is clearly in conflict with theirs. Many farms are over-crowded. That is one of the points we are making. We have heard from the hon. member for Heilbron that in fact the whole country is apparently going to be put into the strait-jacket. They have been very silent so far about their plans for the rest of the country. We very much hope that in this debate we will hear further news about this.</p>

<p>In addition to the limitations that have been imposed, the effect on production and the effect on future expansion, a good deal of human hardship has been caused by this attitude. Various Natives who have been in the Western Cape for countless years have at the drop of a hat often been endorsed out in circumstances which have caused them, and often their employers, considerable hardships. This is an aspect which should not be overlooked when one is considering economic advance and prosperity. The fact remains that, despite these endorsings out, which are often of a very harsh nature, the numbers are increasing steadily.</p>

<p>We had a report in the Press the other day of what the Chief Magistrate of Johannesburg had said in his latest annual report. He said that in the last six years the number of Bantu in the Johannesburg magisterial district has risen by 230,000. At the same time the White population has increased by a mere 38,000. This was a report in the newspapers of the 16th January of this year. We know that the same position exists in Cape Town. Despite the many often very harsh endorsements out, we know that there have never been more Native people in the Cape Peninsula. We know that the position is so serious that a large <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0385"/>number of them do not have proper housing. It shows not only that their policy is failing, but also that they are not actually providing housing for the people that are coming to work here.</p>

<p>The position in regard to the farms has been dealt with by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Clearly there is going to be considerable expansion on our farms in the years ahead. Clearly, as I have indicated, the Coloureds are going to be drawn to the towns in ever-increasing numbers. With such a trend, it is absolutely clear that there will be a crisis unless the hon. the Deputy Minister is far more flexible than he likes to indicate from time to time. There is already the position that a good deal of prison labour is being used to supplement ordinary farm labour. This is a position which has to be watched.</p>

<p>This then, Sir, is the one side. We have this edict about reduction of numbers and the endorsings out. But the Government likewise has no plans about what is going to happen to these people, where they are going to be housed and where they are going to work. We heard many stories and jokes from the hon. the Deputy Minister but we heard nothing of any consequence as to where these people were going and what they were going to do. We know very well that certain of the farms in our country are already becoming overcrowded. Many farmers are prepared to accept these people back when they are sent out. They are prepared to give them a home, temporarily very often, and perhaps allow them to work a small number of days per week to keep them going. This is a situation which could become serious. We know, although he said nothing about it in this debate, that the hon. the Deputy Minister can talk a lot about border industries. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister can exaggerate enormously when it comes to border industries. He made a claim which we have already analysed to a certain extent, but it will be necessary to analyse it even more closely in due course. Among the claims he made was that there were 42,000 people who were directly taken up in border industries.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Even if one accepts that, the point is that it is perfectly possible for an industry which was established long before the border industries policy came into existence to apply for a border industry&#x2019;s advantages. This does not mean to say that it did not have most of its workers in its employ long before the border industries concept was introduced. I have been in touch with various industrialists in the border areas and I plan to get in touch with more of them. I know from their figures that the bulk of their labour was already in those border industries long before the border industries policy was introduced. But the hon. the Deputy Minister is quite reckless. He counts those as people who have been drawn into border industries employment as a result of his policy. It is entirely misleading the country. Many of those industries of course are along the Railway line running northwards from Durban. Many of those places are ideally situated for industry. Naturally many people went into employment in those industries long before this Government was in. power. This does not, however, prevent the hon. the Deputy Minister from adding up every single one that is in those industries and saying that every single one of those would under United Party policy be in the towns. The point is that many of those Natives were taken into employment in United Party days, living exactly where they are now. He claims those people are being kept in the reserves by his policy. This is the type of situation we are up against with this Deputy Minister. He is prepared to exaggerate. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude. Seven or eight years ago a leading article in a leading Nationalist newspaper stated, in words to this, effect, that if they could not reduce the number of Natives working for us, their policy would be a &#x201C;holle kreet&#x201D;&#x2014;a hollow cry. This is what this leading newspaper, much respected in Nationalist circles and in some other circles, said eight years ago, in 1957 or 1958, in a leading article. Since that time the number of Natives in our areas has gone on increasing faster and faster. There is no sign whatsoever of it stopping. I should like to know what those people must be thinking. Does this leading newspaper now believe quite finally that their policy is a &#x201C;holle kreet&#x201D;? Is it going to have the courage to come out and admit that it is a &#x201C;holle kreet&#x201D;, or is it going to hide behind its general support of the Government? I want to know how long the consciences of these people who held these views seven or eight years ago will allow them to extend this period. I am waiting to see some signs of courage from these people and for them to say: We have done a very faithful job by the Nationalist Party. We have backed them up to the hilt and beyond it about this policy, but now it is going too far. We are waiting to see when it will be too much for these people who are among the best people on the Nationalist side. Therefore I say in conclusion <span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0386"/>that there is nothing that the hon. the Deputy Minister has said which can give those people any comfort to-day. He has no plans to indicate that there is going to be a reduction. He did not dare attempt to give us any projections which will show a reduction. No wonder we will decline to support the motion that is being moved.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it will be an easy thing for me to participate in this debate, because I can simply react to points raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and by the hon. member for Pinelands. The hon. member for Pinelands touched upon quite a number of the points which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition dealt with in his speech, and enlarged on them. I shall therefore deal with his points together with those raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. However, I shall begin by dealing with a few points which only the hon. member for Pinelands made.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to make an issue of the disquiet and anxiety which both he and the hon. the Leader have alleged exist amongst the farmers, particularly in the Western Cape, in regard to labour on the farms. However, the hon. member has contradicted himself outrageously in his exposition of the position of the farmers. At the outset he maintained that the farmers in the Western Cape had insufficient Bantu labour, that they were worried and felt perturbed because they were going to get less and less Bantu labour and would ultimately have no labour with which to continue their farming activities. A little later, however, he said that the concentration of Bantu labour on certain farms was too heavy.</p>

The hon. member knows that he and I are good friends, and that I should not like to affront him. But there is one piece of advice I do want to give him: He must be much more careful when it comes to matters relating to Bantu administration because he knows dangerously little about it.</p>

<p>Less than a Week ago I granted an interview to a deputation of farmers from the Western Province here in this building, in the presence of both my Deputy Ministers and certain M.P.s who are here now, for the purpose of discussing their problems&#x2014;imagined problems in many respects&#x2014;in regard to agricultural labour.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The difficulty with the hon. member is that he is always looking for trouble, but looks for it in the wrong places because he is continually finding himself in trouble. When the meeting began I asked the farmers to tell me what their point of departure was, what the basis of their standpoint in regard to Bantu labour on farms in White areas was. They thereupon replied that there should be no doubt that they accepted the standpoint of the Government that the amount of Bantu labour in the Western Cape should gradually be reduced. They stated this flatly. That is why I want to tell hon. members on the opposite side that there is no difference on principle between the Government and the farmers on this point. Neither have I any reason to believe, Sir, that the members of the deputation belonged to one political party only, namely my own. I have good reason to believe that some of them also belonged to the United Party. They accepted the principle that the amount of Bantu labour on the farms, as is also the case in the industries in the urban areas, must gradually be reduced. After that they discussed their problems, and to a large extent their problems were based on a misunderstanding. The misunderstanding was cleared up at the meeting and it was made very clear to them that we who administer these matters&#x2014;and in particular the Deputy Minister, the departmental officials and the local authorities&#x2014;are going to differentiate very clearly, not only in agriculture but also in the industries between short-term labour, labour coming in for a few weeks only for seasonal requirements, and the long-term labour which they require. There is going to be very clear differentiation between the two kinds of labour. The industries are beginning to understand this more fully now, and the Opposition must also understand this more fully. It is one of the reasons why hon. members on the opposite side make such catastrophic errors with their figures, and the same applied to the hon. Leader of the Opposition. They take the figures and point out that in this year so many thousand were allowed into the Cape whereas there were only so many thousand last year, or else they say that so many are here at present and that last year there were only so many. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, that there is no other region in South Africa where seasonal phenomena <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0387"/>in respect of labour play such an important role as in the Western Cape. Apparently it is dawning on the hon. the Leader of the Opposition now that this is so, because he is agreeing with it.</p>

<p>It does not matter whose figures they are. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not interpreting the figures correctly; neither does he understand the background to the figures. In regard to agriculture, in regard to the industries, in regard to our local harbour, which provides a great deal of employment, it is of course the case that what we have here to a large extent is a varying labour stream. For certain months there is a great demand and then the demand suddenly subsides; that is why there will always be a greatly fluctuating number of Bantu entering and leaving the area. But what does it matter if many Bantu enter, if they are only entering for a short term to come and do the work which has to be done, only to return to their own areas or proceed to another place where there is a demand for Bantu labour?

<p>The hon. the Leader also spoke here to-day about the 5 percent reduction which we have announced. Let me tell him now that that 5 percent was not announced precipitately. It is no use his trying to heap scorn on my Deputy Minister who deals with these matters. They have been subjected to a very searching departmental examination, they have been very thoroughly dealt with at the discussions in which I participated. It was done with great care. Is the hon. the Leader aware of the implications of that 5 percent? Does he know what 5 percent means? Is 5 percent such a tremendously large demand to be made on employers? What is being required of employers is not, as the hon. the Leader wrongly stated a few weeks ago, that their labour capacity must be reduced by 5 percent, what is actually being required of them is that their Bantu labour capacity be reduced by 5 percent. What is 5 percent really? If I remind the hon. the Leader of the 5 percent now then he is once again going to try and scoff at the year 1978. What are the implications of 5 percent? The implication of 5 percent is that on a basis of an average of 5 percent per year over 20 years it will be 100 percent.</p>

<p>It does not matter who said it, the fact remains that the hon. Leader repeated it here to-day. Mr. Speaker, we have stated very emphatically that 5 percent must be regarded as an average figure. I shall be very glad, and I think we are still going to succeed in this, to be able to apply a higher percentage than 5 percent per year as this accelerated application of policy gains momentum. That is why we say 5 percent. Perhaps we will not be able to succeed in realizing as much as 5 percent in the first year&#x2014;and perhaps not even in the second either because, Sir, it is difficult to try and change gears which are moving in a certain direction into the opposite direction. Nevertheless the hon. the Leader of the Opposition &#x2014;and the same also applies to anybody else&#x2014; is making a very grave error if he tries to imply that the 5 percent rate of decrease will cause disruption. In a moment, when I come to other aspects of the industries and mention figures again, I shall adduce proof in support of my statement that a decrease of 5 percent need not cause any disruption because it is a 5 percent reduction in Bantu labour only and industrialists are quite at liberty to increase their Coloured labourers. In fact, it is a requirement that the Coloured labour must increase.</p>

<p>This 5 percent reduction was announced more specifically for the Western Cape, but it applies to the whole of South Africa. As far as I am concerned it can happen throughout South Africa, and the hon. member knows that we are pointing out, not only to industrialists but also to commercial and agricultural employers throughout South Africa that their Bantu labour ought to be in a certain proportion to White labour. I shall also have something to say about that now, in pursuance of what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands also referred here to the numerical ratio between White and Bantu workers in industries. He did so in passing only. A year or two ago my other colleagues, amongst others the Minister of Planning, and I began systematically to bring it home to the employers of South Africa that they should apply rationalization in regard to their White and Bantu and Coloured labourers in their service. It is absolutely essential and quite obvious that in the White areas of South Africa one wants proportionately less Bantu than Whites than one wants in the border industry areas of <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0388"/>White South Africa and that one also wants less there than one wants in certain other parts of the country, areas which are not necessarily classified as border industry areas, areas such as Natal which was mentioned here a moment ago by the hon. member who said that the whole of Natal was practically a border industry area. It is almost correct to say that; it is a border industry area in the broad sense of the word but not in the technical meaning of the word. The average position in South Africa to-day is that in the entire industrial network of South Africa, throughout South Africa as a whole, border industries and metropolitan industries included, the average figure is approximately 22 Bantu industries and metropolitan industries included, industrial workers for every 10 White industrial workers&#x2014;2.2 to 1. That is the average throughout the entire South Africa. I want to make it clear here that it is our standpoint that that ratio in the metropolitan areas, in the White areas of South Africa away from the border industry areas, must become more favourable as far as the Whites are concerned, and that is why I have stated repeatedly outside this House&#x2014;and I am going to repeat it here&#x2014;that, dogmatically speaking the ratio ought to be one White person to less than one Bantu in the White areas. That is the ideal position which we are striving to attain&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, I mean the metropolitan White areas. The hon. member must not waste my time with nonsensical interjections. I differentiated very carefully. The average ratio throughout the whole of South Africa is 1 White person to 2.2 Bantu, and the average ratio on the Witwatersrand is 1 to 2.2. To give the Witwatersrand its due we must state that the employment of Bantu on the Witwatersrand is at present in the region of the average figure for South Africa, and that is why we say that we must make that ratio on the Witwatersrand more favourable as far as the Whites are concerned, because the Witwatersrand is undoubtedly situated in the heart of White South Africa. That is why we say that we must stive there to attain what I called the dogmatical target, namely a ratio of one White person to less than one Bantu in those industries. It is not an impossibility.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with East London in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, very close to the Witwatersrand, in a place such as Sasolburg and, even closer, in a place such as Vanderbijlpark, new extensions in the metropolitan White area away from the border industrial areas, we already have a ratio of one White person to one Bantu in the industries there. That is the situation we want, because then we do not have preponderantly Bantu industries in the area of South Africa which ought to be a preponderantly white area. That is a simple, fundamental fact which hon. members on the opposite side must realize; and if they come to me and say that what we are striving to attain is an ideological aspiration, then I say to them that they can label it an ideological aspiration as many times as they please. It is much more than an ideological aspiration; it is an essential part of our struggle for existence in South Africa and it has very emphatic economic implications. Do hon. members want to tell me that it is not in the economic interest of South Africa, of the Whites, of the Coloureds, of the Indians and of all the Bantu nations of South Africa that there should be a stable, established, flourishing, and prosperous white community here in South Africa? Zip!</p>

<p>I come now to the interjection of the hon. member who asked, &#x201C;What about the border industries?&#x201D; As far as the border industry areas are concerned&#x2014;those areas near the borders of the Bantu homelands&#x2014;the ratio of Bantu workers to White workers there can be unrestricted.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Yeoville will listen to me now I will now give him something to ponder on. I say that it is <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0389"/>much more desirable for Bantu industrial workers to work in factories situated near the borders of the homelands and return daily, across the dividing line, to their own areas, to their wives and children, their schools and relaxation facilities and all the other amenties than that they should live in Johannesburg in compounds and go to their own areas once a year only. The hon. member and his kindred spirit sitting behind him there, can go and tell this to the Chamber of Mines and the other people who operate on that basis. But I am not accusing them; it is the Good Lord who is responsible for the mines being in Johannesburg and not in a border area; that is where the mines are and that is why the Natives have to work there.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to return to the points made here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Both the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Pinelands spoke about the increase in the number of the Bantu in the white areas and have raised that as a terrible charge against our side. Mr. Speaker, how do people multiply? No, let me be more specific: How are the Bantu, as people in South Africa, multiplying in the white area?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In the same way we do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the white areas, and I am also talking about the white areas. How are their numbers multiplying here. They are multiplying, as the hon. member for Yeoville has quite rightly stated, in the same way we do, namely by births and influx. The numbers of Bantu in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and in any white urban area, multiply in two ways, namely as a result of migration, (a movement to those areas) and by birth. Let us glance at the statistics, statistics which the &#x201C;hon. member must take into consideration. Against the background of these statistics hon. members must remember one other thing, namely the ridiculous reproach which is levelled at us so frequently that we are destroying the family life of the Bantu. Just listen to these figures: For the period 1946 to 1951, a period of five years which I shall call the first period, there are five births for every ten migrants which we have allowed to enter the urban areas throughout the whole of South Africa. During the next period, from 1951 to 1960, which covers nine years, there are almost 20 births for every ten migrants in those same urban areas. In other words the implications of this are as clear as daylight: The numerical increase in Bantu in the white urban areas is principally attributable to the increasing number of births and not to an increase in the influx. I want to remind the hon. member now of the other reproach which we hear so often, which is that we are undermining the family life of the Bantu. I admit that many of those births are not legal births, legal births in the sense that we, as Whites, judge births to be legal, but hon. members must bear in mind that Bantu have other norms and that those kind of births, which we call illegal, also occur in the homelands within their tribal and family systems. When hon. members on the opposite side talk about numerical increases then they must view these things relatively and not speak about them so absolutely, because I maintain that the machinery of influx control has over the past few years and up to now worked as well as it was physically possible for it to do and that the time has now almost arrived where influx control need not allow a single additional Bantu into the white areas because the birth machine is already supplying an ever-increasing number.</p>

<p>And the increase is continuing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side are probably going to talk about birth restriction now!</p>

<p>I come now to the interjection made by the hon. member for Yeoville who said a moment ago that the Bantu here are present on an integrationary basis. Sir, I myself have probably dealt with this matter four or five times in this House. Other members have dealt with it; my predecessor has dealt with it and the former Prime Minister dealt with it time and again. I said last year that I was afraid I would have to repeat it another 20 times; this will now be the first of those 20 times. But I am not going to deal with it again; I am just going to remind the hon. member that we said that it must be understood very fundamentally that the Bantu who are working in the industries in South Africa, on the basis of our policy as we are applying it, are not here on an integrationary basis because they are not being integrated to become equal workers, equal entrepreneurs or equal partners in our industries. They are here in the industries on another basis than that of the Whites, and the hon. member must therefore not see the numerical increase in the industries as an integrationary process. It is the presence of Bantu and that is all it is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But it is an essential presence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to enlarge very much on that point, even though I am dying to do so; it will probably have to be done again during one of those 20 times which lie ahead; I shall prefer to do it then.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that our industrial development in the cities is oppressive and undermining by not allowing the necessary Bantu to enter those areas. But what is the position? I dealt with this matter very clearly in an address I made before the Federated Chamber of Industries last year. What is the position in a complex such as the Witwatersrand? I pointed out very clearly <span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0390"/>what the position on the Witwatersand as a whole was. There are approximately 2,000 morgen of land which have already been proclaimed as industrial land and which are lying vacant, plus almost 3,000 morgen of land which has been zoned in terms of town-planning for possible industrial development. I pointed out that it had been very carefully calculated, on the basis of the standards which we have in our administration, that if that industrial land is freely utilized&#x2014;because there is no stopping that process&#x2014;for the purpose of establishing industries, and those industries employ Bantu on the same basis as has been the case up to now then there are going to be hundreds of thousands of Bantu plus their dependants, working in that 2,000 morgen and that 3,000 morgen of other land, which will mean an increase for the Witwatersrand of more than 700,000. At the moment there are approximately 500,000. It means that more Natives will enter those areas than there are at present.</p>

<p>Do the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. members for Yeoville, Hillbrow and Kensington, as Johannesburgers, want the numbers of Bantu on the Witwatersrand to be more than doubled? Now they don&#x2019;t say a word. Those are not all the implications either. There is not living room enough for those 700,000 Bantu on the Witwatersrand. There is almost insufficient residential land for the Bantu on the Witwatersrand at present. It is calculated that almost 14,000 morgen will also have to be purchased as residential area for those Bantu. Where are we going to get it from, and what will we have to pay for it? Is it economical? Mention is made in the amendment of an economic basis for decentralization. Is it good economics to purchase the most expensive land in the Witwatersrand area for an unrestricted expansion of residential land for the Bantu, or do they want us to use the limited land which is now available to build houses three stories high for the Bantu there? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must reflect before speaking so unthinkingly about these matters.</p>

<p>In regard to industrial land I want to say the following, in the limited time at my disposal, in reply to the hon. member for Pinelands. Reference was made to the vetoing of industrial sites which ought to be established here in the Peninsula. We did not brood on the matter; I rejected it and I am proud that I did so. In the Peninsula, less than two years ago, the Government allowed an additional industrial township of more than 700 acres to be established at Epping Extension No. 2. This falls under the Cape Town Municipality and is additional to the area belonging to the Divisional Council where other large pieces of industrial land are lying vacant. Is there at present a need for even more? Why are those 700 acres not enough? Why must everyone who has land which he wishes to convert into industrial land be allowed to do so when it entails a population concentration and more Bantu labour? Why should it be allowed? We say no. Up to now those matters have always been controlled on an administrative level between our Department and the Administration, but I am glad that I can hold out the prospect that it will soon be controlled by statute and not by administrative means. There will then be better control, and by that nothing more is meant than that there should be healthy development. This Government will not allow that healthy development to be retarded; neither will it allow unhealthy development.</p>

<p>In the few moments left to me I want to refer to the remarks on decentralization made in the amendment, where it is said that it should be on an economic basis. We all know that that alludes to border industries. I now want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his top economists the following question. Can they mention one example of a border industrial area or an individual industry in such an area which has up to now disturbed the economy of South Africa? There is not one such industry. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>We have heard some violent declarations from the Minister who, I think, was attempting to come to the rescue of his Deputy Minister who. in his inimitable fashion, with bluster and blah, tried to get out of the trouble into which he had got himself. I am convinced that what he has done has backfired and that he has been an embarrassment to the Cabinet. It was noteworthy that when he was being pilloried by the Leader of the Opposition there was not one smiling face anywhere on the Government benches except his own, while that of the hon. member for Paarl, was a picture.</p>

<p>We have now heard from the Minister a big sketch for South Africa from which certain points are beginning to emerge. The future development of our country in the metropolitan areas is limited only to highly developed industries, to highly technical industries tike Sasol. I want to know quite clearly from the hon. members opposite whether that is now to be the future of South Africa, that the major industrial areas on which the whole of our future is based are going to be limited only to those sorts of industry which require enormous capital, and that the number of Bantu labourers there will be reduced and limited. Our point of view is this. The Minister said&#x2019; we were &#x201C;zipped&#x201D; when he asked us a question, which was really too peurile to answer, but our idea is that the whole future of South Africa is based on the achievement of the White man in industry and the contribution made by the Black man. That feature is indispensable. I want to say that as far as I am concerned, in the 18 years this Government has been in power they have not yet taken one step forward in achieving what I would call industrial separation. We did not hear from the <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0391"/>Minister that they had made progress in this matter. We hear now from the Deputy Minister that they had made progress in this matter. We hear now from the Deputy Minister that they are going to start. After 18 years they are going to start, at a tempo of 5 percent! Surely after 18 years we have the right to expect something better from the Government which was elected on the basis of apartheid. But this afternoon we had the Deputy Minister blustering. He made all sorts of jokes, but never once did he come with a clear statement of policy as to how he would achieve anything which comes near to industrial separation. I invite those hon. members to tell us how they are going to do it. We have heard all the laughs and all the snide remarks from hon. members opposite. The Minister himself gave a few hints as to how he thought it might be achieved, but that is all. Sir, this is an economic debate and I believe we have a right to have a clear statement of economic policy from the Government as to how they intend to achieve the industrial separation which is fundamental to their policy. If it is to be carried out at all, it will be carried out on that basis. But will they tell us how they intend to do it? Because I am convinced the Nationalist Party is quite prepared to sacrifice our economy on this altar of apartheid. The Minister himself said he would bend and break economic laws in order to achieve apartheid. Sir, you know as well as I do what the result is if you bend and break economic laws. Then you have recession and depression. The reason why this has not happened in our country is because the policy of the Nationalist Party has been working in reverse. What has happened is this. Over the last 25 years we have had tremendous industrial expansion. [Interjection.] The Government was not responsible for that. What has happened is that the people of South Africa have ignored the fulminations of the Government and have gone ahead with sound industrial development, knowing that the Government is incapable of carrying out its policy. Their whole policy is a dead letter and always has been and always will be.</p>

<p>But there is something even more serious than that, namely the effect on the mind of the Bantu people of this country. They have had 18 years of rule by this Government, telling them that there will be separation, and they know that the Government has failed to achieve it. Somehow or other we will have to learn to live with that fact because it will have a profound effect on the relations between White and Black. This Government has tried for 18 years to separate White and Black and they have failed, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that they have failed. The only thing, in fact, that one can say they have achieved in relation to a territory such as the Transkei is to hand to the Bantu population of the Transkei the initiative for their future constitutional development. They have told those people that they may be independent when they are ready for it, but they are unable to control the time table. They have given for the first time since the White conquests the initiative to the Black people for their own constitutional development, and that is all they have done in 18 years, yet they seriously suggest that they have a policy which is working. [Interjection.] Why has this been done? Why has the Government played the part they have? It is because I believe they have at last come to the sticking place; they have come to the point where they have to do something, and that phrase is taken from Macbeth, when Macbeth and his wife came to the &#x201C;sticking place&#x201D; where they had to dispose of the king. The Nationalist Party is now in the same position; they have to do something to justify their 18 years of government. They have been talking to the prejudice of White South Africa, but they have refused their own people the right to discuss the rational realities of what is happening and the inevitable integration between White and Black in the industrial sphere. We on our side have had all sorts of difficulties because we have tried to find the solution, but on that side there has been nothing at all; there has been no serious discussion.</p>

<p>I say this is a gigantic confidence trick played on the people by the Nationalist Party. If that is not so, why is there this sudden burst of activity on the part of the Deputy Minister? Why does he now suddenly have to tell the people that he is going to start apartheid working? What have they been doing all the time? And what are the immediate results of this activity? There has been consternation in industry and dislocation in agriculture. There is potential unemployment among the Bantu people who are gainfully employed to&#x2014;day, if this policy is carried out. The Minister was speaking about the reduction of the number of Bantu in the urban areas. He said they are temporary labourers. How can you build an industrial society on which the future of the whole country depends when practically the whole of the labour force is regarded as temporary and as not being really there; although they live there and will always be working for you, you just pass a law and say they are not really there, and then you claim that to be the final solution of your problem. The stumbling block of the Government&#x2019;s policy has always been industry, the integration of White and Black working together. White capital and skill and the labour provided by the Black man. To&#x2014;day at last they come with some kind of an answer which they call border industries. The example of Pinetown was raised. It is and always was an industrial area. It had started to develop and it was going ahead. I remember that the hon. the Minister of Finance at the time, the ex member for Worcester, came to Pinetown to open a factory which was the fifth or sixth opened there recently. He declared to the people of Pinetown what wonderful benefits he was going to give them <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0392"/>because he was now declaring them a border area. Exactly the same thing happened at Pietermaritzburg. And I want to ask whether this policy of border industries is a serious attempt to solve the problem which we face of White and Black interacting, inevitably and for all time, in industry in this country.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. this policy envisages two things. One is the relocation of industries, next to existing concentrations of Bantu labour and the other the attraction back to those new industries as relocated industries of the present Bantu labour resident in our present metropolitan areas. The Government is committed to distorting the normal economic development of South Africa. It is committed now to giving to these areas where there is a heavy population of Bantu, the entire advantage of industrial expansion. And we heard to&#x2014;day from the hon. the Minister of Finance of the trouble and problems we are having in raising capital. We are doing this for an ideological reason, admitted by the hon. members on the other side. We have to find the money to be able to develop in these areas, the border areas, fantastic complexes of industry. But I want to examine this question of border development even a bit more closely. My hon. friend here says I am a &#x201C;skande&#x201D; for Natal. I think this policy is a &#x201C;skande&#x201D; for Natal. [Interjections.] We have it from hon. Ministers on the other side how pleased the industrial chamber of Natal were with the policy of border areas. But of course they are. It means that every single area in Natal to&#x2014;day has all the advantages which have been given by the Government to attract industry to those areas. This is money for jam.

<p>Because he is doing it for a reason which is not an economic reason. He is doing it for an ideological reason and he is trying to achieve something which he will not achieve. And in the course of it he is bending the economic development of our country in a way which can only do us harm. The idea is to create growth points. The hon. the Minister will tell us that Durban for instance, which is the major industrial area of Natal, is not a border area. [Interjections.] It is not a border area, it has not been declared a border area. It is surrounded by Kwa Mashu on the one side which is of course not a Bantu homeland and by the Umlazi mission on the other side, which is a Bantu homeland. If you go to Pinetown which is 20 miles up the road, you are in a border area, which is a natural area of industrial development. If you go to Hammarsdale which is another 15 miles up the road, you find a border area there. If you go to Pietermaritzburg, which is the capital of Natal, you will find that this is a border area.</p>

Because you have a hinterland at Hammarsdale which is completely sterile almost barren. The only asset that it has there is people. There is nothing else.

<p>Sure. There are factories at Hammarsdale. Will the hon. member tell me what sort of a growth point is being created amongst the Bantu people living at Hammarsdale which is the purpose of the border industrial development. [Interjections.] Will he please tell us that. Because I want to know. This is the solution to the problem. This is not something which they are doing for fun. This is the solution of the problem of the relationship between White and Black in South Africa whereby that hon. member is going to separate and achieve this magnificent idea of apartheid which this Government has been striving to achieve for 18 years. It is almost 19 years now. I have come to the conclusion that the whole policy on which the Government is basing this, is merely a pattern of words, a paper tiger, as the Chinese call the Americans. There is no reality in this. The great industrial concentration will continue to expand. It must continue to expand. The areas that are being developed as border areas are natural areas of industrial development, in so far as Natal is concerned. The area of Pietermaritzburg has 1,000 acres of rail served land. It has that and it has just recently been developed. But now what is happening is this. We are being told that the Bantu who live there and work there and who have always lived there and who have always worked there, are in a sense being repatriated. [Interjections.] These are people who, were it not for the hon. the Deputy Minister, would have been living in White areas. And we had a figure quoted here of 600,000 Bantu. And I remember the &#x201C;hoor&#x2014;hoors&#x201D; from hon. members on the opposite side, when the hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned it last time. What a magnificent achievement. But let us look at these figures a little more closely. The investment in border industries amounts to R300 million <span class="col_751-752" refersTo="page_0393"/>and employment for roughly 41,000 Bantu. That is an impressive total, namely 41,000 Bantu. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are also the secondary activities such as construction, trading and the provision of services which normally provide for employment for twice as many persons.</block>

<p>So, we have 40,000 plus twice as many persons, which gives a figure of 120,000 people, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister. To that is then added plus minus five members as dependants, which gives you your 600,000 people who are retained in the border areas and who would otherwise normally have been living in the White areas. But. let us look at the figure of 41,000. Are all those people for instance breadwinners? Are they heads of families? Of what nature are the industries established in the border areas if not largely textile? Who are the people that work in the textile mills? Are they men or are they women? Are they heads of families, are they regarded as people who have five dependants each? Do they in fact add up to 120,000 people? And then you get the statement in regard to a secondary activity such as construction. I should like someone opposite, for instance the hon. member for Heilbron, to tell me what construction is going on in the area behind Hammarsdale, for instance, which is going to absorb two for every one person working within that area.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister did not say he was not counting the people at Hammarsdale. We know very well why they could not go ahead. He did not say that. He claimed all those people, every one of them. He said those were the people, 600,000 of them. But he did not say out of these there were 41,000 some of whom were not heads of families or that some of them did not count, that there are no secondary activities such as construction, trading and the provision of services. This is not taking place. Mr. Speaker, I believe that the whole of this claim made by the hon. the Deputy Minister about the 600,000&#x2014;in a more recent speech he said it was a million&#x2014;is absolute nonsense. I believe this is something regarding which he has no claim at all. Beyond that, the hon. the Deputy Minister and his Minister have set out to try and remake the whole of South Africa in the image of apartheid. They have set out to rebuild the whole of South Africa. Everything we know has to be changed, it has to go back into a new pattern; otherwise apartheid is meaningless. But the whole policy is falling down because they are unable it carry it out [Interjections.] The hon. member says it is wishful thinking. I invite that hon. member to get up and tell us just exactly where this policy is working in the way it was intended to work&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Economic Affairs are going all out to achieve new industrial development. They will look for new factories in every single country in Europe and in Japan, if they can get them. And every factory that goes up in any of our metropolitan areas employs far more Blacks than Whites. In fact, every expansion that takes place is bound hand and foot to the employment of more and more Bantu labourers. The hon. members can never escape from that fact.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Mooirivier confined himself to border industries and he said that the Bantu working in those industries had always been there and that no resettlement of Bantu had been entailed. I now want to furnish him with a few figures I have obtained from the Department after I had made careful inquiries into the matter, figures which may perhaps speak volumes to him if he only cares to examine them closely. I said to <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0394"/>the Department: Let me have the number of inhabitants resettled in Bantu townships to date. That is to say, not in Bantu locations, but in Bantu townships&#x2014;townships situated in the Bantu homelands and Bantu resettled in those townships from White areas. According to the figure I obtained from the Department 193,985 persons were resettled up to that date (24th August. 1966). My second question was: Let me have the number of persons employed in border industries. The figure furnished to me on 24th August, 1966, was 53.500 persons, of whom 4,000 occupied high&#x2014;ranking posts.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have just said that I asked the Department specifically to try to get those figures for me. Surely you know that those townships fall under the control of the Department. After all, we know how many workers there are in those townships. The Department does have those figures at its disposal. I mention them for the information of the hon. member. I also asked the Department: Let me have the number of persons who are settled in townships on the borders of the Bantu areas and who work in White areas in industries which are not considered border industries by the Department of Commerce and Industries. That hon. member will know that there are many urban areas which adjoin Bantu areas and which are not classified as border industry areas by the Department of Commerce and Industries because, those areas will then get the benefits applicable to border industries. Durban, amongst others, is one of them. The same holds good for a number of other places, and the figures I got was 83,595 workers. All these are people who have been resettled from the White areas and who are living in the Bantu areas now, but who are working in the border industries&#x2014;that is, industries in the White areas. Is that not a measure of separation brought about as a result of that? Does not that figure serve as proof that the policy is being carried out? But what is more, the hon. the Deputy Minister furnished the hon. member with the figure on a previous occasion and one can accept that those workers are the heads of families. Usually they are heads of families&#x2014;and we can accept that they are the heads of average&#x2014;sized families. For those who are not heads of families there are other families consisting of more than five members, so that one can accept this figure of five as the average for each family. If one takes that figure as the average and multiplies it by the number of workers, one will see how many Bantu are already being resettled in this way through the implementation of our policy of Border industries.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with another point as well. I do not think it is necessary for me to give so much attention to that hon. member. I want to come to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who started off his speech by referring to the Tomlinson Report. He said that there were such large numbers of Bantu in the towns and in the White areas because we had rejected the Tomlinson Report. He said that the position might perhaps have been different if we had carried out the recommendations of the Tomlinson Report. I now want to quote him a few figures from that Tomlinson Report. The Tomlinson Report recommended that an amount of Â£10&#x00BD; million be spent on development in the Bantu areas annually. He agrees with me that that was the figure they had given, that is R21 million per year. Over a period of ten years it would have amounted to R210 million. Over a period of five years it would have amounted to R105 million. Now what is the real position after five years? Over the last five years, up to 1966, we spent&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give you the figure for the last five years. Surely that will be enough for you? After all, we did not discuss the Tomlinson Report ten years ago. We discussed it in this House only six years ago. But let me now give you the figures for the last five years. Up to 1966 we spent R135 million. That amounts to R27 million per year, which means R6 million per year more than the amount recommended by the Tomlinson Report.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is only in respect of development. I want to give the hon. Leader of the Opposition the figures in respect of land purchases as well. The figure for land purchases exceeded the figure recommended by the Tomlinson Report by far. The hon. member need only to look at the estimates of the last five or six years. I want to make a statement here this afternoon, and I shall try to prove that statement. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated here this afternoon that it would be impossible for us to have economic development in South Africa unless we also had a large measure of integration, in other words, unless we employed a large quantity of Bantu labour. I want to say that that statement is quite untrue if we view it in the light of the history of South Africa.</p>

<p>The first statement I want to make is that industrial development in South Africa is not being paralysed and impeded by the restricting of Bantu labour. His statement was that intensification of labour in the country would ensure industrial progress. I am now going to quote figures to show that that is not the case. I want to refer to our large cities, namely Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Germiston and Benoni. Those are the cities where the greatest industrial development took place during the last three decades in South Africa, and I do not think the hon. member can deny that. I now want to quote the figures for those cities only. In 1921 there were 242,000 Bantu males in the cities which I have mentioned, which cities constitute the metropolitan areas where most of our industrial development has taken place. Factory production in those cities amounted to R53 million at that time. In 1936, that is to say, 15 years later, there were 398,000 Bantu males in those cities&#x2014;I do not say they were employed there&#x2014;and factory production then amounted to R105 million. Factory production, therefore, increased by 99 percent during that period, while the number of Bantu males in the cities increased by only 64 percent. Let me now take the next period, namely the period from 1936 to 1951. During that period the number of Bantu males increased to 658,000, while industrial production increased to R555 million. The production therefore increased by 425 percent, while the number of Bantu males increased by 66 percent. The increase in the number of Bantu and the increase in industrial expansion are absolutely out of proportion. The next period I want to deal with, is the period from 1951 to 1960, during which time the number of Bantu males increased to 821,500, which represents an increase of 25 percent, while the industrial production <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0395"/>increased to R1,125 million, an increase of 102 percent.</p>

<p>The statement I now make is that our industrial development in these metropolitan areas has not taken place as a result of labour intensification, but as a result of the capital intensification which took place in those cities. Capital intensification is the reason for the development of our industries. I say&#x2014;and I say it with emphasis&#x2014;that increasing prosperity does not require increasing integration as hon. members opposite want to suggest.</p>

<p>I now want to make a second statement. The Opposition suggests that the Bantu are being urbanized because of the employment of Bantu in the cities, in other words, that there is a direct correlation between the number of Bantu in the cities and the number of Bantu labourers in the cities. I have given the number of Bantu males, the male population, in those cities. In 1921 only 61,000 out of the 242,000 Bantu males in those cities were employed in the manufacturing industry. In 1936 there were 398,000 males, that is to say an increase of 64 percent, while employment in the factories increased by 90 percent. In 1951 the male population increased by 60 percent, while industry expanded by 215 percent. And now I want to quote an important figure, namely the figure relating to the period from 1951 until 1960. Over that period industrial employment decreased by 4.4 percent, and that was the very period when the great industrial upsurge took place in South Africa, an upsurge which is continuing to this day. I repeat, Sir: Since this Government came into office the number of Bantu males in industry has decreased by 4.4 percent, while the number increased by 215 percent prior to our coming into power.</p>

<p>I want to stress once again that increasing prosperity does not mean increasing integration or increasing employment of Bantu as is alleged by that side of this House.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with another statement, and here we must view the factor of urbanization in its entirety, namely the correlation between the number of female Bantu in the cities and the increase of the number of Bantu in the cities. We would do well to have a look at that. In quoting his figures the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made no allowance for the part played in this respect by the natural increase in population. I now want to quote figures in respect of two cities, Pretoria and Port Elizabeth. In 1951 the number of Bantu females in Pretoria increased by 43 percent, while in 1960 there was an increase of 63.3 percent. In Port Elizabeth the increase was 49 percent in 1951, while it was 75.8 percent in 1960. Sir, it therefore means that the number of Bantu females in our cities increased by 242 percent from 1921 to 1936. From 1936 to 1951 it increased by 171 percent. From 1951 to 1960 they increased by 63 percent. I have to draw attention once again to the decrease in these numbers since we came into power in 1948. From 1951 to 1960 there was only a slight increase of 63 percent, but in the preceding periods the figures were 242 percent and 171 percent.</p>

<p>What part does the Bantu female population play in the cities now? The hon. the Minister has already furnished the relevant figures, namely that while there is an increase of one through immigration, the natural increase is 20.That is the increase in the number of females in the cities. The United Party never wants to look at these figures. But this is the party which is always, night and day and at every meeting they have, talking about this evil Government that wants to destroy the family life of the Bantu. They want to see the tendency of the influx of female Bantu to the cities increase. The increase of the number of Bantu in the cities will then be much higher still.</p>

<p>I also want to mention that the natural increase in the number of Bantu males in the cities was only 3.6 percent from 1946 to 1951, but as far as Bantu females were concerned, the figure was 6.5 percent. The corresponding figures for the period 1951 to 1960 were 3.5 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. Over the past ten years the number of Bantu females in the cities increased by 121,600, while the number of Bantu males increased by 83,000. Natural increase is the most important factor as far as the increase in the number of Bantu in the White areas is concerned.</p>

<p>I now want to make a further statement, namely that the pegging of Bantu labour bears no relation to our industrial development, and I should like to quote a few figures in that regard. In 1951 industrial production amounted to R615 million, and there were 345,000 Bantu labourers, which constituted 54 percent of the labour market. In 1960 industrial production amounted to R 1,051 million and there were 357,000 Bantu labourers, which represented a total increase of 11,500 labourers in manufacturing industry over that period under our r&#x00E9;gime. These are the only statistics available in this connection. The increase in the number of Bantu over this period is negligible compared with the increase over the periods preceding it. Over a period of 12 years there was an increase of 10 percent in the number of Bantu workers, not only in manufacturing industry, but generally, while there was a 100 percent increase in the output of the manufacturing industry. Therefore I say that the two figures cannot be correlated; the increase in the number of Bantu in the cities bears no relation to the industrial development in South Africa, and the sooner the hon. Leader of the Opposition and his party realize this, the sooner they will realize what is being done to carry out our policy here in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to mention one more point, because it was also mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if not in this House this afternoon, then on some other occasion. He said that we were allowing the White rural areas to become Black. We heard another <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0396"/>complaint from him this afternoon. We heard the complaint that the faremrs had no labour. I asked him by way of interjection: &#x201C;You say the farmers are complaining that they have no labour; is that the case throughout South Africa?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;Yes, that is so; now we know where inflation comes from, because the wages of all labourers have to be increased now.&#x201D; But is he not the one who always says that the White rural areas are gradually becoming blacker and that there are too many Black people in the rural areas? Mr. Speaker, I again want to quote him figures in connection with the number of workers in the White rural areas so that we may see what the true state of affairs is. The number of Whites in the rural areas has decreased to 13 percent of the total population. Earlier the Whites in the rural areas represented 27 percent of the total population. That percentage has decreased to 13 percent, but over that same period the production of the rural areas has increased threefold. This presents a different picture. But let us see how many Bantu are employed in the rural areas: In 1936, 463,000 Bantu were employed in the rural areas; in 1951 there were 572,000, an increase of slightly more than 100,000 over the whole of that period. Whereas the number of Bantu was 572,000 in 1951, it decreased to 557,000 in 1960, but increased to 646,000 in 1962. Because I am concerned with farm labour and because I have close contact with it, I want to make the statement here this afternoon that there is no such thing as a shortage of farm labour in South Africa. There is sufficient farm labour available in South Africa, but Bantu labour is being incorrectly utilized on a very large scale in South Africa, and I think the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Unions are fully aware of that, and are therefore cooperating with this Department to remedy that state of affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from speeches made by leaders on the Government side it is clear to all of us that the Government does have certain forceful intentions. Nobody would dispute the fact that it has good intentions, from its own point of view, but I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on this side have demonstrated quite as effectively that the results are showing a constant tendency to be contrary to the intentions. So far in this debate we have dealt mainly with the position of the Bantu in what we call the White areas. No one on this side is satisfied with the account that has been rendered of that. But I think it is time we went further and also called for an account in the wider sphere of the Government&#x2019;s Bantu policy, particularly as regards the progress made in the development of the Bantu reserves. When we ask the Government to render account of its policy in this House, the counter&#x2014;question always comes back at us: Where do you stand; what are you planning; what is your policy? Mr. Speaker, as far as the Bantu areas are concerned the question has been answered repeatedly in this House. [Interjections.] As recently as the previous session. Let me quote what I said only last year during the last debate in this House. I am referring specifically to the development of the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Have you reached the stage where you are quoting yourself?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not quoting myself at all. If the hon. the Prime Minister had listened carefully, he would have heard that I said that we had set out our attitude repeatedly, and last session I quoted the attitude of the Party, as it was declared officially, in this House. To refresh the memory of the hon. the Prime Minister, I want to do so again before I come to the point where I shall call the Government to account on its attitude. When the report of the Tomlinson Commission was published early in 1956, the United Party set out its attitude as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reserves must be developed on the general lines proposed in the Tomlinson Commission report. From a legislative point of view it envisages the delegation of varying powers to different areas, depending on their state of development.</block>

<p>At that time the Opposition adopted the attitude that it associated itself with the broad policy set out in the report of the Tomlinson Commission. There can be no doubt about that. What is more, in 1961 the United Party declared its policy as regards the Bantu areas in even clearer terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe in large&#x2014;scale and speedy economic, social and constitutional development of the Bantu areas, with the assistance of White capital, initiative and skill&#x2026; with full protection of the interests of the Bantu in those areas.</block>

<p>Note well, Mr. Speaker, that the statement of policy is absolutely clear. It rests on three principles: Number one, the energetic development, economically and constitutionally, the Bantu areas; secondly, in order to achieve that, the application of free capital and White skill, and thirdly, the protection of the interests of the Bantu in the Bantu areas. There can therefore be no doubt about the attitude of this side in that regard. If the question is asked: &#x201C;What ultimate aim is being pursued?&#x201D;, there can be no doubt about that either. The United Party has stated repeatedly that it has a federative approach with regard to the ultimate position of the Bantu areas. The Government members advocate a commonwealth, but the commonwealth proposed by them is vague; it is incomplete, and the details of the ultimate relationship between the Bantu areas and the rest have never been stated clearly to the country by the Government. We advocate a federative unit on the clear <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0397"/>principle of co-operation between ourselves and the Bantu areas, as they develop, without domination of one by the other. I am just mentioning this because I do not consider this an occasion for a discussion of an academic nature. We have not come anywhere near the stage where a decision has to be taken on the independence of a territory and on its relationship with the centre in South Africa. For that reason it is not on this point that I want to conduct a debate. We are interested in the immediate aims. Let us deal with those.</p>

<p>This is the position. The Government has now been in power almost 19 years. For the first seven years Bantu policy on that side was virtually static, because it then had the excuse that there was a Tomlinson Commission and that we would have to wait until it had published its report. Thus seven years passed, and in March, 1956, the Commission&#x2019;s report was available. But now a further 11 years have passed since the report was published, and for four of those 11 years the Transkei has had self&#x2014;government in the present form. What is the result of all that? After 11 years the Commissioner&#x2014;General of the Transkei, Mr. Hans Abraham, had to come and demand a commission of inquiry to investigate what had become of the recommendations of the Commission and to what extent they had been implemented. This is what Mr. Abraham asked (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Abraham pleaded for a commission of inquiry to determine to what extent the accepted principles of the Tomlinson Commission Report had been implemented, and what means were to be used to effect the more rapid development of the Bantu. (<i>Die Burger</i>, 2.1.67.)</block>

<p>Just imagine it, Sir. What Mr. Abraham tried to say here in a very subtle fashion was that there was something wrong. This is an accusation that there is something wrong, that the time has come for a commission to find out what is wrong that the development of the Bantu areas is not more rapid. He is not the only one. I do not want to read a lengthy series of quotations, but there is another who had been a Bantu Commissioner, Professor Johannes Bruwer, who levelled the same kind of criticism against the Government. At present there is hardly a political commentator in South Africa on that side of politics who does not complain that the development of the Bantu areas is not sufficiently rapid. All of them say that the rate at which the Bantu areas are developing is such that there is no hope of the Government&#x2019;s succeeding in its policy. In 11 years there has been only one territory, and that the easiest of all, because the Transkei is the only unified area. In 11 years only one area was handled in such a way that it shows signs of becoming a state. [Interjection.] For the rest there are very few signs of progress. As far as all those areas are concerned, they may in the main be called economic slums. Their development is so inadequate that the inhabitants are forced to seek a living outside the Bantu areas. That is the crux of the problem. I think it is time we called the Government to account and achieved clarity, firstly, on the political progress of the Transkei after four years. From time to time we read reports on leaders in the Transkei who state that they will ask the Government to hand over greater powers. We should like to ask the Government whether that is the case, and when it will happen. Four years have passed. Now let us hear what further progress is being planned. Everywhere overseas the Transkei is represented as the model item of the Government&#x2019;s policy, as the spearhead of the formation of a commonwealth of free nations in South Africa. When shall we reach the stage where the Government will be able to show the world the practical fruits of its policy and to say: Here the commonwealth is now taking shape? Can the Government tell us when it expects to reach that stage? We hear continually that the Government party is a radical party with radical solutions, but really, if one sees how little progress is being made with its policy, it does seem to me that the emphasis falls on the threadbareness rather than on the radical nature of its policy (&#x201C;die kaalheid van sy radikaalheid&#x201D;).</p>

<p>But in the second place we should like to have a report on the progress made with the emancipation of the other Bantu areas. We know more or less how far the Transkei has got, but what is the position of the others? How far have we got with the other seven or eight? Surely, after 19 years in power the Government should now be able to give the country somewhat more clarity on its policy. Can they now tell us exactly how many other states, similar to the Transkei, there will be? Can they tell us that after 19 years? Can they tell us how much progress they expect to make in the immediate future? Some years ago the previous Minister of Bantu Administration, Mr. De Wet Nel, had an interview with a man who is now the hon. member for Turf&#x2014;fontein. In the course of that interview Mr. De Wet Nel made it quite clear&#x2014;that was in 1964&#x2014;that it would be only a year or two before Tswanaland would become the next country to advance to political maturity and to become the second self&#x2014;governing Bantu state. We have heard rumours of Zululand being on the point of following the model of the Transkei, and also the Ciskei. It is now three years since reports appeared in newspapers about the Ciskei&#x2019;s request that it wanted to make the progress that had been made by the Transkei. We hear nothing. There is a policy on paper, but where are the practical results? If one inquires about that, one hears nothing, and one gets the impression that the Government is engaged in a puppet&#x2014;show. The results will not come. Furthermore, I think it is time they rendered account to us on the question of consolidation. Eleven years ago the Tomlinson Commission made certain <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0398"/>recommendations and the Government accepted those recommendations and said that in principle it was in favour of consolidation. I would not pretend that there has not been some consolidation here and there, but it is certainly not enough for the purpose of the Government&#x2019;s policy. In terms of the 1936 Act a further 1.6 million morgen of land has to be purchased for the Bantu. We want to know what progress is being made in that regard. Time is running out. Let the Government come and tell us: &#x201C;This year we have tackled this, and there has been this or that progress.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No, I do my homework to my own satisfaction. But I want to come to the crucial question, the major question to which we should like a reply, and that is the question of the economic development of those areas, the question of White initiative for development inside the Bantu areas. By this time I think it should be clear to everybody that this side of the House adopted the correct course and the correct attitude from the outset, that if there is to be any question at all of the development of the Bantu areas, that development must take place inside those areas. There is simply no other way. There can be no real development unless free capital is admitted. That is impossible. In fact, the crucial concept on which the appointment of the Tomlinson Commission hinged, the crux of the entire inquiry, was the question of what schemes could be devised to keep the maximum number of Natives inside the Bantu areas. That was the true objective of the Tomlinson Commission. The Government has failed objectively in that purpose. The Government has not succeeded in keeping the maximum there, and why not? There is the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I quote: &#x201C;The development and planning of the Transkei is aimed at enabling the area to support the entire Xhosa people.&#x201D; The reason why I quoted this statement, which was published in <i>Die Transvaler</i> on 3rd November last year, is purely to point out what the intention is, and to measure the results by that. The objective of the Commission was to see how the maximum number of Natives could be kept in the Bantu areas. The majority of the Commission, and that included the previous Minister recommended that if one wanted to attain that object, it was essential that one should allow free White capital to assist in its development. In fact, no political commentator in the country nowadays adopts any other attitude. From no one, not even in this House, have I heard a sound reason why White capital should not be allowed to assist in that development. What is more, there is not one Bantu leader who is not in favour of that. Even three years ago the Chief Minister of the Transkei said that if the Government did not allow White capital, it would be vain to think that Native capital could develop the Transkei properly. Recently a new body was established which claims that it represents 7,000 prominent Bantu, and which demands that free capital should be admitted. The Bantu themselves want it, but the Government closes the door to it. Prosperity will have to be distributed more evenly&#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question? Must the free capital to which the hon. member has referred be admitted to the Bantu areas for investment with a view to development regardless of any control or regardless of any share the Bantu will have in it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to that question later. I am coming to that. Mr. Speaker, we believe that prosperity must be distributed more evenly in South Africa if we want peace and quiet in this country. Every time we speak of White capital to assist in the development, the Government raises the question of border industries. There is no objection to the decentralization of industries. It is a sound and healthy principle and no one has any objection to it. But I want to bring the charge that in a certain sense border industries militate against the development of Bantu areas. How will the Bantu be trained in the economic sphere if he always has to work on this side of the border, where he is subject to legal restrictions and where his work prospects are limited? How will he develop if he always has to work on this side of the <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0399"/>border? How can there be any development if all the economic advantages and development are always on the White side? How on earth can one hope to develop the Bantu areas in that way? How can they develop if the Xhosa in the Transkei, for example, must always remain a labourer on this side of the border? If anything can be called economic colonialism, it is this system of border industries, in view of their underlying aims. No one can point a finger at economic decentralization as such, but this is economic colonialism. It is time hon. members on that side told us the real reason why the Bantu areas cannot be allowed to develop by means of free White capital. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>On the Tomlinson Commission there were only two officials who tried to give an explanation, namely Mr. Young and Mr. Prinsloo. They offered the excuse that &#x201C;White spots&#x201D; would arise if free White capital were admitted. But can anyone envisage a position where there will be no &#x201C;White spots&#x201D; in a territory like the Transkei? Surely, as soon as the Transkei becomes independent, it is going to follow the same course as Lesotho and Botswana. It can be accepted here and now that as soon as the Transkei becomes independent, it will become &#x201C;non&#x2014;racial&#x201D;: a non-apartheid state just like Lesotho and Botswana. Why the pretended concern about &#x201C;White spots&#x201D;? The more territorial separation there is, the more the apartheid area will shrink. The Government will not be able to stop that. We saw what happened as regards education. The Minister wanted to guide Bantu education in the Transkei in a certain direction. The moment the Xhosa attained control over education, they guided it in a different direction. To worry and to have an obsession about &#x201C;White spots&#x201D; in the Transkei is a waste of time.</p>

<p>As regards the fear that the Whites will then make certain demands there, surely it goes without saying that if a White industrialist invests money there he must invest it in the knowledge that he is doing so on the terms of the Transkei. But the important consideration is the fact that the entire existing policy became obsolete when Lesotho and Botswana were liberated. At present South Africans are at liberty to go to Lesotho and to invest and help there. In fact, South Africans are now taking the lead in the economic field in territories like Lesotho. Surely the old story that that is economic colonialism and exploitation is nonsensical. Surely that argument is not valid, particularly not if the authorities of Lesotho and the Transkei ask for assistance. Surely there can then be no question of economic colonialism. In any event, are we to assume that if Frenchmen invested in South Africa, if they helped South Africa to develop, it would mean economic colonialism? No more would it mean economic colonialism if we helped to develop the Transkei. It is a poor argument to say that it will mean exploitation. I admit that new states are sensitive, and that is why we adopted the attitude from the outset that certain protective measures should be taken in the interests of the Bantu. I mentioned that as our third principle. But that is precisely what the Tomlinson Commission also recommended, namely that because it was a young state, protective economic measures should be taken. That can be done in various ways, there are many ways in which protection can be afforded&#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course, the investment is made according to ordinary economic rules. One makes a voluntary decision. One may freely accept the terms offered. There is no interference on the part of the Government. That is free capital, Sir. If a French or British undertaking decided to invest here, it would have to adapt itself to the South African laws, but it is free to enter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course, but there are ways and means of doing that. The man who devised the most successful recipe is Dr. Anton Rupert, with his industrial partnership. There is the case of a South African wholesale undertaking, Moshal Gevisser, which is now going to establish an organization in Lesotho with 50 percent of the shares in their hands and 50 percent in Lesotho&#x2019;s. Why cannot that system be adopted in respect of our own Bantu areas? Not so long ago the <i>Financial Mail</i> gave some very interesting examples of what could be done to achieve the object of rapid development whilst simultaneously affording protection to local people, for example the stipulation that companies must be registered there instead of being subsidiaries of companies in the Republic. The crucial consideration is that without White economic co&#x2014;operation of some kind or other, those areas will never develop to the point&#x2026; [Interjections.] Up to this stage the entire policy has been nothing but a puppet&#x2014;show. There are all indications that the entire concept of separate freedoms, which they advocate so clamorously, will never get any further. Only recently one of the Government newspapers said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crux of the question remains. Do we, the voters of South Africa, really want to implement the policy for which we vote every few years? If so, then we may well in larger numbers render practical, visible proof of our desire. (<i>Die Beeld</i>)</block>

<p>That is our complaint, Sir. A policy is advocated here, but if one calls for account one finds that the results, not only in respect of <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0400"/>the matters mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but also in respect of the crucial question of the development of the Bantu areas, are in contrast to the forceful intentions of the Government. For that reason we are fully justified in supporting the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, in which we censure the lack of results on the part of the Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the latest election I once attended a meeting held by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He made the statement there that he had undertaken a journey to the country and found that the United Party was growing stronger, stronger than ever before, and that it was growing from day to day. Now, I do not want to accuse the hon. the Leader of not being a political expert. Nor do I want to accuse him of having intended to mislead the people. I think I just misunderstood him. I think that what he actually meant that evening, was that the United Party was growing like the tail of a cow&#x2014;downwards. If it continues growing that way, it will soon be like a lean cow in winter. It will be down on the ground. That is why I find it very interesting that we have recently had the strange phenomenon of two hon. members&#x2014;not the Leader of the Opposition, but two other members&#x2014;announcing the policy of the Opposition from time to time. I am referring to the hon. member for Orange Grove and the hon. member who has just sat down. It is very clear to me now why the United Party is going backwards. Before I deal with what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has said to-day, I should just like to refer to a few things he and, shortly after him, the hon. member for Orange Grove said in the no confidence debate last year. In that no confidence debate these two hon. members spoke consecutively. I just want to read out to you what the hon. member for Orange Grove said of the Government. He accused the Government of having no basic policy and of not knowing what they were standing for. He said (Hansard, Volume 17, col. 59)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is their basic political philosophy? When one visits other Western countries, one gets answers which are consistent with the modern language of political science. A party leader or a party member in any other overseas country, in the West, is able to tell you that his party is a socialist party, or that his party&#x2019;s policy is democracy, or free enterprise.</block>

<p>He said further that we did not even have true nationalism any more. He went on (Hansard. Vol. 17, col. 60)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So I could go on mentioning examples of how they do not even have any consistent and far-sighted plan as regards the colour policy. In fact, their own people, their own intellectualists, are telling them that they are no longer making progress. Yes, indeed, &#x201C;major apartheid&#x201D; is dead&#x2026;</block>

<p>So he went on. Then he kept on telling us that the National Party had no policy. Strangely enough, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout rose immediately after him. This is what he said at the time: &#x201C;As I have already stated, we are already a country with a State dogma.&#x201D; One moment we have no policy and the next we are governed by a State dogma. He said further (Hansard, Vol. 17, col. 73)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are already classed amongst the &#x201C;-ism&#x201D; countries. And irrespective of whether they tend towards the left or towards the right, they are all birds of a feather. A system becomes your master.</block>

<p>No policy, but in the meantime a system has become our master. In his speech he proceeds to prove that South Africa has become an &#x201C;-ism&#x201D; country now. If a party permits such men to make their statements of policy, it is dangerous. Then it is very easy to understand why the United Party is growing downwards. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout once again stated the policy of the United Party to-day. He told us that he wanted to tell us what their policy was. Unfortunately he did not tell us that it was the umpteenth policy being stated for the umpteenth time. To-day he made certain statements of policy here, very clear statements of policy. However, he did not refer to certain statements of policy made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville. He did not tell us whether they still stood by those statements of policy, or whether they had deviated altogether from those statements of policy. I can understand why the hon. member for Orange Grove, when he made a speech in the no confidence debate this year, did not once ask for television. I think he pictured to himself how dangerous it would be, because if the hon. member for Yeoville appears on television and starts making statements of policy, it will be extremely dangerous for the United Party. The hon. member who just sat down, made certain statements in the course of his speech to-day. The hon. member is not here at present, but I hope he returns because I want to respond to certain things he said. He told us that Mr. Abraham had supposedly admitted&#x2014; I think he referred to his address to the Rapportryers of Port Elizabeth&#x2014;that our policy had been a failure up to now. If the hon. member had read that report, he would have seen that Mr. Abraham had said the opposite. He said that we had been so successful in our policy and that we had to such an extent created the basic possibilities for the development of the Bantu homelands, that we now had to accentuate another aspect of the development, namely the development of the individual himself. Surely, the potential for the individual is created first. If the individual does not utilize that, we must develop that individual. Why distort a person&#x2019;s very logical and very practical statement and give such a slanted version of what the man has said? I believe that if anybody knows what is being done in the Transkei, then it is Mr. Abraham, because <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0401"/>he lives there and he is very closely connected with the work being done there. It is also for this reason that he said he thought that this phase had advanced so far that another aspect could be emphasized now. We need not concern ourselves any further about pouring money into it at such a fast rate, because the potential and the possibilities, are there. According to him we should now pay attention to the human factor so as to help the Bantu to help himself, to develop his own possibilities as far as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member made the strange statement here that we had already had 18 years in which to do certain things and to prove the practicability of our policy. Does the hon. member know in what condition we took over the country 18 years ago, or has he forgotten that? Does he know what the policy was? Does he know what the course was? Does he remember the conditions which existed in this country? Owing to their policy our entire country was heading for total racial integration. Those conditions had to be broken down first. It took us years to put a stop to those conditions and to check them. The hon. member really made a ridiculous statement. When we took over, Whites and Bantu alike lived in the same residential areas. We started clearing the Bantu slums, and that was a tremendous task. Do hon. members on the other side still remember Cato Manor and the other Bantu locations? Does that hon. member still remember the tremendous task we had in clearing their slums and providing those Bantu with proper houses in which they could lead a decent life? Surely, it was not possible to start developing the individual, to start with a positive policy, under the conditions in which the previous government had left this country. I see the hon. the Leader of the Opposition shaking his head. But, surely, he is no stranger in Jerusalem. After all, the hon. the Leader did drive past Windermere at times. Surely he remembers the shanty-town which everybody was ashamed to admit was part of South Africa. We remember the conditions we had to clear before we could start with something positive, something constructive.</p>

<p>We had to provide proper housing on a segregated basis. It cost the State millions of pounds at that time. We had to undertake an armament programme. I still recall the terrible condition in which our army was. We had to build up an army in this country so as to enable us to defend ourselves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, but I should like to finish my speech in the time I have at my disposal. We had a task, and after we had checked the worst conditions, this Government started with investigations. Previously it was not within our power to appoint government commissions to determine policy and to spend money. The Tomlinson Commission was appointed as soon and as timeously as possible. After all, it takes time to plan. What did the Opposition do in this direction during all the years they had been in power? Nothing. They destroyed, they let things slide, they allowed matters to take their own course. That was their policy, and at times things also went slightly awry. At times things went seriously wrong, and hon. members on the other side know this, surely. Why do they reproach us now by asking us what we have accomplished over the past 18 years? Let me tell hon. members that it took us almost nine years to stem the tide of destruction, before we could start on constructive planning. After that we came with planning, which also took time. Subsequent to that we had to struggle to become a republic, to put race relations in our country in order and on a sound basis. All of these were tasks we had to dispose of first, and only then could we start building, only then could we start with constructive development. As is often the case, it also took us a few years before we were in step in this respect.</p>

<p>That is why I say, Sir, that this Government has reason to feel very proud. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister, the hon. the Deputy Ministers and their Departments on the miracles they have performed. I think that if we take everything into account, the Opposition ought to blush to the roots of their hair for daring to criticize this Minister and his Deputy Minister, while they know in what a chaotic condition they left this country and how, as regards its race relations, they had steered this country to the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that economic development only occurred on the White side of the reserves. He intimated that that was robbery. He also referred to our border industries. The hon. member has probably never heard of the Bantu Development Corporation. That is merely an initial stage. We are pouring money into the reserves on a large scale. We have made those people viable. We are helping them to make a beginning. One cannot make something from nothing, cannot create out of thin air. It is not in our power to do such a thing. We must build, we must build on the ruins in which the Opposition left this country. Out of that chaos and fiasco we must build a future now.</p>

<p>This side of the House has a policy, Mr. Speaker. But the problem is that different policies are not what is being debated in this House. No, here a policy is stated on one side as against a lack of policy on the other side. It is never possible to have a proper debate here in which a specific policy of this side and its <span class="col_769-770" refersTo="page_0402"/>implementation is compared with a specific policy and its implementation as propagated by the other side, because, Sir, one never knows what the Opposition&#x2019;s policy is.</p>

<p>They are characterized by their lack of policy. That is why I do not blame the hon. member for Bezuidenhout if he becomes nervous and regularly makes statements of policy. I think that, if my Leader had also been so lax in propagating his policy, I should also have issued statements of policy occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that an Opposition also has a task to perform. An Opposition has a very positive task in a democratic parliament. I should like to refer the Opposition to the previous Opposition. That Opposition stated their policy as against the lack of policy, or shall I call it the reckless policy of the Government at that time. The leader of the then Opposition and his handful of colleagues stated a positive policy. They said that their policy was one of apartheid or separate development. After all these years we are still very definitely building on the foundations we laid at that time. But on the <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0403"/>United Party side one has hundreds of statements of policy. If one asks them what they said last year, they are ashamed of it. Why is the hon. the Leader so hesitant in making a statement of policy here? The hon. the Leader was not as hesitant when he granted an interview with a magazine of the English schools. He was, as it were, quite willing to make a statement of policy then. When certain questions were put to him, he simply replied to them without any hesitation. He probably did not expect the hon. member for Innesdal to be so nasty as to read out the article in question in this House. He never intended that to happen. In May, 1962, the hon. the Leader spoke at De Aar&#x2014;a town he, too, probably regarded as a small place&#x2014; and then he was also prepared to make a statement of policy. That is why we have to go back to those days because nowadays statements of policy are no longer made from the bench of the hon. the Leader, but from the benches of people sitting slightly across from him. We asked the hon. the Leader whether he still stood by what he had said at that time, so that we might set off policy against policy and not policy against lack of policy. Then we can talk as people who know what is at stake. Does the Leader still stand by the following words he used at that time, namely, &#x201C;It will contribute to the immediate release from racial tension by providing participation by all races in the machinery of government at administrative as well as legislative level. It will not be mere representation without opportunity to participate in the executive and administrative functions.&#x201D; Does the Leader still stand by that, namely that the Bantu and the Coloureds should not only be able to sit in this Parliament, but also in the highest executive authority of this country?</p>

<p>I shall deal with that. If I were the hon. member I should go swimming. I should not ask questions of this sort. The hon. member tempts me to read more and more. By doing so the hon. member is not endearing himself to his Leader. The hon. the Leader was then asked a further question, namely, &#x201C;Could a Coloured become Prime Minister under United Party policy?&#x201D; &#x201C;It is highly unlikely but not impossible,&#x201D; was his reply to that. It appears therefore, Sir, that these things are possible under United Party policy. If we consider these aspects of their policy and observe the world as it is at present, we know that if the United Party&#x2019;s policy is implemented, this would no longer be &#x201C;unlikely&#x201D;, but rather &#x201C;very likely&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As against this lack of policy on the part of the Opposition, the Government came forward with a positive policy, a policy we are not afraid to state before the whole world. In the words of the Minister of Bantu Administration not so long ago: We accept certain facts in regard to our fatherland. The first fact we accept is that we are more than one people living in a common fatherland. We have various Bantu people within this homeland, within this country of ours, within the territorial frontiers of our fatherland. This is one of the facts which we accept and which we do not try to argue away, as the United Party is doing.</p>

<p>The United Party must tell us now whether they accept or reject these facts. If they accept them, they must tell us what they are going to do, because we are prepared to say what we are going to do in regard to these matters. Day after day we state our policy in respect of these various peoples, because we have a basis for peaceful co-existence for the various peoples of Southern Africa. We are not afraid of saying so. We have more than one Bantu people in South Africa. Each of these peoples belongs to a different ethnic group, and we want to help them to develop a distinctive nationhood, to develop into a distinctive nation of which they will be proud, of which they will be so proud that they will not try to break through to the White race. This is a new pattern we are giving the world, a pattern of which we are proud, and time after time we invite the Opposition to accept that as a basis because the people of South Africa want that as a basis. Once they have accepted that, we can debate as adults, surely. Then we shall be able to conduct productive discussions in this House, not this sort of nonsense where two hon. members on the other side contradict each other within five minutes, in that one speaker accuses the Government of &#x201C;-isms&#x201D; and dogmas, while the other speaker claims that the Government has no policy at all. Surely, this is a joke, Sir, and with speeches of this sort nothing is left of parliamentary debating.</p>

<p>We are asking the Opposition: Do you accept the basic principle that we are a country with more than one people? In this country we have the White people, the Coloured people and also the various Bantu peoples. We do not deny this fact. We make no secret of it. When the Minister made this statement, one of the hon. members on the other side asked&#x2014;I almost called it a silly question&#x2014;what about the English and Afrikaans-speaking people, are they two separate peoples? Of course not. They are one people. In South Africa we have built a White nation out of people from many different nations who came here. One White nation originated here. We are one White nation with two cultures and two languages. We can respect each other&#x2019;s culture and language, and each of them will develop its own culture into something fine. For the very reason that this side of the House is doing that, we in this Party have become a unit. We are not like an ostrich which buries its head in the sand and then thinks that it is safe. We know that old English saying of Sir Winston Churchill&#x2019;s, namely, &#x201C;You can fool some of the people all the time, and you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time&#x201D;. I say that they cannot bluff everybody all the time, because those hon. members are trying to overlook the realities of national existence in South Africa. They say, &#x201C;Well, that is how it is, and that is how it will remain&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, what is our real national basis? Let us penetrate to the actual roots of our national existence. The hon. the Leader and his supporters who are laughing so heartily now, must tell me whether they accept this basis as the pattern for the future of South Africa. They must say whether they accept the fact that there will be co-existence of different peoples in South Africa for all times to come. Or does the United Party believe that we shall eventually degenerate into a sallowish hotch-potch? What is the policy of the United Party on these matters? It is simply impossible to have debates unless that side also announces a positive policy. It seems to me as though the hon. member for Sea Point feels like making a statement of policy. Well, I hope he does so the moment I sit down.</p>

<p>Sir, I am repeating the question. We want to know from those hon. members whether they accept the basic principles on which the entire policy of the National Party and the Government is founded. This is a policy we are implementing as a practical policy, piece by piece and step by step. We want to admit what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said, namely that there are many major problems on our way. To-day he depicted these problems as being pitch-black and sky-high. One moment he said that it was absolutely impossible for us to manage without Bantu in our industries, and the next moment he complained about the growing numbers of Bantu. What then is the result, what logical conclusion must we draw in respect of the Leader&#x2019;s point of view? Surely, an opposition should not only depict the impossibilities of a policy without wanting to offer a solution. Because then we must arrive at the logical conclusion that the hon. the Leader thinks that our survival as separate peoples, the survival of the White race as a separate race, is an impossibility. That is why he wants to destroy it; that is why he believes in racial integration. Am I right or am I wrong?</p>

<p>The hon. member says I am wrong. Fine! If it happens to be impossible to implement the policy of separate development, if it is impossible to implement the policy of Bantu homelands, if it is impossible to bring about peaceful co-existence in South Africa&#x2014;because this is what all the speeches on the other side have amounted to so far, namely the impossibility of implementing our policy of separate development, of Bantu homelands&#x2014;then the next speaker on the Opposition side should kindly tell us what they definitely want. The Opposition must stop fencing in the dark. After all, we cannot debate a matter if the other side has not yet said what it wants. Surely in such circumstances we cannot set off policy against policy. What does the Opposition want if they do not want the Government&#x2019;s projects? Since they are saying that separate development and Bantu homelands are impossible, what do they suggest? What does the Opposition want? As alternative I can see nothing <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0404"/>but racial integration, and I put it to the Opposition that if they do not want racial integration, what else do they want? They want a unitary community, a community which, as I have said before, will eventually have a light brownish sort of colour.</p>

<p>I challenge hon. members on the other side to mention a country in which there was a predominantly black population and in which the White people in that country survived as a White people, without segregation having been applied. [Interjections.] The hon. member is being flippant.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I refuse point-blank to reply to a question from a member who says such absurd things, who claims that Namaqualand is such a country. I think it is too flippant a remark for any decent member of this House to make. I shall definitely not reply to that.

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand, Mr. Speaker, has made a most remarkable speech here. He has travelled from one end of the country to the other. At the beginning he was in a sense an apologist for his own party. I do not think he has a lot of faith in what his Minister said here this afternoon and he was trying to divert the debate by asking all sorts of questions which he immediately started answering himself. The hon. member made a remarkable statement about people being fooled. Well, he certainly did not fool this House this afternoon.</p>

<p>We heard the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration telling us this afternoon about what he was going to do. We on this side thought that when he became a Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration he would change his tune, although I would not say he was always irresponsible. But we realized this afternoon that he was coming up with his usual bluster, because when he realized that he had no case and that he was in a most difficult position he adopted the old approach, namely &#x201C;When you have no defence, attack, and do whatever you can&#x201D;. In the recent no-confidence debate that side brought in the Johannesburg election. Similarly this afternoon the Deputy Minister thought he would bring in the pending Worcester election. What he is not going to say when he goes up to Worcester is nobody&#x2019;s business. I hope that when he goes to Worcester he keeps his promise and tells the people there exactly what he told us in this House this afternoon. Because I think that the farming community and the industrialists at Worcester should like to hear what he said here this afternoon, what his plans are for them, what he intends to do to the farmer. I think that he would be doing us and the country a service if he went to Worcester and told them there exactly what he is going to do.</p>

<p>I should now like to talk about the Western Cape. Hon. members no doubt recall that in 1955 Dr. Eiselen made his famous statement to SABRA and then the hon. member for Malmesbury came out with the Van Staden line. The Government eventually adopted the Van Staden line which we know as the Eiselen line of the Western Cape, which refers to the removal of the Bantu. The former Prime Minister said, when he was Minister of Bantu Administration, that the policy of the Government was to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape. But being a man of experience he realized that this was not a practical proposition and that it could not be done overnight. He realized that this scheme should not have any unfavourable economic effect on the Western Cape and that it would have to be implemented gradually. When he later became Prime Minister he reiterated these principles. He appointed a Cabinet Committee which was established to carry out this policy of the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. The Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education was on his appointment allotted the task of removing the Bantu from the Western Cape. I think it was the hon. member for Heilbron who interjected this afternoon and said that his job was to remove them not only from the Western Cape but from the whole Republic. That was the job that was given to the Deputy Minister. I think it was contradicted by the hon. the Minister and he said: No, this only refers to the Western Cape. We have not got that quite clear. We must accept that the hon. the Deputy Minister is there to further this policy as far as the Western Cape is concerned. As a matter of fact, he placed his whole political life in jeopardy and said that if he failed to carry this out he would resign. We all know that the Deputy Minister is a good politician on the political platform, and naturally a statement like that would please his audience.</p>

<p>The whole policy of the removal of Bantu, as has been said by my Leader and other people, is part of an ideological plan. It goes right back to when the statement was made by the hon. member for Malmesbury at a meeting and it was adopted by the governing party. But it makes nonsense when one applies the ideology of moving a people whom we know as Bantu, who happen to be Black, but who are not animals. The hon. the Minister of Finance, a former Minister of Economic Affairs is an economist, and he must have great difficulty in trying to apply his mind to the effects of this policy as far as industry is concerned. We did say to him, when he was Minister of Economic Affairs, that here we have a case of political economy.</p>

<li>(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) with the exception of the Coloured Development Corporation, which holds its quota on behalf of Coloured interests, all the other quotas were granted to undertakings controlled by Whites.

<li>(b) in respect of 1965 there are no particular reasons. Only negligible portions of the relative quotas were not exported. As regards 1966 Safroc could not secure sufficient shipping space to export all the rock lobster before the 31st December, 1966 and approval was then granted that the stocks on hand on that date may be exported until the end of February, 1967.</li>

<p>(2) There was no abolition of posts. The difference between the number of posts on 31st December, 1965, and at present, is due to the regrading of certain posts of postmaster and the amalgamation of the former grades of Postmaster, Grade IV, and Senior Post Office Clerk (existing designation Administrative Assistant).</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned I was dealing with the effects of the ideological policy of the Government as applied in the Western Cape in regard to the removal of Bantu from this area and its economic consequences. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has said that industrialists and farmers must turn to greater mechanization. To support his contention, he continually quotes figures to this House. I think he has a complex about the brick-makers, because he is continually telling us that there must be a higher degree of mechanization in the brick-making industry, which will reduce the demand for labour. Sir, we accept that a high degree of mechanization can reduce the demand not only for black labour but white <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0420"/>labour as well. We also accept that there is wastage, but you will find that industry in South Africa is fairly well organized and they watch the position. They will certainly not pay for any labour which is not productive. When this scheme for the removal of Bantu from the Western Cape was started I think the Minister of Transport was the first to start removing them, and he reduced the Bantu staff in the Salt River workshops to a large extent. He even closed down one Bantu township run by the Railways. In his application of the policy of the Government he also ran into difficulties. It is interesting to see the reply to a question I put on the Order Paper on 8th February, 1966, in regard to the average number of Bantu employed in the Salt River workshops. We find that in 1962 there were 301, in 1963 there were 265, and in 1964 there were 257, and then the Minister ran into difficulties and we find that the number jumped to 495 in 1965. So we see that even the Railways have run into this difficulty. They followed the Minister of Bantu Administration system and they applied for permits to employ Bantu labour after trying very hard to get Coloured labour. The Minister of Bantu Administration must not tell us that there is not a high degree of mechanization in this particular workshop or in the docks. I think the Railways take a lead in mechanization in this country. They had to do it because there is a lack not only of Black labour but also of White skilled labour. In line with the policy of the Government, the Minister of Transport employed some 300 Coloureds who were brought from the Transkei. It is interesting to read a report in <i>The Cape Times</i> of 6th May, 1965, under the headline &#x201C;Coloureds Take Quick Jobs in Docks&#x201D;. This is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the end of 1963 about 300 Coloured families arrived in Cape Town from the Transkei full of optimism, with jobs waiting for the menfolk in Table Bay Docks, but inquiries revealed that few of these Coloured immigrants are still working in the harbour. <i>The Cape Times</i> was told yesterday that only a few of the 300 men originally recruited by the Railways are still working in the docks, and that these few had settled down nicely and that they were quite satisfied with them.</block>

<p>It went on to say that the labour required in the docks did not suit the Coloured worker and that the African was very much more suitable. So there you have the picture of what is actually happening in the Department itself.</p>

<p>They use Black labour and Indian labour, as well as White labour, as the hon. member should know. The hon. the Minister interjected yesterday about the Cape Town City Council. He said it was one of the councils he would give credit to for employing Coloured labour. Sir, that has always been their policy, but I would like to draw his attention to the fact that the City Engineer reported to the Council that there was a lack of Coloured labour and he asked the Council to employ Africans. It was suggested that 290 Africans be employed.</p>

<p>Whether the Minister ever granted the permit I do not know, but there is evidence in Cape Town of a shortage of Coloured labour at the present moment. There are certain suburbs in Cape Town where the streets used to be cleaned at least once a week and at present they have not been cleaned for a fortnight. That is the position. The labour is not there. The hon. the Minister must not tell us that the City Council of Cape Town is not highly mechanized. It is probably one of the few councils in this country that is mechanized to a very high degree. They cannot find the Coloured labour.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration told us this afternoon that he had had interviews with farming deputations who came to see him about the ticklish problem of farm labour. He says that once he stated the Government&#x2019;s policy to these farmers they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I wonder, Sir. I am very certain that these deputations went away feeling highly frustrated and feeling that they would just have to accept the Government&#x2019;s policy. When an industrialist in the Western Cape wants to apply for Bantu labour, I wonder whether the Minister has any idea of the process he has to go through. He has to fill in a form and it takes between ten and 12 days before he gets a reply as to whether he can have Bantu labour or not. As a result, people have become frustrated. We know that in Cape Town one large racing stable intends to move to Durban. Another one will follow for the simple reason that they just cannot get the Bantu labour.</p>

<p>You are letting us into a secret. That is not the owner&#x2019;s statement in the Press.</p>

<p>Sir, how can one run a business in this frustrating fashion? We hear much about productivity. There have been conferences about it. We have heard about how to work harder, produce more, reduce prices, etc., to beat the inflation bogey. How can one tie this in with the Government&#x2019;s policy of political economy? I have often wondered whether there is a link between the Minister of Bantu Administration, the Department of Finance and the Department <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0421"/>of Commerce and Industries, because the Minister of Bantu Administration has taken over the whole responsibility in this country for the location of industries and other matters. One cannot locate an industry unless one gets the permission of that hon. Minister. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council must have great difficulty in forecasting the economic growth of this country when they have a minister such as the Minister of Bantu Administration. I think the hon. the Minister should be one of the kingpins on that council. The Minister may laugh about it. I do not know whether he has ever been a businessman, but he was quite happy about stopping industry in Epping in the Western Cape. He said that he would do it again.</p>

If the hon. the Minister of Finance wants to find where his trouble lies, he must look just behind him. The Ministers must realize that Bantu labour in this country has been the key to the economic success of South Africa. Without it we cannot do anything. The large industries, the gold mines, the diamond mines and the Railways have all prospered as a result of having a supply of Bantu labour; I do not say a free supply, but an adequate supply of Bantu labour.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Because I am thinking about those speeches that you are going to make in Worcester. It is probable that the Minister or the Deputy Minister does not understand the Western Cape, but the new Minister of Economic Affairs has lent his support to the Western Cape development. He is hoping that it will go ahead, but how can it go ahead with a policy such as the one enunciated by the Government at the present moment. It is interesting to hear what Professor Cilliers said about it. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has read his report. Professor Cilliers is the professor of sociology at Stellenbosch University. He was addressing a meeting of the Afrikaanse Sakekamer in Malmesbury on the 13th March, 1963. He warned that it would have to be gradual, if at all. He quoted some interesting figures. The report states:</p>

<block name="quote">Generally, people thought of urban Africans in considering the removal plan. But in fact there were 101,380 in rural areas and 151,564 in urban areas. The percentages were 40.08 and 59.92.</block>

<p>He said that the whole scheme was doomed to failure unless we had the co-operation of both the farmers and of the industrialists. He said that one would have to remove something like 120,000 workers. In regard to an exchange basis, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">The only type of Coloured worker outside the Western Cape who could be brought in on an exchange basis for African labour was the one who did the same type of work as the African which was overwhelmingly unskilled work. On this basis, the greatest number of Coloured people who would qualify was about 20,000&#x2014;and it would mean moving whole Coloured familes.</block>

<p>I think Professor Cilliers&#x2019; conclusions were interesting. We have heard all about the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. I should like to repeat his conclusions. I should like to make them a challenge. Let us accept it. It is Government policy. The Minister says that they are going to carry it out. The Minister of Bantu Administration should talk to his colleague, the Minister of Coloured Affairs, and declare a Coloured border area in the Western Cape. Let us carry out that policy. Let us see the Government replace this labour with Coloured labour. We cannot just remove labour from one area without replacing it. I should like to challenge the Government now to do just that, namely to remove Coloured labour from other parts of the Republic and bring them into the Western Cape and declare the Western Cape as a Coloured border area. Let the Western Cape have the same facilities as the Bantu border areas. Let us have those facilities as far as Railway rates, etc., are concerned. That is the challenge I make to the Government. If that is not done the Government has failed. They can then forget about removing the Bantu from the Western Cape.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down has no grasp whatsoever of one of the major questions in South Africa as far as labour matters are concerned. To-day I shall try to teach him and the Leader of the Opposition one lesson, and I hope they will remember it. South Africa&#x2014;and more specifically after what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration said yesterday&#x2014;is at present divided into two spheres as far as the present discussion on industries is concerned. The industrialist is at all times quite free to decide for himself which of those two spheres he will choose. If Bantu labour is the key to economic prosperity in South Africa, as the hon. members allege, then those potential industrialists have no reason to refuse, if that is their attitude, to make their choice to their own advantage and to put their skill and ability and financial investments into the border industries. If it is an important key <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0422"/>to such tremendous advantages, surely they have an open field there where they can get unlimited numbers of Bantu labourers and where more water is available than in the present areas, where the demand is so great. Then there are the white areas, but despite the fact that in the white areas Government policy and legislation are aimed at making those industries more and more white, does the hon. member not find it strange that despite this key of which he speaks, namely cheap Bantu labour, is rejected in favour of those areas where it is virtually a prerequisite that white labour should be used? The hon. gentlemen should work that out themselves and then they will see that until now they have been wide off the mark.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, because many of the matters raised by him are of an administrative nature. I want to come to the policy question. Yesterday the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a two-pronged attack on the Government, and to me it was something new to see him take one issue, for the first time in his career as Leader of the Opposition, and try to pursue it to its conclusion, although he failed hopelessly in doing so. At least he did not try to scrape together a bunch of matters and to build a case on them, as he did in the past. The attack made yesterday by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, was firstly that he was opposed to the decentralization of industries. Then, in his second attack, he advocated the unrestricted admission of Bantu labour to white areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Here I have the amendment of the hon. the Leader, and since there is such a strong reaction on the part of the Opposition, I shall read the second part of his amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That it will not abuse influx control laws and regulations to exclude work-seekers from employment opportunities in existing industrial and farming areas when they are not assured of work elsewhere&#x2026;</block>

<p>He is saying, even as regards those in the Bantu homelands, that unless there is work for them in their homeland, as he sees it, is in the white area. The motion continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And when their exclusion will retard the healthy and desirable development of those areas.</block>

<p>Before dealing with the essentials of this twopronged attack, I just want to point out that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will be a great help to us as the Leader of the Opposition if he will use the same language that he used here to-day when he speaks at meetings in the rural areas, such as that held in Prieska. That would enable us to evaluate the attack made by him on the Government. But if he makes a point against the Government at Prieska while his points against the Government in this House are the opposite, it becomes very difficult for the Government to decide what the Leader of the Opposition is criticizing. We must therefore remember that we should also see his entire attack against the background of what has now become a hardy annual as far as the hon. member for Yeoville is concerned. The hon. member for Yeoville has made it his annual task to allege in this House that the influx to the industrial areas is increasing. From Government side it is pointed out to him year after year that the increase in the number of Bantu in those white areas is attributable to the fact that those industries have grown. In reply to hon. members it is then pointed out that the ratio has always improved, and not deteriorated. But despite that they come back the next year with the same attack and the same question, with the result that they are virtually wasting our time, and instead of discussing matters on their merits, they come back once again and state the case which they misrepresented the previous year and which the Government side presented correctly. Then we reply, and as soon as it has been given they always close the debate and run away from the entire situation.</p>

<p>Now it would be most interesting to know what the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and his party would be if in this session there is a realization&#x2014;and I hope there will be&#x2014;of what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration referred to yesterday, namely that industrialists and potential industrialists will be restrained as far as their labour force is concerned. For example, if they wanted to establish a new industry on the Witwatersrand or in Pretoria or elsewhere, they would have to complete a form to state how many labourers they would employ, how many Whites and how many Bantu, where those people would live, how much water and electricity they would need and what transport facilities they would need. It would be interesting to see the reaction of the Opposition when such things are brought about by way of legislation. If the pleas made at the negotiations&#x2014; which have always taken place on a high level and at which the industries were urged to try to adapt themselves to the population strength of South Africa and the relations between White and Black&#x2014;have fallen upon deaf ears in the case of a large number of industrialists, and if a large number of industrialists are engaged in disrupting our position on the Witwatersrand and Pretoria from time to time as regards housing, labour matters and transport, etc., then we are forced to take statutory powers to attain those objects. Now I want to say that if those are put into operation, I do not think we will have a repetition in future years of the story told by the hon. member for Yeoville, that the number of Bantu in the white industries is increasing continually. I say that is again contrary to the facts.</p>

<p><span class="col_811-812" refersTo="page_0423"/>The facts prove the very opposite, although matters are not yet quite the way we want them. Yesterday we heard the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education tell the House about actual cases of industrialists who were compelled to accept the responsibility for housing their workers and then discovered immediately that they could make do with far fewer Bantu labourers than they would need if the city council or some other concern provided their housing. It is true that there will be that sobering influence on industries that are getting completely out of hand to-day, something which I, for my part, want to say no orderly community or state or society can tolerate any longer, because the Leader of the Opposition encourages and asks the Bantu in the Bantu homelands to leave their areas and to stream to the white areas. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should realize that the consequences of his plea would mean a regression to those years when the National Party came into power and when those notorious shanty-towns existed on the Witwatersrand, creating an absolutely uncontrollable situation. How we had to plead here to have those chaotic conditions on the Witwatersrand cleared up!</p>

<p>We know how the late Prime Minister, when he was Minister of Native Affairs, had to struggle and fight here against the greatest resistance this House had ever known on the part of the opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now had a rest, he has regained his breath, and now he comes along with the violent attack he made yesterday. He pleaded that for the sake of eyewash those businesses should get a minor condition here and there, such as those I have just read, namely that the Government should not regard the progress of those industries. Seeing that the hon. gentleman had the facts at his disposal and that he brought this material accusation against the Government, one would at least have thought he would be fair enough to tell this House where, in what place and in respect of which industry, industries were disrupted as a result of these control measures of the Government. He could not give one example. In his speech he also suggested that we on this side should prove by means of figures that the reversal would be reached in 1978.</p>

In proving such things by means of figures, surely one should prove to what extent the change will take place, or else what meaning would the figures have? The great attack the hon. member made on the Government yesterday was that we on this side had never proved to him that the reversal would come in that year. I cannot understand his attitude, Mr. Speaker. Surely the hon. gentleman is a practical farmer and knows that one does not count a chicken before it is hatched or a calf before it is born. But he expects us to anticipate that year through figures regarding a matter of policy which has so many obstacles to overcome.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>We are not prepared to confine ourselves to a specific date. As matters develop from time to time, I feel justified in saying to-day that we shall not wait until that year, but that the reversal for which we aim will come long before 1978. Next year the hon. member will be thoroughly convinced of that. The hon. member should remember that, just as in the case of our battle against inflation, the Government has to deal with foolhardy powers in the industrial field as well. Those powers use and abuse their economic strength as an obstacle in the course of such policy matters. That must be combated continually.</p>

<p>I think that as far as this matter is concerned, we shall exceed the wildest expectations. We shall succeed in presenting a clear image, an image which will become clearer and clearer, and after the establishment of such statutory powers industrialists will have no more difficulties because the choice of a factory site will be exclusively in their hands. If it is so advantageous&#x2014;as the hon. member alleged&#x2014;then the land is there and they can also employ 100 percent Bantu labour. But if that is not the case, on which we insist and which we make an absolute requirement, then we shall not allow our white areas to blacken more and more.</p>

<p>The actual reason why I rose was to come back to the speech made the other day by the hon. member for Hillbrow in connection with certain aspects of our mining industry. Apparently the hon. member has a very thorough knowledge of the financial aspect of our mining industry, and he was able to describe certain things to us. But if the hon. member describes a black horse with a white spot on its head and fails to mention the white spot, then he is not quite accurate. Amongst other things the hon. member made the important statement in this House that the mining industry was at the moment exhausting all the rich mines. Five percent of the mines, i.e. the very rich group, get away with all those benefits. According to him the rest of the mines are marginal mines, mines that are dependent upon and that can make a living only as a result of Government concessions. Amongst other <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0424"/>things the hon. member pleaded for subsidies for mines already in existence. The hon. member also pleaded for reorientation of labour matters on the mines, and that the Chamber of Mines should make a very sincere attempt to do certain things, things which this Government has never accepted and never will accept.</p>

<p>There is a certain aspect I want to bring to the attention of the hon. member, however, and when he deals with the mining industry again, I want him to bear this aspect in mind as well. Between the profit-making mines and the non-profit-making mines&#x2014;which are called marginal mines&#x2014;there is a world of difference as regards the respective policies laid down. The mine directors concerned decide whether a mine is a profitable mine or whether it is a marginal mine. Why is that so, Mr. Speaker? The reason is as follows. The marginal mines receive ample tax concessions. They also receive ample concessions as regards their working costs. What is the result of that? Once they are regarded as marginal mines, the working costs of those mines are forced up systematically and deliberately, on instructions. The reason for that is that they must not make a profit because that is not the source of the share-holder&#x2019;s profit. In this respect I want to say something of a serious nature, but I think it is high time it was said. The directors simply decide that the mines must not be profitable. They do not want the mines to show a profit because they make their profit from the materials which are pumped into the mines day by day. They make profits from cement, from timber, from hardware, from all the wares they deliver. That is the reason, Sir, why one hears Anglo this and Anglo that.</p>

<p>If Anglo does not make its profits from marginal mines, it makes it from cement, etc. There it makes all its profits on materials which are so to speak thrown away in the gold mines. That is an aspect which should be investigated. The hon. member should bear that aspect in mind. If 5 percent of the mines are profitable while the rest are only marginal mines, it is a very serious matter. It then becomes time for us to determine to what extent the directorates of the profit-making mines have a say in the non-profit-making mines as well, and to what extent they have an interest in the manufacture of cement and in supplying timber and all the other materials pumped into those mines. That is an aspect the hon. member, who has made such an intensive study of the mining industry, should also have presented to this House. Because it is only then that we shall get a correct picture of our mining industry. The mining industry is used all the time for propaganda purposes, in order to gain some sympathy for that coterie which makes the profits. The difficulties and so-called non-profit-making circumstances of the other mines are exploited in the fashion I have just described.</p>

<p>If there is one matter in South Africa that should be investigated it is this one, because for my part I want to say that the gentlemen advising the Government in connection with taxes do not always know about those tricks of the mining trade. Because in those non-profit-making mines they enjoy the benefits of the subsidy and of all kinds of concessions, and then they enjoy the advantage of the profits they make. If the question of working costs is taken into review, Mr. Speaker, it will become clearer to you what I mean. If one takes the working costs per ton in those profitable mines and compares them with the marginal mines, one will soon see what is wrong. Why are the working costs of the highly profitable mines lower than the working costs of the marginal mines? Let hon. members of the Opposition, who are so fond of pleading for subsidies in season and out of season, explain that to us. Let them tell the House these things, and then you will see that there are things happening in the mining industry which South Africa cannot tolerate any longer. And is it not the mining industry which is influencing other industries in South Africa to speak the way the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate? Is it not the mining industry which is in many respects exerting the stranglehold of credit provision on those subsidized industries, and which is dictating to them that they should offer as much resistence as possible to the Government&#x2019;s influx control policy as far as the Bantu are concerned? Are they not behind that?</p>

<p>I submit that they are in fact behind that. Let the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tell us, through the next speaker on that side, what their attitude is as regards the question of absolute control on a statutory basis over labour questions on the Witwatersrand and in Pretoria, and what their attitude is as regards housing. Will they support the Government in its policy that every future industrialist should also be responsible for housing his workers? If one is frivolous, one always receives a fair response from the Opposition, but when one tries to point out to them what is wrong in the economy in respect of which they always act so protectively in this House, then that side is silent. I want to express the hope that hon. members on that side will adopt a new pattern. In the past they had a more difficult part to play here; they had to act here, not as the official South African Opposition, no, they always had to act on behalf of the U.N. or on behalf of the British Government. Seven years ago the hon. the Leader of the Opposition acted here on behalf of Ghana. It is my hope that in view of the development that has taken place in South Africa, in view of South Africa&#x2019;s enhanced status, the Opposition will now adopt a new course. Sir, all these issues which were so clouded in the past arose from the fact that we were not independent. The solution to our colour problem on the highest possible level had always been prejudiced and adversely influenced by the fact that we were a member of the Commonwealth. As a result of the fact that we were not an independent republic, we were always <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0425"/>shackled. But some years ago we became a republic, and we cannot but congratulate the Government on the tremendous progress it has made in implementing its policy of separate development.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Krugersdorp rose, he told us that he was going to teach my Leader a lesson on labour matters. I found that somewhat funny, coming from that hon. member. It is years since the hon. member resigned from the Labour Party, but he is still poking his nose into mineworkers&#x2019; affairs every so often. One would think he should know something about labour matters. But if he knows something about labour&#x2014;he is a senior member of that Party&#x2014;why is he not on the Government benches? The Government is in great need of such a man. The hon. member talked so much nonsense that it is no wonder his colleague the hon. member for Carletonville was laughing at him and eventually argued with him about his speech. Nor do the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Brakpan agree with him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp said that my Leader advocated unrestrained admission of Bantu to the white areas.</p>

<p>He said that my Leader encouraged the Bantu to leave their homelands and to move to the white areas. Surely the hon. member knows that is not true, and yet he said that. Before leaving that hon. member I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister of Finance that the speech just made by the hon. member is aimed at frustrating the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s plea for a higher gold price.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Because he does not know what he is talking about. Mr. Speaker, the late General Smuts was known throughout the world and will always be known as &#x201C;General&#x201D;, although he later became a Field Marshall, because he achieved his greatest fame as a general. We have always thought the hon. member for Vereeniging would always be known as the hon. member for Vereeniging, because in his capacity as member for Vereeniging he talked some of the greatest nonsense of his career. There must be few members who talked so much nonsense and advanced so few constructive arguments over a period of so many years. Now that he has been promoted, he got his second and third wind all at once, and now he is excelling himself. I have no doubt that from the way he is acting now he will be known in history as the Deputy Minister of the century.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>He will always be known as the immortal and widely-loved Churchill of South Africa. But speaking of the great men of other countries, I just want to point out that the make and break methods applied here by him remind one rather more of Churchill&#x2019;s greatest enemy, i.e. Hitler. The hon. the Deputy Minister wants to make and break everything by force; he simply cannot do that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, most of the arguments advanced yesterday by the hon. the Deputy Minister have already been responded to, but there are one or two on which I should also like to say something. The hon. the Deputy Minister told us that there was a terrible wastage of Bantu labour in South Africa. I think we can agree with him, but what has his Government done to eliminate the wastage of unskilled labour? What have they done to train those people properly?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

</speech>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says they have done a great deal. What have they done? They are wasting even more skilled labour through their senseless regulations, for what is happening? A Bantu worker comes to the white areas; he works some months until he knows the work well, and then he has to return to his own area and a new worker has to be trained. Is that not a terrible waste of labour? [Interjection.] I am speaking of the Bantu workers. Yesterday the Deputy Minister told us how he had shown the manufacturers, the businessmen and the farmers how to get along with less Bantu labour, and he said that they were grateful for that. If that is true, he has missed his vocation. He should practice as an efficiency expert.</p>

<p>But he is one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>If the businessmen of South Africa discover how good he is in that respect, I wonder whether they will not try to steal him from the Cabinet, as the farmers are now stealing one another&#x2019;s labourers. That will be a great loss!</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister does not want to bury the wonderful year 1978, and then the hon. member for Krugersdorp came along and said it would be even sooner. I just want to ask that hon. member, if it is true that the Bantu will have to return, who will work in the mines, which he wants to nationalize? That is the kind of talk we hear, and there is no reply.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has devoted himself to reducing the Bantu in the Western Cape, and he told us how wonderful things were in the brick manufacturing industry, how <span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0426"/>they were making do with much fewer Bantu. But is it not that very industry which is at present experiencing a great shortage of bricks. That shows how he is disrupting the industry from which he removes the Bantu, and that is only where he started. We must now prepare ourselves for the fact that the further he goes, the more disruption he will cause. [Interjections.] The first one he tackled has been disrupted. I fear the Deputy Minister will yet cause the Nationalist Party many headaches. No wonder some of them are telling us that they suspect him of being a United Party fifth columnist among them.</p>

<p>I also want to address a few words to the hon. member for Namaqualand. As far as nonsense is concerned, he is not far behind the Deputy Minister. I just want to deal with two of the matters he raised here to-day. The first is that he told us how long and how hard the Nationalist Party had to work to clear up the mess they inherited in 1948, such as slums. I just want to ask him: If his Party had been engaged in a war for six years, and its best men had been away during the war time, what would it have been like then? Then he raised a second point, and I am sure he did not know what he was talking about. He told us how hard his Party had to work to build up the Defence Force. He may not be aware of it, but after the war, until 1948, there was a sound Defence Force, and for twelve years that Government did nothing but break down that Force. Of course they now have to work hard to build it up again, and of course it will now cost more. No, the hon. member should not talk about things he knows nothing about. If the hon. member had come from a constituency like Brits and had then talked such rubbish it would have been understandable, but he comes from Namaqualand and there one expects diamonds, but look what we are getting. Only bitter apples and bitter melons.</p>

<p>The Government claims to have a very good policy. What we on this side should like, is to see them make an effort to carry out that policy. They should not merely talk about it; they should show us results. They should not merely talk about what will happen in 1978. [Interjections.] The hon. the Deputy Minister merely disrupts everything. There is a difference between disruption and implementing a policy. Let us see what they can do. Even if it is ten years late, let them start with the recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission. Then there may be some progress. But all they do is a bit here and a bit there, without touching the most important points in that report. I fear that in due course economic conditions will force them to give effect to those recommendations.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration told us that he envisaged a ratio of one and less Black to one White in the large metropolitan areas. To me it seems so unfair that that ratio should be applied in Cape Town and Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg, but only eight miles outside Pretoria there is no restriction and there may be hundreds.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>No, they live just next door. The same applies to the so-called border industries. That is also in White South Africa. At present, by the norm of the Minister, the ratio in Johannesburg is out of all proportion and one wonders how they are going to try to correct that. It seems to me there will only be one way, and that is for them to proclaim Sowetho a homeland, and then their problem on the Rand will be solved. Every night numerous trains leave for the homelands, but the problem will remain just the same. Whether it is near Johannesburg or on the borders, the problem remains the same No wonder, if one has such a policy and tries to carry it out, that the Minister should try all those tricks to bluff the voters into thinking that it is actually happening when it is not happening. They try to bluff the public into thinking that there is such a thing as separate development, when it is not true. They try to bluff the public into thinking that they are implementing it, when they are not doing that. That is our complaint. In respect of this so-called policy of theirs, on which they have so much to say, it is our complaint that they are making no effort to make it work in practice.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am really very sorry that the hon. member for North Rand has talked his Leader out of the House because I actually wanted to speak to his Leader. Just in passing I want to say to the hon. member for North Rand that he made me feel a little jealous here this afternoon. He called my colleague the Deputy Minister of the century. I had thought that there might perhaps be a chance for me too! I think I will go one better than my colleague. I am going to propose a reduction of at least 10 percent in Bantu labour, and then I will surpass him. The hon. member will forgive me if I do not spend too much time on him. I do not think he expects me to do so either. I just want to tell the hon. member in passing that if he thinks that we are going to make a homeland of Sowetho he really has no notion at all of what a homeland is. A homeland is an area which is being developed for one of the ethnic groups so that they may make their national home there. I now want to ask him whether he can place the Tswanas or the Vendas or some ethnic group or other in Sowetho. You see, Sir, that I would find myself involved in these trivialities if I were to react to that hon. member. I think I should prefer to leave it at that. That is also what the hon. member expects.</p>

<p>Neither am I going to discuss this afternoon the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s plea for more Bantu labour, not only for the <span class="col_819-820" refersTo="page_0427"/>Western Cape but for the entire economy of South Africa. Sir, we have on previous occasions heard about the homeopathic pill. Apparently that pill is efficacious in the treatment of any disease. I sat here yesterday afternoon listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He asked for more Bantu labour, particularly in the Western Cape. That labour is supposed to solve the economic problems of the Western Cape. It must strengthen the Western Cape economically. It must solve the problems being experienced in regard to agriculture and the increased prices of land. It must solve problems which may perhaps be created if Britain enters the European Common Market. Just as that homeopathic pill does, there is not a disease we suffer from which could not be cured if only we could have more Bantu labour in the Cape. In addition we are attacked for supposedly allowing migratory labour here. I am now going to do the hon. member for North Rand the honour of referring to him again. When he spoke about migrant labour he said, &#x201C;What foolishness!&#x201D; We allow migrant labour to take place, but as soon as that labourer has learnt something he has to return again. In other words, he wants them to be permanently settled here. Now we have heard what the United Party&#x2019;s point of departure is, namely that the Bantu must be permanently settled in the white areas, not only on a basis of migratory labour, but also on a family basis. There is not one of them who will deny this. Accusations are being made against us to the effect that we are disrupting the entire family life of the Bantu and therefore doing them an injustice. They even went so far as to ram Sinodal resolutions down our throats. We must therefore conclude from the United Party that more Black labour will solve all the difficulties. They want more Bantu women and a better family life for the Bantu here in White South Africa. It is then taking amiss of us when we place this process of making White South Africa Black, which the United Party advocates, and which it also advocates as its policy in season and out, before the electorate of South Africa and say to them that our policy is aimed at keeping White South Africa White in a country where the White man will retain his control. [Interjections.] That hon. member is shaking his head.</p>

<p>Before I leave this point I just want, in passing, to come for a moment to the hon. member for Salt River. I was amazed when I sat here listening to the hon. member for Salt River, who asked us in such a superior way whether we were not aware that we could not use the Coloureds as dock-workers. He went on to mention quite a number of other types of work which the Coloureds could not do and for which Bantu were specifically required. I now want to ask him which people are used in the harbours of other countries such as America, Britain, Japan and China. How do they load their ships? [Interjections.] No, the hon. member can furnish me with a reply on some other day after he has first considered this matter. It will really be a tragic day for South Africa if the entire nation had to adopt the attitude which the United Party adopts, i.e. that there is certain work in South Africa which will just have to stand still and which it will not be possible to do if there are no Bantu to do it. A lady told me the other day that a neighbour of hers had two little children. She asked how she was supposed to bring them up if she did not have a Bantu woman to help her. If we had to adopt the point of departure of the United Party, namely that nothing can continue without Bantu labour, and that our population cannot even multiply without Bantu labour, it would be a bad and fatal day for South Africa. I had to remind that woman of the fact that she could get a Bantu woman to assist her in raising her little children. However, she must at least expect that that Bantu woman, during the time she is here, will surely bring more than just two little children into the world, and that she is not going to need any help in raising them. In terms of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act of 1945 those children are inhabitants who qualify to remain here in future. [Interjections.] That hon. member will have an opportunity of speaking. He was afraid to speak yesterday.</p>

<p>I just want to dwell for a moment on what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said yesterday afternoon when he referred to a report which appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i> of a speech which I made at the East London Congress last year on the 2nd November. I maintained that I could not have been reported in the way the hon. member claimed. The hon. member was kind enough to hand over to me a clipping from <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 3rd November. I notice in this newspaper that I was in fact reported as he claimed I had been.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I still think that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout owes me an apology. He wanted to create the impression here that I had supposedly said that the Transvaal would be developed in such a way as to absorb the entire Xhosa population, in other words that even those Xhosa living in the Ciskei would be absorbed into the Transkei. Now if they were to read for themselves this report as it appeared in <i>Die Transvaler</i>, and I am not going to spend much time on this matter, hon. members would see what I mean. I shall just read this extract (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition the Bantu areas in many places&#x2014;in the Cape, particularly the Ciskei &#x2014;must be consolidated. Here at least an additional 100,000 morgen of land must be purchased from Whites in order to link up the areas while the Bantu in turn have to relinquish a 100,000 morgen to the Whites. Plans have not yet been finalized.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, surely everybody knows that there are no Vendas, Tswanas, Shangaans or Sothos living in the Ciskei. Everybody knows that the Xhosas are living in the Ciskei and that the Ciskei will be consolidated for the Xhosas. The hon. member therefore missed altogether the purpose I was trying to express. But now he comes forward here with these words to which I take exception:</p>

<block name="quote">In reply to another point for discussion, Mr. Vosloo said that it is the policy of the Government to let the Xhosas return to the Transkei as quickly as possible.</block>

<p>that means of course the Transkei and the Ciskei&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development and planning of the Transkei is aimed at making it possible for the territory to carry the entire Xhosa nation.</block>

<p>Now the hon. member, by wresting these few words of mine from their context, wants to create the impression here that what I meant was that the entire Xhosa nation should live in the Transkei only. I do not think there is any other person who, upon reading the entire report, would have come under that false impression. But so much for the congress of the National Party of the Cape in East London last year. It was followed closely by another congress in East London, the Congress of the United Party.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, so I understand. Now I also want to link that to the speech which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made yesterday afternoon and in which he told us that he was going to discuss their policy. He said that their policy was a federative approach without domination. I then strained my ears to hear how that federative policy without domination was going to work. The only conclusion to which I could come was that this federative approach had to be the offspring, and I do not know whether it is the illegitimate offspring of the old Senate plan, the defunct race federation plan of the United Party. The hon. member said that they had had a very good congress. Yes, that is what I read in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 18th November, where it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party has just concluded one of its better congresses in the Transvaal. Badly mauled in a general election little more than six months ago, the party showed itself nevertheless to be in reasonably good fettle. The level of discussion was higher than usual, young delegates participated more prominently than in the past, and the general approach adopted to political problems of the day seemed to be more constructive than previously.</block>

<p>They then go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was best illustrated in a discussion of provincial matters. It is even possible to detect a tiny shift of emphasis in the crucial area of race policy. Here, as has been amply illustrated in recent years, the United Party is at its most vulnerable. Its race federation policy has been sheer disaster politically for this has proved virtually impossible to put across to the electorate. Clearly something else has got to be devised before the party can entertain hopes oi coming to power again.</block>

<p>Now I want to read this little extract which is of importance in this regard:</p>

<block name="quote">The obvious step is to revert to orthodox federalism on a geographic basis and there have been signs that the more thoughtful members of the party have been considering such a move. Not long ago Mr. Japie Basson made a small sortie in this direction and <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0429"/>at this week&#x2019;s congress Dr. G. F. Jacobs spoke in guarded terms of the benefits of the federal system in a heterogeneous country like South Africa.</block>

<p>One can continue in this vein. It was a very interesting congress and that is why we listened with interest here to the no-confidence debate and to this debate. All that we got was this kind of criticism which we heard here this afternoon from the hon. member for North Rand who wanted to know when we were going to implement our policy. When we are in the process of implementing that policy he states that we are disrupting the economy of South Africa. The newspapers I quoted from are not kindly-disposed towards the National Party. They are not newspapers which support our policy. They are newspapers which readily support the United Party&#x2019;s policy. They are newspapers who want to support them at any election and who are dependent on gaining a handful of votes in order to win another constituency here and there. A few days later I read the following in the <i>Evening Post:</i></p>

<block name="quote">So far, each plan had proved a dismal failure &#x2026; the United Party can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for an unwillingness to try something new.</block>

<p>I cannot agree with them there. The United Party does try something new from time to time, but it simply does not succeed. But why should they listen to me; let them listen rather to the Press which supports them.</p>

<block name="quote">Since its defeat in 1948 the United Party has produced quite a number of plans designed to woo the voters. So far each one has proved a dismal failure. Now again, according to Press reports, the United Party is about to offer something new. We are to have a federal South Africa, and I do not suppose anyone will quarrel with this, not even the Progressive Party, from which the plan, or at least some of it, has been borrowed.</block>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Houghton for one can see that she has at least progressed so far now that the United Party is borrowing from her as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker,</p>

<p>I am glad to see that the hon. member for Orange Grove is now beginning to show signs of life. Perhaps he would explain this policy which I, the voting public as well as the Press, would so much like to know more about because it is surely the new approach, it is that new something which they are trying. That is what they are going to woo the voting public with. They have decided that they are going to woo them here at Worcester. They are even going to put forward a candidate in Worcester and we should like to know in advance how they are going to Woo the voters in Worcester. Perhaps the hon. member can inform us. Unfortunately I shall have to omit many quotations from this because we want to know more about this new policy. The <i>Sunday Times</i> states under this headline, &#x201C;Race federation abandoned in favour of territorial federation &#x2014;Major changes in United Party policy&#x201D;. These are all good things which were born out of the congresses. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 4th December, a few days later, a report appeared with a very fine photo of the hon. member for Yeoville. He is actually the expert in the field of race federation planning, or am I wrong in terming it race federation, since it is being alleged that this concept is already defunct? The hon. member granted an interview to the <i>Sunday Times</i> and explained this policy to them. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party has always accepted that the present Bantu reserves would have to play a major part in the federal organization of South African states. He pointed out that in 1964 Sir De Villiers Graaff emphasized in his congress speeches at Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth that these areas would eventually be associated with South Africa on a truly federal basis in which the territorial aspect would be apparent.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we would like more information about these matters. This is supposed to be the policy which the United Party should have put to us, and the closest we got to that, was yesterday afternoon when the hon. member for Bezuidenhout told us that their policy was a federative one.</p>

I know nothing about that. I am not a very regular reader of <i>The Observer.</i> I notice, however, that the hon. member has recently become a very regular reader of that publication. But we shall let the matter rest there.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I&#x2014;and the voting public of South Africa&#x2014;would like to know about this new policy with which the United Party is now coming forward, the new policy with which they are going to get the voters onto their side.

<p>We ourselves want to find out from the United Party what <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0430"/>this policy is. Now the hon. member is asking me to explain his party&#x2019;s policy. The hon. member puts me in mind of two U.P. members in the Somerset East constituency who were discussing their race federation policy before the last election. The one said to the other: &#x201C;Can you explain our race federation policy to me?&#x201D; to which the other one replied: &#x201C;No, I do not understand it very well. The other day I questioned Andres Cilliers, An-dries Vosloo&#x2019;s opponent about it, and he told me that he did not understand the policy very well either. We then decided to ask Sir De Villiers Graaff, but he told me that he did not understand it very well. But anyway Dr. Ver-woerd understands the policy very well. He can explain it.&#x201D; That is precisely what the hon. member wants from me&#x2014;he wants me to explain his party&#x2019;s policy. That is the policy about which we should like to hear more ourselves. I have here a clipping which deals with what the hon. member for Hillbrow said, under the heading: &#x201C;Federation is United Party Policy.&#x201D; Is it necessary for me to read it out, or shall I leave it to the hon. member for Hillbrow, who to my way of thinking always speaks so well, to explain this policy as he sees it to us in his next speech? He can tell us about the new approach, the new policy, as he proposed it at the congresses. [Interjections.] No, I think the hon. member must allow me to make my speech in my own way and to go on with the matters which I got up to deal with. I have now made this request to the United Party. I hope it has not fallen on deaf ears. If there are hon. members on the opposite side, such as the hon. members for Transkei and North Rand for example, who are not acquainted with the policy, then surely they have experts to inform them and they must not come and ask me to explain that policy to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also spoke about the consolidation of Bantu areas yesterday afternoon. He said that the United Party was in favour of the Bantu areas being consolidated. The hon. member reproached us with consolidating the Bantu areas too slowly. Perhaps one could agree with him. But if one glances at the records of the various parties&#x2014; I do not have the time at my disposal now to go into this, but I promise the United Party that I shall do so in a future speech&#x2014;ther the National Party Government has nothing to be ashamed about as far as the consolidation of Bantu areas is concerned. In fact, we have made more rapid progress in this regard than has the United Party. Nevertheless, I am glad to have received this admisson from the hon. member, namely that the United Party is also in favour of the consolidation of the Bantu areas. I now want to ask the United Party this: If they are in earnest about the Bantu areas being consolidated then they must put an end to this suspicion-mongering which they have been practising all these years. Where land is being purchased to consolidate White areas, where consolidation is taking place, or where land is being purchased in order to clear up Black spots, the United Party takes delight in sowing suspicion against the Nationalist Party Government and the Trust.</p>

<p>There is the admission. How did the suspicion arise? It arose because it was created by the United Party. One day they are congratulating themselves that they were the originators of the 1936 Act, but on the next, when it comes to the implementation of that Act, then they fail to acknowledge that legislation and say: &#x201C;Look how this Government is taking over the White man&#x2019;s land for occupation by the Black man&#x201D;. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, how the former member for King William&#x2019;s Town stood up here in this House and attacked this side of the House by saying that it was this Government who was handing over the precious soil of South Africa to the &#x201C;destroyers of ground,&#x201D; as he said.</p>

<p>I want to return to the congress which was held in East London. What about the suspicions which were sowed there? The hon. members who were present know what I am referring to. Suspicion was sown there in regard to the survival of East London in the White corridor.</p>

The hon. member for Krugersdorp, completely against the general area in which this debate takes place, decided to introduce the gold mining industry. I will have occasion later on to reply to the particular challenge which he has made. I really do not know what particular function the hon. member for Krugersdorp had in the mining industry but he displayed great ignorance of the management of a mine. He certainly has no idea of the vital Government functions which are performed by officials like the Government Mining Engineer. I can only come to the conclusion that he never had anything to do with the management of the mines. Perhaps he never rose above the collar of a shaft.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, what is symptomatic of his whole approach is his reference to the issue of decentralization; this is where I think we should start. He starts off by saying that this side of the House is against decentralization. We have never said anything of the kind. But, Sir, when we look at the issue of decentralization of industries there are certain things of which we must be aware. Why do you decentralize? You do so in the first instance for strategic reasons. The great powers, particularly where there is real danger of atomic warfare, are aware of this. It is held by most of the military strategists that it was this particular fact that lead Mr. Khrushchev some while back to begin to make friendly overtures to the Western world and to evolve his new policy of peaceful co-existence, because there was the realization that in Russia, in contrast to America, strategic industries were sited in a few well-defined areas. They were hence vulnerable to atomic attack. The military reasons for decentralization therefore are clearly established.</p>

<p>But you also decentralize very often for economic reasons. Quite clearly, when your centralization gets beyond a certain point then diseconomies arise in the form of bottlenecks on transportation systems and all sorts of other things. Very often attention is drawn to the fact that research which has been done has shown that the social costs of putting a worker in industry rise steeply as your city increases in size. But this is off-set by many other factors. There are certain disadvantages which follow from decentralization and these have been completely overlooked in this debate. For example, centralization of industry gives you a greater concentration of demand for goods and services and hence the distribution costs of those goods and services are lower. But the whole question of specialization is also greatly facilitated. What is more, the task of management is very much easier when there is centralization. It is no mere coincidence that the countries that have the highest productivity rate and the lowest production costs happen to be America, West Germany and Japan where they have the greatest degree of centralization of industry. But, Sir, we must also see it against this particular feature: In South Africa, although there is clustering of industry in certain areas, we do have a great degree of decentralization because these areas are widely dispersed. For example, between the Cape and the Witwatersrand there is a distance of almost 1,000 miles. Certainly South Africa has at this stage as great a degree of decentralization of industry as Brazil has or the Argentine, which are at comparable states of industrialization.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday also made great play of the fact that in Britain they succeeded in decentralizing and in uplifting some of the depressed areas. But what he did not indicate is that in Britain you had the infra-structure which was necessary, the services were there. Why did he not tell us about the south of Italy, where over many years they have had a concentrated attack on the problem, and attempt to decentralize industry to the south of Italy&#x2014;and have they had any success?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when you think of decentralization, particularly in our context, then it might also have sociological and political implications, and it is particularly in this context that we must view it. And hence we come up against the question of border areas. We are not against border areas as such but we want to draw attention to the economic features which are involved in this border area scheme. Sir, what is claimed for this border area scheme? What does the Government say? They say that the border area scheme will stimulate industrialization of the Bantu homelands themselves, because there will be a spillover effect. But in practice it will work in exactly the opposite way, it will in all probability retard economic development within the Bantu homelands because instead of having a spill-over effect there will be leaching effect. You are draining away the skills which are in the homelands and you are putting them in the border areas.</p>

<p>It is held also that the border area scheme is primarily designed to show that integration in the economic setting can be stopped. But this works in exactly the opposite way. Why are we taking the factories to the Bantu homelands? Precisely because they have the labour. Do we not in these border areas do away with some of the job reservation provisions? It is therefore not a question of stopping integration; it intensifies integration. It shows precisely <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0432"/>how dependent we are upon Black labour, and that is why we are taking our factories to the Bantu homelands.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The whole question of integration in industry is in fact largely an academic one. Professor Frankie put it this way some time ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question is not whether the economic frontier between Black and White should be abolished in modern economy. Economic forces have already abolished it.</block>

<p>But, Sir, it is also held that the border area scheme will lead to a reduction in the labour which will flow to it; indeed it will lead to a reduction in absolute numbers. What are the facts of the situation? Many figures are thrown across the floor of the House, but economists like Dr. Nieuwenhuizen and Stacey have estimated that we will have to provide job opportunities to the extent of 80,000 a year in order to contain those who are already in the homelands and who are seeking job opportunities from there. And what is happening now in terms of this border area scheme? The hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday indicated to us that over the last seven years they have in fact found employment for 53,000. Does this begin to look like a situation that is manageable? Does it begin to look as though it can stop this inflow? This particular development in the border areas has taken place at a cost of R250 million, and one could therefore work out what the per unit costs were to place these people, and you find that in many of these industries it is twice as high as it would have been if they had been sited in the normal conventional areas. We cannot reverse this sort of flow until such time as there is something else there which can draw them away. At the moment this whole border areas investment scheme accounts for about 3Â½ percent of our total capital investment. It does not even begin to look like doing what is claimed for it. That is why you find an economist like Dr. Nieuwenhuizen writing in <i>The S.A. Journal of Economics</i> saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Even on the most optimistic of assumptions, the creation of employment opportunities in or on the borders of the reserves will be unable to cater for the increasing population in these areas.</block>

<p>Now let me quote another authority, somebody who is a well-known economist, who sits on many Government boards and who even graces a seat in this House, although he is unfortunately not here at the moment. Having made an assessment of the border area scheme, what does he say? He wrote in the <i>Sabra</i> journal in October, 1956&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ten spyte van al die konsessies ten gunste van sekere grensnywerhede, het sulke grens geklassifiseerde nywerhede veel groter ontwikkeling in die blanke nywerheidsentra ondergaan as in die sogenaamde grensgebiede.</block>

<p>Our objection is that the border areas scheme can never be anything but a very small part in this whole pattern. We want to make the point that it can never do more than that because it is based on false economic premises. The modern economy is one which is primarily a metropolitan one. You cannot isolate industrialization from urbanization. The two are mutually attracting; they go together. Industry tends to move to the greatest concentration of population, in much the same way as water tends to flow to the lowest-lying places. It is because industry offers them something. It offers them entrepreneural and managerial skills, and quite apart from that it has the markets, and nowadays market is seen essentially as purchasing power. The moment you move away from this, you have additional transportation costs, you have lower skills, you do not have an industrial tradition, and hence your productivity is lower. If border development represents an extension of existing industrial areas, it is perfectly logical and that is why it works in Hammanskraal, Rosslyn and elsewhere. But you cannot just create new <i>foci</i> of growth out in the open. You cannot just take industries and string them out like beads of a necklace along the borders of a homeland. In any case, even if you did do it, what would you achieve thereby? You are merely coming nearer to your source of labour, and unskilled labour is one of the most mobile commodities you have in economics nowadays. These things do not get us anywhere nearer the solution to the problem. Economists for years have identified market-orientated industries. They have also identified supply-orientated industries, but here we are concerned with politically orientated industries, and these just do not exist and they have never worked before.</p>

<p>We go further. We say that this approach has inherent risks. What are the implied risks here? They are these. It will suggest to others that we are establishing border industries because we want to further primarily White interests. It will also create further friction, because we are not doing away with all job reservation provisions. Indeed, there are still restrictions that apply. But the greatest disadvantage of the scheme is that it does not even begin to get to the roots of the problem itself, and the problem is the economic development of the Bantu homelands themselves. This is our charge against the Government, that they are adopting primarily a negative <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0433"/>approach instead of a positive one. For example, look at the hon. the Deputy Minister when he was on the Rand last year, look at some of the surprising remarks he made. He told some of the municipalities up there that they must not provide such lavish amenities because this will tend to draw the Bantu from their own homelands to the urban areas. Surely the solution is obvious. If these amenities are lavish, you create others in the homelands which are equally lavish or more so, and that is the way you will probably reverse the flow. What is the Government doing at the moment? It is introducing a 5 percent limit and threatening legislation, but those are negative measures. Why do they not get to the roots of the problem, which is to develop the Bantu Homelands? Dr. Tomlinson made this quite clear in his report. He indicated that these areas could never support their own population and provide for growth unless they were industrialized. What is happening at the moment? To what extent are these areas being industrialized?</p>

<p>It is very difficult to get reliable figures. We know in terms of the Government&#x2019;s 1961 plans that R114 million was provided, and the hon. member for Heilbron was very loquacious on this score yesterday, but what does he not say? He does not indicate how much of that amount is for industrialization itself. The bulk of that money was for agriculture and for providing houses. What we are concerned with is what is being spent at the moment. The Bantu Investment Corporation, from what we can determine, has spent R6 million over the last seven years. What did Dr. Tomlinson indicate nearly ten years ago? He said that R60 million should be spent in ten years. The gap is tremendous. Why is the development so slow in these areas? The Government&#x2019;s approach is wrong. They are trying to use a Civil Service group to industrialize these areas. I do not want to decry the efforts of the Bantu Investment Corporation. I am sure they are doing the best they can, but you are concerned here with risk-taking and with business, and the Civil Service is probably the worst form of training for that type of risk-taking. And why must the taxpayers&#x2019; money be used in any case, when the industrialist can use his money?</p>

<p>These areas will not develop unless we use White capital and White enterprise. Now we come immediately to the problem as to why the Government wishes to prevent this and why they are not anxious to promote it? What are the reasons they have given us? The White Paper said that Black enterprise uninhibited by European or by White competition, should be allowed to develop these areas. But Black enterprise is non-existent in these areas. What is South Africa&#x2019;s prosperous position due to? It is due to the two important pillars of White initiative and Black labour. What are we doing in this case? We are denying these homelands precisely the two features which made South Africa prosperous. We deny them that important portant catalyst of White initiative, without which those areas will just not develop. What are the other reasons they have given us? They say it will lead to a form of economic colonization. But South Africa itself has received the benefit and the fruits of foreign investment to the extent of some R3,000 million. Even yesterday when the Minister was speaking he said: &#x201C;Ons kan buitelandse kapitaal nuttig gebruik&#x201D;, and this is a country which is already industrialized.</p>

<p>Mention to me one country in the world that started off without foreign capital and that has really made a success of industrialization. Then they say thirdly that if we have White capital and initiative there, it will lead to exploitation of the Black people. Now how does it fit in? I as an industrialist can site my factory five miles from a border area and be given every encouragement by the Government but then it is not exploitation. If however I move it five miles further away and it is inside the homeland, then all of a sudden it is exploitation. It does not begin to make sense. Obviously there must be certain controls and once the principle is accepted these controls could be introduced without any difficulty. One could ensure for example that some 51 percent of the equity might be in the hands of the Bantu Investment Corporation or some similar body. One could certainly stipulate time limits after which control might pass completely to the Black people. Instead of having freehold title you might have leasehold title. But provided there were no restrictions on the use of Black people and provided industrialists were given the encouragement that they are given at the moment to go to the border areas, they would go there and they would develop the areas.</p>

<p>If these areas become independent as the Government foreshadows, surely at that stage they are going to seek foreign capital, foreign initiative and foreign assistance. By not allowing our own people to go there at the moment, are we in fact not penalizing them because quite soon when these areas become independent, the Chinese and all sorts of other people are going there to assist them to develop economically. One therefore begins to suspect that there might be other deepseated reasons as to why the Government will not permit White capital and initiative there. Is the first one perhaps not that they are trying to prove that economic interdependence and economic integration does not work&#x2014;indeed this is a cornerstone of the whole apartheid philosophy. But it has worked all these years in South Africa. Indeed, if we were to disturb this pattern to-day of White initiative and Black labour, then South Africa would be bankrupt within six months. That is how important it is to South Africa. But one suspects also that there might be a more deepseated reason. Despite all their protestations, does the Government really want to make these Bantu homelands independent? Because if you wanted to do so and if you wanted to give them economic <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0434"/>viability, then this is the last way you would go about it. If we wanted to make the Free State independent would we deny them the skills and the capital from the rest of South Africa? Would we go and site our factories on their borders? This is the last way you would go about it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this just indicates once again another important weak link in the whole Government race philosophy. They say that we are against decentralization, but we are not. All that we are saying is that you can never achieve what we and what to some extent the Government wish to achieve in this particular field unless you put the pull in the border areas and make them stronger than they are at the moment, than the established urban areas. But then they always cloud the whole issue. They always put us before a false choice and they say to us in South Africa, &#x201C;You must either integrate or you must separate because there is nothing in between.&#x201D; But what has South Africa had for the past 300 years&#x2014;neither of these.</p>

<p>We have always followed the middle course and that has brought us to the prosperous position we have to-day. Indeed, our problems only started 20 years ago when they came with this policy of forced apartheid. What are the fundamental weaknesses in this policy? It is a policy of splitting, a policy of fission and what happens elsewhere when you resort to this form of splitting and fission. You get a violent explosion. It is not clear what has happened in Korea? For years nobody even knew it existed until it was carved up and split. Look at all the problems they had there. Look at Vietnam. Nobody knew that it existed until they cut it up and split it. This policy of splitting holds in itself tremendous dangers to South Africa. It does not take into account the realities of the South African situation and these are that there is complete economic interdependence. These are also that South Africa is a multi-racial, a diverse community consisting of people of different racial groups. No system can work unless we take this into account and provide for it. Politically speaking, there is no other way in which you could do it except through federation. The choice that we therefore put before South Africa is a simple one. South Africa must either federate or it will disintegrate. If it disintegrates there will follow in its wake chaos such as we have never seen before and then everything that we have built up over the years will be irrevocably lost.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what has struck me particularly since this debate assumed this tone are two arguments which have come from the Opposition side. The first came from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He used a new expression here, an expression which I resent his having used. He said that the border areas development plan of the Government was in fact nothing but economic colonialism. He tried to bring into disfavour in South Africa, and also, probably, in the outside world and among the people concerned, this endeavour to create an opportunity on a very large scale for the Bantu of South Africa to live within reach of their own homelands where they can enjoy certain privileges and where they can in fact be employed in such a way that they will be able to acquire a place of their own and in the meanwhile also undergo a process of self-development which must eventually result in a major rehabilitation plan, a major plan to enable the Bantu to develop their own areas. That was the attitude adopted by the hon. member. The other attitude adopted by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was that of condemning on economic grounds the possibility of the development of the Bantu race groups along with the White within the framework of a policy of developing the border areas. The hon. member therefore says that whatever we do cannot withstand the test of time and in fact cannot show real viability for the future when tested by economic standards. The hon. member says that this plan of the Government must therefore fail in this process. The hon. member said quite a number of things. In every few sentences he made some very challengable assertion. There is a whole series of them. I hope I shall have the time to reply to quite a few of the assertions made by the hon. member. I must tell the hon. member that many of the assertions made by him are not quite correct. They are factually incorrect.</p>

<p>I come to the first assertion made by the hon. member. He says that the aims of the Government to bring about development in the border areas&#x2026;</p>

<p>Business interrupted in accordance with Standing Order No. 30 (2) and debate adjourned.</p>

<p>The House proceeded to the consideration of private members&#x2019; business.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in view of the very serious danger of depletion of our marine resources, as a result of both external and internal overfishing, this House requests the Government immediately to consider the advisability of&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) extending our territorial waters to a minimum of 12 sea miles;</li>

<li>(b) proclaiming a further fisheries zone and taking appropriate steps to obtain international recognition therefor;</li>

<li><span class="col_835-836" refersTo="page_0435"/>(c) appointing a commission of inquiry into all aspects of our own fishing industry, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the granting of licences and quotas.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">This House further requests the Government to co-ordinate the findings of such an inquiry with those of a similar inquiry at present being conducted in South West Africa in order to formulate a common policy in regard to the exploitation and conservation of marine resources off the coasts of both South West Africa and the Republic.</block>

<p>In moving this motion, I should like to refer to what I believe is a misconception as regards the speech of the hon. member for Moorreesburg during the last sitting. I submit that there is some confusion in the minds of hon. members when it is thought that the hon. member for Moorreesburg&#x2019;s motives and mine in asking for a Government inquiry into our fishing industry are the same. If I may quote briefly from his speech, the main points that he made were that we had an annual catch of 1Â½ million tons, that there has been an increase in the scope of the fishing industry of 13,000 percent, and that the Government had taken important measures to give the industry more scope. In fact the whole emphasis of his speech was on development and further expansion. His main cause for complaint was that there were certain bottlenecks and certain problems, and for that reason he asked for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into &#x201C;these hitches, bottlenecks and&#x2014;please note&#x2014;new possible points of growth in the industry&#x201D;. I thought at the time that he was referring to the difficulty of getting Bantu labour and other similar problems in the industry. I see now that his main objective was to expand the existing industry My motive is quite different. My motive is that because the fishing industry has expanded so fast and so far that there is a serious danger of depletion of our marine resources.</p>

<p>There has been another opinion, and that is, in view of the statement of the then Minister of Economic Affairs at the end of the discussion on his vote during the last session that it had been decided by the Government to appoint a commission, that it is unnecessary for me to have introduced this motion. It is not at all unnecessary for me to introduce this motion, because we have had experience of the Government&#x2019;s attitude towards the establishment of other commissions. I refer just in passing to the False Bay Commission. There had been requests for years and years that False Bay should be closed to trawling. After years of protest and agitation the Government ultimately, in December, 1964, decided to appoint a commission. That commission sat early in 1965. Its report only came out towards the end of 1966 and that report, according to the Minister, is still being considered by the Cabinet. I maintain that there is considerable urgency in this matter. Unless the Government takes immediate and effective steps, there is a more than serious danger of our marine resources being depleted.</p>

<p>I have to substantiate my charge. In doing so I should like to refer to our South African fishing areas. In the first place we have the trawling areas, the recognized trawling banks &#x2014;West Bank, Dassen Island, Cape Columbine and Danger Point. Hake, soles and kingklip are trawled in these areas. Then we have what are known as the shoal fish areas, where pilchards, maasbanker, mackerel and anchovy are netted. These areas centre on the West Coast, north of Cape Town. Then there are the recognized line-fishing areas such as the Wild Coast and the area south of Durban.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer briefly to the fishing areas of South West Africa. As you know, Sir, the chief centres of this industry are at Walvis Bay where there are ten factories&#x2014;an industry concentrating mainly on pilchards&#x2014; and at Luderitz where there are four factories, concerned mainly with the catching of rock lobster. We have seen considerable growth in all these areas in the last 20 years. In 1938, the total tonnage of fish caught in the South African and South West African waters was a mere 64,306 tons. This came mainly from canning and freezing of rock lobster and line fishing. By 1948, by way of deep-sea trawling, the tonnage was 46,610; in addition, because the pilchard industry had just been established, 82,000 tons of pilchards were trawled. In all, there was a total of 186,000 tons. By 1966 we had taken from our waters and from the waters of South West Africa 1,250,000 tons. We have become, as hon. members will know, the eighth largest fishing nation in the world. We have a fleet of over 1,000 boats. The capital investment in those boats is over R60 million. There are over 50 depots and factories. A considerable amount of Bantu and Coloured labour is used in the fishing industry. Our exports from the fishing industry alone amount to in excess of R50 million. I think it is interesting to note that we ourselves are very poor consumers of fish. In actual fact South Africans consume only 10.1 lb. of fish <i>pet capita</i> per annum. In contrast to this, the figure for Japan is 70 lb. and that for Norway 55 lb.</p>

<p>I shall now substantiate my allegation that there has been over-fishing. I shall deal in the first place with the shoal fish of South West Africa. The first fishmeal factory and cannery was established in 1948 and 8,700 tons of pilchards were taken in the South West African area in 1949. In 1953 it had grown to 289,000 tons. Then the fishing authorities took fright. They pegged the fishmeal plant capacity. They restricted the number of factories. They limited boat capacity. They discontinued the system of &#x201C;seasons&#x201D; and they set a quota system of 250,000 tons. No sooner had they set that quota than they raised it to 540,000 tons per annum in 1963. To-day it stands at 720,000 tons, consisting almost exclusively of pilchards. In 1964 the raw fish catch of South West Africa was 794,856 tons. The fishmeal <span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0436"/>from that raw fish catch was 191,420 tons. The fish oil amounted to 34,739 tons. In 1965-&#x2019;66 there was a drop of over 90,000 to a raw fish catch of 704,631 tons. Fishmeal production dropped to 171,270 tons and the fish oil produced amounted to 33,504 tons.</p>

<p>I shall now turn to our own industry. The shoal fish catch in South Africa, as you know, Sir, is governed by quota. In 1965-&#x2019;66 the total shoal catch was 444,276 tons. The pilchard catch was 132,691 tons. The mackerel catch was 61,163 tons. The maasbanker catch was 48,374 tons and the anchovy catch, an entirely new catch, was 202,048 tons. This meant a drop of 91,806 tons on the 1964-&#x2019;65 season, in spite of the fact that the fishing industry had made representations to the department concerned for the extension of the open fishing season by one month. What is the attitude of the Director of Fisheries? He discusses the situation in his 1965-&#x2019;66 report and he speaks of what he calls &#x201C;the new <i>composition</i> of the Cape&#x2019;s shoal catch&#x201D;. This is what he says:</p>

<block name="quote">The most significant change in the pelagic fishing industry has been the progressive reduction in the landings of pilchards. Nevertheless the industry has maintained its landings at a more or less constant level, mainly because of good catches of anchovies.</block>

<p>He goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">It has not yet been proved, but it is nevertheless believed that this apparent disruption of the equilibrium between the two species is due to the sustained high rate of exploitation of the pilchards.</block>

<p>He says further:</p>

<block name="quote">It is hoped that the increased effort extended towards the catching of anchovies will in due course cause a reversal and a return to normal conditions.</block>

<p>Mr. Du Plessis, the Managing Director of the Fishing Development Corporation, said:</p>

<block name="quote">If it had not been for the anchovy catch, faces in the industry would have been even longer than they are now.</block>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Speaker, the little anchovy of approximately five inches long, is keeping our shoal fishing industry alive at the moment.</p>

<p>What about the history of the pilchard, to give a further example? In 1942 and 1943 it is common knowledge that there were sighted off St. Helena Bay large concentrations of a fish very similar to the sardine that used to be caught off the Californian coast. The Government welcomed this find and gave all possible assistance to the establishment of factories at Saldanha Bay and Lambert&#x2019;s Bay. In 1952, that is ten years later, the pilchard catch exceeded 300,000 tons. Then, to quote the language of the Director of Fisheries, the shoals &#x201C;thinned out&#x201D;, and in 1956 there were only 170,000 tons of shoal fish taken, of which 84,000 tons were pilchards. What did the boats do? They ranged further and further afield. Bigger boats were built and they came south towards Cape Town and Saldanha and even into False Bay. Vertical echo sounding devices were installed in these boats, new factories were erected at Hout Bay, and the fish were found further south. By 1958 the industry had recovered. It is not a matter for congratulation that the industry should have recovered by 1958 with the aid of new devices and by travelling further south to find the shoals that had been chased from further north. Be that as it may, it had recovered to such an extent that 214,000 tons of pilchards were taken from the shoal fish catch of 298,000 tons. The quotas were immediately changed to a system of &#x201C;open&#x201D; and &#x201C;closed&#x201D; seasons making it more advantageous for the catching of fish by the industry. What did the Director of Fisheries say? He hoped that there would be a return to &#x201C;normal&#x201D; conditions. And what were the &#x201C;normal&#x201D; conditions to which he referred? In 1962 there was a pilchard catch of 452,735 tons, in 1963 441,943 tons, in 1964 282,301 tons, in 1965 225,067 tons, and in 1966, without counting the extended one month season, the catch was 125,766 tons, and that in the enormous area of sea between the Orange River mouth and Cape Agulhas, including the waters of False Bay. That represents a drop of 326,000 tons over a period of five years.</p>

<p>Recently we have had announced with acclaim the discovery of sonar, horizontal scanners for the pilchards fleets. According to the agent for the horizontal scanners, the original object of the investigation was to conduct research on two broad fronts: to plot the movements of fish further out than usual catching, and to find shoals and guide fishing boats to them. &#x201C;The fish,&#x201D; he says &#x201C;for a variety of reasons, seem to be concentrating further out to sea. Previously the boats set out from the ports. A few went up the coast, and others went down, within sight of the shore. When one boat found a concentration of fish he called up the other by radio-telephone and the boats converged on this point, catching fish until they filled their holds.&#x201D; All of these devices have resulted in the industry struggling to catch fish near to the shore and finding it necessary to go further out to sea, and indeed they are catching fish at a distance of from 30 to 50 miles from the shore at the moment.</p>

<p>What happened in California? It has been quoted in this House before. In 1937, 761,000 tons of pilchards were caught, and then the shoals began &#x201C;to thin out&#x201D;. In 1947, 248,000 tons were caught, and in 1950 only 2,000 tons were caught. That was the crash of the whole industry.</p>

<p>Is it only the pilchard industry that is in danger? What about the perlemoen industry? In 1965-&#x2019;66 in this industry a record quantity of 1,507,620 lbs. were processed. But scientists <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0437"/>now fear that abalone stocks are being overexploited, and legislation is to be introduced limiting the yearly catch to about 900,000 lbs. According to the report before me the previous year was a record year. The report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The high-catch figures achieved in the past few years do not mean that there are suddenly more abalone. It is because the fishing effort has increased tremendously. In fact, the catch per unit of effort is half of what it was in 1960.</block>

<p>I now come to rock lobster. One of the scientists attached to the Sea Fisheries Department made a detailed study of South African rock lobster species. It was found that there are signs which could have been caused by exploitation of the west coast rock lobster at too high a level. As regards Mount Vema, the Vema lobster was first exploited last year, and at the end of last year catches had petered out almost completely. Two conclusions can be drawn, Sir. Either the lobsters were forced to leave because of pollution, or else because of over-exploitation.</p>

<p>What about the line-fishing industry? A report by the General Manager of the Fisheries Development Corporation says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African line fishing industry, with a catch of just over 30,000 tons a year, has made little progress for a quarter of a century.</block>

<p>What about tunny? The Marlin and Tuna Club reports that in 1963-&#x2019;64 there were 3,034 tunny caught on rod and reel. In 1964-&#x2019;65 only 2,000 were caught, whilst in 1965-&#x2019;66 but 300 were caught. What I have referred to up to now is the position as far as our own industry is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, what is the position regarding foreigners? We have had newspaper reports, we have had warnings by Ministers on various occasions about the danger of overfishing outside our territorial waters. There have been reports that Russia has a fleet that has been expanded by three factory ships and dozens of ultra-modern long-distance trawlers. This fleet is probably the most modern in the world. It exceeds sixty craft. As regards Japan, three more 20,000-ton fishmeal factory ships are on order in Japanese ship-yards. Spain has a fleet of approximately 50 vessels specially designed for service in South African waters. The latest trawler is described by fishermen as revolutionary. It is fitted with a unique suction pump designed to suck fish from the purse seine net into an internal conveyor system for cooling in brine tanks amidships. Japan, Korea and Nationalist China, West Germany, Holland, Italy, France, Israel, Belgium, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria&#x2014;all of these countries are fishing outside our territorial waters. The South African industry itself is expanding with the introduction of floating factory ships and fleets of attendant trawlers. Besides the recently converted Willem Barendsz, work is under way on the conversion of Kosmos V, owned by the Buitesee Viskorporasie (Bpk.), which is a jointly owned subsidiary of KaapKunene and Ovenstones. Negotiations are well under way for the purchase and conversion of a third factory ship.</p>

<p>Where is this all going to end? What does the Director of Fisheries say? On 7th October, 1966, he said as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Foreign fishing vessels seem to be converging more and more on this part of the ocean and making use of the facilities of our ports for trans-shipping frozen fish to refrigerated cargo vessels&#x2026; Thoughts in South Africa are gradually being directed towards the institution of international control over fishing activities in the South-East Atlantic Ocean. Because of a decline in the trawl fish catches in the Cape waters in the past few years, the Division of Fisheries has undertaken a programme to investigate whether the trawling grounds are being over-fished.</block>

<p>I quote Mr. van Eck of the same division&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is of great importance to know what has happened to our stocks. It appears from figures that the traditional Cape grounds are being over-fished, but this is not conclusive. To be certain that there has been overfishing age determination studies must be made too.</block>

<p>And so it goes on. There are reports about investigations that have to be made, while nothing is being done. I believe that we as a nation are conservation-minded. It dates back to the original visit in 1889 of the American schooner, one of the first purse seine netters in the Cape. An immediate outcry after that visit resulted in the passing of a Fish Protection Act in 1893 and thereafter the appointment in 1896 of a marine biologist and a survey of the Agulhas Bank. The next survey took place in 1920 in the Dassen Island grounds and then, as we all know, we had the two research vessels <i>Africana I</i> and <i>Africana II.</i> What else has the industry done; what else has the Government done? It has imposed quotas; it has established seasons and it has defined net sizes but, every so often, it has relaxed its own regulations to suit the representations of the industry. It has extended the territorial waters to six miles and claimed sovereignty over our continental shelf in terms of the Geneva Convention of 1958. It has created a further six-mile fishing zone. In terms of the Railways and Harbours Amendment Act of 1965, it has the power to refuse facilities to foreign nations engaged in a boycott against us. In last year&#x2019;s Railway Budget higher wharfage dues were imposed on foreign factory ships and foreign trawlers using our harbours. But no sooner was a protest made by our local industry on the ground that we were losing valuable foreign <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0438"/>exchange than those wharfage dues were lifted. New sets of regulations were drawn up in 1966 and various committees were appointed, the most important of which, I believe, is the Boat Limitation Committee which went into the number of boats catching pilchards, maasbankers, mackerels and anchovies. Provision was made for monthly returns of catches made, and for more boats to patrol our sea boundaries. The question arises as to what else we should do, I believe that we should take several steps. The first is that we should extend our present territorial sea from six miles to 12 miles off both the South African and the South West African coast. In doing so we would be supported by the recommendation of the International Law Commission of 1958 in its report on the Geneva Conference that the right of a coastal state to fix the limit of its territorial sea is not disputed but that international law does not permit that limit to be extended beyond 12 miles. Secondly, I believe that we should proclaim a maritime conservation zone because this is one of the current trends in international law. We should bear in mind, in doing so, the extent of our continental shelf. In the south the average width of our continental shelf between Hangklip and Mossel Bay is 70 miles; in the west it is 36 miles; in the east it is 15 miles. We have plenty of precedents for the proclamation of a maritime conservation zone, going back to the Truman Proclamations in America in 1945 when it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the pressing need for conservation and the protection of fisheries resources, the Government of the United States of America regards it as proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the High Seas contiguous to the coasts of the United States of America.</block>

<p>The President further authorized &#x201C;the enactment of provisions for the administration, regulation and control of the fishery resources of and fishing activities in such zones&#x201D;. Sir, it was not a claim to exclusive authority over fishery exploitation in the High Seas. The Americans were simply concerned with emphasizing that the right of entry into their conservation zones by foreigners was conditional on those foreigners participating in their conservation schemes. That, I believe, is a sensible step which the Government can take. We also have further precedents. In 1952 Chile, Ecuador and Peru, by way of the Santiago Declaration, established a maritime zone of 200 miles from their coast and declared those areas to be subject to exclusive sovereignty of the claimants, not only for the conservation of marine flora and fauna but for the exploitation of those resources. Sir, the modern trend is in favour of unilateral fishing regulation and we should follow suit, as Argentina followed suit only five days ago when they unilaterally extended their maritime jurisdiction over the adjacent waters to 200 nautical miles from low tide. In addition in the proclamation, sovereignty is extended to adjacent sea bed and sub-soil of the submarine zones up to the 200 metre isobar. Regulations are about to be promulgated by the Argentine Government and in the meantime foreigners are expected to observe certain requirements which are clearly stipulated in their announcement.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sir, I believe that the time has come when the Government should act and convene an international fishing conference. As far as I am aware, in almost all the important fishing oceans of the world, there are conventions governing the exploitation and the conservation of marine resources in those oceans, and yet the waters around our coasts, so rich in marine resources, for some reason or other, are governed neither by convention nor by agreement, Sir, if we convene such a conference we have precedent after precedent for sea conventions, and claims to larger maritime belts, and judging by happenings in recent years and months, I believe that our claims would be well supported and that agreement would be obtained.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>It was with interest that I listened to the speech made by the hon. member for Simonstown, and I was very glad to see that he approached this matter very calmly and in a serious manner, somewhat different from the way in which he approached it about a year ago; then, shortly before the election of 1966, he came out rather strongly against the commission which was at that time conducting an investigation into fishing in the False Bay area. He very obviously tried to make some political capital out of it. I am glad that the hon. member can now at least forget the election and that he approached the subject from a broader point of view to-day and that he&#x2014;I think this is the purport of his speech&#x2014;expressed serious concern in particular about the possible damaging and depletion of our fish resources. We can assure the hon. member that we on this side of the House agree with him as far as the general purport of his argument is concerned and that in the main we share his views.</p>

<p>The sea definitely remains one of man&#x2019;s greatest reserves with a view to future provision of food for the growing population of the world. During the past two decades the nations of the world have turned to the sea in very large measure and have made very serious attempts to exploit and to use the riches of the sea. Therefore, it is not surprising and it was high time that our industrialists in South Africa should direct their efforts to taking their rightful share in the exploitation of the riches of the sea and making it available to our nation, and also harnessing it in order to earn foreign exchange for South Africa. We have undoubtedly had tremendous success in this direction during the past 20 years. I think we can extend a word of congratulation to our industrialists who have entered this field which is a new one for South <span class="col_843-844" refersTo="page_0439"/>Africa, and who have developed our fishing industry from a very small and modest beginning to a considerable industry which today earns R50 to R60 million in foreign exchange for South Africa and in that way makes a very important contribution as far as supplying food for our own population is concerned, even if it is the case, as the hon. member for Simonstown said, that our population&#x2019;s consumption of sea products, of fish, is still relatively low. It is undoubtedly so that we have not yet become really fish and seafood conscious, but we can also expect that our people will consume fish to an increasing extent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to repeat the data which the hon. member for Simonstown gave us here; I just want to emphasize some of the facts once again and change the perspective a little. The position at the present moment is that we have a fishing fleet of 139 trawlers with a total tonnage of 13,480 which is concentrating upon one branch of the fishing industry, namely the catching of shoalfish for the purpose of producing fish-meal and fish-oil. The hon. member pointed out that our annual catch amounts to approximately 1Â¼ million tons. We have to mention another figure in addition to that, and that is that at the present moment an annual total of 4,160,000 tons of fish is caught along the African coast, that is to say, along the coast of Angola and the Republic. In other words, foreign powers catch nearly three times as much fish along the African coast as South Africa herself does. That means that we are not exploiting our fish potential to the full, but that other powers are deriving great benefit from it and are exploiting it to their advantage; and therefore, where the hon. member advocates the necessity of appointing a commission of inquiry, especially in view of the danger of our fish resources becoming depleted, another consideration we have to bear in mind is that we are in competition and that we shall gain nothing by reducing and severely restricting our own catches while foreign powers come and take off the riches of the sea. I must add to that that the hon. member put forward a proposal to extend our territorial waters and our fishing zone, by means of which he wants to try and restrict the catches. But we have to keep in mind that South Africa, in relation to the riches of our seas and our fishing resources, is exploiting only a modest portion and that the rest is being exploited by other powers.</p>

<p>In actual fact there are three branches to our fishing industry. The first is the catches for the production of fish-meal and fish-oil, which are made mainly by our trawlers which catch shoals of fish for our factories by means of nets, but then we have another branch to our fishing industry, namely the catching of so-called whitefish for the purpose of obtaining supplies of fresh and frozen fish which are offered mainly on the fish markets of the world, both in our country and overseas. It is interesting that this is a smaller branch of the industry, but nonetheless an important one. A catch of nearly 200 million pounds of whitefish&#x2014;of various kinds, of which stockfish was the most important&#x2014;was made in 1957 and the value at landing of those fish amounted to R4,202,777. Stockfish accounted for 133 million pounds of that total of 200 million pounds. In other words, nearly three quarters of the total was made up of the more popular variety. In 1960 catches rose to 258,898,000 pounds and the value thereof at landing was nearly R5,900,000. In 1961 the catch was 247 million pounds with a value at landing of R5,265,000. In 1965 the catch was 229,626,000 pounds, with a value at landing of R5,753,000. I am mentioning these figures merely to show that we have a branch of the fishing industry here which remains at a reasonably steady level, and I want to repeat that it is an important branch of the industry and one in the field of which, in my opinion, there is still a reasonable opportunity for expansion. It is, if I may put it in this way, the difficult part of the industry. If we now argue that we have to think seriously of stricter measures for preserving our fishing resources, then we must remember that we cannot make rules which are simply applied to other branches of the fishing industry as well, and that we have an industry here which we should encourage, and that the development possibilities of that industry should be further investigated, and that there are many facets which should be investigated with a view to further development and extension.</p>

<p>The third branch of our fishing industry is our rock lobster industry, which also means a great deal to South Africa by way of earning exchange on the foreign market and which, in addition, is to an increasing extent making a contribution as far as supplying food to our own nation is concerned. I want to emphasize to-day that our Government has over the years been deeply conscious of the danger of depletion. The hon. member mentioned that, The Department is conscious of the danger and that warning voice has been heard. But although the Department has been aware of the danger of depletion, it could not simply put a spoke in the wheel and impose restrictions upon the industry. Planning was necessary and the entrepreneurs in the industry had to be encouraged to develop it as far as possible and to exploit the potential of our fishing resources in the interests of the country. That has also been done in the case of our rock lobster industry, which is one of the branches where a system of control and restrictions has been developed over the years, a system which is a fairly strict one in my opinion. In the rock lobster industry we have the breeding areas which are forbidden territory and where catching is not allowed, and we have a closed season which extends from 1st June to 30th September, which has again been extended during the past year, and which is subject to change every year according to circumstances. It is important that the fishing <span class="col_845-846" refersTo="page_0440"/>community which forms part of the industry should co-operate very well with the Government and the Department and should always declare themselves prepared to observe the restrictions which are imposed. When the closed season is extended it is usually the fishermen themselves who fall in with it and who make suggestions as to how it could best be done. I think I must mention that our fishing community have a positive approach and that they also take a long-term view and would like to see our fishing industry being stabilized, because that is, of course, not only in the interests of the country, but also in their interest. I think the Department has over the years provided an example of proper planning and preservation of our rock lobster and fishing industry in this regard.</p>

<p>As regards our fishing industry, especially the fish-meal industry, there are also severe restrictions. There are restrictions in respect of processing units. People cannot simply establish more factories and start producing fishmeal. There is a restriction on processing units and a severe restriction on the tonnage allocated and the number of trawlers which may be made available to exploit the quotas. If the hon. member advocates restrictions and stricter control, I think he should join us in giving the Government credit for the fact that a tremendously great deal has already been done.</p>

<p>I now want to come to his proposal in regard to our territorial waters and the extension of our fishing zones. It is not such an easy matter to act unilaterally in regard to these things. In the old days the limits of the territorial waters were fixed on the basis of the range of any particular country&#x2019;s weapons, and the limit decided upon three miles, which was approximately the range of the naval guns of the various countries. But not all countries fell in with that. Norway, for example, set the limit of their territorial waters at four miles, and Greece decided on six miles some years ago. We know that in 1930 the League of Nations held a conference to arrive at an international agreement in regard to this matter, and in 1960 a U.N. conference was held at Geneva. Only one vote was lacking to secure a two-thirds majority for deciding upon a six-twelve mile limit, that is to say, six miles of territorial waters and a twelve-mile fishing zone. I think that testifies to the awareness of the countries of the world, members of the U.N., which have an interest in this industry, of the dangers of depleting our marine resources and of their willingness to co-operate. I repeat that one vote was lacking for a two-thirds majority in favour of such a resolution. In other words, two-thirds but one of the members of that conference voted in favour of this six-mile limit for territorial waters and a twelve-mile fishing zone. It is therefore world-wide phenomenon that the nations which have an interest in the fishing industry want to conserve the riches of the sea.</p>

<p>But now the question is whether we can do what the hon. member has asked, namely to extend our territorial waters to 12 miles unilaterally and to extend our fishing zones unilaterally to 25 or 100 miles or even further, as other countries have tried to do, Then I want to say that through the years South Africa has always respected existing conventions in her international relations. I think that by doing that South Africa has earned herself a good reputation in international relations, and if we were to take such a decision unilaterally to-day, I wonder whether we would increase our prestige in international relations. As the hon. member said, there are quite a few countries that go in for fishing along our South African coast, outside our fishing zone, and he also mentioned the countries, such as Russia and Spain, which have the largest fleets. The question is now what we can achieve by that, and I think in the first place we shall give offence to foreign powers. But we can also very easily create international incidents which can have bad consequences. It is very difficult to imagine that the countries which have gone in for fishing along our coast for many years will simply allow themselves to be chased away and to be deprived of the right to catch fish there by a unilateral decision of South Africa. If we think of the position of South West Africa in world politics, we are convinced that that decision can have very serious consequences particularly as regards South West Africa. Therefore I am not very strongly in favour of this idea that we should extend our territorial waters and our fishing zone by means of a unilateral decision of the Government, but I think that the Government should approach this matter very carefully and that the Department of Commerce and Industries through its Sub-department of Sea Fisheries should rather give consideration to ways and means which are within our reach to encourage our fishing industry, to investigate further our methods of fishing and the extent of our marine resources, and to see what improvements we can bring about, and to keep the industry on a sound basis in this way and to try and stabilize it for the future.</p>

<p>I may say that we should not take the figures in respect of the annual catches too seriously and accept that the industry is going to ruin, because statistics show that catches run in cycles. One year they are bad and the next year a little better and the year after that perhaps a good deal better, and then you have years of a gradual decline again, and then there are periods of better catches again, Thus 1966 was a bad fishing year, but the indications are that we shall experience better times again. In the main I want to identify myself with what the hon. member said, but I want to ask that we should act with circumspection as far as extending our territorial waters is concerned, and that we should act wisely and should co-operate in order to preserve and develop our fishing resources for the future.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from><span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0441"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I support the motion moved by the hon. member for Simonstown, and I would like to congratulate him on the speech he made. I think his speech could be a handbook for the Minister who is handling this matter. The amount of information and the facts that have been garnered show a tremendous amount of research and investigation, and in a short and concise speech the hon. member has placed the emphasis where it belongs and has submitted this information to us here in Parliament. I think I can sum up what was said by the hon. member who has just sat down by saying that he also approves of the resolution, and much of what he has said is really in support of the motion, although perhaps from a slightly different angle. But I want to say this in regard to what the last speaker has said, and think it is implicit in what was said by the mover of the motion, and that is that in this motion there is no condemnation of anyone. There may be criticism implied in respect of some aspects of our fishing industry, but this is an objective attempt to deal with an industry which, as the figures have shown, is the basis of one of the big industrial projects in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to approach this problem from a slightly different angle from that of the mover and the last speaker. Throughout the history of commercial fishing in South Africa the emphasis has, probably quite rightly, been laid on the Western coast and the cold waters there, That emphasis has tended to take away official and private interests from the eastern shores with their warm waters, and I think that is a great pity, but it may have been a blessing in disguise. If indeed an investigation shows that there is over-fishing taking place on the west coast and in the Cape Peninsula area, then possibly it may be that we have an unexpected reserve of fish on the east coast where the warm waters are, The lack of appreciation of the potential on the east coast has been shown by successive Governments right from the time of Union in the failure to make provision for fishing harbours and for adequate facilities for the catching and the processing of fish on the east coast. The argument has been used repeatedly on the basis of fishing that was undertaken by fishing research vessels in the past, and so on, that the waters on the east coast have not the fish to the extent that the cold waters have it in the Atlantic ocean. That of course may be true to a very great extent when one looks at it from the point of view of shoal fish and the accepted orthodox type of commercial fishing that is taking place on the west coast. But even the techniques in connection with fishing are changing. The hon. member for Simonstown pointed to some of the new scientific methods that are being adopted in the Cape. And it may well be that new techniques may provide us with an unexpected reserve of fish on the east coast. On the west coast&#x2014;I think it was the Japanese who have come with this long-line fishing as I think it is called and which is something quite new in our experience&#x2014;the method of long-line fishing is being copied and is producing a tremendous quantity of fish, which has nothing to do with shoal fish.</p>

<p>On the east coast we have a development which as far as I know has not been duplicated on the west, and that is the development of the ski-boat as it is called. Small craft are used, usually with a crew of not more than four at the outside, powered with two very high-powered and fast outboard motors, able to get out to a distance of several miles and able to get in again quickly if the weather should turn against them. Last year they produced, according to figures that I have received, something over two million pounds weight of fish. That two million pounds weight of fish is little in regard to the whole. But then I want to point out that it is a technique that has not been developed elsewhere. And it has this advantage. That two million pounds weight of fish comes here into the South African market for consumption in our own country. And this is one of the things that I am concerned with, Because, I believe that South Africa, broadly speaking, is paying a price internally, at overseas levels. We are paying an internal price at overseas levels, and that goes for the lot, be it crayfish or rock lobster or whatever they may want to call it to-day, right down through the whole gamut of fish and fish products. It is because of the export trade and the fact that we do get good prices overseas. People do not want to sell at the old prices, the cheap prices here in South Africa. The result is that sometimes you can get good beef which has taken the farmer five years to raise, with all the risks of drought and all the rest of it, at a cheaper price than what you have to pay sometimes for seafood which is acquired at the goodwill of the Almighty from the waters that flow round our coast. One of the places to be provided with the benefits of our fishing industry should surely be our own country and our own people. This is where some of the benefits, I should say one of the major benefits of care and protection and the consideration of our fishing industry may pay good dividends. And where I mention two million pounds of fish on the east coast taken by ski-boats last year, I am not saying that that is a vast quantity of fish. I am saying that its value lies in the fact that it is brought in fresh, sold forthwith and consumed by our own people, at a price which is by and large, generally speaking, a reasonable price, under all the circumstances. The east coast is also developing another technique and the more reason why I should like to see an inquiry and investigation into the matter raised in paragraph (c) of the motion of the hon. member for Simonstown, namely to go into the whole question of the relationship between commercial fishing and our angling community, the anglers. It should cover the whole of the development along the sea coast. I am not quite certain what the position is in the Cape. Originally, at the time of Union, the <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0442"/>two maritime provinces were left with certain legal powers which vested in their provincial councils, with regard to our semi-enclosed bays, estuaries and lagoons. I am not sure whether the Cape has more or less handed over those powers to the Central Government. We still exercise some of those powers in so far as Natal is concerned. There is growing up a truly tremendous interest with a huge crowd of supporters for spear-fishing. Now, whether it be line fishing, that is the ordinary angler fishing from the rocks, a ski-boat or a pleasure boat that is fitted out for the purpose, or whether it is spear-fishing or some other form of inshore angling as it is called to-day, the fact remains that that fish is being taken relatively close to the coast. But it is producing a tremendous interest in so far as the sporting side is concerned. And we are now starting to draw sportsmen from all over the world. It is not publicized. Apart from the people who know something about it and who are interested in it, it is not even generally known, not even by our own folk who may be living alongside the beach. We are getting people coming from the other side of the world to come and take part in spear-fishing. We have already had recommendations from the spear-fishing fraternity in Natal for protected areas in the waters off the coast of Natal, because of the possibility that that fish may be annihilated through the upsurge of spear-fishing activities. I have no figures and I do not think figures are available to show us exactly the amount of fish that is being taken. You may see in the newspapers now and again a picture of a man holding up a big catch of something or other and saying that that was what he took with his spear and that it weighed 30 lb., 40 lb., or 50 lb., or whatever it may be. That is just about the only publicity you get for it, This is one of the amenities of South Africa to-day. In the same way as big game fishing in other countries attracts people from all over the world and brings in a tremendous amount of revenue, so here our angling and spear-fishing and associated activities can bring in an enormous amount of revenue for us in South Africa. I listened with interest to what the hon. member who has just sat down had to say in connection with the limit, the fixing of a limit, and the difficulties which we may encounter internationally. In regard to the waters close inshore there can be no difficulty and there can be no doubts. Fish proliferates there but it can be augmented. Other countries have found that it is possible to augment the fish in their inshore waters by taking certain measures. Let me give you an interesting discovery from my own experience. Many years ago when I was a young man we had a disease which wiped out the whole of the mussels on the Natal coast. The mussels there which appeared above high tide mark and below low tide mark, not only in the inter-tidal zone as they call it, but way down below that, were virtually wiped out. You could go across rocks there for miles and miles along the coast and you would not see one single mussel. But gradually spats started to come in again from a few odd individuals that had been left, they began to build up and to-day again right from the Transkei border to the Portuguese border at Ouro Point, the mussels are there again in their millions. That is the basic food supply for a whole group of fishes which come inshore for the purpose of those mussels. On the west coast plankton is the big food or main food in the ocean. We do not have plankton to any great extent on the east coasá¹­ at all, We have a different kind of <i>animalculae</i>in the sea there. That is why we have a different kind of fish. The protection of the basic food requirements of the habitat&#x2014;the food in the habitat&#x2014;of the fish there can as I have said augment our fish supply and build up the interests in so far as the angling fraternity are concerned and the people who are prepared to make a sport out of inshore angling. And if I go no further than the coastline of my own province it gives us well over 400 miles of coastline. Already we are receiving requests for protection because of the tremendous drain that is already being exerted on those fishes. But apart from that there is little in the way of commercial exploitation. You may find it perhaps on the fishing bank, on the Agulhas bank where the MoÃ§ambique current comes down, where you have one or two of the fishing companies who are doing a certain amount of commercial fishing by means of old, time-honoured methods that they have adopted for the last 50 years or more.</p>

<p>New techniques and new methods can find new ways of catching fish. Perhaps an investigation will show that new methods can find new ways of catching fish. Perhaps an investigation will show that new methods will find, as I say, an untold wealth of fish on the east coast, 10, 12, 15 or even 20 miles out. I do agree with what the hon. member and the hon. member who moved the amendment had to say about the outside fleets. What is happening, it seems to me, is that South Africa is breaking the ice. We are the &#x201C;Voortrekkers&#x201D;, the trail-makers and when we have found big supplies of fish, then there are other nations coming in, who are very willing indeed to take the fruits of that which people have found and exploited and proved the worth of. They are outside our territorial waters and we cannot touch them. There is nothing we can do about it. It is legitimate presumably as long as they are inside the law. It is a matter which we ought to view, all the same, with a very great deal of care and consideration so as to see how far that goes, because these are nations who are very careful not to allow outside interference so far as their territorial waters are concerned. I would like the Government to turn its attention to the east coast, as well as to the west. On the general question of conservation, the fishing industry is bringing us in so much money to-day, that I believe that the Director of Fisheries and his staff could be allowed far greater sums of money for the purpose of oceanic research to investigate the whole of the basic principles underlying the <span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0443"/>fishing industry in South Africa both on the east and the west coast, Pure, basic scientific investigation and the facts which can be derived from that investigation are what we need. I believe that it is going to be well worth our while to spend big sums of money, because if we conserve, we will have a perpetual source of food for our own people in the last resort, whatever may be the position so far as the export market is concerned. But once it is depleted to a stage that the cost of acquiring the fish has been raised above the price the consuming public can pay, then we have lost something of exceptional value which may take a very long time to replace. We have to conserve, so that that basic breeding stock shall not be depleted. If our breeding stocks are gone, or if a disease should strike it, what will happen? When I think of what happened to the mussels on the Natal coast some 30 or 35 years ago, and I think that that kind of disease can strike perhaps our shoal fish on the west coast, I feel concerned. We have had this kind of thing happening in the history of fishing throughout the world. It has been known in the past. A disease like that can desolate your shoals. The fleets from Spain, Russia and elsewhere up their anchors and away they go, looking for other fishing grounds. We are left with the depleted fishing grounds. We have to husband our resources. But the time to make that basic investigation, and to find out what we have and what is necessary to preserve it, is now, This, I suggest is the time that we should be doing that and it is well worth the expenditure of large sums of money. I particularly look at paragraph (c) of this resolution, which asks for an investigation of the kind suggested by the hon. member, and I ask the Government, Sir, to look at the east as well as the west coast of our continent, of our country.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say at once that I am delighted that it is possible for us to sail in such calm waters in discussing this important motion. The hon. member who has just sat down made a few very important observations to which I want to refer later in my contribution to this debate. To begin with I want to refer to the observation made by the hon. member for Simonstad who introduced this motion and who referred to the plea I had made here last year under the Vote of the Minister in question for an enquiry similar to the one he was asking for, It is true, Mr. Speaker, that I did plead for such an enquiry on the part of the State on that occasion last year. I pointed out that as far as the process of development of our fishing industry, our rock lobster industry and particularly our marine industry in all its facets was concerned, it was perhaps essential at this stage for us, on behalf of the State, to put our heads together and to formulate what we wanted to do in the future, and also to investigate the bottlenecks, because this industry has developed very rapidly in recent years. Certain points of friction have developed. There are bottlenecks which in my opinion require a thorough investigation on the part of the State at this stage. I want to point out that what I had in mind in the first instance&#x2014;and I want to emphasize and advocate this once again on behalf of this side of the House as well&#x2014;was a broad, scientific inquiry into our entire marine industry, not only the fishing industry, not only the rock lobster industry, but an inquiry into all the facets of our entire marine industry, particularly with a view to indicating new points of growth by means of a scientific approach. It was pointed out here by the hon. member for Piketberg, and it has already been said repeatedly, that it is strange, that it is astonishing really, that the people of the world had not yet undertaken research into and the exploitation of the riches of the sea with greater scientific drive and enterprise. We are spending millions of rand at present in order to go to the moon. Is it not strange that man did not turn to the oceans in the first instance? The oceans cover 71 per cent of the surface of the earth. But viewed from a scientific angle, it is true that not even 5 per cent of the ocean bed has been explored scientifically at this stage. In an important speech shortly before his tragic death, the late President Kennedy intimated that on the part of his country more attention would be devoted to and greater activity would be displayed in respect of oceanographic research in the future. He said that our entire existence in the future would depend on our knowledge of the oceans. That is true, but in this respect, too, the fact remains that scientific research and its technical implementation will yet again have to pave the way for us to greater successes in the future. Now, it is true that there has been greater interest in oceanographic research, greater scientific support in respect of our marine industry and all its facets, on the part of various peoples of the world in recent times, especially in the past few years. I want to mention the example here of the Advisory Committee of the American President which passed a resolution very recently&#x2014;I think it is six to seven weeks ago&#x2014;in which the attention of the President of America was once again called to the importance of a body being established for more purposeful and concentrated development in respect of research in the marine industry. They recommended that the amount of money which had to be spent in America in future years up to 1971, had to be more than doubled until it amounted to R420 million during the next few years. If we look at these facts, I think that all of us in South Africa should be telling one another that we may not lag behind in this field. We must turn to the oceans in greater earnest. I want to tell you why. South Africa has a coast line which is 2,000 miles long. In addition to that we have warm and cold sea currents, as has already been pointed out by the hon. member. In other words, we are virtually surrounded by oceans. What a challenge this is to South Africa&#x2019;s technologists, to our scientists! There is a second truth: We are close to the South <span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0444"/>Pole. From a scientific angle this is very important. At present we are the world&#x2019;s second largest exporter of fish meal. We are the world&#x2019;s third largest manufacturer of fish and fish oil. In addition this fishing industry is growing so fantastically at present, or it has been doing so over the past few years, that the situation here in the Western Cape at present is such that the fishing industry in the Western Cape already earns us more foreign exchange than an old established industry such as the wine industry. At present this fishing industry in the Western Cape is a strong competitor of our fruit industry.</p>

<p>I also want to mention another point why it is important for us to look after our oceans in greater earnest. It is also important to note that the industry is committed to the export market for almost 90 per cent of its turnover. That is also important. important, For this reason&#x2014;the hon. member has already referred to it&#x2014;I pleaded here last year for the appointment of a commission. The hon. the Minister indicated at that time that such a commission would in fact be nominated. The commission I envisaged, would have been much broader in scope than the one proposed by the hon. member in point (c) of his motion. I envisaged an inquiry which was based on scientific principles and which, as I have said, would cover a much wider field in respect of oceanographic research and the marine industry in all its various facets.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I want to indicate a few points which I feel, viewed from a broad angle as well as from more practical angles, are essential at this stage and to which we should pay attention by means of such a commission. The first question I want to ask is whether even at this stage the time has not arrived for us to think of a separate ministry&#x2014;or shall I call it a separate department&#x2014;for our marine industry in its wider scope. I am thinking of a separate State department. If there is justification at present for a State department of tourism, of sport, of forestry, and others, I should say that, in view of the great value which is being attached to our marine industry, we in South Africa should consider the establishment of a separate State department for our marine industry even at this early stage. The peoples of the world are going to turn to the seas in greater earnest and to an ever-increasing extent, and our activities at sea are going to cause more and more international complications to develop, as is apparent from the situation in respect of our territorial waters, the re-defining of our territorial waters and the factory ships which are increasing in number and size all the time. This entire aspect in respect of our marine industry is also gaining international prestige, and for this reason, Sir, I think that we should pay more attention to the organization of this industry in the future.</p>

<p>There is a second aspect I want to mention, namely the planning of a sea project, something I also advocated here by way of a motion introduced two or three years ago. At the moment I do not want to motivate this proposal any further, but in this respect, too, I want to ask whether the time has not arrived for us to co-ordinate our research in South Africa&#x2014;research which is rather important and which is being carried out well by our scientists&#x2014;on a larger scale, and to come forward with a planned sea project somewhere along our coast, a project by means of which we can show the world that that is what we are prepared to invest in this industry.</p>

<p>A third point I want to mention, is the disorderly pattern along our coastline. Up to now it has been the position that in the areas where this industry has developed so fantastically fast, the State lands immediately bordering on our coast fell under the old Department of Lands at first and falls under the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure at present. As I see the position, disorderly development has taken place in many places, and the question is whether the jurisdiction over these areas immediately bordering on the sea, should not be removed from the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure and transferred to this particular department I have proposed. I think that we shall then have greater co-ordination and better and more purposeful planning in respect of the development of our marine industry. I think we cannot leave this situation as it is at present.</p>

<p>There is a fourth point I should like to mention, and it is an aspect such a commission of inquiry would also be able to investigate. I am referring to the labour structure of our entire marine industry. The normal future labour structure in respect of our fishing and rock lobster industry in particular, requires thorough analysis and planning at this stage. In respect of the labour structure relating to the Whites in our fishing industry, we have had the establishment of the naval academy at Grainger Bay. That was an important step in the training of Whites in our marine industry. But especially in the Western Cape we are in the first instance committed to Coloured labour. I am asking myself whether we should not investigate the matter in the complexes along our coastline where there is great activity in respect of our entire marine industry, to see whether attention should be given at this stage to certain elementary principles in respect of Coloured labour. I am thinking of certain elementary aspects to which attention can be paid at ordinary schools even at this stage, aspects which can be taught there. At a very early stage these subjects can be brought home to the Coloured child, particularly in view of the fact that owing to the geographic lie of the land he will immediately be linked up, as it were, with the marine indusry. For instance, I wonder whether the following subjects may not be dealt with as part of the syllabus, namely seamanship, signalling, types of tackle, the manufacture, repair and manipulation of nets&#x2014;which is a very expensive article at present&#x2014;fishing methods, marine <span class="col_855-856" refersTo="page_0445"/>life in general, the hygienic handling of fish and the use of by-products. Mr. Speaker, it is time that we sought greater stability in the labour market of this important industry.</p>

<p>There is a fifth point, which, I think, may be investigated, and that is the technology of fishing. Smaller catches do not necessarily mean that there is a decrease in the quantity of fish in the sea. This is often a result of defective knowledge of the industry. Fish migrate, but what do we in South Africa know at present about the migratory habits of fish? In this respect we are tremendously far behind. That may be an important reason for those catches decreasing at times. There is also the question of deep-sea fishing. I am taking the position in respect of tunny catches as an example. At present it is being felt by all concerned that our tunny catches will not develop properly before more profitable methods of catching have been found. This is an important aspect on which I cannot elaborate any further. It is an aspect which we must investigate scientifically and which needs further research. In other words, the hon. member&#x2019;s opinion concerning the reason for the decrease in the numbers of our fish, is not entirely correct. There may be other reasons of which we do not know at this stage.</p>

<p>The sixth point which I feel may be investigated by such a commission, is the artificial fertilization of oceans and conservation farming in the sea. It is indeed a big mouthful, but it is a fact that science will have to devote its attention to this matter. We simply cannot reap all the time and never sow. We cannot merely take from the sea in an unrestrained manner. The time has arrived&#x2014;and judging by the spirit in which he spoke, I think the hon. member agrees with me&#x2014;for science to help us here. We shall have to determine what we can put back into the sea. I should like to point out that Australia already has a submarine farm which is already in production at this stage. South Africa cannot remain behind in this field, either.</p>

<p>There is also the question which has already been touched upon here by the hon. member for South Coast and into which I cannot go any further for lack of time. He spoke about the use made of our sea products by our population. It is estimated that the Whites in this country only eat 8 per cent of our own fish caught here annually. As regards the Bantu, I think that they eat approximately 40 lbs. per person per year. If we compare this position with the position in other countries, it becomes apparent that we eat reasonably little, as the hon. member has rightly observed. The consumption in Japan, Iceland, Norway and Sweden is more than 50 lbs. per person per year. In the U.S.A. and Portugal it is approximately 30 lbs. per person. Here in South Africa the average consumption, the Bantu included, is only 12 lbs. per person per year. I agree with the hon. member that this aspect should also receive more attention.</p>

<p>There is the matter of our fishing harbours. As far as the development of our fishing harbours is concerned, there was a time when we could not even spend all the money that was voted in the Estimates, owing to the shortage of engineers. In this respect there has also been a great improvement, but even here we should plan much more purposefully. The State will also have to be prepared to render more extensive service in respect of the East Coast. This is an aspect which can be planned much more purposefully. Our general methods of control also deserve to be investigated. I just want to point out that all of the producers in the rock lobster industry in the area extending from Hout Bay and including almost the entire West Coast, attended a meeting on 27th January, this year. Approximately 90 per cent of them were present, and a very important discussion on bottle-necks in the industry took place there. Incidentally, a memorandum was handed to me this morning, a memorandum from the entire corps on the West Coast, and I shall give it to the hon. the Minister. In that memorandum there are approximately 10 or 12 points which to my mind calls for a very thorough investigation by such a commission.</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of our conservation methods. As far as this aspect is concerned, are we, as the hon. member asks in his motion, up to date in South Africa at present? Is it not possible for us to give attention to this matter once again? These 10 points I have mentioned here, are aspects of our marine industry which in my opinion ought to be investigated very thoroughly at this stage by such a commission of inquiry. In view of our long coastline of almost 2,000 miles, it is in our interests that we should look after our marine industry in much greater earnest in the future, and that is why I, on behalf of this side of the House, want to support particularly point (c) of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion in broad principle.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened with great interest to the hon. member for Mooreesburg who has rather indicated some degree of disappointment that following his motion in this House in 1965, no steps seem to have been taken to implement the appeal which he then made for maritime research and to implement the various other suggestions which he then made and which he has repeated here this afternoon. In that debate in February, 1965, the hon. the Minister of Planning made a reference to the fact that certain research was going to be undertaken by the South African National Committee for Oceanographic Research. I should be interested if he is able to tell us what progress has been made in the two years which have passed since that announcement was made in this House.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to confine myself to point (c) of the motion and to indicate reasons why I feel that a commission of inquiry is necessary so far as the fishing industry is concerned. I do so, Sir, because we have had the warning that the catches are becoming smaller despite <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0446"/>the extensions which have taken place within the industry, extensions by the grant of additional licences and by the grant of additional quotas. I notice from the latest statistics that in spite of the fact that from 1960 to 1964 there was an increase of almost 50 per cent in the number of boats of varying sizes which were being used in the fishing industry, that the total catch remained almost the same in 1964 as it was in 1960. Sir, for these reasons I do feel that one must be cautious in considering the suggestion made by the hon. members for Moorreesburg and Piketberg with regard to further extension of the industry until such time as we know where the industry is going. I think there are vital facts that must be ascertained scientifically before there is any talk of further expansion of the opportunities for catching fish. The danger exists at the moment on the west coast that that coast may be over-fished, and instead of the development that we all would like to see on the west coast, we may find ourselves extending the Skeleton Coast towards the south, along the west coast of the Cape Province.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to turn to one or two matters on which I hope the hon. the Minister will be good enough to give information to the House. I want to refer in the first place to the conditions attaching to the grant of crayfish quotas, for instance. I do know that the Minister in granting the quotas imposes certain conditions. I want to refer to just two of them. The first is this: &#x201C;Geen belang of aandeel in die kwota sal oordraagbaar wees of verhandel word sonder die toestemming van die Minister van Ekonomiese Sake nie.&#x201D; A further condition was compulsory membership of the South African Frozen Rock Lobster Packers (Pty) Ltd. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied that these quotas are being utilized by those to whom they were granted and for the benefit of those persons who should have had the benefit of them; in other words, that there is no trafficking in these quotas. In his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs, the hon. the Minister will be aware of the fact that despite rather stringent supervision, this difficulty does arise in regard to import permits, and I wonder whether the Minister is satisfied that the present control of quotas is such that there is no trafficking in quotas. Then, Sir, I wonder whether the time has not come when the public should be taken into the confidence of the Government and when there should be a clear unequivocal statement as to what considerations determine the granting or otherwise of quotas, licences or facilities in the industry. I do not want to mention the names of any particular concerns this afternoon but members of the public find it very difficult to understand what is going on when a company, which has been concerned solely with rock-lobster business, suddenly receives, or is able to receive, a fish-meal quota, a company which has not fished pilchards, a company which had no fish-meal factory and was entirely a rock-lobster company. I believe that these are matters in which the Minister can dispel public concern by saying quite clearly what considerations motivate the granting of these licences and permits. The Minister realizes how tremendously valuable these permits are. <i>South African Industry and Trade</i>,writing in July, 1965, went so far as to suggest that a South African fishing permit was a licence to print money. One wonders whether the time has not come to consider the question, when it is possible to extend the industry and to grant further licences, of introducing some sort of tender system in order to control the granting of further permits and further licences, because a great evil has grown up in this country in the general conduct of our economic affairs; one finds&#x2014;and I do not limit this to the fishing industry only&#x2014;that there is a rumour that a certain right or a certain permit or a certain quota or a certain import permit is going to be given and immediately there is a great deal of gambling in unquoted shares. There is no control of these transactions, and the result is that there have been most serious losses suffered by the public because of the uncertainty as to when and where and if quotas, permits and licences are to be granted. I believe that the Government can take steps in this regard to ensure that there is no gambling of this kind. It has happened only too often in recent years, in recent months almost, that very serious losses have been sustained in dealing in the shares of companies which have been granted licences and permits in the fishing industry.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to repeat points which have already been raised by other hon. members this afternoon, and for that reason I have merely indicated to the hon. the Minister these further facets of the fishing industry which I believe do need serious consideration. The hon. the Minister indicated two years ago that something was being done about oceanographic research. I believe that further research is necessary and I believe also that the one thing that the Minister must not be led into is the creation of another State Department to look after this particular industry, because then he will be compelled to co-ordinate the activities of that State Department with the activities of all the others which have some say in this particular industry. I believe that this industry should stay under the present control, and I believe that in that way the industry can flourish and develop to the benefit of the country.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>The discussion to-day in connection with the fishing industry is not only a wholesome one, but is long overdue and very necessary. I think the House agrees that some steps should be taken to look into the conservation of fish and the extension of the territorial boundaries to some distant part of the sea. I am delighted to find that there is such unanimity on this, and therefore, I rise to stake a claim for the great mass of Coloured people whom I respresent, who participate <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0447"/>in the industry and to deal with section (c) of the motion, which concerns the granting of licences and quotas.</p>

<p>We know, of course, that the people who catch the fish are the Coloured people, but they do not enjoy the proceeds of their efforts to the extent that they should. I want to make it clear, that I am not speaking in a critical vein. I acknowledge the fact that the Government has given a quota, albeit through the Coloured Development Corporation, to Coloured fishermen and that is, at least, a step forward. But the fact that that quota is only 5,000 cases lobsters out of a total of 344,000 gives one something to think about. That is the figure. Out of 344,000 cases of lobster weighing 6,800,000 lbs., 5,000 went to the Coloured Development Corporation for the benefit of Coloured fishermen. That brings me to the main theme of my remarks, namely that the C.D.C., acting in good faith, decided to farm out its quota. There are Coloured companies which catch fish, expecially rock lobster, which is the field I am discussing now, and they cannot get a quota direct. At first blush it will be said that there may be good reasons for that. I do not know what the reasons are, but the effect is this, and I quote actual cases.</p>

<p>Independent fishermen, fishing for the C.D.C. are paid R40 a crate of 300 lbs. of lobster, which means 100 lbs. of tails, and at the end of the season they get a bonus of R16, making R56 for 100 lbs. of tails. That is not bad; it is certainly much better than it used to be. Other fishermen in the same business who have their own company and who trade with a canning company get R45 for 100 lbs. of tails, and of course they must sell to the company because the company is financing the boat. If we look at the price the lobster fetches eventually on an f.o.b. basis on the world markets, we find that it is between R90 and R100 per 100 lbs. of tails. That is what the person merchandizing it gets. It may be said that as a business man, I should know that there are costs in between, but I do not think it can be advanced as a logical argument, that the difference between R56 and R100, depending on the grade, as the selling price, is a fair margin. Similarly, because of the fact that this particular company&#x2014;I will not mention names&#x2014;is a Coloured company, it can sell live lobster in Paris. They have had an offer made by a prominent man with backing from Europe, and they applied for a quota to do so, but were told there was nothing doing. Therefore I make the point, that, if the Coloured man is going to get his share in the fishing industry, this is an aspect which should be looked into. It is unfair to suggest that the thousands of men who are engaged in fishing as a livelihood should get this meagre amount, when they become entrepreneurs or merchandizers of fish which is caught, chilled and sold outside the country. The canning companies&#x2014;not all, because some are very good&#x2014;prohibit the private fisherman from fishing, because he occupies a house which they have built, even if he pays his rent. You know, Sir, that along the west coast the determinations of the group areas have not been done, and the local authorities have not set aside housing schemes of their own, so that the housing provided by the canning company is the yardstick by which a private fisherman is permitted to fish. I would be the last to suggest that it is the canning company&#x2019;s job to provide housing for all and sundry, but if we are going to have this separate development of which we hear so much, then I think the Minister responsible and this Commission, must make recommendations that where Coloured fishermen are engaged in fishing there should be accommodation for them. Also, that there should be wharves at which they can unload and sell their fish.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of chilling facilities. These people are compelled at present, probably because in their case the industry is new and has not been developed to the extent it should be, to work through white owned factories. We concede all that. Nevertheless I think the time is ripe for me to say here, that the prospect of Coloured persons enjoying to the full and sharing in the wealth of the fishing industry is at hand, and that the share that they should have and enjoy should be determined by a commission of the kind envisaged. When one deals with this practically, in the light of the information which comes to representatives like myself, one finds that Coloured people work under tremendous difficulties in this particular field. A simple thing is this. There is no bait. The best bait is frozen pilchards from Walvis Bay. The lobster likes it, but often there is no bait and they must use fish offal and heads obtained from other companies. These things are withheld and the Coloured fisherman is euchred or stymied. I therefore think that this commission is not only a step in the right direction but a move which will redound to the credit of the Government, in that, it will make quite sure that the Coloured people enjoy all the facilities that go with fishing.</p>

<p>I hope I do not get the reply that I got once before which was that there are many Coloured men with boats&#x2014;we know that&#x2014; and that they fish on their own account, because we know that too. There is a very lucrative side of the business and that is the one to which I am referring now, where the merchandising of live fish, live lobsters, is being carried out and it is most profitable. But Coloured people cannot get a quota to do this, and I think that it is wrong. I therefore ask the hon. the Minister that, when he is framing the terms of reference of the commission which I hope he will appoint, he will take particular care to see that this aspect of the fishing industry is investigated and that Coloured persons interested in the business will have an opportunity of giving evidence and appearing before the commission and of speaking for themselves.</p>

<from><span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0448"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, throughout the discussions on the motion before this House to-day, positive suggestions have been made and many useful hints have been given concerning the direction in which this important industry may develop. At present the fishing industry is a very important industry to us and it has developed very rapidly over the past number of years in particular. Mention was made here of the large exports, the increase in catches, etc. I just want to give a brief summary by pointing out that from 1948 to 1964 the tonnage of fish caught increased from 190,000 tons per annum to more than 1&#x00BD; million tons, as far as South West Africa and the Republic were concerned. As regards processed marine products the value of catches increased from R8 million to nearly R60 million over the same period. A similar increase was experienced as regards pelagic fish and we also find, even as regards whitefish, that there was a very large increase. These increases experienced within the fishing industry over this short period illustrate how much the industry has expanded. At the same time the industry has also served as a source of employment. A great deal of capital has been invested in the industry and it has been a large earner of foreign exchange. We also find that as regards our whitefish, our entire industry has been based to a large extent on pelagic fish or surface fish, such as the sardine and fish of that type. The whitefish industry in particular has grown considerably over recent years. In 1948 the tonnage caught was 46,000 tons and in 1964 it was 106,000 tons. This illustrates how this industry has grown. In view of the fact that the fishing industry is to a large extent an international industry in many countries, one can understand countries which have no fishing waters off their coasts sending vessels thousands of miles to fish and to bring food home for their populations. Ours too was a source which they did not ignore and in course of time they gave it more and more attention. For that reason we found that an ever-increasing number of foreign vessels came to fish in our waters. In the beginning they fished along the Agulhas shelf at all known sources far away from our territorial waters. They fished and even transferred their catches to other vessels to be taken home. They did not make use of our harbour facilities but recently there were attempts to make use of our transshipment facilities. At that stage our South African concerns, even those which do not form part of the fishing industry, were unwilling to offer them freezing facilities. In this way it was made difficult for foreign fishing concerns to make use of local facilities. This did not facilitiate their fishing activities. However, we find that these activities increased a great deal in recent years and that vessels came from Belgium, Hungary, Germany, Ghana, Israel. Japan, Poland, Portugal, Russia and Spain. There was even interest on the part of the United Kingdom and the U.S.A. This had the result that certain of our firms which had profitable markets in other countries came up against competition from other foreign firms which competed on such foreign markets with fish which had been caught near our waters. However, when these vessels too started making use of our harbour facilities, that created problems here for our harbour authorities to provide them with the necessary trans-shipment facilities. In terms of international law it was not always possible for the authorities to refuse them and at the same time, with our limited facilities, it was extremely difficult to provide our own vessels with facilities. Consequently it became necessary to investigate the matter very thoroughly because not only was the concentration beginning to become more heavy but these boats were fishing just beyond the three-mile limit and often came to fish within our territorial waters. As a result instructions were given for this entire matter to be investigated by various Departments, <i>inter alia</i>, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Departments of Transport, Commerce and Industries, Mining, Defence, Foreign Affairs, Customs and Excise, the Defence Force and the South African Police. These Departments jointly ascertained what their powers were to prevent these vessels from entering either our territorial waters or our fishing area, or to prevent the vessels from making use of harbour facilities which they could be denied and what their powers were to introduce patrol services, etc. It was in consequence of this investigation that the Prime Minister issued a statement in November, 1964, in which he pointed out the dangers which were arising and the necessity of protecting our own fishing industry. He pointed out at the time that we had extended our fishing limits to 12 miles the previous year. He referred to the international conference on territorial waters where only one vote was needed for a sufficient majority to increase the international fishing zone to 12 miles. As a result of the activities of foreign vessels, he deemed it necessary to designate special units of the South African Navy and Air Force as a special fishing protection service. The service was to be put into operation immediately and in accordance with international practice, Police, Customs, and Sea Fisheries&#x2019; officers, as well as officers of other departments concerned in the matter, were to be appointed members of this special protection service. These measures were therefore taken to prevent operations <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_0449"/>within our own territorial waters. This led to more effective observations and even to levies being imposed on certain trans-shipment rights. These levies were increased considerably. As a result of representations subsquently received from friendly nations, however, these levies have been suspended. It was decided to ascertain whether a solution could not be found along diplomatic lines and whether it could not be laid down by means of an agreement with other countries what the fishing zone should be and what the closed seasons should be. It was also decided to ascertain to what extent it would be possible to have international co-operation within our own waters so as to counter the catching of our fish to a greater extent. Reference was made here to the extension of the international zone and this is one of the proposals in the motion of the hon. member. He mentioned here that some countries had extended their limits to the continental shelf, that some countries had extended their limits to 100 miles and others to 200 miles. It is true that some countries have done so. Those which have extended their limits to 200 miles are China, Costa Rica, Korea, Peru and El Salvador, for example. Others extended their waters to 130 miles, but you will notice that these are mainly countries in South America and that most of the countries in South America &#x2014;the Argentine too recently&#x2014;extended their limits to serve as protection against one another. There it may help but here we are not in the same position. As far as we ourselves are concerned, in spite of the fact that this international conference did not succeed in extending the sea limits to 12 miles, we nevertheless did so in 1963. We did in fact extend our limits and subsequently other countries followed suit and at present there are 66 countries which accept or have already created the 12-mile limit for themselves. There are 41 countries which do not yet accept the 12-mile limit. I think this limit is honoured by most of the countries which fish within our waters. Representations have been made that we should also extend our international territorial waters beyond the six-mile limit, but it is not so easy to do so. Some of the countries fishing in our waters still subscribe to the three-mile limit and they are not prepared to extend it, I think we will all agree that if it were possible for us to do so we would want to do so but then we must know that friendly nations, as well as other countries, would be prepared to recognize such extension, otherwise we could land ourselves in an extremely difficult position. If we extend our international waters and those waters are violated by other powers we must, after all, be prepared to take action. For that reason I do not think that it would be advisable at this stage to extend our international waters beyond the three-mile limit off our own bat.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, six miles. I do not think that it would be advisable to extend our territorial waters to 12 miles. I do not think it would be desirable to do so. Our only alternative is to see whether we cannot come to an agreement with other countries by means of a convention or otherwise. Various international conventions exist. The North-Eastern Atlantic Fisheries Convention on conservation was held in January, 1959. In the beginning there was not a sufficient number of countries which wanted to become members of the convention, but this convention did in fact come into operation in 1963. We are a member of that convention. The convention provides for, <i>inter alia</i>, unilateral conservation measures by a coastal state, if such measures are deemed urgent or essential by such country in the event of negotiations with other fishing states not being brought to an agreement within six months. The fact that we have become a member of the convention proves that we subscribe to the international rules or to international law in this connection and that we are interested in the conservation of these resources of the ocean. In the third place, our membership will afford us a clear opportunity to refuse facilities in our harbours to those countries which do not want to observe reasonable conservation measures. Therefore I think that progress has already been made in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown also said that we should see whether we could not form our own conventions. I think it is important to point out that before one can consider entering into conventions with other countries, there should be sufficient research. We must be in a position where we have the information relating thereto at our disposal. It is in this very connection that we are co-operating even with other states in so far as conducting research in connection with our deep-sea resources is concerned. When we take this matter further there will be the opportunity and the possibility of finding common grounds as far as entering into conventions or coming to an understanding is concerned. You can be assured, because this threat still exists, not so much within our waters but beyond the 12-mile limit, that endeavours will continue to be made to arrive at agreements in this field.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked for a commission. Other members also referred to that, I want to refer him to a speech made by my predecessor when he replied to the hon. member for Moorreesburg on 16th September last year and said (Hansard, Vol. 17, col. 2304)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can also tell him that we have already decided to appoint a commission of inquiry which will investigate all aspects of our fishing industry.</block>

<p>Possible terms of reference have been asked for since that time. Certain terms of reference have been drawn up, but I do not want to go into that matter now. At the moment I cannot even say what all those terms of reference are I nevertheless want to furnish the reasons. I can tell the hon. member for South Coast that one of them relates to what steps can be taken for expediting the development of the fishing industry on the south and east coasts. I think this will set his mind at ease as far as that is concerned. There are also reasons as regards conservation, etc. These proposals are comprehensive but we felt that there were certain other aspects which had to be taken into account. We must also afford the industry an opportunity of making their suggestions. Then too scientists will make other suggestions. We feel that such an investigation will be very <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0450"/>closely linked with an investigation in South West Africa. As you know South West Africa is at present engaged in such an investigation. It is advisable for us to wait for the findings of that commission before we proceed any further with our own. I also feel that in appointing a commission such as this we should negotiate with South West Africa to see to what extent there can be co-ordination. For this reason too we should wait for their report. I understand that they have already made a great deal of progress. To-day&#x2019;s discussions will assist to a large extent in making the terms of reference of this commission, in respect of which we all agree, as comprehensive as possible in the interests of the fishing industry as a whole.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that investigations up to now have indicated, particularly in the rock lobster industry, that there are newcomers to the industry. First I want to deal with those trading in this country. I shall presently say more about the others. People who catch rock lobsters and deal in rock lobsters in this country do not need to have a permit or quota to do so, It is clear that there are newcomers who are very active particularly along our coastline here. As a result of that it was felt that certain additional measures of control must be applied. For that reason consideration is being given to prohibiting the use of ocean-bed trawling nets within a distance of five miles from the coastline within the area which extends from Cape Point to the Orange River Mouth. Further consideration is being given to prohibiting commercial catching methods which do not take place from vessels of any description and consideration is even being given to a regulation in respect of escape holes so as to ensure that rock lobsters which are shorter than 3Â½ inches will be able to escape. These are steps which are being considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg referred to the composition of the labour force. Rock lobster quotas are awarded annually. It is the policy to award no new rock lobster quotas but to renew them annually. In this way rock lobster quotas for this year have been renewed and they will likewise be renewed during this year. The information was also contained in a written reply to a question put to-day, Therefore it is not the intention to give any consideration whatsoever to increasing the rock lobster quotas. From the figures regarding labourers employed in the rock lobster industry, I notice that on the west coast in particular several thousands of Bantu are employed. In the light of the policy which was also discussed here to-day in another debate, I feel that the time has arrived for the fishermen in the rock lobster industry to see to it that their labour policy is brought more into line with the Government&#x2019;s policy. There are concerns on the west coast which employ Coloured labour exclusively. Then there are others which practically pay no attention to making proper provision for Coloureds and Bantu in their employ. If, as a result of conservation measures which must be applied, it should appear that there has to be some curtailment, I want to say at this stage already that that will be a factor to which we will not be able to close our eyes, because it is a matter of policy.</p>

<p>Mention was made here of the important research which is being conducted. As far as the fishing industry is concerned, I want to emphasize that research has been extended to a marked degree. There is for example the Oceanographic Research Group of the C.S.I.R. in Durban which was established in 1954 and extended in 1960. There is the Oceanographic Research Institute of Durban which was established in 1960. There is the Department of Ichthyology at the University of Rhodes. The Navy has a hydrographic office at Simonstown. Then there is the Naval Oceanographic Research Unit of the Navy. We also have the museums. There is, too, the Oceanographic Section of the University of Cape Town, the Fisheries Development Corporation and the Sea Fisheries Division in Cape Town. In addition we have the South African National Committee for Oceanographic Research. I mention these bodies in order to illustrate that there are numerous bodies which conduct independent research as far as the ocean is concerned. It was said here that we should not regard the ocean as a source of fish only but that we should also have regard to all the other assets in the ocean. As regards this large variety, I feel that our national effort, both as regards man-power and funds in so far as the marine industry as a whole is concerned, is being wasted because proper coordination does not exist.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that pleas have been made for more oceanographic research, I find it appropriate to refer to a resolution taken last week in respect of research, not only fish research, but research in all spheres. The scientific division of the Department of Planning under Dr. MÃ¶nnig was instructed to create various co-ordinating committees in an attempt to co-ordinate our scientific efforts. This will include, <i>inter alia</i>, the geopraphical and environmental sciences, the biological sciences, the physical and industrial sciences, and the medical sciences. The entire marine industry falls under the biological sciences. As far as the marine industry is concerned, it has therefore been decided to co-ordinate all research which is being conducted in this regard. Therefore I hope that our own efforts will be integrated with this more embracing national effort. I do not want to go into details of what our own fishing industry itself is contemplating as regards research. I refer to a long and impressive research programme of South West Africa which was submitted to the previous Minister of Economic Affairs when he negotiated with South West Africa on fishing matters. I may also inform you that the Fisheries Development Advisory Council recently recommended the increase of the industry&#x2019;s contribution <span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0451"/>to research. The industry agrees to make a larger contribution. The State too has made ever-increasing contributions to research in this connection, because we realize that research is a basic essential, not only for tracing new sources of fish but also for greater knowledge about the habits of fish and for encouraging us to investigate new directions, such as shrimps for instance. I believe that research will play a major role in the future, as it did in the past, both as regards our conservation and our extension.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo referred to certain awards in so far as Coloureds were concerned. The fact is that when the awards were made&#x2014;and the awards were few in number&#x2014;they were made to people who were engaged in the rock lobster industry. All the companies to which awards were made have a long history in respect of contributions made to the catching of rock lobster. At that stage there was no application from or claim on the part of Coloured entrepreneurs. It was then decided to make an award of 5,000 cases to the Coloured Development Corporation which award was to be exploited to the benefit of the Coloureds engaged in that industry. The Coloured Development Corporation does not fall under this ministry but I may inform hon. members that it caused that quota to be exploited by others to the benefit of the Corporation. At present there are considerable funds which are available for this purpose. They assisted Coloureds with boats. As regards its own contribution to this quota, it even offered them a larger bonus than that offered to Whites. A White was stationed at Lambert&#x2019;s Bay for the very purpose of assisting with organizing to give the Coloureds a larger share. They are looking for a suitable harbour. They have made representations for a fishmeal quota to be awarded to Coloureds. The possibility of an own harbour or place where they as Coloureds may make further progress in the industry is being examined and was discussed at the last meeting of the Fisheries Development Corporation.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to certain existing problems and I think these are problems which basically can be solved by him through the Coloured Development Corporation in the interests of the Coloureds. It is indeed true that if the Corporation itself were to export it would perhaps be able to make larger profits. When the day arrives that it exploits a larger quota or gives the Coloureds a larger share therein, it will be more to their advantage. The idea behind it all was to give the Coloureds a more active role in the lobster industry. With the establishment or extension of fishmeal licences a share therein was given to the Corporation as was given to other companies in the fishing industry.</p>

<p>As far as live rock lobster is concerned, I just want to say that certain companies were given the right to export live rock lobster. No new quotas, however, were awarded for that, They could only exploit existing quotas. Therefore the right to export live rock lobster did not entail the award of further quotas and no larger catches were approved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point asked what the conditions of rock lobster awards were. He mentioned some of the conditions, namely that they must sell through Safroc and that there may be no alienation without consent. That provision was specially introduced because there was a large measure of consolidation in respect of earlier rock lobster quotas. There was such a large measure of consolidation that one group held nearly 70 per cent of all rock lobster quotas. It was to counter that trend in particular that this small group of quotas had been awarded. In addition it was small quotas which they received. Leave was granted for the transfer of one quota. These particulars were also furnished to-day. You will realize, however, Mr. Speaker, that we have problems. It is possible for one to make such a provision but there are of these companies which are quoted on the Stock Exchange and it is impossible to impose a restriction on the transfer of shares. The provision is there, however, to try to counter the large-scale consolidation of quotas as far as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of tenders. I do not know what will happen if there is a possibility of a further licence and tenders are invited. It is clear that if tenders were invited they would go to the larger groups who are well provided with capital. The approach throughout has been to give the fishermen in the fishing industry a share in it as well. It has not always been possible to do so, They did not always have the necessary capital at their disposal. Particularly where we are now entering new fields, in so far as factory-ships are concerned, it has not always been possible to that extent. The hon. member, in consequence of the latest awards, referred, without mentioning names, to a concern which had a rock lobster quota and which did not have any other quota. I presume that he was referring to a certain concern on the west coast. The fact of the matter is that it was laid down in the award made&#x2014;when three awards were made on the recommendation of the Fisheries Development Advisory Council&#x2014;that that company, apart from its own members&#x2014;because the vast majority of its own members are people who are fishermen&#x2014;also had to make provision for other applicants in the vicinity who had claims. That was investigated very thoroughly and this step was taken because there are so many individual fishermen in that company and so many others who were individual applicants at first but became associated with the company in the course of time.</p>

<p>I think that as far as the fishing industry is concerned we find ourselves in the position that we must also accept the challenge as regards the presence of foreign vessels in our own waters. This matter is creating problems for South West Africa and is still under discussion. I nevertheless feel that if we ourselves, <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0452"/>like other countries do not sail further out into the ocean in larger vessels and fish new grounds &#x2014;and reference has been made here, <i>inter alia</i>, to the South Pole&#x2014;then we shall tend to fall behind other countries in this sphere of the fishing industry.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the speeches made by hon. members, and I want to thank all of them sincerely for taking part in this debate. I also want to thank the hon. Minister concerned for his full replies to the points raised here, Nevertheless I have to express the fear that hon. members do not realize the seriousness of the decrease in catches, especially the decrease in the pilchard catches, in South Africa. I am, of course, a little disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to appoint a commission at this stage or to extend the limit of our territorial waters.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, this motion has received wide support in this House and under these circumstances I am prepared to withdraw my motion.</p>

<p>With leave, motion withdrawn.</p>
