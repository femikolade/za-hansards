<heading>Njelele Irrigation Scheme</heading>

<p>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS replied to Question *3, by Mr. S. J. M. Steyn, standing over from 16th May:</p>

<question by="#steyn" to="#deputy_minister_of_water_affairs">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<p>Whether work on the left bank canal of the Njelele irrigation scheme has been or is to be stopped or postponed; if so, (a) why, (b) under what conditions will the work be resumed and (c) when is it expected that the work will be resumed; if not, why no provision was made for this work in the Estimates of Expenditure for 1967-&#x2019;68.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_water_affairs" to="#steyn">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<p>No; In view of the fact that to date no money has been voted by Parliament for the left bank canal, reference should not be made to a stopping or postponement of work on the left bank canal.</p>

<p>The printed loan vote estimates for the financial year 1966-&#x2019;67, reflected an increase in cost, ammounting to R265,000, in respect of the Njelele canal scheme as approved by Parliament.</p>

<p>Shortly after the said loan vote estimates were tabled it became apparent that the R265,000 increase in cost could not be ascribed to the approved programme of work but that the increase was due to a completely new work falling outside the scope of the approved programme.</p>

<p>The programme of canal works for which Parliament had voted R1,000,000 consisted of a main canal on the right bank of the Njelele River the details of which were described on page 5 of White Paper, W.P. J-&#x2019;63.</p>

<p>The purpose of the approved canal works was to eliminate the use of the bed of the Njelele River below the confluence of the Matamba Spruit as a distribution canal, because the Matamba Spruit polluted the water of the Niele with boron salts.</p>

<p>Page 1 of White Paper, W.P. J-&#x2019;63, read as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;In 1954 a serious reduction in the quantity and quality of the citrus crop was experienced and investigation by the Citrus Board proved that the trouble was due to the high concentration of boron salts contained in the low flow of the Matamba Spruit, one of the tributary streams. The matter was referred to the Department of Water Affairs and led to the investigation of the possibility of constructing a concrete-lined canal on the right bank of the Njelele River, from a diversion weir at a point upstream of the confluence with the Matamba Spruit, in order to ensure the elimination of the contaminated water source.&#x201D;</block>

<p>It is therefore clear that the proposed left bank canal, to which the hon. member&#x2019;s question refers, did not form part of the approved scheme and that it was not envisaged by the Irrigation Board when the scheme was initially placed on the estimates.</p>

<p>Section 57 of the Water Act requires a White Paper to be tabled in respect of any additional new works, the cost of which exceeds R200,000.</p>

<p>After it had been ascertained that the proposed left bank canal did not form part of the approved works for which R1,000,000 was initially voted by Parliament, it was decided not to table in Parliament a White Paper on the proposed left bank canal at that stage.</p>

<p>Subsequently, two members of the Irrigation Board, namely Messrs. Joubert and Uys, made verbal representations regarding the matter to the Minister of Water Affairs in Cape Town. It was explained to these two gentleman that other schemes in respect of which money had already been voted by Parliament had of necessity to receive priority over the proposed left bank canal of the Irrigation Board and that money <span class="col_6299-6300" refersTo="page_0411"/>for the latter canal would not be requisitioned by way of a White Paper until such time as the approved programme of work for the Irrigation Board had been completed.</p>

<p>The said programme will be completed during the current financial year and the Irrigation Board is at liberty to approach the Department for the construction of the left bank canal. Such a proposal will thereafter be investigated by the Department and reported on to the Minister.</p>

<p>If approved, it will, together with other new schemes, be considered on merti for inclusion in future estimates.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In the first place this Bill provides for the amendment of certain definitions and in the second place for a change in the procedure followed in connection with the investigation of a charge against an officer on account of misconduct. As regards the amendment to the definition, a change is effected in the definition of &#x201C;the force&#x201D; and &#x201C;a member of the force&#x201D;. This relates specifically to changing the designation &#x201C;special constable&#x201D; to &#x201C;temporary member&#x201D;. The reason for this is as follows. The Force makes extensive use of temporary members or, as they were in the past special constables, and they are usually retired members of the Force. It happens so frequently that a sergeant or a warrant officer stays on as a temporary member and that he is then described in the Act as a special constable, although he is a sergeant or a warrant officer. <span class="col_6305-6306" refersTo="page_0414"/>You will appreciate that in the past this caused some embarrassment, and for that reason it was in fact found necessary to correct the position by way of regulation. Now we also want to rectify it in the Act, in order that he may be defined as a &#x201C;temporary member&#x201D; and no longer as a &#x201C;special constable&#x201D;. We also find that a definition of &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; is changed from &#x201C;Minister of Justice&#x201D; to &#x201C;Minister of Police&#x201D;. The S.A. Police is under the control of the Minister of Police, and in terms of section 10 of the Interpretation Act the State President has already placed the administration of the Police Act under the control of the Minister of Police. Therefore it is now also corrected in the Act.</p>

<p>Then hon. members will find that as regards the actions of the State President with regard to commissioned officers, we are abolishing the actions which may possibly be dealt with by him in so far as they relate to suspending, reprimanding or reducing members of the Force in seniority in rank. In considering this matter, and also the procedure which is subsequently set out for the consideration of a complaint against a commissioned officer, I should like hon. members to take into account that the Police Force has changed tremendously since the Act was placed on the Statute Book for the first time in 1912 until to-day. At the moment the Police Act is Act No. 7 of 1958, but in actual fact it is merely a consolidation, and these stipulations were in fact introduced in 1912. Now hon. members should bear in mind that in 1912 there were only approximately 100 commissioned officers in the Force, while at the moment there are approximately 1,300, and one could appreciate that the State President should not be burdened with many of the trivialities with which commissioned officers may perhaps be charged from time to time. It is in fact for that reason that it was felt that as the State President is responsible for the appointment of a commissioned officer of the Force and is consequently the only person who can approve a reduction in seniority of rank or who can dismiss such an officer, the State President retains that power as far as his actions are concerned, but we now remove that suspension and reprimand, as I said a moment ago. We are also removing them as regards the powers of the Commissioner in the proposed clause 3. Hon. members will see that suspension and reprimands are dealt with in clause 5. There the Minister or the Commissioner are granted authority as a temporary measure to deal with the suspension of commissioned officers of the Police Force.</p>

<p>As far as the other matters are concerned, that is, the procedure followed in connection with the preferment of a charge of misconduct against an officer, the old procedure was most cumbersome, and we are now trying to simplify it considerably. In terms of the old procedure a preliminary investigation has to be carried out. Evidence is adduced in full and the evidence is forwarded to the State President, and on the basis of the evidence the State President may then appoint a board consisting of three or more members to investigate the matter and then to take the necessary decisions in connection with punitive measures, etc. The board is then appointed and investigates the matter <i>de novo.</i> In other words, all the evidence adduced in the first place during the preliminary inquiry is adduced all over again at the inquiry by the board and the board then makes recommendations to the State President in connection with the punitive measures to be applied. This is a most cumbersome procedure, and as I said a moment ago, it is felt, in view of the expansion of the Force and the large number of commissioned officers in the Force at present, that the State President is burdened to a too large extent by trivialities which may arise. For that reason we are now simplifying the procedure. It is now provided in clause 4 that the Commissioner or a commissioned officer appointed by him may prefer a charge of misconduct against an officer of the Force. That officer may then plead; he may admit guilt or deny guilt, and then the Minister may appoint a board to inquire into the matter. We also provide that this board need no longer consist of three or more members, as previously, but that it may consist of only one or more members. This board then inquires and finds the officer guilty or not guilty. If he is found guilty, it is also provided that the officer may appeal to the Minister on his conviction. If the conviction is upheld, the board makes certain recommendations to the Minister in connection with the punishment. As you may appreciate, the Minister can then reprimand or suspend or something similar, but if the charge and the conviction is of such a serious nature that the consideration of dismissal arises, the Minister can make a recommendation to this effect to the State President, to discharge or dismiss the officer. This then as regards the procedure. Furthermore, in clauses 6 and 7 there are simply consequential amendments where &#x201C;special constable&#x201D; is changed to &#x201C;temporary member&#x201D; of the Force. I move.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to make a few observations in connection wi h the implementation of this Bill, because I have always adhered to the principle that subterranean water should be used very judiciously. If we had passed this Bill in its original form, it would in actual fact have been a violation of the sound principle of the allocation and use of subterranean water. For that reason I tried to say a moment ago and am now repeating that I am very grateful that we are passing this legislation in this form. I am not quite satisfied with it, of course. In the report of the Select Committee on the private Bill there were two issues which came to the fore very clearly and of which we should take note. The first is that through a representative whom the Town Council of Mafeking sent to the Minister&#x2014;a year or so ago&#x2014;they cautioned and objected against the large-scale abstraction of subterranean water by farmers in the dolomitic area adjacent to the Grootfontein. I have the documents here and can substantiate this. They submitted that the abstraction of subterranean water had a tremendously adverse influence on the flow from the Grootfontein and the supplies available to Mafeking. Afterwards they came along with a Bill and asked for unlimited large-scale abstraction of subterranean water. Even in the form it has now assumed they have also obtained the rights in terms of section 5 to use the borehole which has already been sunk and also two other boreholes for that purpose. In the second place it is apparent from this evidence that municipalities and other concerns which want to undertake expansions should ascertain in advance whether there is water available. They should not first undertake the expansions and then place the State and the Minister before an accomplished fact and ask for legislation to provide for the abstraction of subterranean water and its diversion over long distances to the dolomitic regions. From the evidence given before the Committee it is quite clear that Mafeking does not have its own water potential to provide for any large-scale expansions in future. In this Bill it is now provided, and its application will amount to this, that Mafeking obtains rights which would never be granted to any farmer in a proclaimed area in that dolomitic region. However, I am more satisfied with the Bill in its present form. In its original form it provided, amongst other things, that the municipality of Mafeking should have the unlimited right to augment the rate of flow from the Grootfontein artificially.</p>

<heading>PRICE CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time. This amending Bill proposes three amendments to the Price Control Act of 1964. In the first place the Price Controller is empowered to inform any person by letter of a price control notice to place any article sold by such a person or any services rendered by such a person under control. Since the commencement of the Price Control Act of 1964 it has been found that the existing provisions in the Act, i.e. that all price control notices should be issued by way of publication in the <i>Gazette,</i> hamper the Price Controller in the proper execution of his duties because this procedure causes delay and frequently gives rise to unnecessary costs in cases where only a few persons are affected by a determination which is made. Hon. members will recall that my predecessor, with a view to the battle against inflation, urged the public repeatedly to bring cases of unjustified price increases to the attention of the Price Controller. The Price Controller in fact receives evidence of many such cases, but his hands are bound to a large extent because the relevant articles are not subject to maximum price fixing and because he cannot take action against profiteering on such articles unless maximum prices for them are fixed by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> Because <span class="col_6311-6312" refersTo="page_0417"/>it is usually individual dealers who are involved in actions of this nature, it is frequently not possible to justify the necessity of fixing the price of the article concerned on a general basis, with the result that no action can be taken against the dealers concerned. Hon. members will appreciate that if maximum prices are to be fixed for all the articles with regard to which the Price Controller receives complaints from the public in connection with unjustified increases in prices, the list of these articles would grow very rapidly. This would entail considerable costs and also a waste of manpower. If, however, the dealer concerned may be directed by letter under such circumstances not to exceed certain maximum prices, it will obviate the necessity for a general fixing of maximum prices by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> and will ensure that no unnecessary burdens are imposed on dealers who were not guilty of incorrect actions, or on the office of the Price Controller.</p>

<p>A second amendment which is contained in the Bill as printed and which empowers the Price Controller to lay down fixed prices for articles, I shall withdraw when the Bill is dealt with in the Committee Stage, as I have already intimated in the Press, and I have placed an amendment to this effect on the Order Paper. These provisions were included in the Bill in the light of representations received from dealers and manufacturers to the effect that the Department of Commerce and Industries should do something to protect them against disrupting price cutting and price discrimination. Subsequent to publication of the Bill, however, strong representations were received from both the Federated Chamber of Industries and the Vereniging van Kamers van Koophandel against the inclusion in this Price Control Act of powers to determine fixed prices, but I want to make it clear that they were not the only ones to make representations to me. Other representations were also received from bodies and persons who insisted that we should proceed with this Bill. I should like to read the views of these bodies to the House, without mentioning their names&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Association, on behalf of its Republic-wide membership, comprised in the main of small traders, wholeheartedly supports the principle and proposals in the current amendments in the Price Control Regulations. Letter follows.</block>

<p>Then there is another one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federation, in all major centres of the Republic, fully endorses Government action against manipulative and misleading loss-leader price selling and trusts effective legislation, maximum and minimum price regulation, as intended, will eventuate.</block>

<p>Here is another one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Association strongly supports Government action in this regard. It is obvious that any true over-all benefit to consumers is largely illusionary under this selling system, a system aptly described by the Americans as &#x201C;sucker or deceit selling&#x201D;. It is noteworthy that the Governments of both Britain and America and certain other countries have taken steps to curb various aspects of &#x201C;loss-leader&#x201D; and &#x201C;free-gift&#x201D; selling. It is clear that once multiple commodity chains have eliminated the true competitive factor of the independent small distributor, they will then be in a position to dictate prices selectively, etc., to both producer and consumer.</block>

<p>These are only a few of the representations made to us to the effect that we should proceed with the principle contained in the Bill. The question is: Why are they making these representations&#x003F; I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The independent small distributor will not be eliminated because of inefficiency but because (a) in many cases he is compelled to pay wholesalers and manufacturers prices which are substantially in excess of those at which chains are retailing and (b) by the secret rebates and discounts which appear easily available to the chain groups but not to the independent distributor. Presumably the angle is:&#x201C;Give us a lower cost price than our competitors or our group will buy elsewhere.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This is one of the arguments which is advanced, but there is also another aspect which we should take into consideration, and that is the fact that in certain fields of our industry there are strong groups which show monopolistic tendencies, and we find that when a young undertaking seeks to enter the market in that field, it is barred because that undertaking, in the specific locality where it starts a small undertaking, sells its goods or delivers its article at a price far below the price at which it delivers them in other areas, with the deliberate object of giving the small undertaking no chance to find a market for its product. There are several fields in which we are constantly receiving complaints from new undertakings that want to establish themselves and that are exposed to that kind of competition from larger undertakings. Basically these are the two aspects of the problems brought to our attention. But in the light of this apparent disagreement between organizations involved in commerce, I am prepared to refer this aspect to the Board of Trade and Industries for investigation. The Board of Trade and Industries is at present engaged in another inquiry into price maintenance agreements, and this inquiry will now tie up with that. At this stage I therefore do not want to say anything more in this regard.</p>

<p>But there is also a third amendment in this Bill, and this is contained in clause 6. In the first place the type of transactions in respect of which the conditions may be prescribed in terms of section 9 are extended by making it <span class="col_6313-6314" refersTo="page_0418"/>possible for the Price Controller also to announce conditions in respect of lease-lend and hire-purchase transactions or any other kind of transaction, as defined by him in the notice concerned. This provision is intended to enable the Price Controller to take action against evasion of the prescribed hire-purchase conditions. This evasion usually takes place by adopting other names for transactions which are essentially sales transactions but which are presented as a different kind of transaction simply to evade certain prescribed conditions. This includes, for example, leasing transactions in terms of which the seller supposedly leases goods on the condition that upon the termination of a certain period of lease or upon the payment of a certain amount in lease money, no further payment will be collected from the lessee, and that the leased goods will then become the property of the lessee. As a result of evasion of this nature the effective implementation of the relevant control measures is frustrated to a large extent.</p>

<p>In addition, new provisions are being introduced in section 9 of the Act with regard to the validity of contracts. Firstly, it is provided that substantial compliance with any condition specified by the Price Controller in respect of a particular type of transaction shall be regarded as compliance with that condition. This provision is inserted in the Act in order to provide the courts with some discretion in deciding on the culpability of persons who enter into contracts in conflict with conditions prescribed by the Price Controller. Minor deviations from these conditions as a result of errors in calculation or in the stipulation of the prescribed deposit or instalment terms, which may have the result that too low a deposit is charged or that too long terms are allowed, need therefore in future not necessarily be punishable. Moreover, the courts will in future have the discretion to decide that a seller who grants a buyer respite for the payment of instalments and thus varies the term stipulations of the contract in such a way that they no longer comply with the prescribed term conditions, shall not be punishable if circumstances obtain from which it is clear that when the parties to a contract deviated from the prescribed conditions, they were compelled to do so by unavoidable or unforeseen events and were not deliberately intent on contravening the prescribed conditions of the contract, for example if on account of illness or loss of income the buyer is unable to pay his instalments regularly. Secondly, it is provided that cheques or other negotiable instruments shall be made payable to the seller within 21 days. This provision is necessary to prevent evasion of payment conditions prescribed by the Price Controller, in that buyers pay by cheque and the sellers then undertake to delay offering these cheques at the banks for payment until the buyer has the necessary money in the bank to honour the cheques. This provision is also necessary to establish a fixed basis in terms of which the courts may judge contracts if offenders are arraigned before them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it is provided that contracts entered into in conflict with a prescribed condition shall remain operative contracts notwithstanding this contravention of the conditions. The parties to such a contract will therefore be empowered to enforce in court the rights obtained by them in terms of such contract, but, of course, they remain punishable under the Act for contravention of the prescribed conditions. This provision is introduced in the Act to meet the problems which arise when the seller grants respite of payment and the contract may therefore be declared inoperative in terms of the existing legal provisions. If a contract is regarded as inoperative after respite of payment because it no longer complies with a prescribed condition, it will have the result that sellers will not be prepared to grant respite of payment even when a buyer is unable to pay on account of illness, for if the contract were regarded as inoperative, the buyer would be able to return the article, which had been in his use for some time, to the seller, and demand the return of the money he has already paid. It is therefore clear that the seller, rather than to grant respite of payment if the contract will thereby become inoperative, would rather take back the purchased goods from the buyer if the latter could not pay an instalment. The new provision, in terms of which the contract will not be inoperative if it does not comply with a prescribed condition, is therefore to the advantage of both the seller and the buyer. Furthermore, this provision will not essentially prejudice the object of conditions prescribed under section 9, because the penalties laid down in the Act are severe enough to prevent contracts in conflict with the prescribed conditions from being entered into on a large scale.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>When the Act of 1964 was introduced, it was opposed by this side of the House. As you will remember, Sir, we were quite willing to renew the War Measures Act, under which price control was exercised, year by year as long as it was deemed necessary but we did not think that any case had been made out for permanent legislation on the subject. Indeed it was only fairly recently that that view was not shared by speakers on that side of the House. However, I just want to place on record that that is still our view. We do not like price control as a permanent feature of legislation, but that is the law, Sir, and you would quite rightly have something to say if I pursued that subject any further, so I shall not do it.</p>

<p>What we have to consider is whether the Bill before us seeks to extend the powers of the Price Controller, to tighten price control, and how it is proposed to do it. When the Bill was first introduced, there were provisions in it, particularly the controller&#x2019;s power to fix minimum prices, as well as one or two other provisions, which we would have had <span class="col_6315-6316" refersTo="page_0419"/>no option but to oppose, but since then the hon. the Minister, as he has explained has had time to consider the matter further and he has now placed six or seven amendments on the Order Paper which to a large extent remove most, if not all, of the objections which we had to the Bill. Indeed he is leaving the Act very largely as it stands at the present time. That being so, we shall not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill. But there are one or two points we would like to raise with the hon. the Minister both here and, depending on his reply to the debate, possibly in the Committee Stage as well. In four clauses it is sought to give the Price Controller, as the hon. the Minister has pointed out, the right, instead of acting by way of notice in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> as has always been the practice, simply to write to a particular individual person.</p>

<p>Sir, we think that is wrong. We think it is wrong for two reasons. In the first place we think that it is going to be extremely difficult to implement. The hon. the Minister said that if the Price Controller had this power, he could write to an individual person, and if that did not produce the necessary results, he might later have to fix a general maximum price and publish a notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> It was not quite clear whether by that he meant that if the Price Controller was going to fix the maximum price for the article in question for the whole country, he would be bound to publish it in the <i>Gazette</i> or whether he could do it simply by way of a letter to the manufacturer or to the importer. If that is so we think it is wrong. At the present moment, as far as I can see, there is nothing in the existing Act&#x2014;in fact I understand it is being done now&#x2014;to prevent the Price Controller, with all the authority of the Government behind him, from writing to any particular person whom he thinks is charging exorbitant prices and advising or telling him that he should reduce that price and warning him that if he does not do so steps will be taken to fix the price. But there are more people involved than simply the person to whom the Price Controller intends to write, whether that person is the manufacturer or the wholesale distributor or the retailer or the consumer, because under clause 3 not only is anybody who sells at above the maximum price guilty of an offence but anybody who buys at above the maximum price is also guilty of an offence, and therefore if the maximum price is fixed, it seems to us that it is quite essential that that should be publicly announced, and the only way to do it is though the <i>Government Gazette.</i> If it is done through the <i>Government Gazette</i> then the various trade organizations, who study the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and the Press will get to know about it at once and nobody will have any excuse for not knowing what the position is.</p>

<p>It seems to us that this is unnecessary and might lead to serious complications, because if the Price Controller were to fix a maximum price and not publish it in the <i>Gazette,</i> it might mean that he would have to write thousands of letters if he is going to achieve any purpose. We think that the Price Controller has sufficient authority behind him and sufficient power to-day to deal with a case of this sort. In fact, I think cases have arisen where the Price Controller has been able to cope with the position. I think the question of cinema prices is a case in point where the Price Controller was quite able to control the position simply by correspondence and by dealing direct with the people concerned who, in that case, were in effect the manufacturer or the importer of the articles concerned. The Price Controller handled the situation very well and we think that the Minister would be wise to let the position stand as it is at present.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the question of delays and costs as an argument against the publication of notices in the <i>Gazette.</i> But, Sir, what delay is there&#x003F; Unless things have changed very much the position always used to be that you only had to give a week or less than a week&#x2019;s notice to have measures of this kind included in the following Friday&#x2019;s <i>Gazette.</i> As to the question of costs, where you are dealing with an article which is in common use throughout the country and which involves large sums of money, I cannot believe that the cost of printing a notice of that sort, which after all is simply a charge between one Government Department and another&#x2014;the money stays in the Government&#x2019;s hands really&#x2014;is an argument for not insisting that the widest possible publicity should be given to any action that the Price Controller might wish to take. Indeed, it seems to me that from his own point of view, his hands would be strengthened. The more people know what he is doing and the more they are satisfied that he is fulfilling his function of preventing profiteering, which is really what price control is for, the more will they back him up and assist him, so I cannot see any reason at all why all maximum prices which are fixed by the Controller should not be published in the <i>Gazette</i> in the ordinary way as they have always been published.</p>

<p>Then I come to clause 6 which proposes a new section 9. This clause may have very wide implications. One of my colleagues will deal with this matter in greater detail. I understand that the hon. the Minister in his interview with organized commerce and industry, explained to them exactly what the purpose of this clause was and he gave fairly explicit assurances as to what he was not going to use it for. Of course, this practice of leasing things is a very old established, recognized practice in industry and in business. I know of one very major industry in this country where the machinery is never sold; it is always leased by the manufacturer. It has always been like that. It is quite a common practice for big business houses to lease the machinery used in the offices. It is perfectly legitimate; it helps them and I am not sure that the Government does not do it too. Under this clause, as it stands, all that could be interfered with and <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_0420"/>done away with by the Price Controller. The hon. the Minister gave assurances on that subject but he did not repeat them this morning and I hope that when he replies to this debate he will repeat them in this House and make the limited reasons that he has for wanting to give the Price Controller the powers contained in this clause, perfectly clear to this House. Depending on his reply to this debate, we do not propose to oppose the Second Reading, and, again depending on his reply, we may or may not have further discussions during the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister in his opening remarks referred to price control as a means of handling inflation. In this connection may I remind him that when the 1964 Act was before the House the then Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot control inflation with a measure such as this. Inflation has to be controlled by other means. But you can control some of the effects of inflation by a measure of this kind and, of course, your measure is designed to control rising prices even in times where there is no inflation.</block>

<p>As the hon. member for Constantia pointed out the object of this measure is to stop profiteering. But I should like the hon. the Minister in his reply to tell us what he regards as profiteering. What does he regard as being a reasonable price and a fair return on capital&#x003F; Because this is what it comes down to in the final analysis. The principle of price control has already been established and therefore, Mr. Speaker, you will not allow us to discuss it. But neither this hon. Minister nor his predecessor has ever indicated what is regarded as being a reasonable return on capital. I believe, however, that this hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor a few years ago did indicate that he regarded a 15 per cent return as a reasonable return on capital in a competitive system and having regard to the prevailing rate of interest. But since those days interest rates have risen and to-day the hon. the Minister may have other ideas of what is a fair return on capital. I think we are entitled, against this background, to ask the Minister what he regards as constituting a reasonable price&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Minister in his opening remarks also referred to certain amendments he proposes to make in the Committee Stage, amendments which he had already placed on the Order Paper. It is because of these amendments that we are not opposed to this Bill. I should, however, like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention particularly to clause 2 (b). In paragraphs (a) and (c) the Minister proposes to omit the words &#x201C;price or&#x201D; and &#x201C;charge or&#x201D;. But I notice that he does not propose the omission of the words &#x201C;price or&#x201D; in paragraph (b) of the clause. It appears to me to be logical to omit these words also in paragraph (b) in view of the fact that he does so in paragraphs l(a) and (c). So, there must be some special reason for retaining these words in paragraph (b). If so, we should like to know what this reason is. I should like to point out again that we are debating this Bill against the background of the amendments which the Minister has said he would introduce and we are giving our support to this Bill in anticipation of these amendments being carried through. We are, therefore, supporting this Bill in good faith. Therefore, the Minister should give us an indication why it is not proposed to amend also paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to clause 6 of the Bill. This clause provides for the control of lease agreements. In this connection I should like to know from the Minister whether it is his intention to prohibit these agreements altogether. As the hon. member for Constantia has said, lease agreements have become customary to-day, not only for industrial machinery, motor-cars and in some cases furniture but also in respect of business equipment because this type of equipment is being leased to a large extent to-day. In the computer world, for instance, it is almost an exception for a computer to be purchased. The development of the computer is such that after a year or two a computer may be obsolete. Consequently, people using computers prefer to lease a computer because by doing that they may be able to come to an agreement with the supplying house concerned for any modifications or improvements to be embodied in the plant being used. In that way they can keep their plant up to date. This clause gives the Minister very wide powers.</p>

<p>If it is the object to protect the individual against the unscrupulous dealer then it has our support. There are occasions where the ordinary man does not buy a car under hire-purchase agreement but under a lease agreement. Well, he may not know that the lease agreement provides for a lease which eventually may mean his paying a considerable amount more than he would have paid for that vehicle had he bought it under an ordinary hire-purchase agreement. As I say, the car dealer or the financial organization behind the car dealer is putting such a person in a position where he has to pay a considerable amount more than he should pay under normal conditions. As I have said, it this is the object of this clause then there is some support for it. But where in the ordinary cause of business a fair lease charge is made and the arrangement is a reasonable one we see no objection to it. Agreements of that kind should therefore be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>I should also like to support the views the hon. member for Constantia expressed with regard to notices in writing. We should like to have further details from the Minister in this connection because it does seem to us that there should be more publicity given to price determinations. If it is the object only to inform individual firms without a notice in the <i>Gazette</i> one can see objections to the practice. For instance, people may be in ignorance of <span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_0421"/>what has been done. Subject to these remarks we support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>As the House is already aware, we on this side are going to support this truncated Bill. Let me, however, say immediately that we do not like controls of any kind. I think our position has been made clear in this House from time to time. However, there may come a time when however much you may object to the principle of controls, a form of control may become necessary. We on this side of the House have for a long time been asking the Government to take more stringent measures to curb inflationary trends. Furthermore, we welcomed the measures the Government took towards the end of last year and since. The major aspect of this Bill is that it is in furtherance of those objectives. There are now only two principles left in this Bill. The first principle is that maximum prices can now be fixed not only by means of notice in the <i>Gazette</i> but also by writing individual letters. Like my hon. colleagues, I do not like this at all. We shall, therefore, discuss it in more detail in the Committee Stage. Price control, as we see it, is a public and not a private matter. Once a control has been imposed it should be with the full knowledge of the public. I know the hon. the Minister has said that there may be a single person or a single organization who is overcharging. Here one of two things can arise. Either competition can stop this overcharging or, if there is no competition and the person concerned has in effect a monopoly, there is the Monopolies Act which can deal with the situation. I can see no reason whatsoever why any notice cannot be published in the <i>Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The second principle of this Bill is in clause 6. It allows the Price Controller to intervene in instalment selling and to bring leases within the definition of sales. The Minister has told us that what he is trying to do is to bring within the orbit of the Price Controller sales which are being disguised as leases. It is important that one must realize that the rights given to the Price Controller are purely permissive. This is an enabling Bill&#x2014;it enables the Price Controller to do certain things. We are not saying to him, for instance, that he is getting authority to do this or that. All we are saying to him is that should certain circumstances arise which may affect the economy of the country adversely he will have the power to intervene. I think it is important that this should be realized. The Bill says the Price Controller &#x201C;may&#x201D; prohibit the sale or lease of any goods. It lays down specifically the circumstances under which he may do so. The first thing he has to do is to give notice to the seller that the sale of the goods concerned is prohibited. But an important rider is being added, namely except on the terms laid down by the Price Controller&#x2014;in other words, he is not saying to a dealer he may not sell these goods; he is saying that a dealer can only sell these goods on certain conditions. Here again I think it is important that this is realized. By implication, if not in fact, I think this will only apply to cases where the purchase price is payable in instalments. The other important provision in clause 6 is that such a prohibition only becomes effective if the goods are to be sold with a lesser deposit than that required by the Price Controller or if the goods are to be sold over a longer period than the period determined by the Price Controller. So, here is not a complete prohibition in any shape or form. It is a prohibition only in the sense that once the Price Controller has said that certain goods may be sold at a certain price, upon a certain deposit and the payment of certain instalments and the dealer complies with these requirements the seller is free to sell. The prohibition only becomes effective when the seller does not comply with these conditions.</p>

<p>Certain leases are included in the term &#x201C;sale&#x201D;. After listening to the hon. the Minister it seems to me that the purpose appears to be to include what are in effect sales disguised as leases. It must be tied up with a disposal of goods&#x2014;in other words, there is no intention to do anything in so far as the normal lease of a house, for instance, is concerned, or normal leases of that kind. It will, therefore, not affect straightforward leases. I think I can sum up the position by saying that we are giving the Price Controller wide powers, that I do not think we can deny, but the power is not to prohibit the sale of goods; the power is to lay down the conditions under which goods can be sold. This is really what we are doing. We think that this is necessary to-day. As I said, we on this side are vitally concerned with the closing of the gap in the inflationary measures. We know that there is an enormous volume of business being done to-day in motor cars, furniture, and electrical appliances, which are being sold under contracts of lease when they are in effect sales. The purpose of these leases is purely to evade the provisions of the Hire-Purchase Act. We agree that this should be stopped because it is not in the interests of the buyer, nor is it in the interests of the country. It may be in the interests of the seller, because we are encouraging people to spend beyond their means on goods that they cannot afford during a time when the country cannot afford to allow this to happen.</p>

<p>The prices at which these goods are being bought and sold are very much higher than the normal prices at which they could be bought and sold under normal circumstances, even under hire-purchase agreements. We know that the seller in many cases is adding as much as 20 per cent to the price of the goods and this again is having serious effects on the economy of the country. High interest rates can be charged by organizations that finance this type of transaction, and they can afford to pay these high interest rates because they are drawing the money from the public at high rates of interest. By doing so they are diverting funds from institutions and organizations, such as building societies, to which we on this side and, I believe, hon. members opposite, <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_0422"/>believe that the funds should be flowing. This will have the effect in some measure of not only doing the task that the Minister wants here, but other things will flow from it which I think are also a factor in the movement towards the ultimate reduction of the interest rate of this country. It is because these things are necessary, because of the times in which we live, because of the inflation that we are trying to overcome, that we support the Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the attitude of the hon. members of the Opposition and the way in which the hon. members for Constantia, Pinetown and Parktown have lent their conditional support to this Bill, and the way in which they pointed out certain problems. It is clear that they appreciate that there are certain practices in commerce which are prejudial to the consumer. They are in fact also prepared to co-operate if those malpractices can be eliminated. That is their attitude. The hon. member for Constantia also outlined in principle why they were opposed to price control. I have already taken note of their attitude in this regard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I never said that; I said that I was against permanent control.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member said that he was opposed to permanent price control, and that he felt that such restrictions should be renewed from year to year. As regards price control, I just want to say the following: There are few articles which are subject to price control through publication. Then there are quite a few other cases where price control is virtually in a voluntary form. Here I may refer to tyres, fuel, cement, cans in which goods are preserved, condensed milk, and so forth. It is possible to establish price control on a voluntary basis, particularly when one deals with large organizations and well organized undertakings throughout the country. There are, however, other cases which have to be put right. What we are therefore asking in principle here is that the powers may be extended in order that it may not be necessary in such cases to publish in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in the first place.</p>

<p>It has been said here that it is not good practice simply to give notice. It may nevertheless happen that one feels that a certain dealer in a certain town, or an undertaking which trades throughout the country, is selling a particular article at too high a price, and it is now asked that such a case should be corrected by letter. I think it was the hon. member for Constantia who said that this was now being done even in cases where such an article was not subject to price control. But I do not think the hon. member is quite correction saying that. I have been assured that correspondence takes place only in those cases where price control has been agreed on voluntarily. In cases where there is no such voluntary agreement, those persons are not asked by letter to reduce the price. The hon. member also referred to the prices of admission to cinemas. I understand that notices in this connection did in fact appear in the <i>Government Gazette</i> after an appeal had been made to the concerns involved not to increase the prices of admission.</p>

<p>Now the question is this: Should price control take place by way of written notice in such cases where there are perhaps only a few articles which are sold in this way, or where only a single undertaking is involved&#x003F; I feel that this discretion should in fact be given. I shall see to it that it is not exercised in many cases. As a result of the appeal made to the public last year by my predecessor, we find that they did bring sudden and unjustified price increases to the notice of the Department. Now the question is this: Should publication take place in cases where there was in fact an excessive charge, or can the matter be disposed of merely by writing to the person or undertaking concerned&#x003F; I feel that if the article or undertaking in question is not found throughout the country, publication is perhaps not justified.</p>

<p>If hon. members on the opposite side insist, I am prepared to consider a possible amendment on these lines. I shall do so if hon. members feel strongly that even in cases where only one undertaking or a group is involved, and after it has been ascertained that file position is in fact as alleged, it should appear in the Press for the information of others. It is just that I fear that it may be somewhat unfair to certain undertakings to do so. Nevertheless, if hon. members feel that it is a better solution to have publication take place after there has been correspondence, I shall be prepared to consider such an amendment. With co-operation I may even have a possible amendment drawn up.</p>

<p>I may as well give an example of a case in which it was even necessary to take quick action. Certain undertakings in Natal decided suddenly to increase the price of their articles in Natal.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I am sorry. They were contacted by telephone. Some years ago, on a previous occasion, there was even an announcement on the radio that it could not happen. Sometimes it is necessary to take quick action. There have therefore been cases where it was necessary to act in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to certain problems which he wanted to anticipate. He pointed out that hire-purchase transactions or lease contracts were customary. It is true that in commerce and even in industry it is becoming the practice to an increasing extent to lease many expensive articles on a lone-term basis. I am now thinking particularly of electronic <span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_0423"/>computers. It is by no means proposed to curb this. I think that for many undertakings it is impossible to raise the large amounts for purchasing these expensive articles and in addition to meet the costs of repairs. These items are usually of a very technical nature. There is not very great competition as far as they are concerned. I think it is an essential service which is rendered to industry in this connection.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to two instances. We find that certain articles are usually sold under a hire-purchase contract. We may consider motor cars&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinetown also mentioned them. Motor cars are usually sold under a hire-purchase contract. We find, however, that certain concerns are evading those conditions completely. There is no minimum deposit which has to be paid, no period is laid down, and consequently, in view of their ignorance or because they want to obtain an article which is perhaps completely beyond their means, certain persons have to be protected against their own ignorance. There is also another reason, and that is the following. As far as hire purchase is concerned, one of the means of combating inflation is measures to bring about a reduction in the buyer&#x2019;s demand or in the consumption. For that reason the Hire Purchase Act was in fact used in this country in the past to curb the inflationary tendencies by prescribing higher deposits and by providing that the purchase price should be paid in full over a shorter or a longer period. But this means that if the Government should perhaps decide as an anti-inflationary measure to restrict hire-purchase transactions by increasing the deposits or shortening the period, those provisions may be evaded by entering into a contract which is actually not a hire-purchase transaction. This is a further basic reason why this provision is necessary. I do not think it is in any way intended to oppose the good and essential practice of hire-purchase contracts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown asked what we regarded as a normal profit. It sometimes happens that in financing motor cars more than 30 per cent profit is made. I do not want to go into this any further, because I know that my colleague the Minister of Finance is dealing with certain amendment to the Usury Act. Basically this type of financing comes under the Usury Act. On the other hand, the provisions of the Usury Act are not of application to hire-purchase transactions.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred us to certain provisions of clause 2 and said that to him they did not seem to be quite correct. I shall have a look at that, and perhaps I shall have a further discussion on it with the hon. member. As far as fixing prices and charges for certain services are concerned, I think it is the basic principle not to proceed with that but to refer the whole matter to the Board of Trade and Industries. I shall correct it there if it is at all possible.</p>

<p>I think I have referred mainly to the fundamental objections raised by the hon. gentlemen. I appreciate that it is perhaps a difficult measure to implement. The intention is not, however, to intervene unnecessarily in any way in private initiative or commercial practices. These amendments are called for only with a view to application in those cases where some disruption is caused or where the existing Act cannot be applied effectively. I move.</p>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to break a lance for the angler with the hon. the Minister, in respect of the Bantu areas. In saying this I am referring to Bantu areas along the coastline of the Republic of South Africa and also Bantu areas in the interior of the Republic which offer fresh-water angling. I want to make it quite clear that I am not rising to plead for the interests of the commercial fisherman. Be it far from me to advocate their interests in this connection. This morning I am concerned only with the sporting angler, the person Who goes fishing for relaxation, and to whom angling is a sport.</p>

<p>I want to tell you at once that the establishment of cities and towns and their expansion are making inroads on the angling resorts. Day by day his angling waters are being cut down by various factors. There is the allocation of various areas for different population groups along the South African coastline, which has given rise to further restrictions for the angler throughout the country. I would almost say that it will not be long before an angler will be an unwelcome guest on the South Coast of Natal as a result of the tremendous expansion which has taken place there. As towns and cities expand, the angler will have to suffer further restrictions from time to time.</p>

<p>Further restrictions are imposed by the demands of Departments such as the Departments of Forestry, Water Affairs, Transport, Defence, Bantu Administration and Development, etc. In the same connection it should be borne in mind that existing popular angling resorts, for example St. Lucia, cannot meet the demand of the anglers in South Africa during peak periods.</p>

<p>Against the background of all this it should be appreciated that no other sport has expanded as much as angling during the past one or two decades. No other. Anglers in South Africa have increased until at present there are approximately 400,000 to 500,000 of them. No other sport equals this. It is on be <span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_0424"/>half of these sportsmen that I am making these representations to the hon. the Minister this morning. I shall try to discuss this subject again when we come to the Vote of the Department of Planning, when I shall deal with a further aspect. But now that this Vote is under discussion I want to suggest in the first place, and this is my first request, that the Minister should enter into consultations with the Government of the Transkei in an attempt to persuade the Transkeian Government to provide the white angler of the Republic of South Africa, who may be regarded as a tourist in the Transkei, with good angling facilities. Just as the Republic is trying to draw tourists from every quarter, I believe the Government of the Transkei will also endeavour to draw tourists from the Republic of South Africa and even from all over the world. For that reason it should provide the facilities along the Transkeian coastline which will induce these white anglers to go there. They should be provided by the people of the Transkei. This will be a source of revenue to those people.</p>

<p>Then I am beginning to doubt. The second request which I want to make relates to the coastline between Sordwana and the Mozambique border. This area is situated in a Bantu homeland. I want to ask that anglers should receive more encouragement there and should be drawn to those areas, because it may be a source of revenue to those homelands. The Whites should be enabled to go there. The control over those angling resorts which may be established by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development may perhaps be placed in the hands of the South African Angling Union.</p>

<p>No, I am not sneaking on behalf of them; this is a request I am making on behalf of the anglers of South Africa. But if I am to recommend a body to exercise control over those areas on behalf of the anglers, then I say that the South African Angling Union may be considered. It is realistic to make this request for the simple reason that in white South Africa we grant beach areas to the Bantu. In all the controlled areas along our coastline in white South Africa the Bantu of the Republic may go angling. Those areas are open to them.</p>

<p>No, not in the white area, in the controlled areas. In the controlled areas in white South Africa the Bantu in South Africa may go angling. It is open for all angling to all the population groups. The Bantu in South Africa may go angling in those controlled areas just like any other population group. There would be no objection if the white angler were prohibited from angling in areas situated opposite Bantu towns on the coastline of that homeland.</p>

<p>No, he may not go angling in a white area. I said that he could in fact go angling in the controlled areas. If the hon. member cannot understand that, he may come and talk to me in a moment and I shall explain it to him. However, I am not going to waste the time I have available by explaining to him. We are not asking that the white angler should be admitted to coastal areas opposite the Bantu towns in the Bantu homelands. Nor shall we request admission to swimming areas for the Bantu in the Bantu homelands, because, by the same token, we do not expect the Bantu and other population groups to be allowed at our swimming areas and opposite our residential towns in the Republic.</p>

<p>Let me say this. The Sordwana-Kosi Bay-Mozambique border complex is an angling resort in world class. It is on a par with Bazaruto and St. Marthino. In 1963 61,158 people from South Africa visited Mozambique. In 1964 the figure was 70,146. In 1965 it increased to 75,686. In 1966 the figure was 75,926. It is an increase of more than 14,000 within four years. Now I say this. If each of these South Africans spent R50 in Mozambique, they paid an amount of R4 million into the coffers of Mozambique.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow him. He has touched on a very interesting topic, a topic on which I think we could spend quite a good deal of time with considerable profit.</p>

<p>I want to refer for a moment to the remarks made here yesterday by the hon. member for Marico, who is not here at present. I want to say that I think that it is regrettable that he made the speech yesterday in regard to certain developments in Zululand. We in this House have to deal with a multitude of matters of varying degrees of importance, but there comes a time when we are dealing with matters of supreme importance, of critical importance. I deprecate the hon. member making a speech as he did yesterday on an important matter. I must say that I agree with the hon. the Minister when he said that he hoped "hat as far as possible the names of individual Bantu leaders would not be used more than is absolutely necessary in this House. There come times when, for various reasons, because of reasons of State, it is <span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_0425"/>necessary that names shall be used. But unless that is the case&#x2014;and it was not the case yesterday&#x2014;then I deprecate it if names are so used. I think that it was very unfortunate that the hon. member spoke as he did. Because, Sir, it starts a certain train of thought running, it gives rise to certain effects.</p>

<p>I want to say that, whatever the hon. member may have thought in regard to the position in Zululand, when he uses the name of the Paramount Chief he is wrong. It is a pity that he said what he said. I am trying to choose my words, because I do not want to be guilty of causing any of the ill effects which can flow from the kind of speech which we heard here yesterday.</p>

<p>The position is that the Government is pursuing its own policy a policy with which I disagree but which is nevertheless the policy of the Government of South Africa. As far as the people of Zululand are concerned, it is the policy of the Government of South Africa. The Government wishes that policy to be accepted. But it also wishes it to be acceptable. Up to now the policy has not been accepted there, it is not acceptable. Negotiations take place from time to time. Here I want to repeat what I said here yesterday. These folk are some of the most law-abiding, responsible people that we have got in the whole of the Republic. And it is a good thing that it is so&#x2014;for all of us. They are some of the most loyal and law-abiding people, and they are people who inhabit our country on the northern border where we are situated next to another country in which difficulties have arisen. Grave political difficulties have arisen there. The people who live on our side of the border are our Zulu people. They occupy a strategic position as far as South Africa is concerned, which is unique because of their own past history and their present situation. They occupy not only the country on our northern border but also the country on our seaboard there.</p>

<p>The Government may take measures&#x2014;and I hope appropriate measures&#x2014;not to force these people into anything. What is their attitude to the proposals that have been made&#x003F; Their attitude is that they are a conquered people and they can be ordered to do certain things. And they will carry out orders. They do not understand what consultation means because they do not understand the politics of the white man and the political way which white people have of dealing with their political affairs. They understand the position of a conquered man who is given an order and told to carry it out. Their position is quite clear. They say, &#x201C;If we are ordered, we will do what we are told, loyally and to the best of our ability&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I think that what the hon. the Minister said yesterday was of the utmost importance when he said that he will compel none of the Bantu people by force to accept independence. That is what the Minister said yesterday. That is a statement of surpassing importance to South Africa. When the Minister made that statement and committed the Government yesterday, he was saying it also to those people who at the present time are going slowly and haltingly along the line which the white people have cast for them. They are going slowly because they are a cautious people. They want to see where this path leads. They want to see whether it has, in fact, the benefits which are claimed for it by its proposers. They want to see it operating successfully somewhere. There is only one place in South Africa so far where it can be operating successfully, and that is in the Transkei. They want to see it being successful. They are cautious. That is why I say that the Minister&#x2019;s statement was of surpassing importance.</p>

<p>I want to plead with the Minister. As far as possible I want him to get hon. members on both sides of the House not only not to mention the names of individuals here, but to keep this issue out of the party politics of the white man here in Parliament. This is not a matter to be trifled with. What we say here can be so easily misunderstood when you get up onto the Lebombo mountains. We must always bear that in mind. It is misunderstood sometimes by white men a long way away from Cape Town. The inner meaning of what is said here can so easily be misunderstood. It is looked at from the point of view of the background, the tradition and the language of the folk concerned, not the background and tradition and language of the people who are speaking here in Parliament.</p>

<p>So I plead with the hon. the Minister to go slowly with these people. Deal with soil and water conservation and with the practical things of life so that they can see for themselves the benefits that flow from the Government&#x2019;s policy. Those are things which are acceptable to all sides of the House. We all want soil and water conservation measures carried out. It can be demonstrated that it is beneficial. Those are the practical things of life, but when it comes to political considerations and our ideas of politics I ask the Minister please to go slowly, and as far as possible on both sides of the House let us keep those matters out of the debates here so that the people there can see the fruit of the tree, so that they can see other people experiment on the lines they are being asked to follow, and when they have seen the success of the experiment that will be the time to press them to take similar steps. But in the meantime they stand back, and I believe they are entitled to do so and so say: Do not force us, and if you are going to force us, do not say you are asking our opinion, but order us to do something and we will do it. That is clear to me, and I understand how those people think. In the meantime I say the Minister should neither order them nor force them to try to give him advice as to what their people think about it. The people will declare themselves. I just ask the Minister to go slowly with these <span class="col_6329-6330" refersTo="page_0426"/>things and to keep the emphasis away from political considerations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast will pardon me if I do not follow him in his approach. I should like to make a few observations in respect of the Bantu in South-West Africa, and to make a specific request to the hon. the Minister. As we know that South Africa is sincere in her endeavour to do certain things in respect of the Bantu in South-West and as we know that this is founded on the equitable principle that she wishes to provide every ethnic group with its own opportunity for development towards self-determination, I should like to refer to the speech the hon. the Minister made in Ovamboland recently, in which he proved once again that South Africa was sincere in her intentions with the various Bantu groups there. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Self-determination is the foundation of our policy. Every ethnic unit must manage its own affairs, and in that respect our Republican Government is helping every ethnic unit as long as it is necessary. The form of self-government will of course differ from one ethnic unit to another &#x2026; It must be appreciated that our Government&#x2019;s policy of creating separate development for every nation is a living and growing policy. For that reason matters cannot be stationary &#x2026; In fact, a comprehensive plan has been drawn up in terms of which in Ovamboland approximately R30 million will be spent in the next five years by my Department alone, on stock-breeding, fencing, buildings, roads, airports, economic affairs, education, etc.</block>

<p>With reference to this speech by the hon. the Minister and to the accusations levelled against South Africa throughout the world at present, to the effect that we neglected promoting the material, moral and social welfare of the inhabitants, I think it is necessary that it should be placed on record in this House and that the Minister should give us information again in connection with his announcement in Ovamboland on the expansion of the economy of that population and on this expenditure of R30 million during the next five years. Yesterday the hon. the Minister referred to a five-year plan, and I assume that there is also a five-year plan for Ovamboland. In this connection I should like to make a request to the Minister. What about the other population groups there, such as the Okavango&#x2019;s, the Damara&#x2019;s, the Nama&#x2019;s, the Herero&#x2019;s, the Eastern Caprivians and the Bushmen&#x003F; We know what has been done. We saw that in this comprehensive report <i>South-West African Survey,</i> for which we are very grateful and which showed what has already been done for these Bantu population groups in South-West. But we feel that in future a great deal more should be done and is going to be done, and I am therefore making this request to the Minister to give us a clearer exposition of the plans of his Department in respect of the development of this Bantu population with a view to leading them to self-determination and self-reliance. But one also appreciates that in this aid programme there are many problems, because it is a vast country covering more than 300,000 square miles, which varies from rich and fertile land to sandy deserts, and where the rainfall varies from nil in the desert regions to a tropical rainfall. What is characteristic is that the population in the territory have retained their differences through the ages. They differ in physique and in appearance and in ethnic origin, and they differ in language and in culture, and they are at different stages of development. These different ethnic groups regard themselves as separate nations and prefer to continue as such in future, and not to be dominated by some group or other. Locality has also contributed towards underlining these differences, in their eating habits, their hunting customs, their farming methods, and everything else. It is therefore essential that in this aid programme it should be very clearly apparent that these different population groups, each with its own traditional customs and its own language and culture and way of life, should be preserved in this way to ensure peaceful co-existence and thus to achieve the maximum development for each ethnic group and the maximum development for the territory in its entirety. As these population groups practise the agricultural industry, I want to submit that in respect of mining and industries this has been neglected to some extent, but that in future we should concentrate on agriculture. In order to be of assistance in this field, certain things are most essential and should receive attention. The first is the provision of water. A great deal has been done in that regard, but perhaps the Minister may tell us in more detail what is planned for the next five years. There is fencing and the improvement of their stock. One finds large stock-farmers among them, also sheep farmers, and in the different regions in which they live we find that they are restricted to certain types of farming. There is control over stock diseases, and then there is the problem of impressing upon them that it should not merely be a self-supporting economy but also a marketing economy, and that these animals should be marketed. Many of them still have the idea that the number of their stock is actually a status symbol, and they are not eager to sell them. However, there are problems in respect of the marketing aspect and there are too few veterinary surgeons, because in the northern regions, where the largest numbers of stock occur, lung disease and foot-and-mouth disease are endemic. I therefore want to make this request to the Minister, that very good control measures should also be imposed in respect of stock diseases and that veterinary services should be emphasized and that it should happen in such a way that they will not jeopardize the entire South-West African economy by marketing animals deriving from those regions, <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_0427"/>but that by controlling those stock diseases they may be freed of those diseases in order not to harm the entire South-West African economy, which is based on agriculture. In respect of all the other developments, such as transport, the creation of infrastructures, health, education and social services, I should also like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s further plans for the future are.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday and to-day we heard nothing but attacks from the Opposition on the creation of the homelands. The Opposition attacked the Minister and the Government on everything that has been done and that is to be done in the homelands in future. I wondered whether we should not forget about the Opposition, because in my opinion it is mischievous of them. They will not understand what is being done there, and they will not see that the homelands are becoming reality and they will not see that we are continuing with that work. But I want to say that the homelands have become reality and that we should take every opportunity to explain the homelands and their planning to the urban Bantu. If we have the co-operation of the Bantu in the large cities and if we cultivate love in them and the realization that it is their homeland as well, and land which will be their land, we shall achieve great results in future. Where large schools are established in the urban Bantu townships, I have wondered whether those schools should not be transferred to the homelands in order that the Bantu may learn from an early age that his school is in his homeland; the country which he inherited from his fathers and which he must learn to love, and the country which he must help to develop for his nation and for posterity. If one cultivates love for his own in the child, I believe we shall achieve results. Furthermore, I also want to plead with the Minister, like the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, that homes should be established in the homelands for the aged Bantu who are no longer able to work in order that they may also have the privilege of finding a place of rest in their own country. If we can assimilate the aged people and the youth in those homelands. the ordinary Bantu will follow. The homelands are reality and we know that in future that ideal should be developed. How can we get the urban Bantu to understand that&#x003F; Here I want to thank the Minister for the fact that a year or two ago he enabled the various large Bantu advisory councils to undertake a tour through all these Bantu homelands. It was worth the trouble. I also know that the Department of Bantu Administration is doing a great deal to take Bantu businessmen through the different homelands, because we need these businessmen as well, as they have already achieved great success in the Bantu townships. They have proved that in business the Bantu is quite as astute as any White. If those Bantu from the cities could also establish businesses in the homelands, I know that they will achieve success there as well. It was said yesterday that there were Whites in the homelands who owned certain businesses and that those Whites had taught the Bantu and had to get out now, but I may assure those hon. members that on the Witwatersrand we have Bantu businessmen nowadays who are quite as capable as any Whites. Just give them a chance in their own homelands and you will see the results. I thank the Government for the assistance rendered to those persons. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the establishment of Bantu townships has been under heavy fire in the past, but I may give you the assurance that they are a success, and just as they are a success, we on this side believe that the Bantu homelands have become reality and that in future they will be a great success.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein, towards the end of his speech, became quite lyrical about the establishment of Bantu townships in white areas. I almost thought for a moment that he was going to plead with the hon. the Minister to leave them there and perhaps even to extend them further. Sir, he also referred to Bantu businessmen and I agree with him that many of the Bantu businessmen have progressed. We know that at the present moment there is a congress of Bantu businessmen from all over the country sitting in Cape Town, and I say:</p>

<p>More power to the Government&#x2019;s elbow; let us develop more of these people. The hon. member for Stilfontein also spoke about Bantu homelands which he says have become a fact, and he says that the Bantu must be taught to love their homelands. Sir, I submit that they have always had what this Government now calls a homeland. We have always had the reserves; we have always had the Bantu areas which they have considered to be their homes, and I do not think that they regard them any more as their homes to-day than they did before.</p>

<p>Sir, yesterday we had the hon. member for Aliwal waxing lyrical about the &#x201C;rooigras&#x201D; which is now growing in the Transkei and about the greater carrying capacity of the Transkei, the fact that the Transkei can now car&#x2019;-y more stock and so on. During a debate earlier this Session I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, when he also waxed lyrical about the amount of money that we had spent here, whether the carrying capacity of the Transkei had been increased. Sir, I still have not had any answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister, and I think this applies not only to him but to his colleague, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, who yesterday also told us about the fantastic sums of money which had been spent on the Ciskei and so on and about the employment opportunities which had been provided in those areas. Sir, I want to put this question to both those hon. Deputy Ministers: Has the carrying capacity of the Transkei and the Ciskei been increased, not only with regard to stock and <span class="col_6333-6334" refersTo="page_0428"/>agriculture, but from the point of view of people&#x003F; Can more people get employment there to-day&#x003F;</p>

I ask you, Sir! I cannot follow the argument of the hon. the Deputy Minister. This, of course, raises the question of how separate is separate development. As the hon. member for Transkei said, here they are compelling people of different racial groups, by legislation, to live next door to each other. My own brother-in-law in the Transkei is compelled to live with Bantu people on either side of him. He is not objecting: he is not opposing it and he never has. It has been accepted by the people in the Transkei, but this Government has first said that it is wrong and then they come and compel it by law. Let us go further into this question of separate development. How separate is separate development when you can have a statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education that Soweto is wrong as a Bantu township on the outskirts of a city. but Umlazi, Imbali and a few others like that are all right. What is the difference&#x003F; [interjections.] Sir, I know what the hon. the Deputy Minister will say. He will say that they are in Bantu homelands but since when have they been Bantu homeland&#x003F; These places have all been established on what was white-owned land. Umlazi township is established on land which at one time belonged to the great-great grandfather of the hon. member for Pinelands. He owned the land on which Umlazi township is now established: it was subsequently a sugar farm. What about Imbali outside Pietermaritzburg&#x003F; That was all white-owned land.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down became so entangled in figures that he reminded me of a saying I once heard: &#x201C;The figures do not lie, but liars can figure&#x201D;. With reference to the wise words spoken by the hon. member for South Coast a moment ago, I want to tell you a story, Mr. Chairman, of what happened in Natal where a Bantu Commissioner had to explain the Government&#x2019;s policy to the Bantu. He did so in his own language. The wise men, some of them grey-beards, sat there and listened attentively, and the Bantu Commissioner wondered how they would receive it and how they would understand it. One of the wise old men sat there and made this gesture with his hands, a gesture as though he had something in his hands which he was passing from one hand to the other, and the Bantu Commissioner, who understands the Bantu, knew at once that what he said had been well received, because the wise old man wanted to indicate that it was such a delicate matter that one should handle it the way one handles an egg; if one drooped it, it would break. I am therefore grateful that the hon. member for South Coast used such wise words. The hon. member for Houghton would do well to take notice of that; she would do well to read and study the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, because the question occurs to me: How many people does she represent here to-day&#x003F; She has regarded herself as the advocate and as the patron of an under-privileged group. She believed, of course, that it is only the non-Whites who are under-privileged. There are also Whites who are under-privileged. She pleaded their cause here, but she did so in such an inciting, inflammatory way that I wonder how many of them to-day &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter, namely this: In my constituency and also in other large centres there are persons who do not accept the policy of separate development with the enthusiasm with which it is received by those of us who are filled with idealism, and they are undermining the policy of the Government, which makes the laws which apply in this country. Them are many Whites who in conflict with the law permit Bantu to be accommodated on their premises, where they spend the night and from where they leave the next day for their various places of employment. There are certain suburbs of certain cities where there is even a regular bus service to transport these Bantu from the suburbs to their places of employment. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to do everything in his power to clear up that situation as soon as possible. It gives rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction among the Whites, both supporters of the Government <span class="col_6337-6338" refersTo="page_0430"/>and those who are not supporters of the Government, and it is a matter which in my view should enjoy very serious attention from the Government.</p>

<p>&#x2026; that abuse is a very poor substitute for argument. In fact it is no substitute at all. Neither of those hon. Ministers have answered at all any of the objections I made to the system that the Government is <span class="col_6339-6340" refersTo="page_0431"/>implementing as far as the migratory system is concerned. I say to the hon. the Minister quite unequivocally that I am quite certain that there is no church in this country, be it the Dutch Reformed Church, the Anglican, the Roman Catholic or the Jewish Church, which system. Everybody knows it is a bad system would in any way defend the migratory labour sociologically. He knows that as well as I do, because the report that he read out from the main body at Bloemfontein expressed its appreciation to the Government for what it was doing to reduce the migratory labour system and not for what it was doing to increase the system. All the sound and fury and all this tremendous excitement, because I dare to quote a Dutch Reformed Church report, mean nothing to me. This is a lot of nonsense and the hon. the Minister knows it himself and his anger certainly does not deceive or divert me.</p>

<p>I was very interested to see the announcement of the new five-year plan for Africans which is reported in the Press to-day and which the Minister mentioned yesterday. One thing I want to say is that I am glad to see that a larger percentage is being set aside for economic development, namely for secondary and tertiary development in this five-year plan, than was set aside in the first five-year plan. I hope the hon. the Minister is listening to me. It might please him more than last night&#x2019;s speech. The first five-year plan set aside, I think, R141 million and R76 million of that was for housing, of all things, and not in the urban areas, of course, because that does not fall under this Vote at all. That is the municipality&#x2019;s responsibility via the National Housing Commission. That amount was for housing in the Native reserves and in the so-called border areas. I do not believe all of that R76 million was spent on housing. As far as I can make out from the answers given to me by the hon. the Minister over the years, something like R102 million was spent in all between 1960 and 1965 plus R16 million that was spent in the Transkei. Of that something like R25 million was spent on housing. Last year an enormous amount was spent on housing, namely about R32 million out of a total amount of R61 million in the Bantu areas, that is in homelands and in the border areas. I think, of course, that this is a most unproductive expenditure. It is highly unproductive. It simply means that rural villages have been set up to provide housing for the families of the workers endorsed out of the urban areas, and those who have been removed from agricultural occupations in the reserves and who presumably are to be the reservoir of labour, either for the border industry areas, or for any other schemes like the Orange River development scheme. Or else it is migratory labour which is going to be allowed to come into the towns. This to me is unproductive expenditure.</p>

<p>I am not interested in that hon. member&#x2019;s opinion, anyway. This is again more abuse but no argument. To me the important matter is to spend more of this money on agriculture, to make the reserves more productive, which they badly require in order to provide for some of the existing population. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister has had a pipe dream again about being able to provide sufficient employment for all the natural increase in that population, but at any rate it will not be on a reasonable standard of living. Of course one can keep people living below the breadline and say you are looking after them. The hon. member will perhaps tell us something about the average income of a family in the reserve entirely dependent on agriculture. Would he like to give us a figure in that regard&#x003F;</p>

<p>But this is a very important question.

The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that, when the Tomlinson Commission reported, the average income of a family of five in the reserves was &#x00A3;40 a year. That included not only the amount which was realized on the sale of agricultural products, not only the amount consumed by the family of five, but also the earnings of the migratory worker in that family. I want to know now what figure is considered adequate for supporting what he calls the natural increase of the reserves. I think we will find it is very low indeed. I think we are entitled to have this figure, because all these figures are meaningless if they are not at least adequate for subsistence living. I still believe that to the greatest possible extent the reserves are going to be dependent on the earnings of migratory workers.</p>

<p>Twice last night and again this morning the hon. member for Houghton tried to tell this House what the policy of the D.R. Church was supposed to be in connection with this matter. But I want to point out to her that the report to which she referred was a preliminary report to the Cape Synod. The Cape Synod did not accept this report because the Cape Synod is not a policy-formulating body. The report was therefore forwarded to the General Synod in Bloemfontein, which is the policy-making body. Here I have the <i>Christian Minister,</i> from which she quoted yesterday, as well as other documents following it. I now want to demonstrate to her how that original document changed. For example, paragraph 2 of that report was substituted completely and was not, as the hon. member alleged, accepted as it appeared in the <i>Christian Minister.</i> Paragraph 9 was amended; paragraph 10 (a) was substituted; a large portion of paragraph 14 was omitted&#x2014;rejected completely; paragraphs 15, 16, 17 and 19 were amended; paragraph 20 was referred back to the study committee concerned for further study; paragraph 21 (a) was substituted.

<p>It is not necessary &#x2014;I understand very well what the hon. member wants. She wants to suggest to this House and to the outside world that the D.R.

Church is as is published in the <i>Christian Minister.</i> Well, I am telling her that that is not the case. The policy is as recorded in the minutes of the General Synod. Yesterday, the hon. the Minister quoted from these minutes of the General Synod. If the hon. member would also consult this document, she would find neither the words &#x201C;alarming&#x201D; and &#x201C;cancer&#x201D; there, nor the sentence &#x201C;by virtue of God&#x2019;s laws &#x2026; which she also quoted. What right has the hon. member to declare the <i>Christian Minister</i> the organ of the D.R. Church&#x003F; No <i>ad hoc</i> commission of the General Synod can bind the General Synod, any more than a committee of this House could bind the House to a resolution or a report.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall try to make a positive contribution to this debate, and hon. members of the Opposition will forgive me if in order to do so I do not pay much attention to them.</p>

<p>In recent times there has been particular emphasis on the urban Bantu. I should now like to say something about the Bantu in the rural areas and on the population ratio in those areas as it has changed in the past number of years. I just want to quote some figures. Whereas 46.6 per cent of the Whites lived in the rural areas in 1911, this percentage was only 18.3 in 1958, and according to a recent survey made in the Transvaal only 8 per cent of the population in the rural areas in this Province are white. There are various reasons for this state of affairs&#x2014;amongst others, the process of industrialization in the course of the past few years, which in particular has caused the urbanization of Whites. Our people in the rural areas are aware of the problems in this regard and would like to help to bring about a better population ratio in the rural areas. The farmer in agriculture also wants to contribute his share. But here certain problems exist which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. One of the labour systems prevailing in the rural areas is that of squatters, a type of labourer which is in temporary employment and living on the farms. Committees have been appointed to regulate this labour. Under this system the farmer can build up a supply of labourers on his farm, a reserve from which he may then draw his labour during seasons when labour is urgently needed. It is a system which has also made its contribution to upsetting the relationship between the population groups in the rural areas, namely through the further blackening of the rural areas. It is now the policy, and quite rightly, that this type of labour should be abolished. This means that as far as seasonal labour is concerned, agriculture has to rely on labour from the homelands, but in the homelands the recruiting organization is not what it should be. As a result the farmers are not so eager to co-operate as regards rationing labour, and for that reason it is not being implemented as it should be. There are, of course, the Bantu labour councils which have to regulate all forms of labour on the farms. There are also some farmers on those councils, and they are therefore directly concerned with determining the labour demands of farmers on the farms. We can appreciate that these people will not be so conservative as regards rationing this labour. They <span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_0433"/>do not have a reserve of labourers on their farms any longer, but now have to rely solely on seasonal labour from the homelands. We are therefore very grateful that the hon. the Deputy Minister recently announced at Lichtenburg that this type of labour was now to be reorganized in order that there could be more effective mobilization of labour in the homelands. Amongst other things, the hon. the Deputy Minister said that consideration would be given to a system under which every Bantu in the homelands would be required to have himself registered as a work-seeker.</p>

<p>The time has also come that we should bring it home to these people that their major export product, through which they can stimulate the economy of their homeland, is their labour, which they can export. For that reason this product must be of a higher quality. They must appreciate that they have to compete with labour from other homelands. They must appreciate that in agriculture we can draw labour even from neighbouring states. We must therefore make it clear to these people that separate development also means self-development.</p>

<p>I am opposed to interference in the private life of any person. If the Government is sincere in its policy and in its intention that the Bantu homelands are to be homelands for the Bantu where they can live as they wish to live, then it would be wrong to use them as a reservoir of compulsorily registered labour to be taken out of the Bantu areas for employment in the white areas because the white man may need labour. My answer therefore to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s question is that I would be opposed to any compulsory registration which has as its object the forcing of people to register and then to force them to work, either for the white man or anywhere else, against their will. I couple my objection to the concept of forced labour, something to which we are all totally opposed. But let me relate this question also to the overall policy of the Government. I have here a statement which was made by the hon. the Minister of Mines and Planning last year. I quote from the <i>S.A. Digest</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There they have already started to exercise their national aspirations to the full. My Government assists and guides them and has pledged itself to continue to do so. We are working with black nationalism, not against it.</block>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the House adjourned for lunch I had warned the Government that it should not create the impression that it was contemplating forced labour in South Africa. I want to make it quite clear that that does not mean that we are opposed to the registration of &#x201C;work-seekers&#x201D;. We have always supported the labour bureaux and the registration of those who are seeking work or those who are in the white cities under permit. I asked how the Government could reconcile the statement made by one of <span class="col_6345-6346" refersTo="page_0434"/>its Ministers that it was working with black nationalism and that the Bantu within their own areas would control their own affairs, with the suggestion that they were going to compulsorily register, within the Bantu areas, labour which is to be forcibly taken from the Bantu areas to the white areas. But that is not the only danger. In recent weeks we have had a number of confrontations between the South African Government and the Government of the Transkei. I do not have time to quote them. I have a report here which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Suid-Afrika jaag nou met kierie. Ons sal die saak nie laat vaar nie totdat alle Transkeise burgers toegelaat word om in die nywerheidsentrums in Suid-Afrika te werk.</block>

<p>There is another demanding the amalgamation of the Ciskei with the Transkei and saying that it is in accord with the policy of the Republican Government. We have had statements about the take-over of departments which have been denied by the Ministers of this Government. I want to know how these conflicting views are going to be reconciled. Here we are now having head-on clashes and direct opposition on specific policies with the Transkeian Government. It states that it will not allow its citizens to be kept out of the work centres of South Africa, and it makes statements about taking over departments, about consolidating the Transkei and the Ciskei, etc., and our Government makes different statements. Where is this confrontation going to lead us and who is going to have to give up&#x003F; Will it be like the Ndamse case where the white Government had to give way, or is the Bantu Governments of the Transkei and the other Bantustans which will have to give way&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now want to refer to another matter. I want to take the strongest exception to the fact that the Minister should during the course of this debate&#x2014;whilst we are discussing his Vote&#x2014;issue to the Press a vital statement on the development of the Bantu areas, a statement outlining a five-year plan with an expenditure of R490 million over five years. Yet we are busy in this House discussing these very matters. He goes behind the back of the House and issues to the public through the Press a statement on the five-year plan of the Government. We take the strongest exception to this. Seeing that the Minister has decided to do that, now let him stand up in this House and give us the details of that plan. Is this just eyewash or is it real&#x003F; The last five-year plan was started in 1961, and was due to expire at the end of 1966. We now find that for a whole year while the original five-year plan was in operation, a second five-year plan has also been operating. I say that the figures given for that year of overlap between the last five-year plan and this new one are completely out of proportion to what this House has voted. The figures are not nearly similar. I call upon the hon. the Minister to give this House the information not only concerning his plan but also what he has spent on the last five-year plan in relation to what the original plan intended and to reconcile the money which we are now being asked to vote with what he has told the Press are his plans for the Bantu areas. We want to see those areas develop. We want to see them given an opportunity to increase their carrying power. We do not believe that this Government is going about it in the right way. Therefore we are particularly interested to know that there is a plan. We want to hear how that plan is going to cope with the Bantu who are to be removed within the next few years from the white areas of South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. the hon. member for Durban (Point) need not get so hot under the collar. I think the hon. the Minister gave an adequate reply to that yesterday. He indicated that the proposed five-year plan was available at the Department and he even invited the Press to go and get it there to give a full report on it.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another matter. I am glad that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is here, because this is in fact with reference to a remark made by him earlier this year in a debate which took place in this House. I first want to say that on that occasion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to the so-called &#x201C;federal concept&#x201D;. I want to confirm that in my view it is perhaps the best description for that, because I do not think it is a &#x201C;federal system&#x201D;. Let us therefore leave it at a federal concept. I would then be grateful if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition could give us more particulars in this regard. He mentioned some of the units which would be included in the federal concept. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he could not name some more units. Here he mentioned the Transkei, the Ciskei. Tswanaland, Zululand, etc. I want to ask him whether it is not possible to enlarge further on that in order that the voters of South Africa may also know what the attitude of the Opposition is in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>What I actually want to refer to is the important statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. The hon. the Prime Minister asked him this question: Why, then, is this the policy of the United Party, in contrast with the policy as announced initially by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, namely that the eight representatives of the Bantu which he envisaged in this Parliament could eventually also be Bantu&#x003F; With reference to that statement the Prime Minister asked him why he was discarding that and only provided for there being Whites. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition then said, and I do not want to quote him incorrectly: &#x201C;The answer to that is very simple. Pressure mounts, and at that stage the pressure in the country was very bad as a result of the policy of this Government.&#x201D; That was the reply of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Now I want to say at once that this statement made by the hon. the Leader <span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_0435"/>of the Opposition implies this important admission, namely that before this recent announcement the United Party did in fact envisage that the eight representatives of the Bantu in South Africa would eventually also be Bantu. The second important part of the admission is this, that now that the pressure has decreased, the Opposition has reconsidered its position. Now it is prepared to state that those eight representatives will be Whites. At the moment the implication is, firstly, that the U.P.&#x2019;s policy is subject to pressure. It is a quite logical deduction, that the U.P.&#x2019;s policy is subject to pressure. In other words, if pressure mounts it will change its policy as it has in fact done it. If the pressure decreases it will adjust it once again. It is a very important change of front in the policy of the United Party. Its policy is now subject to pressure. Not necessarily from members of its Party, but also from people in the country and abroad. It is a very important admission. In other words, if the pressure which prevailed were to apply again, the Opposition would again be prepared to state that the eight representatives of the Bantu in this House would be Bantu. Surely that is quite logical. That was its attitude. Because the pressure decreased. it changed its policy. Now it is also logical to assume that if that pressure mounts again to the same extent, the representatives will again be Bantu. Now the question is: What other aspects of the United Party&#x2019;s policy are subject to pressure&#x003F; Which policies of the United Party in this country are subject to pressure and which are not&#x003F; Is its policy in respect of the Bantu in general, or of the Bantu in the cities, or wherever they may be, subject to pressure or is it not subject to pressure&#x003F; This is not a debate on economic affairs, etc., but I want to know what other aspects of the Opposition policy, apart from their Bantu policy, are subject to pressure. I should like to hear that from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Now I want to say that if as a result of pressure the United Party&#x2019;s policy can jump from eight white representatives for the Bantu in this House to eight Bantu representatives in this House, I should like to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition what a jump his Party is prepared to make, for example in respect of the numbers to represent the Bantu here. As the hon. the Leader of the Opposition explained, they will be represented by eight people. Now I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Is the jump from eight to ten, for example, or to 12 or 20, indeed so large as from eight white representatives to eight Bantu representatives&#x003F; In my modest opinion this is not even at issue. To admit that the policy has changed from one position to the other is indeed a jump which we have never seen in this country. Now I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: If the same pressure is exerted on him in respect of the numbers in this House, what jump is he prepared to make then&#x003F; To how many would those eight representatives be increased&#x003F; That is the second question I want to ask.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have heard a very important admission in respect of our politics in South Africa. This is, namely, that a party will pursue and formulate its policy in accordance with the pressure exerted on it. We see that as something new in our politics. In other words, a party has its policy, but that policy is of no consequence. It depends on the degree of pressure exerted or not exerted on that party. In other words, an absolutely new element has been introduced in our politics in South Africa. This is the fact that the United Party&#x2019;s policy is now no longer a consistent policy, but will depend on the degree of pressure exerted on it.</p>

<p>I also want to know how much pressure has to be exerted before the United Party is prepared to abandon its fundamental principles completely. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must give us more information on this. I also want to know whether the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition announced to the country and to the world that his policy would be adjusted according to the pressure exerted on it, is not in effect an invitation to the impure elements in this country actually to exert pressure on the United Party. We should bear in mind that that party is now the Opposition, but if that party ever came into power, in particular, I want to know whether it is not an invitation to the impure elements in this country to exert pressure in order that the United Party may yield.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with the short time at my disposal, I do not intend enlarging on what the hon. member for Middelland, the whip on the other side, has been saying. It is quite obvious that he has been trying to draw our attention away from the real issues at stake. We are not interested in red herrings from any whip on that side. We are only concerned about the issues at stake to-day in South Africa. For that reason I do not want to waste any time.</p>

<p>I should like to get on with a few points in regard to which I should like clarity. Coming from the border area of the Eastern Cape, I am naturally concerned, and so are many people in that area, about the so-called &#x201C;white corridor&#x201D;. At the beginning of this year the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development was on the point of telling us what their plans were, I think. But then his time expired &#x2014;I have his Hansard here&#x2014;and we never heard the final decision or his answer. I think it is time the Government cold us now, and told the urban as well as the divisional authorities of the East London complex and the farmers, the businessmen and the industrialists just where they stand. I think it is time that the inhabitants of this area were told just what corridor between the Kei River and East London is gradually being bought up for Native occupation. I should like to know whether <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_0436"/>farms are being sold to the Government for Native occupation in this area. I also want to know whether the Government has taken options on properties in the so-called white corridor. It is no use the Deputy Minister making all sorts of wild promises which are pointless to us in the Eastern Cape unless the Government can give us a positive assurance. The industrialists there, or those we endeavour to encourage to come to the Eastern Cape and the border area, are naturally worried because they do not know, nor do we here, whether, in the very near future, their industries will find themselves in a black area or in a white area or in fact in an industrial area.</p>

<p>You are kidding yourself. Not only that, Sir, it is a tragedy, because the hon. the Deputy Minister is kidding many people outside as well. This particular area covers thousands upon thousands of morgen, stretching from the Orange River in the north, and from the Kei River in the east to the Great Fish River in the west and the Indian Ocean in the south. This is the area which we would term the Ciskei and the Northern Cape. I know that much of the land in this area has already changed hands. It is no use the hon. the Deputy Minister shaking his head. We know that close to Kidd&#x2019;s Beach land has changed hands. The Government has been buying land there, and we find it difficult to-day to encourage industrialists to come to this area because no one can give them a guarantee as to what the future might bring. At the same time we have all this loose talk about taking the labour away from the Western Cape and settling them&#x2014;a lot of people would call it dumping them&#x2014;in the Eastern Cape. I should like to know what the Government&#x2019;s reactions were when Chief Matanzima recently said that negotiations were going on to persuade the South African Government to relax the influx control regulations as the Transkei had no industry to absorb the thousands of its citizens. Now, what is taking place&#x003F; I think it is only right that the hon. the Minister should tell us to-day what negotiations have taken place and what the Government has decided in regard to that request by Chief Matanzima. It interested me, when the Minister mentioned last night, that if the Black people are not ready for independence they will not get it. How long will Chief Matanzima and his party be able to reject resolutions like those introduced in the recent meeting of the legislative Assembly in Umtata, demanding independence before 5th May&#x003F; How long will they be able to continue rejecting resolutions of that sort&#x003F; [Interjection.] Nobody promised them independence before 1959. It is only this Government that has done so, and of course there has been pressure from U.N. also but the promise of independence to our black people has not satisfied one single state outside our borders. What I am interested in are the boundaries of this so-called Bantustan. Unfortunately we have not been able to ascertain just what these boundaries are. We would very much like to know, and I think we could demand to know, where these boundaries are. It is our birth-right and privilege to know. Where have you ever heard of any business or any establishment negotiating on a certain transaction, not to mention promising independence, and when once all the business has been concluded and agreed upon, then we decide where the boundaries will be&#x003F; I have never before heard of such a business transaction taking place, and I believe it is our birth-right to know where those boundaries are. Does the hon. the Minister stand by the 1936 Land and Trust Act of General Hertzog, or does he not&#x003F;</p>

For what purpose will the Department clear black spots&#x003F; To make it a black area&#x003F; In the second place I do not think that it was very intelligent of him to have discussed the borders of the Bantu areas here, because had he only consulted the 1963 Act of the Transkei, he would have seen very clearly that that Act defines the borders of the Transkei.</p>

<p>I want to leave the hon. member at that, because I should like to come to the hon. member for Durban (Point), who, in my modest opinion, displayed more cheek than common-sense this afternoon when he said that the Government must be warned that it must not create the impression of so-called &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D;. I want to tell the hon. member for Durban (Point), and also the Opposition, that I think the hon. member for <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_0437"/>Durban (Point) must be warned that he must not get up and speak of &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D; in this House. For whom does he do so&#x003F; He is merely doing so for consumption abroad. I want to issue a challenge to him. Will he get up he e and mention one single example of &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D; in South Africa&#x003F; Why then does he speak of &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D;&#x003F; A front bencher of the United Party should not say this type of thing. It is merely a reflection of two things. One of these is that the hon. member for Durban (Point)&#x2014;and we like him&#x2014; occasionally drops a small bomb merely for the sake of politicking, and secondly, in doing so he is merely reflecting the complete bankruptcy of the United Party as far as Bantu attains are concerned. The whole attitude of the United Party in regard to Bantu affairs really reminds me of the soldiers who were on parade when the sergeant-major gave the order, &#x201C;Raise you left foot and keep it in front of you&#x201D;. One of the soldiers, however, raised his right foot instead of his left foot. The sergeant-major looked at this and said, &#x201C;Who is that fool standing with both feet off the ground&#x003F;&#x201D; In its approach to Bantu affairs the United Party, as well as the hon. member for Houghton, is standing with both feet off the ground because they are so unpractical and unrealistic in this connection. No, our problem in South Africa is not at all one of &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D;. Nothing like that exists and it is a pity that those words have been introduced into the debate. Our problem is precisely that the supply of labour is so enormous that we are forced to keen labour out of South Africa. That is our problem, and not the opposite, which was the impression the hon. member tried to create. I want to say emphatically that I take exception to that term &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. member for Transkei, who asked here yesterday whether the policy of apartheid would make South Africa a happy country and would offer South Africa security. I do not want to deal with that at length&#x2014;I wish I had the time to do so&#x2014;but I just want to make this point: If one considers what has happened in South Africa over the past 20 years, then I think I am right in saying that the exceptional security and stability we are enjoying is actually one of the wonders of the world. No less a person than Dr. H. J. van Eck made a comparison in a Hoernle Memorial lecture a few years ago between the industrial revolution in South Africa and those in America and Britain, and he showed that South Africa had had a more rapid industrial development during the past 20 years than either of those countries. What did the great authorities, such as Engels, for example, prove in connection with revolutions&#x003F; They undeniably proved that &#x201C;riots were endemic&#x201D;, at their best riots, and that in the so-called welfare state of Great Britain, were endemic and where they had not been endemic they had become bloody revolutions. But South Africa with all the odds against it, in spite of even the United Party and the other people who wanted to make so much political capital with an eye on countries abroad, has succeeded in passing through such a period of rapid industrial development without those characteristics having been applicable to South Africa. What has happened in South Africa is really a miracle and one asks oneself to what that may be attributable&#x003F; The reply is quite simple. The reply is that that may, in the first place, be attributed to a strong National Party Government.</p>

<p>I may assure the hon. member that scientifically that is correct. In the second place it may be attributed to the economic stability we have in South Africa and in the third place it may be attributed to the implementation, justly and fairly, of the policy of apartheid and the policy of separate development in South Africa. Therefore we have the stability and therefore we have presented the world with this miracle over the past 20 years. I think the time has arrived for the United Party to realize that.</p>

<p>But I want to come to another important aspect in this connection and that is that in 1960, when the development of the border areas was commenced&#x2014;something which is, as the world is beginning to realize in spite of the Opposition, an important component of this real miracle which has taken place in South Africa&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think the Government has been proved on all sides to be attempting the impossible (in connection with the development of border areas). They seek to dictate, regulate, direct and interfere in the economy of the country. (Hansard, 1960, col. 34.)</block>

<p>He said that the Government would not manage to make a success of the development of border areas. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District&#x2014;for no particular reason we simply call him &#x201C;botter-bulletjie&#x201D;&#x2014;got up this afternoon and asked in a theatrical fasion, &#x201C;What has the development of border areas brought South Africa&#x003F;&#x201D; I should like to mention the following facts to him: The hon. member for Houghton also questioned the availability of facts relating to the results of the development of border areas. Particularly in the light of the United Party&#x2019;s attitude, the party that said that it was impossible to make a success of the development of border areas, I now want to mention the following facts to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: In the past 67 years more than 190 new large industries were established as a result of the development of border areas by the National Party Government. Does that look like attempting the impossible&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, the total direct additional investment in the secondary industries in the border areas alone up to the end of 1966, i.e. in <i>6j</i> years, amounted to R220 million.</p>

<p>We heard a great deal yesterday and to-day about the Transkei, the Ciskei, Natal and Zululand. I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to the other side of the country and refer to the position of the people north of the Orange River in regard to Bantu development. Sir, the first thing that springs to mind is this: The hon. member for Senekal said in the course of a speech recently, either at Albertinia or Riversdale, that the Western Cape, from which the Bantu were going to be removed, extended as far north as the Orange River, even into the Division of Hay, but strangely enough, the City of Kimberley was excluded. My purpose this afternoon is to inquire what the Government&#x2019;s intentions are, in regard to that part of the country in relation to the development of Twsana-stan, which is going to be founded in the northern part of the Cape Province. Sir, recently the municipality of the City of Kimberley decided, in view of the fact that the Cape Province was building a new hospital, to build a new hospital in the Bantu village which comprises some forty odd thousand people and which has been developed to a considerable extent and advanced in every possible direction for the benefit of the people who live there. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is true or false that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development has intruded into this decision to the extent that the hospital which was to be extended at Kimberley in the form of a brand-new hospital for Bantu alone &#x2026;</p>

<p>The whole fact of the matter is that deputations have visited Government departments to inquire exactly and precisely what is intended, and I speak on behalf of the Bantu in that part of the country, who want to know where they stand in this regard. It has been said that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development is going to build the hospital. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister how many beds are going to be provided at Papierstad, which is in the Taungs Native reserve or on the boundary of it, and what the future prospects are for people who take ill, 80 miles away at Kimberley and in the adjoining towns and who have to go to be treated as far as 80 miles away.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to raise in the limited time at my disposal is this. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has referred to the fact that the status of Bantu who have worked for ten years for one employer or who have lived in an urban area for 15 years, and who have the right to live there as a result of those qualifications, may be altered. What was more or less a threat, was aimed at the heads of the persons concerned, that they will be required to carry passports from a homeland with which they are not associated in any shape or form and which they know nothing about. They are the descendants of people who were born in the Transkei or Zululand or some other Bantu territory two or three generations ago. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether or not the new Bantu urban councils, which are being set up, and will be set up, in terms of the law, in the Bantu villages on the perimeters of urban areas, are going to be Bantu councils constituted from foreigners, from persons carrying passports. What are their functions and <span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_0439"/>duties going to be&#x003F; Will they be supplementary to or complementary to or in conflict with the existing authorities in the form of municipal councils, who control the Bantu villages at the present moment&#x003F; I think it is a point on which the country needs elucidation and on which an explanation from the Minister is long overdue. I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister what the future of municipal employees in the Bantu service is&#x2014;municipal employees of all municipalities affected by these Bantu Urban Councils now being brought into being. Finally I should like to ask the Minister whether or not it is his intention, in applying the law in regard to the employment of Bantu labour on farms, to employ white inspectors to visit farmers or is he going to employ Bantu inspectors&#x003F; Is it his intention to employ Bantu only in due course in the Bantu administration&#x003F; My information is that white inspectors are to be appointed in the Department of Bantu Administration but officials of the Bantu Affairs section of municipalities are more or less advised that their future is limited. Is that so&#x003F; Have they any future in Bantu Administration or should they do something on their own to get out and go to some other section of the municipal service&#x003F;</p>

<p>Another question I should like to ask from the hon. the Minister is by what standards does his department judge whether or not a person is a Griqua&#x003F; You may or may not know, Sir, that applications for identity cards and later registration of births are being forwarded to the Department of the Interior, applications by persons who claim to be Griqua. If there is any doubt about these persons they are sent to the Bantu Affairs Commissioner&#x2019;s office where they are dealt with by an official who then decides whether or not they are Griquas or Bantu. I should like to know by what standards is it decided whether these persons are Griquas or Bantu&#x003F; What is a Griqua&#x003F; That is the burning question&#x2014;we should like to know what a Griqua actually is. What is the definition of such a person&#x003F; At the present moment officials have these persons appear before them and they then decide, arbitrarily I think&#x2014;although I am subject to correction&#x2014;on what grounds an individual can claim to be a Griqua or not.</p>

<p>It is difficult for me to reply to what was said by previous speakers. Such a variety of ideas was expressed that even the Minister is going to find it difficult to connect up everything. To-day I should like to let the emphasis fall on the attitude which exists between White and non-White in this country. In order to implement our policy it is important for that attitude to be good. It is so that the attitude of the Bantu towards the Whites and towards our policy has improved gradually and that has happened in spite of the agitations which have been launched by the United Party from time to time. This Government, without distributing alms and without currying favour with the Bantu, has made an attempt to enable the Bantu to develop on their own strength&#x2014;even if that is going to take many generations. I am not speaking of the non-Whites in the cities of whom a few United Party members have experience&#x2014;I am speaking of the 90 per cent of non-Whites who are still completely uneducated. If we have to give an account of our stewardship over the past 20 years, we shall be able to point out that in 1948 only 733 Bantu children attended school and that 2,064,000 attended school last year. Between 1948 and March, 1966, 253,000 dwellings for non-Whites were constructed at a total cost of R242 million. A short while ago the hon. member for Houghton wanted to know what the income of an average Bantu family was. She referred to the findings of the Tomlinson Commission that that figure came to &#x00A3;40 per annum. However, she did not take the standard of living of the Bantu into account. Nor did she take into account that the Bantu in South Africa were better off than all Bantu in other countries in Africa. Nor did she take into account that the income of the Bantu had increased from R285 million, which it was in 1948, to nearly R1,000 million in 1964. Sneering references are made to the Bantu Development Corporation. Hon. members do not realize what harm they are doing by referring sneeringly to such a noble undertaking. Out of 5,000 applications received by the Bantu Investment Corporation, it was only possible to help 14.7 per cent. Why&#x003F; Because the Bantu is gradually beginning to realize that he will not be able to raise a loan for the establishment of a wholesale business without the guidance of the Whites. That requires staff, training and time. But these things will develop in the course of time amongst the Bantu. The European civilization has many centuries behind it. Development does not come overnight. First one has to develop spiritually. The Bantu himself has to put his shoulder to the wheel and has to decide to help his own people. This is a process which will take time. But I say that this Government, if we look back on what has already been achieved, is playing the game. I happened to come across the following letter written by a Bantu to the manager of the Bantu Investment Corporation. He writes (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Honourable Sir, I greet you as well as all the torch-bearers of progress. I address a friendly request to you to grant me a moment so that I may express my gratitude for the fine way in which we are being assisted by means of the upliftment work you are doing.</block>

<p><span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_0440"/>In the first place I should like to say thank you for the door of progress which is open to the Bantu and which is open for the Bantu in their own areas. After I had noticed how my brothers and sisters went to appeal for and also received assistance, I myself went to appeal for assistance at that door which is always open. I went through that door and I received the desired assistance.</p>

<p>To-day I am the proud owner of my own house built according to my own likes on a site I myself selected in the New Umlazi Bantu township. All these things could only be realized with the assistance of the B.D.C. (Durban branch). I express my gratitude for the support which I was given at that door and especially to the staff of the B.D.C. who largely contributed to the realization of my ideals.</p>

<p>My fondest wish to you is &#x201C;Forward&#x201D; with the upliftment work which is highly appreciated by us, and may that thankfulness continue to live in our hearts. With humble apologies, Yours sincerely, Alfred Kubeka.</p>

<p>I mention this so that hon. members may see that the Government is playing the game. To this hon. Minister and his Deputy Ministers I should like to quote these words of truth which we learned when we were small&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And when the one great Scorer comes to mark against your name He writes not that you won or lost, but how you played the game.</block>

<p>This Government is trying to play the game as far as the black man is concerned. I am sincere and honest when I say that.</p>

<p>Let me conclude with the following, because I was told to speak for six minutes only. There is one matter which I should like to bring to the attention of this Minister and the Deputy Minister, namely the labour tenants&#x2019; system in our country. I am now going to say something unpopular, and that is that I, as a farmer, regard the labour tenants&#x2019; system as something monstrous. It is unfair to expect that the Bantu has to work on the farm for the right to live there. More and more districts have decided on their own through the Transvaal Agricultural Union that the labour tenants&#x2019; system has to be abolished. We are wasting labour with this system. We are grateful that labour control boards have been established. We are grateful for that and for the fact that it is possible to exercise control over labour through them, because in some rural districts labour is definitely being wasted. The days are gone when three Bantu were sent to plant a gatepost. We must begin to mechanize completely and to become completely efficient and to make full use of the labour we have to the best of our ability. Unfortunately there are farms in our country to-day which are in the hands of Whites but which actually are Bantu farms. Therefore I want to tell this hon. Minister and the Deputy Minister, &#x201C;Continue on the road which has been taken and convince those people that we have to utilize our labour more effectively&#x201D;. There is nothing wrong with making use of casual labour. The American farmer who has not been able to mechanize, makes use of, for example, Mexican casual labour. In our case we may make use of the casual labour of the homelands, Mr. Chairman, I have taken seven minutes.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, my hon. friend who shares a bench with me will forgive me if I do not follow him in what he said. My time is as limited as his was. The hon. member for Houghton made a statement to-day in connection with the subsistence group in this country. These are the people who live from hand to mouth. That was an irresponsible statement which may create a wrong impression outside. The subsistence group in South Africa to whom she referred represents only 2 per cent, as compared with 30 per cent for the whole of Africa. The idea that our Bantu homelands are living below the breadline is a fallacy which she would like to broadcast to the world. I think the world is already beginning to realize what the hon. member for Houghton is and how she acts. I am convinced that it will be proved in the future that the development of border industries was one of the major and vital tasks of making a success of separate development. My statement is confirmed not only by the R220 million which has already been spent on border industries, not only by the 46,000 Bantu in employment, but also by the attendant large-scale development which is taking place in this new era. Just look at the development of Bantu townships in the Bantu homelands while border industries are developing. That is something grand to see. Last year the Department carried out its full programme. Nearly 13,000 houses were built by the Department within one year. In the past five years no less than 78,000 sites were laid out with all the additional plans, services, church sites and facilities for sports. All these things were established for the Bantu. But what is the psychological effect of these things on the Bantu&#x003F; To-day the Bantu realize that these are their own things. He has ownership of his own house. This develops a pride and a love in the Bantu for the things which are his own. Now I want to make the statement that in years to come you will find that the Bantu is going to contribute to an ever-increasing extent to the development of the homelands. The official Opposition is always willing to try to belittle the Bantu Investment Corporation and it is not nice to listen to people who are not even prepared to read a report. If one consults the legislation dealing with the Bantu Investment Corporation, one sees what the objects of the Corporation are. It is not merely a question of injecting capital into the homelands. The Act contains much greater and more important objects. What is the Corporation&#x2019;s biggest problem&#x003F; Its problem is that the Bantu&#x2019;s lack of specialized knowledge constitutes the greatest single obstacle to more rapid <span class="col_6359-6360" refersTo="page_0441"/>development. The Corporation accordingly considers the training of its human material as one of its most important functions. The cost incurred in respect of investigations and aftercare services amounted to R83,845 for the year under review and is regarded as an indirect investment, the value of which cannot be measured in terms of money. That is the trouble with the Opposition. Everything they tackle is always measured in terms of money. They represent certain financial powers which would like to create a situation in the Bantu homeland areas which the entrepreneur may exploit in a vulture-like fashion. That is what is so extremely bad. If this Government were to allow that, namely free white capital and not on an agency; basis as at present, we would create the biggest problems there within a few years that had ever been created in the entire Republic as well as in the homelands, because there are certain people who have no principles apart from materialism. I am convinced that this Government and this Minister will always guard that that, something for which the Opposition like to plead, does not happen. The development of border industries and the development of the Bantu homelands are developments which are interrelated and which cannot be divorced. The development of border industries and of the Bantu homelands should continue on this basis where border industries must have priority and where the development of the Bantu homelands must take place on a scientific basis. If one were to deal with human material arbitrarily and were to inject money without taking cognizance of the evolutionary reaction of the Bantu one would be doing the Bantu a disfavour. Our policy is to make a success of the development, to make a resounding success of border industries and the attendant development of the homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Primrose said that the Government through its agencies has given employment to 58,000 Africans in six years. I think that was what he said. Because of that figure, he claims that the Government&#x2019;s policy is a success. If the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s policy of getting 5 per cent of the Africans out of the urban areas is to be carried out, they certainly would have to do much better than that. This is nothing to boast about. The Tomlinson Commission, which reported over ten years ago, found that it would be necessary to take 50 per cent of the population off the land in the reserves. What then does this figure of 58,000 mean&#x003F; How is that helping to solve the problem&#x003F; The Tomlinson Commission also found, quite rightly, that the Bantu in the reserves at the moment are part-time farmers and part-time industrial workers. They said that under that system they can never achieve anything. They have got to become efficient in one or the other. If you are to rehabilitate the reserves agriculturally, the farmer in the reserves has to become an agriculturalist. He cannot do that unless he can farm on an economic basis and unless he can farm all the time. What is one of the problems of the department of the Minister in making these reserves agriculturally viable&#x003F; One of the difficulties is that there are too many people on the land. The Tomlinson Commission dealt at length with that point. Unless the Minister or the Government can find alternative work for those people who are living on the land, they will have to remain on the land and the land will never become viable. Yesterday the Minister announced a five-year plan. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (Point) when he condemned the Minister for the manner in which he did so. What right has the Minister to say to members of Parliament: If you want to know what our five-year plan is, you can get it from the Press&#x003F; I am giving it to the Press. What do we get in the Press&#x003F; We have a short statement as to what is envisaged. The figures in the <i>Cape Times</i> are the same as the figures in <i>Die Burger.</i> I checked them. But how can we compare these figures with the estimates of revenue and the Loan Fund&#x003F; It is impossible to say for instance how much has been budgeted for in regard to the economic, secondary and tertiary development of the reserves. Education we can check up, but the physical development we cannot. How can we compare at all&#x003F; I want to say that if we are to judge this plan by the last plan, it is going to achieve nothing. Time is pressing. The Tomlinson Commission stressed that time was most important and that the matter was one of urgency. We could not dilly-dally and proceed as this Government is doing. We had to embark on an energetic plan. We have lost 12 years since the Tomlinson Commission reported. How much additional work has been provided&#x003F; The Deputy Minister told us yesterday about the Ciskei. He said that he is now almost providing&#x2014;he has not done so yet&#x2014; work for the natural increase in the Ciskei. But that is the Ciskei as it was before Mdantsane was established. Now that Mdantsane has been formed it is going to grow into a big town and there is going to be a bigger natural increase in the population. The Africans are now being sent out from the Western Province and other places to Mdantsane. More and more work will have to be found. If all they have been able to do in border industries in the Eastern Province is to find work almost to satisfy the natural increase of the Ciskei, when are they going to find work to satisfy not only the natural increase, but also all the people living in the Ciskei&#x003F; The whole effort has been made around East London. Nothing has been done, I repeat, for the main reserve in South Africa, where the biggest concentration of the population is. Nothing has been done at all for the Transkei. Until you can show us how you are combating the problem of the Transkei, we say that you are not facing up to the problem.</p>

Why can we not be given some copies&#x003F; Is it that they are afraid that we will see something&#x003F; It is impossible for us to debate this five-year plan on the short notice we have been given. The Minister only told us about it last night. Why did he not tell us about it before&#x003F; Why did he not tell us about it when he embarked on it in 1966&#x003F; Why does he only tell us about it now&#x003F;</p>

<p>I should like to come to the hon. member for East London (North) who so badly wanted to know where the borders of the Ciskei would be and then piously came forward with his party&#x2019;s attitude in regard to the 1936 Act in which regard he wanted to confirm that there was not one jot or tittle of the 1936 Act which his party did not want to implement. But if he confines himself to that Act, why does he ask me where the borders are&#x003F; After all, the borders are defined in that Act, in the Schedule. However, his people are not satisfied with the borders as defined in the 1936 Act. He mentioned congress resolutions here, but I may tell him that as long ago as 1933 the congress of his Agricultural Union objected to the bonders as defined in the old 1913 Act and asked for consolidation to take place in the Ciskei. But if he now stands by the 1936 Act, I want to ask him whether he should not in that case proceed to purchase every released area in the Ciskei&#x003F; I challenge him to give me the reply across the floor of this House. Do I have to proceed to purchase that fine developed area to the north of Alice, released area No. 20, which is defined in the Act&#x003F; The hon. member must speak now. He does want to know where the borders are and that, after all, is really one of the borders of the Bantu homeland. Why is he so quiet now&#x003F; But he can also reply to me later. He also made an allegation in regard to options on land which we wanted to purchase in the white corridor. Yes, I did use the words &#x201C;White corridor&#x201D; at meetings, but I ask him what options have been taken&#x003F; Our Department does not take options on land. We make offers and it is for the people to accept them or not. However, he has to tell me what offers have been made to owners in the white corridor to which he referred. But I want to tell him that there are black spots in that white corridor, and that is the area which extends from the west of the Kei River to where it will eventually be decided will be the best place for those scattered scheduled areas to be linked up with the Ciskei. Some of those black spots have already been cleared or are already in the process of being cleared to the extent to which we already have compensatory land. However, the hon. member also knows that we have in fact purchased compensatory land for those areas in respect of which requests were made for their clearance but that even more land will have to be purchased and now I am referring to Kwelera and Mooiplaas and Umgwali and others. He knows every one of them. Requests have been received and from time to time requests are still being received for those places to be cleared. If those hon. members want to be helpful so that we may obtain the necessary compensatory land in terms of the 1936 Act, then those areas can be cleared. But that is not the method which he wants to follow, because then he loses every little bit of political advantage which he can get in the Eastern Cape by using this argument and by sowing suspicion against the Government by telling the people that their land is in danger and that the Government is engaged in turning white land into black land. But the hon. member praises the Act and piously pretends that he will adhere to that Act, but why does he not tell the people that that Act which he praises involves, as far as the Cape Province alone is concerned, 678,198 morgen of quota land which still has to be purchased&#x003F; Why does he not tell the people that they should now assist the Bantu Trust to acquire that land nearly 700,000 morgen in extent as well as the necessary compensatory land for the scattered black spots which are a problem to us and which will assist us in creating a White corridor in this important and most developed area of the Eastern Cape&#x003F; No, it does not suit him to do so, because it holds no political advantage for him. Therefore we have this casting of suspicion and that is why he asks us to say where the borders are going to be. He should now stop listening to gossip and to those people who say where the borders are going to be, the know-alls and the people who say that options are being taken on land. Not a single option has been taken on land there. [Time expired.]</p>

We need to see the plan as a whole so that we can judge whether it will be likely to achieve any of the objectives the Government wishes to achieve by it.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that there is a big difference in the approach to development between this side of the House and the other side. We wish to develop the Reserves fully so as to give homes and jobs to the Native people in those areas so as to restrict to a minimum the numbers of those who must find employment outside. But the other side of the House has to embark upon this expenditure in the Transkei in order to try to put some life into this lifeless policy of apartheid. They are bound to make this expenditure in order to try to keep back the numbers of Natives who are flooding into the cities in the white part of South Africa and who are multiplying there. It is for this purpose, to try to get a little nearer to the ideal of separation, that this money is year after year being poured into the Reserves by the Government. It is therefore most necessary for one to be able to judge from a full exposition of this five-year plan whether it is likely to get anywhere near to achieving that aim. The hon. member for Transkei and others on this side of the House have shown, by a comparison with the expenditure under the previous five-year plan and the enormous expenditure on border industries, that what is going to be achieved by this further R500 million which is to be spent in the next five years is just a drop in the ocean. In terms of Government policy, it is going to give job opportunities to Natives on a very limited scale in the Transkei area. If we had a full analysis of the figures and a full exposition by the hon. the Minister as to what he hopes to achieve in the way of employment opportunities through this five-year plan, I am quite certain that every single member on the Government side would vote against this expenditure. They only vote for it because they have been led to believe, especially by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, Mr. Coetzee, that everything is going wonderfully, and that these people will be flowing back to the Bantu reserves and that he is prepared to stake his reputation on that. When this type of talk is indulged in, hon. members lean back happily in their chairs and vote this money; but they would not vote for it if they knew that this enormous expenditure is not going to stop the flow of Bantu to the white urban areas in the slightest&#x2014;not to any significant extent. It is not going to draw back to the Transkei the enormous number of Bantu who are at present in Johannesburg and in the other main cities of South Africa. Sir, we condemn the fact that this House and particularly hon. members opposite should be asked to vote money for something which is not going to achieve its purpose although the public may be deceived for a while longer into thinking that there is some validity in this policy. I do not believe that there are many hon. members opposite who really believe that they are going to achieve what this policy is supposed to achieve, but it makes them happy to believe it, and unfortunately we waste more and more time instead of facing up to the true situation and the true facts in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would therefore like to say, after listening to this debate and in the light of recent developments, that my hon. friends on the other side have lost their way in regard to Native policy. There was a time when the Nationalists knew where they were going under their Native policy, or to put it more accurately perhaps, there was a time when they were being dragged in a certain direction in accordance with a definite stated policy to a definite end and that was in the time of the late Dr. Verwoerd; but now they are no longer being dragged in that way. The aim is no longer clearly one of sovereign independence. They no longer know where they are really going under their Native policy and they do not even know which is right. I want to say to hon. members opposite that on two great fundamental matters they do not even know what their own mind is. This party, on the other hand, does. Hon. members opposite do not know which is the right policy, whether to have the Native reserves becoming independent states or to have them as part of South Africa. We had a statement from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in the Other Place the other day that they could obtain independence or that they could remain part of the Republic. Sir, what must we make of a Government that does not know what is best for South Africa in this regard&#x003F; Hon. members opposite do not know where they are heading. All their measures are heading in one direction, but when they get there they will probably be told that that is not what the Natives want. The result is that they are building on a completely false basis. This party, on the other hand, knows where it is going. We say that we want white leadership and that there will be federal elements in the whole set-up. Sir, we are told that the great advantage of the policy of the Government is that it allows self-determination for the Native peoples while the policy of the United Party does not. Sir, I say that that is not correct. The policy of hen. members on the other side shows that they do not know their own mind and it therefore offers these two completely different alternatives, that is to say, either independence for the Bantu states or to be part of South Africa; <span class="col_6367-6368" refersTo="page_0445"/>but they do not allow self-determination in the sense of a completely free choice any more than we do, because if the Natives come along and decide in terms of this right to self-determination that they want &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in the Republic, then hon. members opposite will immediately say: &#x201C;Oh, no we will not allow that&#x201D;. Well, if they cannot do that, then they have not got self-determination. They are limited to certain choices under the policy of hon. members opposite. But they do not even know which is the best choice for South Africa. As I have said, according to hon. members opposite, these Bantu states can either be sovereign independent states or they can be part of South Africa. Sir, what kind of Government have we got when they do not even know their own minds to that extent&#x003F;</p>

<p>In connection with the speech made by the previous speaker on the opposite side, the hon. member for Pinelands, I just want to say that he had a good effect on me this afternoon. I am sorry that he did not speak sooner so that he could have had this effect on me sooner. As hon. members know I have been concentrating heavily during this entire week, for five days, first in the Other Place and now in this House. I have sat listening to hon. members for five afternoons; I shall not mention all the things I have had to listen to. But the hon. member for Pinelands had this effect on me: He supplied me with a few moments of light recreation. I want to thank him for that and I am very sorry that he did no speak in the middle of the day because I actually needed the light recreation more then than I do now, because I am near the end now. The hon. member stood there and spoke in a very serious vein, trying to scoff at us. But he merely succeeded in supplying me with enjoyable light relief, and I am grateful for that.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to reply to the hon. member for Transkei, and I come at once to the five-year plan. The hon. member for Transkei condemned me a moment ago for announcing the five-year plan yesterday in this way and referring him, as he claimed, to the Press. Mr. Chairman, let us consider this matter closely. I stated very emphatically yesterday when the question whether there was a second five-year plan was put to me&#x2014;because the first five-year plan is a thing of the past&#x2014; that in the same way as there had been a first five-year plan so there was a second five-year plan, and just as in the case of the first five-year plan it was a normal departmental working document, and the fact that the book had been printed made no difference. Ours is a very large Department with hundreds and hundreds of officials who have to handle the book and we can have it printed if we want to do so: why not&#x003F; The book which has been printed does not have t" be distributed publically. It is a normal departmental working document, and surely it is not the case that normal departmental working documents have to be distributed at random amongst the public or amongst members of Parliament, or that they should be laid upon the Table. I dealt with this point here yesterday but the hon. member apparently did not hear me. I said that it was a departmental working document and that it would not be laid upon the Table, in the same way as the previous one had not been laid upon the Table. I want to tell the hon. member that we have many departmental working documents and I can show him other departmental working documents as well, some of them in printed form and others which have not been printed. Does the hon. member want to suggest now that I should show every member of Parliament every departmental working document which contains interesting and important particulars&#x003F; I did not show this departmental working document to our members either. Why should I&#x003F; If I do that then I shall in due course have to throw all the files open to be scrutinized by all.</p>

While I was still talking they nearly bowled my Private Secretary over in their rush to get hold of books. That is why I knew that before the Opposition or anybody else could get the information from me the Press would already have it.

<p>I want to leave the hon. member in suspense a little. I shall reply to that question in my office. I do want to save a little tension for him, a little excitement. Let us remember very well what was done on the previous occasion. On the previous occasion there was also a five-year plan, and, just as now, my predecessor let the Press have a look at the five-year plan a considerable time after the five-year plan had been in existence, and I take it that he let the hon. member or other hon. members also have a look at it. I am also prepared to do that. I want to inform the hon. member that if I do that it is a voluntary offer on my part because I am under no obligation whatsoever to do so. It is a confidential departmental working document and we cannot in this way distribute departmental working documents to anybody and not even specifically to members of Parliament. I do not do this with hon. members on this side, nor can I do it with hon. members on the opposite side. It is a special concession therefore and does not create any precedents.</p>

<p>I want to remind hon. members of what I said yesterday in regard to that plan. I mentioned the amount and I said it must be borne in mind that that amount which stands in that book is not a law of the Medes and the Persians. In the very first year of that five-year plan we encountered difficulties as a result of credit restrictions and other causes which had not been foreseen when the plan had been drawn up in this respect that we were not able to obtain as much money as we would have liked. This will probably occur again before the end of next year as well: We do not know how long these restrictions are going to last. In fact. I want to say here that, and now hon. members on that side must try and play football with this if they want to&#x2014;actually they must play soccer, because that is more kicking than catching &#x2026;</p>

As far as politics are concerned, I will still be here, but equally as far as politics are concerned I do not know whether the hon. member for Transkei will still be here. I sincerely hope that he will still be in the land of the living. In any case, I cannot guarantee the way in which those amounts are spent. The intention of that five-year plan is to give us a properly planned framework of development for all these facets which are necessary, and of course the framework must be interpreted in figures. But those figures are not a law of the Medes and the Persians&#x2014;that must be understood very well. I do not want to be reproached with this later. If we should exceed this mark, if we achieve more than is envisaged in that plan, then I am saying now in advance that I do not want the Opposition to come along and praise me for it.</p>

<p>No. In regard to the first five-year plan I just want to remind the hon. member for Transkei of what I said last year. He has stated here that we have again drawn up a five-year plan and that we are again not going to achieve anything with it. The hon. the Deputy Minister has just replied to that. The hon. member had such a lot to say about the Tomlinson report. The Tomlinson report is a piece of work which we have put to very good use. It is not a report which is accepted by the Opposition. We began debating the Tomlinson report in this House in 1956. Hon. members can look up what the Opposition had to say about that report. The Opposition did not want the Tomlinson report. But now they are very piously pretending here to-day that that report is the salvation of everything and that if we do not carry out the report then we are going to fail. We have issued a White Paper in regard to the matter and stated precisely what aspects of that report we accept without question and what aspects we have to consider first. Because what is a report of a commission&#x003F; It is not a law of Parliament. It is a proposal made by a group of people. One assimilates many of their ideas. In many respects they stimulate one to think in a quite different way and to strive to attain the same goal perhaps in a quite different way. I want <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_0447"/>to repeat what I said here last year to this hon. member. In our first five-year plan we spent R6 million more per year than the Report had recommended per annum for a period of ten years.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The first one was this five-year plan. Now there is a second five-year plan shock for the hon. member.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Etosha asked me certain questions here in connection with my recent visit to Ovamboland. The hon. member referred to what was said in the speech, which is known, and he pointed out that, judging from what they said there and what was reported in the Press, the Ovambos had displayed a great deal of interest. That is correct. The Ovambos displayed a great deal of interest in what we are offering them there. In connection with that I also want to make something known which was not made known previously. I am doing this to indicate that the Ovambos are really interested in the offer which was made to them there that they could be given greater tasks to perform in their development towards self-determination. After the conclusion of the proceedings the Ovambos drafted a letter which they forwarded to the hon. the Prime Minister. As you know, it was the hon. the Prime Minister who had instructed me to go and address this meeting of Ovambo chiefs, headmen and councillors. The letter was sent to the Prime Minister and he asked me to publicize it here. It has not been publicized before. It contains nothing new for it is merely a repetition of what they said there. But it is just a short letter, and I feel that I can quote it here. The letter is dated 21st March, 1967, at Oshakati. It is addressed to &#x201C;The hon. the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Buildings, Cape Town&#x201D;, and reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Honourable Sir,&#x2014;Our sincere thanks for the message conveyed to us by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to-day. It was a great message which brought joy to our hearts. We are glad because it appears that the development is also being expanded to our governing bodies. Our joy is all the greater now that we know that we are going to have our own Central Government in Ovamboland. It is an ideal we have been striving to attain for a long time. We are all the more pleased because we know that the Government of the Republic of South Africa is not going to abandon us, but will support us during this process of development. It will draw our Ovambo tribes together. It is a great step forward, one which we grasp at eagerly with both hands. You, Mr. Prime Minister, must please help in our development in this process of self-government and see to it that we are not left in the dark. We do not want foreign nations to govern us, just as it is not our desire to govern others. We ask that you and your Government will remain our faithful allies.</block>

<block name="quote">In conclusion we want hereby to take the liberty of addressing to you an invitation to visit us whenever it may be possible for you to do so. Our best wishes to you and your Government.</block>

<p>This was signed by the seven leaders of the seven tribal areas, namely Uushona Shiimi of Ogandjera, Shokongo Taapopi of Ukualuthi &#x2026; etc. I shall not read the other names because it is not necessary. Sir, the hon. member has also asked me what is going to happen now. I stated at that meeting that what I had said to the Ovambos there applied to the other Bantu nations as well. It is now up to them to ask. We are not compelling them. It is with great pleasure that I am able to tell you that I recently received a message from the Okavango area to the effect that one of the number of tribes there has already raised the matter themselves from their side and said that they also want something similar to what is now being offered to the Ovambo people. It will therefore be possible to hold further discussions now with the Okavango Bantu on that basis. As I have said, they number five tribal groups, and certain of them have in fact raised the matter. Now, while I am discussing South-West Africa affairs, I also want to deal with the question of the hon. member for Karas. This is also where the hon. member is going to receive his second little shock. The hon. member for Karas asked me, arising from what I had said at Oshakati when I referred to the development work which was being offered to the Ovambo there: What about the Bantu areas in general in South-West Africa&#x003F; I just want to tell hon. members that we have also drawn up a five-year plan for the Bantu areas of South-West Africa. Its cover has also been printed by the Government Printer, but it is also a departmental working document.</p>

<p>Yes, it appears to me that it is a shock to that hon. member. This plan covers all kinds of physical and economic developments. It is a plan involving a sum of approximately R60 million. Everything which I said a moment ago applies <i>mutatis mutandis</i> here too. That is an estimate for that amount. It cannot be guaranteed that it will be available each year, because it depends upon the availability of funds, upon departmental appropriation, budget circumstances, etc. In addition we must remember that circumstances are very difficult in the South-West Africa areas. They are very distant and isolated. Certain of those people are a little reluctant to co-operate with us, and in the implementation of this five-year plan set-backs and delays could be experienced. These are all things for which we must prepare ourselves as part and parcel of the undertaking. Of course, I am making an appeal to those nations to cooperate with us and our officials in these matters. However there are sometimes many distorted views in regard to these matters. I can only hope that, as in the case of certain of the Bantu nations in South-West Africa, that the light will also penetrate to others who have not as yet seen the light and that they will come to realize that this developmental work is in their own interests and that it is essential for the development of their areas, and that they should co-operate with us in that regard. I am now furnishing these details to the Press. They can also obtain them and publish them if they want to. [Interjection.] Since my Deputy Minister has already said so now, the hon. member can have a look at that book as well.</p>

<p>I have nothing more to say about the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member for Klip River said something to which I must refer briefly. He appealed for facilities for sporting anglers in the Bantu areas and also in the Transkei. He spoke in particular about a strip along the northern part of the Natal Coast. I just want to say that it is our policy &#x2014;and I would rather apply it more strictly than more leniently&#x2014;that the establishment, in regard to angling, of white interests and white rights, which has in certain places even taken the form of pieces of land obtained by people, should be guarded against. They are even insisting that the size of those pieces of land be increased. They are erecting buildings there and they want all kinds of facilities in the Bantu areas, which is not right. The Bantu have a limited percentage of the coastal area of South Africa. It is not right for us to deprive them of the facilities in which they will also in due course be interested, and are to a certain extent already interested. That is why I cannot be content with even certain rights of control being granted to outside bodies so that they can exercise control over such angling sites in those areas. In general therefore, we feel ourselves more inclined to restrict the angling possibilities for the non-Bantu within the Bantu homelands than to expand them.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>That is also the case in the Transkei.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course. I lost sight of that aspect. As far as the Transkei is concerned, the Transkei Government of course has the say in regard to those coastal resorts and not us.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Bethal and Standerton both touched upon the question of farm labour and labour tenants. They discussed farm labour in particular. I think that it is desirable to make some general comment on this matter. One can of course discuss it at great length, but that is not necessary. I want to emphasize that our feelings as a Department in regard to this matter are similar to those of organized agriculture, i.e. we feel that the labour tenant system should gradually disappear because it is an anomaly, because it is not a type of work which we want to maintain for ever, or even extend. For that reason we made provision in the Act a few years ago for labour control boards. Where labour tenants were still legally registered on farms the labour control boards could do the work of the labour tenant boards plus the other work in respect of full-time labourers throughout the year. Hon. members who are practical farmers, will know that labour tenant control boards could previously only control the labour tenants. We are therefore doing away with labour tenant control boards where it is possible for us to make the necessary arrangements. If there are still labour tenants on the farms they can be dealt with through the labour control boards which are being established, and which is also doing the other work in addition, i.e. the work in respect of fulltime labour. But the position is that we should very much like to see, as I gathered from the pleas of those hon. members, that we progress to the stage where our agriculturalists have a stable workers&#x2019; group of full-time Bantu workers on their farms. Whenever it is necessary this group can be supplemented by seasonal workers or temporary workers who work for short periods of time. In principle this is nothing new. I am pleading, and recently at Lichtenburg the hon. the Deputy Minister also pleaded, for an extension of this system on an organized basis. Hon. members know that in the Western Cape temporary workers are recruited for the packing of fruit and other work. We are all acquainted with the old system of Bantu shearing teams which travel from one farm to another to shear sheep, etc. What the hon. the Deputy Minister has previously advocated the farmers should do is the correct solution, i.e. that in so far as there has to be supplementary labour, labour to supplement the full-time Bantu, the agricultural organizations should also consider doing this in an organized way in the same way as those shearing teams go to work in an organized way. With a view to that it was suggested&#x2014;it was explained here this afternoon&#x2014;how we could expand the bureaux system <span class="col_6375-6376" refersTo="page_0449"/>further so that the network can be extended. Just as the industrialists, householders and shop-owners can obtain Bantu labour, so there should be a wider network of organizations through which Bantu labour can be obtained. The bureaux must also be established within the Bantu homelands where the Bantu workseekers must have themselves registered, so that their names may be entered in records and so that, if there is a demand from an urban area for industrial or commercial workers, or from farmers for teams of shearers or for other temporary purposes, there may be proper registrations on record, on which basis it will be possible to distribute the Bantu workers. That is the position as a whole. That is the tendency in our policy in regard to Bantu labour on farms. I can only say that the entire Free State has already agreed to the proclamation of districts&#x2014;they have already been proclaimed&#x2014;as districts where labour control boards may replace the labour tenants system. There are also a number of districts in the Transvaal, for example Delmas, Pretoria District and a few others which have already been proclaimed. It is expanding. We are doing this in consultation with organized agriculture. We are asking them to take the initiative and apply to us for registration because the boards usually consist of two local farmers from the district under the chairmanship, as a third member, of the Bantu Affairs Commissioner. That is the picture and I hope that that development will be encouraged. I think hon. members in general agree that that is the most sensible way along which development may take place.</p>

<p>I now come to the Sancho Panza of Natal, the hon. member for Durban (Point). The hon. the Deputy Minister has dealt effectively with him for having intimated here that we are tackling something in the nature of forced labour.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not think that I am so stupid that I could not understand what he was insinuating. I understood very well what he said, but I understood equally well what he was insinuating. When he speaks that hon. member always says less than he is insinuating. He always does two things simultaneously. He speaks and he insinuates. I understand both. The hon. member must know that I am acquainted with these matters which he discussed. I do not think I could be reproached for being presumptuous if I told him that I am better acquainted with them than he is. It is my duty as well. When he discussed these matters then I know what he is insinuating by what he is saying, unless of course it was done in ignorance. Then he must state openly that it was done in ignorance because I shall then forgive him and I shall not even deride him for his ignorance. Anybody can be ignorant in regard to a matter, even the hon. member. But the hon. member linked the two matters together. I have noted it down here that he is against compulsory registration with which he associates the possibility of compulsory labour. He linked the two concepts together in one breath, two things which cannot be associated with one another anywhere in our legislation or administration. Only convicted people can be compelled to do certain work, not free Bantu. The hon. member knows that. If he did not know that before, he knows it now and then he must not in future eat so blatantly, shamelessly and greedily out of the hand of the hon. member for Houghton when it comes to a matter like this. Because that is the way the hon. member for Houghton speaks. That is her story. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It seems to me the hon. member for Houghton does not know it, but the hon. member for Durban (Point) is eating out of her hand and doing so very greedily. I do not know what hon. members are laughing about. What I am using is a perfectly normal metaphor. They should not tempt me to use other metaphors.</p>

<p>The compulsory registration of workseekers in Bantu homelands is an old institution. Work-seekers in the Bantu homelands have always had to register themselves with the district officials, i.e. our Bantu Affairs Commissioners. Now we are extending the system in order to render better services to those who want to work and ought to work. The United Party is moaning and groaning about the lack of work for the Bantu. We want to establish more Bantu labour bureaux, in the tribal areas as well. Some of the tribes have already made use of that system, <i>inter alia,</i> in the Ciskei. Before this system had even been established properly, the tribes seized upon it eagerly and began to apply it. Now I am asking the hon. member: Where does he get the moral right to present that system as compulsory labour, as a lot of Opposition newspapers have unfortunately done during the past few weeks. They did not do so out of ignorance, because they had complete speeches before them on which they could base their reports, but did so with harmful intent. The hon. member has merely gone and repeated the story now, either that or he is eating out of the hand of the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

By so doing he is not furthering the good relations which he maintains we must have between Whites and Bantus in South Africa. <span class="col_6377-6378" refersTo="page_0450"/>The hon. member also referred to the speeches of Matanzima according to the newspapers, speeches which he recently made before his congress, when he used the so-called &#x201C;knob-kerrie&#x201D; metaphor.

<block name="quote">Labour Influx Control Measures: I have been taken to task by Opposition members (these are his own opposition members) for statements I have made in connection with influx control. It is correct that influx control is a separate development measure, for the influx control regulations are designed to regulate an orderly flow of labour to the industrial centres and, <i>inter alia,</i> to ensure that people seeking work in the cities are assured that there will be work and suitable housing for them. I also appreciate the fact that the policy is to give preference to Coloured labour in the Western Cape and that the numbers of Bantu labourers in the Cape should be gradually reduced. Such reductions should, however, go hand in hand and be related to the development of the Bantu homelands to ensure that our citizens who are removed from the Cape will be able to make a living in the Transkei.</block>

<p>Just look at the mentality of an opposition. It only cries &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D; in regard to certain things.</p>

<block name="quote">In the meantime our own labour bureaux are co-operating fully with the labour bureau system of the Republic and the benefit derived through this system can be seen from the fact that during 1966 our labour bureaux found employment for 160,000 workers in the Republic. When I make representations from time to time to the Republic for certain relaxations in influx control measures, I do so as a responsible leader of my people seeking to promote the welfare of our citizens who are dependent at this stage of our development on employment outside our own territory. It should not be interpreted as if I thereby reject the idea or necessity of a properly controlled labour influx system.</block>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further about this matter. In addition I also want to refer to a few words which the hon. member spoke which were not correct either. As I said just now, the hon. member says with only half a word a great deal more by insinuation. He also spoke about Matanzima and said in the same breath, &#x201C;In the same way as they have given way to Ndams&#x201D;. Must we now drag in the whole Ndams case here&#x003F; Sitting here is the hon. the Prime Minister, who was Minister of Police and of Justice at that time and who handled the whole case, and he will interrupt me if I say something wrong. It was not a case of, as the hon. member said, our giving way to him. Certain restrictions were imposed on Ndams by the Minister of Justice and certain representations were made and after consultation with me the Minister of Justice refused the representations, and subsequently, at the end of last year, the new Minister of Justice found that it was then in order to lift the restrictions on that Bantu person, and that is why they were lifted.</p>

<p>I can let what the hon. member had to say about the five-year plan suffice, because I dealt with it a moment ago.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) had quite a lot to say, but the hon. the Deputy Minister dealt with it except for one aspect, <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_0451"/>i.e. the, as he called it, land request of Matanzima. This is another of the notorious newspaper reports of last year in which it was stated that Matanzima had allegedly said that he wanted all the land between the Umzimkulu and the Great Fish River. Matanzima denied it within two days in a statement which he issued. I dealt with the case fully the other day in the Other Place and I do not want to deal with it equally fully now. Matanzima pointed out that there had been a stupid confusion between two things, namely the linking up of geographic areas as opposed to the linking up of systems and governments. He talked about the linking up of the Ciskeian government system with that of the Transkei, and it was presented as if to imply that he was speaking about a linking up of geographic areas, of the land, and then he stated very emphatically, something which he said again in this speech from which I have just quoted, that he made no claims on white land in that large area between the two rivers. He said that if he spoke of unity there he was speaking about a unity of Bantu territories. He said so again very emphatically in his speech here and to save time I will not read the whole thing out because I want to try and finish up. He said: &#x201C;I only referred to the existing Bantu areas and such other land as may be bought&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands has a lot of time. When the Transkei Hansard is published he can go and make comparisons and see whether I have deviated. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have also during the past year, to the consternation of many people, been quoted and largely misquoted as laying claim on behalf of the Transkei to all the land between the Fish River in the south and the Umzimkulu River in the north. I would like to make it perfectly clear once and for all that when I speak of the land between the Fish and the Umzimkulu Rivers, I refer only to the existing Bantu area and such other land in this area as might be purchased for Bantu occupation or which might in the process of consolidation become Bantu area. It will be remembered that in terms of the Natives Trust and Land Act of 1936, a further 678,000 morgen of land should still be purchased for Bantu in the Cape Province. It would obviously, however, be most presumptions and unrealistic of me to think that purely white districts and huge white urban complexes such as East London, Queenstown or Port Shep stone, for that matter, could be incorporated into the Transkei.</block>

<p>That is the entire passage as I have it here, I have nothing more to read in regard to this matter. He also speaks about the amalgamation of the Transkei and the Ciskei, but that is actually concerned with the system of government, whether the territorial government of the Ciskei should be joined to the parliamentary system of the Transkei, yes or no, but that is not the point at issue here.</p>

<p>There the hon. member now has another new thing with which he can go and play football.</p>

<p>I think that it is fitting that this should have been the first time that the hon. member for Karoo spoke again in this House. The last time he spoke it was also my work which was being discussed. I am very glad that the hon. member is now in such a condition that he can once again participate in the debates. The hon. member asked me about the hospital position in the region of Kimberley. Now I must remind the hon. member that I am only concerned in so far as it concerns hospitals in the homelands. As far as the rest are concerned, namely a hospital in the Bantu area of Kimberley, it is a provincial matter. There was talk of a large hospital, a regional hospital, for the Bantu at Kimberley, but the latest planning is to abandon that plan. A hospital will be built at Papierstad by our Department within the Bantu area. It will be a large regional hospital for a large region in the Transvaal and also for a large region in the Northern Cape and also at Kimberley and there will in fact be less important hospital facilities for outpatients, etc., at Kimberley and other Bantu who do not fall into that category of treatment will then be removed to the larger hospital for treatment there. This development of regional hospitals at scattered centres, where practically all kinds of work can be done, specialized hospitals, and, lower down the scale, smaller hospitals and clinics, is a development which is taking place on a worldwide basis as well as here in South Africa. It is within that framework that planning is now being considered at Kimberley, but it has not yet been finalized. The hon. member also wanted to know two other things from me. The one was what was going to happen in regard to the urban Bantu councils. If the Bantu all receive passports, a possibility which I had envisaged, what is going to become of the urban Bantu Councils&#x003F; Here I want to remind the hon. member of the fact that the Xhosas of the Transkei already have Transkeian citizenship of their own and despite that fact they still serve in the urban Bantu <span class="col_6381-6382" refersTo="page_0452"/>Councils of Welkom and will serve in the Councils of other places. When the Transkeian Xhosa obtained their citizenship we stated clearly in their constitution that they would not be dealt with as foreigners here, and similar provision can also be made for others.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me about the classification of a Griqua. Now, I am in a slight spot of bother here. A Griqua is not classified as a Bantu person. This is done under the Population Registration Act and I cannot answer for that. It is they who must decide whether a person is a Griqua, and if they decide that he is a Griqua then I have nothing to say about that. But if they decide that a person is a Bantu, man or woman, then he falls under the Passes Act which is under our jurisdiction and then we have our criteria which we have to apply.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member should rather come and argue this matter out with me at a later stage.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to something which the hon. member for Pinelands said, and which I did not reply to a moment ago. Sir, to-day we have had a revival of an old political term. To-day we have again heard from United Party side the term &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;, after many years. The term was defunct and now it has been resurrected.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that it was not defunct. It seems to me it was in cold storage: it was frozen and now it has been resurrected. Sir, I want to conclude by putting this question to that hon. member. I am going to continue asking this question. My hon. friend, the hon. the Minister of Planning and Mines, continually asked this question in the past: Are the Bantu going to sit in this Parliament as representatives&#x003F; Just as he posed that question time and again, I am going to continue posing this question: Mention to me one responsible Bantu leader or Bantu body which has already stated that&#x2014; not Bantu leaders whom the United Party hopes will say this, but on which has already stated this&#x2014;that the Bantu are prepared to remain forever under a policy of &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D; in a common political system and remain subservient to the Whites governing over them&#x003F; I am asking hon. members to furnish me with one name.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is customary in discussing this Vote to consider the two aspects of Bantu education. The first is finance and the other is the professional aspect. The professional aspect is concerned with the work in the school, the progress made by children, the admission of children and, the most important feature of all, the supply of teachers for our schools. We have had ample opportunity to discuss that aspect of education this Session. We had a private member&#x2019;s motion introduced by the hon. member for Randfontein and then another private member&#x2019;s motion, again on Bantu education, introduced by the hon. member for Houghton. We have really had five hours of discussion during this Session on that aspect of Bantu education.</p>

<p>In deference to the wishes of the hon. the Deputy Minister I should like to say a word about the accounts of Bantu education. I have on various occasions said to the hon. the Minister that we opposed the establishment of a Bantu education account. We considered, of course, that Bantu education, like any other Department of Government, should come under the general Revenue Account. But the change has now been accepted; we have a Bantu Education Account. We also expressed our disappointment that the Government had decided to make a contribution to this fund of R13 million per annum and the fact that that amount would be pegged. Throughout the years that amount has remained constant. Sir, it cannot remain constant in these days because the value of money has depreciated. The amount remains constant in these days because the value of money has depreciated. The amount remains R13 million but what can be done with R13 million to-day is quite a different story. We know from the statistics that we get from month to month that the depreciation in our currency is approximately 2&#x00BD; per cent per annum, so that in the 12 years of Bantu education, the depreciation has been 12 times that amount, i.e. 30 per cent. Sir, I wish to be conservative. I will not take a figure of <span class="col_6383-6384" refersTo="page_0453"/>30 per cent; I do not wish to have any discussion about the percentage, so I will make it 25 per cent. Every member will agree that during the 12 years the depreciation has really exceeded 25 per cent. What then should the Government&#x2019;s contribution be to the Bantu Education Account&#x003F; It should be not R13 million. but R13 million plus 25 per cent. Hon. members can see immediately that that would be an additional R3&#x00BD; million, so that instead of R13 million, the amount that should be contributed this year by the Government should be R16.25 million I think that is fair. But that is only half the story. What we have to bear in mind is this: Of what amount has this account been deprived over these 12 years&#x003F; Two and a half per cent the first year, of course, then 5 per cent the second year, and so on. It is a simple arithmetical progression to say that the average amount over the 12 years&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;the average amount&#x201D;&#x2014; is a half of the R3.25 million, i.e. R1,625 million per annum over a period of 12 years. If we take the total amount, it means that this account over the years, while we have been building up Bantu education, has been deprived of 12 times R1,625 million, which hon. members will see immediately is R19&#x00BD; million. Sir. this account is not receiving a fair deal at the hands of the Government. That is the point I wish to make. But it goes further. I wish to discuss the finances. Looking at the Auditor General&#x2019;s report, I see that in the most recent report, that is, for the year ending March, 1966, we are told that over R1 million on Revenue Account was surrendered; it was not used. One million rands of the amount voted was not used. The Auditor-General explains why the Department did not use this R1 million, but the fact remains that Bantu Education lost R1 million. What happened to that money&#x003F; That R1 million actually had to be surrendered and went back into the General Revenue Account&#x2014;not into the Bantu Education Account, but into the General Revenue Account. It did not go into the Bantu Education Revenue Account, not into the Bantu Education Account, but into the General Revenue Account. At the same time the Auditor-General tells us that the Bantu Education Account is in the red to the General Loan Account. The Loan side is in the red to an extent of nearly R8&#x00BD; million&#x2014;R8,429,000 to be correct. We are told that they owe the Loan Account R8,429,000 and that at the same time they had to surrender R1 million of their Revenue Account. During the Budget Debate we heard the hon. the Minister of Finance tell us that he was considering cash budgeting. If there is one Budget that should be a Cash Budget in South Africa it is the Bantu Education Account. Why should the Account have to surrender R1 million on their ordinary expenditure, on their current expenditure account, when they are R8&#x00BD; million in the red on their own account&#x003F; We should say that that R1 million will go to reduce their debt to the Loan Account. I put that up to the hon. the Minister. That is the first point I wish to make on finance.</p>

<p>My next point is this. I have to try and get through as much as I can in a short time. As I say, I do not want to discuss the professional side too much, because in our discussions we said that on the professional side there is not much cnance of building up a very good system when only one pupil in about 1,500 is in standard X, and only one in about 9,000 matriculates. How can we build up a staff of teachers, how can we build up a very strong Department of Bantu Education if that is our problem&#x003F; There are almost 2,000,000 children in school and with 2 million children at school they have not sufficient teachers. The result is that teachers are not well-trained and the pupils are not well taught. I do not blame the professional staff; the members who have to administer this account have an exceedingly difficult time.</p>

<p>Now I wish to touch on one aspect of the professional side. We have been told, and we are told on official authority, that it is the policy of the Government to take all secondary education, almost all secondary education, to what they call the &#x201C;homelands&#x201D;. In other words, if Bantu children are living in a city they will have to go to a Native reserve to receive their secondary education. That is the policy. The obvious question is this: What are they going to do when they get there&#x003F; Where are they going to live&#x003F; Where are the children leaving Soweto and the other big towns going to live there&#x003F; How are they going to get there&#x003F; I am now quoting the authority of the department, from the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i> of November, 1966, where they discuss this. I will give one or two extracts. We find the following on page 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The towns people are to go to the homelands &#x2026; Our people in the cities are already complaining that they do not have a sufficient number of high schools. They will have a few high schools, but never enough, because, according to government policy, most of these schools should be situated in the homelands. They will never get a trade school in the white cities again.</block>

<p>That is the story. What are they going to do when they get to the homelands&#x003F; The Department makes provision here for a system of boarding houses. These are not Government boarding houses; it is not what we have in the Coloured Education Department. In the Coloured Education Department the churches establish the boarding houses, but not here. They advocate a system of child farming amongst the Africans. I quote from page 5 of the above-mentioned publication&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every boarder will of course pay for board and lodging; this will be the same as the normal fees paid by boarders at large central hostels&#x2014;no more and no less. Two-thirds of the board and lodging fees will be used by the owner to care for the pupils and his own family, and the other third will be his profit.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that the hon. member for Kensington does not do justice to what we are doing for Bantu education in this country. He concentrated on the fact that expenditure was pegged at R13 million, and he will not take it amiss of me if I say that he seeks to create the impression that that R13 million is all that is being spent on Bantu education in this country. However, the picture is a totally different one. He referred to the depreciation of money and pointed out that at present it was approximately 25 to 30 per cent less. What he did not add is, of course, the R1&#x00BD; million which is being spent on Bantu university colleges. What he did not take into account at all, are the taxes that are also being employed&#x2014;every cent of Bantu tax is being spent on Bantu education. We must look at the picture this presents to us.</p>

<p>Up to 1958 only 80 per cent of Bantu taxes were spent on Bantu education, and the highest figure occurred in the year 1957-&#x2019;58 when it amounted to just under R4 million. But what has the picture been since then, now that 100 per cent of their taxes are being spent on their education&#x003F; It increased from just over R4 million in 1958-&#x2019;59 to more than R6 million in 1963. In 1964 it was more than R7 million; in 1965 it was more than R7,600,000. The estimated amount for this year is R10. million.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter. That is part of our policy&#x2014;it is part of our policy that the Bantu themselves should pay for their education. They receive that basic aid from us. Owing to the improved method of collecting taxes there is not the slightest doubt that the amounts spent on Bantu education in South Africa have increased fantastically over the past 15 years.</p>

<p>Let us just take a look at the way we have progressed. I am at a loss to understand how an hon. member, a person who has dedicated his whole life to education, can fail to show appreciation for the progress we have made in connection with Bantu education. I just want to tell the hon. member what the basic principles of this Government are in respect of Bantu education. I am referring first to education for the Bantu by the Bantu. This aims at training the Bantu so that he may serve his own community. The Bantu must accept responsibility for financing their own education, over and above that tremenous fillip of R13 million we are giving them. To a very large extent the Bantu themselves determine the development of their own education. It is therefore a waste of money to go and spend more in an artificial way. As UNESCO pointed out, in doing so we shall only be doing a disservice to the under-developed nation. The moment more is forced upon them than they can absorb, the result is not only that money is wasted, but in addition that they are not being provided with such education as may serve their interests in the best way.</p>

<p>Let us see what progress we have made. Here in South Africa we prefer to establish the education of the Bantu on the broad basis of general literacy, because in doing so the Bantu can be better stimulated to develop in all spheres, and to apply the traditional system of financing, as I mentioned a moment ago. Let us look at the progress we have made over the past few years. In 1953 the number of Bantu schools was 5,665. By 1965, ten years later, it had increased to more than 8,800, excluding the Transkei. That number of 5,665 in 1953 included the Transkei. By 1965 it had increased to 8,800, excluding the Transkei. Here we have a remarkable figure, namely that the number of pupils in 1953, including the Transkei, was 858,000. Up to last year this had increased to just under two million, excluding the Transkei. Have we not made fantastic progress in connection with Bantu education in South Africa&#x003F; I am the first one to admit that we cannot keep pace as far as Bantu teachers are concerned. But that is not our fault. The Department goes out of its way to make provision for the training of Bantu teachers, male and female. We are doing everything in our power to train them, and it is not our fault that we do not have enough teachers. It is the same problem we experienced amongst the Whites. Look at the progress we have made.</p>

<p>In 1953, including the Transkei, there were just over 21,000 Bantu teachers, male and female. That figure increased to 34,000 last year, excluding the Transkei. That is tremendous progress we have made in that regard. In 1953, 45 per cent of the Bantu population between the ages of seven and fourteen attended schools, and in 1963 the school attendance in that age group was 83 per cent, almost twice as many within a period of ten years. Let us compare this with the same age group in other countries of Africa. In South Africa the figure for the age group seven to fourteen is 83 per cent. In Kenya it is 60 per cent. In Algiers it is 55.8 per cent; in Liberia, one of the countries that has so much to say about us, it is merely 34.2 per cent; in Malawi, 35.5 per cent; in the Camaroons, 61 per cent; in Libya, 59.7 per cent; in Togo, 49 per cent; in Somalia, merely 4.8 per cent, and in Mauritania, 12.9 per cent. The figure for that age group in South Africa is virtually 40 per cent higher than that of any other country on the continent of Africa. Let us go further. In 1953 our percentage of literacy was 21.8 per cent. In 1960 it was 39.7 per cent, and in 1964, 50 per cent. That is in respect of the whole Bantu population. In 1963 approximately 80 per cent of the Bantu population between the ages of seven and 20 were literate. I say that this is a record of which we may be very proud. It is a record which did not simply come about all by itself, but resulted from the dedication of both the <span class="col_6387-6388" refersTo="page_0455"/>Department of Bantu Administration and the Bantu themselves, as well as the Bantu&#x2019;s enthusiasm for becoming literate and being educated. Let us go further and take the number of Bantu passes in standard six and how they have increased. In 1960 the pass figure was 37,530. By 1966 it had increased to 59,100. The 1960 figure includes the Transkei but the 1966 does not. If the Transkei is excluded, the number of Bantu who passed the examination every year, was almost doubled over the past seven years. The total number of Bantu who have passed standard six, is estimated at 580,000. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with interest to the figures of the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to Bantu education and his comparison with those of other lands. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister one question. Which of the other lands he mentioned can claim the nucleus of white people to offer the training, guidance and tuition which we in South Africa can offer to Bantu pupils&#x003F; His comparison is not a fair one. One comparison which the hon. the Deputy Minister did not apply, was a comparison with Rhodesia, because when we come to weigh up what Rhodesia does in the way of Bantu education, I do not believe that our record is such a good one. The Rhodesian Government itself gives more to Bantu education than we do proportionally. I want to return to the question of the five-year plan. The five-year plan also covers Bantu education so that I feel that I am entitled to refer to it under this Vote as well. I should like to refer the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister to a very interesting booklet which I do not think is generally available in the Republic, but which is published for external consumption and issued through the Department of Information in America. It is called <i>Progress through Separate Development, South Africa in peaceful transition.</i> It contains some very interesting articles and remarks. I should like to deal with the Tswana people, but I realize that I would be out of order. I want to refer particularly to an article entitled, &#x201C;Let the World take Note&#x201D;. The author of this article is none other than Dr. Muller, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This is what he says on page 27:</p>

<block name="quote">We have as a rule avoided the stresses and strains of five-year plans and ten-year plans which never seem to come to fruition in any year.</block>

<p>You see. Sir. this is the bi-focal policy of the Nationalist Party. For outside consumption they talk about the five-year plans that do not come to fruition. But the hon. the Minister nearly went into orbit about the five-year plan which is past and the five-year plan which is to follow, here. I wonder which is right. Is this plan ever likely to come to fruition&#x003F; When we put the spotlight on Bantu education in this five-year plan, I believe that the spotlight tends to cast lengthening shadows over Bantu education itself. The nearer the subject comes to the light, the greater will be the shadow. It is an elementary fact of physics. I believe that until the Government reviews the decision which it took in 1953 in regard to the pegging of funds for Bantu education, the Bantu university colleges, about which so much has been said, will remain expensive reminders of the failure of this Government to face up to the needs of Bantu education.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the position that exists today, because I believe that it is a serious position, namely the fall-off in the number of pupils and therefore the limitation on the source of university pupils for the Bantu university colleges. These are the latest figures. I received them in answer to a question put to the Minister on the 5th May. They deal with figures as late as the 30th September, 1966. From these I have calculated that out of every 28 Bantu pupils attending primary schools, one will reach secondary school and out of every 374 pupils attending primary schools, one will reach high school. Out of every 1,183 Bantu pupils in primary schools, one will reach matric. If this is something to be proud of, I am afraid I cannot go along with the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Compare the matric results of 10 years ago. It is rather a disappointing comparison. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana should look that up and see for himself what the position is. Once the church schools had to give up training matric pupils, the drop took place and we are still recovering from that. I want to put it to this Committee that the main difficulty is an economic one, because not only are the Bantu contributing by means of the general tax to which the hon. the Deputy Minister referred, but they are contributing directly and indirectly. They are paying general tax, they are contributing on a fifty-fifty basis for schools in the white area, they are contributing on a fifty-fifty basis for the maintenance of schools in the white area, and they are paying for their books. When it comes to books, the latest assessment of what this involves the Bantu parent in, is given as follows. This applies to Natal, but I think it is very similar to other provinces. These are round figures. For class books from sub form to form V text books cost R103 and exercise books and extras cost R16. School fees and levies come to R28. Boarding fees amount to R120. Examination fees are R14. This makes a total of R281. Also included in the liabilities which a parent is faced with in sending his child to school, are school uniforms and a school case. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has told us, most children attending secondary schools will be called upon to go outside the urban areas and attend the secondary schools in the Bantu homelands. They will therefore be called upon to become boarders. Clothes have to be provided, and also train fares to and fro, even if it is only <span class="col_6389-6390" refersTo="page_0456"/>at the end of term. Then there are bus fares, levies for sport, for medical expenses, etc. It has been estimated from a reliable source that the cost to put one child through a one-year matric course amounts to a quarter of the income of the average Bantu family in Durban. That is in Natal. The position throughout the country in the other provinces is very much the same. I believe that the volume of evidence on the inadequacy of Bantu education cries out for parliamentary intervention.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Berea joined the ranks of the long line of prophets of doom we have found on the other side of the House in the last few days. They are making predictions that never come true and will never come true. I can appreciate that the hon. member and hon. members on the other side do not like the idea of a five-year plan. Their five-year plan is one that can be told by any child, it is the story of the nine little nigger boys who went out and of whom only five returned. Then the five of them went out again and eventually only one returned. In another five years&#x2019; time very few of them will be left. They will therefore not be able to discuss the fruits of the five-year plan. I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the high standard that is being maintained in publishing this fine publication, namely the <i>Bantu Education Journal.</i> It was printed on glazed paper. It contains a rich variety of data and interesting articles. It has been illustrated abundantly with newsworthy photographs and it even contains a correspondence column. It is a publication in which every education department in any part of the world can take pride. I make bold to say that I do not believe that there is a white education department in South Africa which circulates such a useful publication. Not only do I believe that it can be an important contribution and an important aid to the Bantu teacher, but I also believe that it may render a major contribution in furthering his self-respect and his professional dignity. However, this publication is not all that is fine in the Department of Bantu Education. It merely reflects a very thoroughly planned and well-organized department that is doing excellent work under extremely difficult circumstances. Few people realize what enormous proportions the activities of this Department assume. If one looks at the numbers that are at school, one finds that over the past ten years they have virtually been doubled. In 1956 approximately 1,100,000 pupils were attending schools. Last year there were approximately 2 million. This number already represents approximately 17 per cent of the total Bantu population in South Africa. It is a percentage which is much higher than is the case in any other African state. If these increases can be maintained, far more than 3 million Bantu pupils will be attending schools in another ten years&#x2019; time. It must undoubtedly be a tremendous task to provide this tremendously increasing number of pupils with equipment, school buildings and books.</p>

<p>But it is not only in scope that this Department is doing great work. In essence and in content, too, this Department is performing a gigantic task. As a matter of fact, I maintain that the Department of Bantu Education is engaged in the greatest act of salvation that has ever been performed in the history of South Africa. This Department is engaged in uplifting a nation that has for many years been the herdsmen and the hewers of wood and drawers of water to the stature of people with self-respect, people who can think and act for themselves, people who take pride in their language and their culture and their history, and people who will indeed be able to render a major contribution so that their people may save themselves. The basis and the starting-point of Bantu education is that of preparing the youth to serve their own communities. I am quoting from the <i>Bantu Education Journal</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is always being borne in mind that the development of the Bantu and their homelands should be anchored in their own cultural institutions and customs, having due regard to the right of full self-determination. The object of bringing about a self-supporting Bantu community which can develop fully in the social, cultural, economic and political spheres, is also being pursued in the educational sphere.</block>

<p>There was a time when this basis and starting-point of Bantu education was quite different. It was the time when that Party was in power. At that time the starting-point of Bantu education was to break down the language, the culture and the traditions of the Bantu, to free the Bantu from his tribal background, to make those things appear ridiculous, old-fashioned and savage to the Bantu child. He had to forget those things as soon as possible. He had to learn to speak English. He had to acquire British habits and the culture of the British. He had to wear Western clothes. If he did not do so, he was made to appear ridiculous. In other words, the object pursued by Bantu education at that time, under the r&#x00E9;gime of that Party, was to make a Westerner out of every Bantu child. What was the result&#x003F; Educated Bantu looked down on their own people with contempt. They referred to &#x201C;lobola-paying, blanket-wearing kraal Bantu&#x201D;. They refused to extend a helping hand to their own people. They tried to live like white people and among white people. They wanted to share in the privileges of the white man. How could one blame them&#x003F; Their system of education did in fact prepare them for that.</p>

<p>When the educated Bantu saw that they could not achieve these things and that they could never or would never become white persons and could not be accepted as such, they realized that they were travellers to nowhere. Then they became frustrated and paralysed. In the course of time a grievance was born in their hearts. They started hating the white man. They became communist agitators. Many of the educated Bantu of that era we do not <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_0457"/>find amongst their own people at present, but abroad, members of many of the so-called freedom movements directed at the Republic of South Africa. Fortunately there were also a few individuals who realized that one could only live one&#x2019;s life to the full when one was at the service of one&#x2019;s own people. They are doing useful work amongst their own people at present. The policy of this Government, namely the policy of separate development which means good relations with the various states and various peoples in South Africa, necessarily entails that the homelands of these peoples must be developed, and developed as soon as possible, but this should in fact be done by employing as far as possible their own means, their own spiritual properties, their own natural talents, their own labour and, where possible, their own capital as well. We know that once these people have, with our aid and assistance, developed themselves for their own benefit, it will not only be to their own advantage, but also to that of the Whites and the entire country. That is why it is the aim and object of the Department of Bantu Education to train every child in such a way that he may be at the service of his own people and that he may be a useful citizen. The progress that has been made is indeed spectacular. The hon. the Deputy Minister has already mentioned it here. Two million Bantu pupils are attending schools&#x2014;and there are approximately 9,000 schools&#x2014;and they are being instructed by more than 34,000 teachers. Last year 871 matriculants passed. Provision is not only being made for academic training, but a male Bantu youth can also receive technical and manual training. He can be taught the following things brickmaking, painting, baking, concrete work, plastering, carpentry, joinery, cabinet-making, plumbing, drain-laying and sheet-metal work, motor mechanics, electrotechnics and wiring homes, and building construction. Many of these Bantu, once they have been trained, will also be able to render an important contribution to developing the infra-structure of their own homelands. Bursaries are offered to the more intelligent Bantu pupils so as to encourage them to study further. A large number of bursaries are offered by the Department itself and by local authorities and churches. In all there are 1,482 bursaries, to the aggregate amount of R56,000, which are available to Bantu pupils. This major and extensive work of the Department of Bantu Education is frustrated by a shortage of funds. Apart from the R13 million that comes from the Treasury and the R1.5 million that is being voted for university training, the Government has afforded the Bantu peoples a splendid opportunity for actively developing the education of their children into something grand by deciding that all Bantu taxes should be spent on education. That is the chief source of the Bantu Education Account, but unfortunately this source has been disappointing so far. It is actually difficult to understand that a population of 12 million people merely yields R10 million in taxes when the education of their own children is at stake. This amount must undoubtedly be increased threefold or fourfold eventually. I think that just as in the case of the Whites, the time is ripe for a P.A.Y.E. system to be introduced for the Bantu so that they may pay their taxes. I think that this is perhaps a controversial idea, but I nevertheless think that the money that is obtained through the sale of spirituous liquor to the Bantu, may perhaps be paid into the Bantu Education Account. Last year the municipal drinking places in the Bantu townships of Port Elizabeth alone yielded more than R1 million, and they are merely selling one-third of the liquor the Bantu obtained, because liquor dealers outside those townships specialize in selling liquor to the Bantu and they deliver liquor on a large scale in those Bantu townships; in this way they attract approximately two-thirds of the Bantu liquor trade.

<p>I only want to reply to two or three of the statements made by the hon. member for Algoa. The first is to tell him that whatever he may think in regard to the Government&#x2019;s concentration on trying to re-establish tribal customs and developing pride in the African people, the Africans in South Africa live in a modern industrial country and they do not want to return to their tribal structure. The Africans want only one thing and that is to share in the benefits of the development of Western civilization, and they are not interested in wearing tribal clothing and sitting around a pot in the tribal areas. They want consumer goods of all kinds and they want a share in the general development of the modern industrial society, and nothing the Government does to try to put them back in that old mould is going to work because they are moving ahead together with the rest of this country.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am grateful to you, Sir. The point is that if we are going to consider this financial aspect of the Bantu Education Vote, I want to say to the Deputy Minister that this is, of course, the only section of the population which is expected to contribute specifically to its own education, or that has a separate fund for it. There is no separate fund for Coloured or Indian education or for the Whites. The education for those groups is expected to be paid for out of the national coffers, but the poorest section of the community has to pay for its own education. There can be no justification for that. I cannot agree with this separation at all, but even if one <span class="col_6393-6394" refersTo="page_0458"/>could agree with it in principle, the basis on which it is done is quite unjust, apart from the valid point made by the hon. member for Kensington about the reduction in the value of money and the point made by the hon. member for Berea about the Africans having, over and above their taxes, to contribute monthly fees and to pay for all their books. I want to point out that the Africans contribute an enormous sum by way of indirect taxation which is not taken into consideration at all. The percentage of their contribution to the national income is far higher than the R13 million plus the R1.5 million for colleges which is allowed for it. [Interjection.] The Minister cannot compare the contribution made indirectly in labour and in indirect taxes to the national income and equate it with what this Government allocates to education.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that we all make glib statements about Bantu education in this House and the Department puts out reports talking about &#x201C;unparalleled achievements&#x201D;, and the Minister talks about the great advances that have been made, and the Government tells us over and over that 80 per cent of the children are at school and that there is a high degree of literacy among the Africans. But I do not think we really know these figures, because when I asked the Minister earlier this year to tell me about the number of children turned away from school at the beginning of this year in the Witwatersrand region only, he said he did not know. I also asked him to tell me what shortage of accommodation there was for African children throughout the Republic, and his reply was that the information was not available and that to obtain it a comprehensive survey would have to be undertaken. Well, I suggest it is high time that he undertook just such a survey, so that we can really understand what the facts are in regard to Bantu education, and how many children come clamouring for admission to the schools which are available, particularly in the urban areas, and how many are turned away. In Port Elizabeth alone we were told that something like 2,900 children were turned away. I asked a question about it and the Minister replied that this was the responsibility of the Municipality of Port Elizabeth. because in 1965 they did not put in an application for schoolrooms at all. On the 12th May, however, there was a denial of this by Mrs. Holland, the Chairman of the Bantu Affairs Committee at Port Elizabeth. She said that they did put in a request for schoolrooms, and although this year they were told that they had been granted additional schoolrooms, they were still waiting for the money to come through. So I do not know whether all these allegations of municipal responsibility not being carried out are correct or not. I think it is time to have a proper survey into the whole position of Bantu schools. I do not believe we have this enormous literacy rate among African children. I do not believe that anyone can be functionally literate who has only spent the two sub-grades and maybe the first two years at school. Most of them leave before Std. 2, and according to the Eiselen Commission, unless a child has had four years at school, to all intents and purposes that schooling is wasted. So how the Government can claim this high literacy rate among African children is beyond me, because the vast majority of children do not have those four years at school. To give these figures of hundreds of thousands of children who are at school today is all right as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. It does not even go up to St. 2, so I discount entirely the claims of functional literacy among African children. The Minister correctly said that they had made many attempts to increase the number of teachers. May I just have the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention here and put it to him that the emphasis is on the wrong side. The emphasis should not be on primary education at this stage, but on secondary education in order to produce the teachers, because unless you have teachers you cannot go in for a massive primary education system. This must be obvious to everybody. The number of teachers has not increased in anything like the proportion that is required. That is probably due to salaries as well and the absolutely niggardly increases that Bantu teachers have had. They start at too low a level. It is like starting with R1 and raising it to R2 and then saying that the increase is 100 per cent. Of course it is 100 per cent, but if you start too low it does not help. They have to get an increase that means something. But the emphasis should be on secondary education if we really want to educate an African people who can play their part in the general development of this country and even, according to Government policy, in the development of the reserves, because as things stand at the moment, they are not going to have the professional people, the engineers, the teachers, the technicians, the doctors and the nurses, to play their part in the development of the reserves. We must start by increasing the number of secondary schools. I agree absolutely with what the hon. member for Kensington has said about the building of secondary schools, only in the rural areas. Sir, it is a terrible thing to do. It means that the most advanced section of the African people who are in the urban areas are denied easy access to secondary schools. It is impossible for those parents to pay boarding fees over and above everything else, and apart from that the parents are dead scared that if they send their children to secondary schools in the rural areas, those children forfeit the right to re-enter the urban areas. Great difficulties are placed in their way if they wish to come back into the urban areas. The tendency therefore is not to take advantage of the schools which exist in the rural areas. If the Government is really serious about wanting to present South Africa as an advanced country, advancing the education of the African people, they will have to rethink their policy on three major lines, firstly the financial side, secondly the whole question of placing the emphasis on secondary <span class="col_6395-6396" refersTo="page_0459"/>schooling, rather than on a broad basis of primary schooling where the children get three or four years of schooling in the lowest possible grades and then leave, and thirdly, of course, on the question of where these secondary schools should be placed. They should obviously be in the urban areas. I believe that the Government is making a very serious mistake as regards the way in which it is handling this whole question of Bantu education.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to begin by saying that I believe this is the most important Vote in the whole of the Estimates, this Bantu Education Vote. Sir, I believe that this Government is treating Bantu Education as a step-child of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, and when I hear from the hon. member for Kensington that over R1 million has had to be surrendered on this Vote during the past year, I believe there is something very seriously wrong indeed. I say that this Vote is the most important Vote in the Estimates because you are dealing here with the mind of the Bantu people. Surely what we in whit e South Africa are trying to do is to win the struggle for the mind of the uncommitted people of Africa. We are trying to win that struggle for the Western Christian values that the white man stands for. Surely the way in which we should do that is through education, through bringing home to the Bantu people the values that we stand for, our traditions, our background and everything that the white man has to offer. I believe that the function of the Bantu Education Department is to educate, to uplift, to offer new horizons, to bring home to the Bantu population the tremendous world that lies open to them through education, through progress, through co-operating with the white man. I do not believe that this is faced with sufficient seriousness by this Government, and I believe that that is borne out by the pegging of the amount of money made available to Bantu Education in this country. Sir, I am the first to concede that there are difficulties, that there is a shortage of teachers and that there are problems in providing buildings and so on, but I believe that education is the most potent weapon that the white man has. Sir, the hon. member for Algoa has drawn the attention of this Committee to the fact that so many educated Bantu have turned to communism. Why&#x003F; They turn to communism because of the rejection by this Government of everything that they expected from the white man. That is what turned them to communism, and you see exactly the same process going on to-day where they are being forced to look to the Bantu homeland areas for their secondary education. These people are increasingly becoming part and parcel of the economic system and the society of South Africa. They recognize themselves as playing that part, and here they are being met by a blank wall; they are being told by the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister and officials of the Department that the parts they are playing in South Africa to-day are not recognized; that they are rejected; that they are to go back to their own areas. This is what is being said to Bantu people in our urban centres who are carrying on their backs the whole of the economic life of South Africa. I believe that this is terribly short-sighted. I can see no explanation for it; I can see no justification for it. Sir, the hon. member over there shakes his head. How would he like it if he had to go some hundreds of miles away from where he is living for his secondary education, not by choice but forced to do so because no facilities are provided close to his home for secondary education&#x003F; Sir, has every person not got the right to have education provided for him as close to his home as possible&#x003F; Is that not the efficient way of doing it&#x003F;</p>

<p>Is that not what happens throughout the Western world&#x003F; Local schools are made available to the population as a whole. [Interjections.] Sir, I do not accept that for one moment. This is something which is the result of the ideological policy of this Government.</p>

<p>However, I do not wish to continue in that vein. I wish to make a special plea here to the hon. the Minister for the development of the system of Bantu farm schools. As one who lives on a farm, I believe that this system of Bantu farm schools is one of the biggest stabilizing factors that one can have in the relationship between the white employer and his employees on the farm. I believe that this is a system which ought <i>&#x2018;o</i> be developed in the interests of the farming community and the labour involved in that farming community. Sir, I made a very rough calculation and my figures may be a little bit out, but I see that there are about 221,000 pupils in some 2,500 farm schools, and in those farm schools there are some 4,000 teachers, which gives us a pupil-teacher ratio of one teacher to 50 pupils. Sir I do not think that is satisfactory. I know that there are problems also in getting teachers to go to these remote areas, to the farms. The Government will experience that same difficulty when they want teachers to go to the Bantu homelands. But I do believe that inducement can be offered and I do believe that the system of educating Bantu farm labour on the farms offers a tremendous advantage in that you are not orientating the Bantu labour on farms to an urban type of life, which I think is something which is causing a tremendous degree of instability in the whole of the platteland to that particular section of our Bantu labour population. I believe I am correct in saying that many of these farm schools are found on a voluntary basis by farmers. They have to be maintained by the farmers or the local community for two years before the Department takes them over, and when the Department takes them over, the Department then become responsible for the salaries of the teachers. The local community <span class="col_6397-6398" refersTo="page_0460"/>has to make some contribution towards the establishment of the school and its maintenance for a period of two years. I believe that this is the system which should be extended. I believe it is a system which will be of considerable benefit to the farming population and I would like to see it improved where it is possible to improve it, particularly in this matter of the relationship between the number of teachers employed to the number of pupils.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I have just as much to say about the hon. member for Houghton, but as far as she is concerned, I would also rather say nothing. I want to make a few observations on the fundamental approach and the practical implementation of our policy in respect of Bantu education, particularly in the light of the transfer of management and administrative powers to the respective Bantu nations in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Not only were the fundamental arguments raised by the Minister in speeches in the course of the year founded rightly and realistically, both inductively and deductively, on our multi-nation contact situation in South Africa, but his view of the place of the education facet within the Bantu&#x2019;s own pattern of life is equally correct. The total human growth process is assisted, fostered and directed by the education facet. For that reason the Government is now taking the broader elements of the enculturation process together with the rudimentary elements of the Bantu&#x2019;s traditional educational and teaching system and causing their crystallization into the modern formal and informal methods and facilities of education.</p>

<p>Bantu education will now also have as its object not only the training and planning as regards the Bantu&#x2019;s political and administrative structure; not only will it be instrumental in creating closer links between the various ethnic groups and their other fellow-tribesmen who five in other places; not only will it contribute towards independence as regards the Bantu&#x2019;s legal and court system, his economy, finance and social development, etc., but under the guidance of the Government his education will grow and gradually be handed over to the Bantu himself.</p>

<p>With a view to maintaining educational policy and uniform educational content and standards, sustained central control is exercised by the Department of Bantu Education, firstly, in respect of certain professional services and, secondly, in respect of certain administrative services&#x2014;for example, the registration, classification and grading of community schools, statistics, the Bantu educational advisory council, control over teacher-training schools, other State schools and universities. The ethnic sub-committees of the educational advisory council which are already in existence are to be developed into full-fledged advisory councils for each ethnic unit. Thirdly, certain accounting responsibilities will initially be retained, for example, control and supervision over accounting and the preparation and distribution of salary cheques.</p>

<p>The other responsibilities are entrusted to the Department of Education and Culture of the territorial authority on the understanding that certain services will be provided in cooperation with other interested Departments. The functions can be transferred gradually as the Bantu become equipped for them. I shall now mention a few as examples. Firstly, there is the planning and establishment of new schools which, as was previously also the case, will be submitted to the Department for the necessary registration. Secondly, there is the expansion of existing schools. Thirdly, there is the erection and maintenance of school, hostel and office buildings. Fourthly, there is the provision of water, light and sanitation services. Fifthly, there is the payment of rentals and insurance costs, water and lights to those particular concerns, for example church and other bodies, from whom they rent the buildings in question. Sixthly, there is the payment of travel and subsistence costs of members of school boards and other officials in the service of the Bantu authorities. In the seventh place there is the provision to community schools, hostels and offices of furniture and other equipment which they will require. In the eighth place there is the creation, subject of course to the approval of the Secretary for Bantu Education, of educational posts in accordance with fixed formulae and within the limits of the money provided. In the ninth place there is teachers&#x2019; appointment, promotion, granting of leave, transfer and discharge and the formulation of the necessary conditions of service. In the tenth place there is the employment, with the approval of the Minister of Bantu Education, of administrative staff at offices, schools and hostels. Furthermore, there is the Budget for the abovementioned services and also for the promotion of language, literature and arts. There are also translating services and State publications, and the provision of study bursaries and loans.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say something about the organization and staff. A regional office for every separate nation which will serve as a seconded office of the State Department of Bantu Education in Pretoria, will be created. The function of this office will be to exercise professional control over both those schools which come under the territorial authority and certain Government schools in that Bantu area, as well as schools in white areas in the districts concerned. Furthermore, the regional office will assist the Education Department of the territorial authority through advice and guidance.</p>

<p><span class="col_6399-6400" refersTo="page_0461"/>The office is headed by a regional director, assisted by some white administrative officials and one or more white inspectors. However, all Bantu officers, as well as professional officers, for example inspectors, are to be transferred to the Department of Education and Culture of the respective territorial authorities. Where necessary, some of these Bantu officers may be seconded to the establishment of regional directors of the relevant territorial authority.</p>

<p>The control officer of the Education Department will be in liaison with the chief control officer of the territorial authority in respect of local co-ordination, and with the regional office in connection with matters referred to the Head Office in Pretoria. The regional office itself will exercise control over professional services. The establishment of Bantu and white officials of the control officer will be determined by way of investigation.</p>

<p>The territorial authority executive committee member in charge of education will be assisted by an educational committee, and this educational committee will comprise all the chairmen of the various school boards for the area concerned. In areas where there are fewer than five school boards, both the chairman and the deputy-chairman will serve on the committee concerned. That educational committee must be in contact with the relevant sub-committee of the educational advisory council.</p>

<p>School boards, as constituted at present, and their functions are retained, but they will come under the territorial authority and its executive committee. School committees as constituted at present and their functions will be retained unchanged.</p>

<p>Consideration will have to be given to the possible transfer of professional services to the territorial authority.</p>

<p>At this stage it should be mentioned that the Bantu Education policy of the Government is in full swing. Personally I am satisfied that this policy is founded on the best educational scientific principles. I am satisfied that it has regard to the full reality of our ethnic contact situation here in South Africa, and that in course of time the Bantu will indeed be able to exercise full control over his own education within a certain period from now on.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to follow the hon. member who has just sat down, but as he has set himself up as something of an expert on Bantu education, I would ask him to support me in my plea which I will direct at the hon. the Minister. I want to refer the Minister to Table 1 on page 22 of the Annual Report for the Calendar Year 1965 of the Department of Bantu Education. This table sets out the number of schools under the control of the Department as 7,220 odd as at the end of 1965. In 1960 there were 7,721 schools. It would, therefore, seem that there has been a drop of 500 schools, although elsewhere in the report we read of an increase of 180 schools. Can one assume, therefore, that the drop of 500 schools was brought about by the closure of religious schools or church schools&#x003F; As I say, there has been a drop of 500 schools over the past five years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to Table 1, Summary of Schools on page 22. The present figure given for church schools is 509. In 1954 the Catholic Church alone had over 800 schools, 688 of which were subsidized schools. Now it has 490 schools, none of which are subsidized. The total of church schools is now shown in the table as being 509, none of which are subsidized. In this respect I should like to refer the Minister to a question he answered for me on the 16th May. His answer to a question of mine was that: &#x201C;Certain church authorities prefer to establish, maintain and control their own schools and such schools are registered as private schools which means that they receive no assistance from the State&#x201D;. I wonder whether that is in fact the position. Do they in fact prefer to receive no subsidy&#x003F; I suggest rather that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy that leaves them with no alternative. Another interesting feature is the composition of the remaining schools. The figure given for community schools is 3,883 and farm schools 2,521. It is interesting to note that out of the 7,000 schools shown on the table, over 4,000 are in the so-called white areas. If one was to look at the figures for the 509 church schools, you will find that these church schools cater for 82.0 pupils or about 5 per cent of the total number of Bantu being educated in the Republic. Furthermore, and this is the important point, this table shows quite clearly that these 82.0 pupils are being educated at no cost whatever to the Government. I do not believe that from the Government&#x2019;s point of view you can get any cheaper than that&#x2014;82,000 Bantu children educated in this country out of charity, 82,000 whose parents pay in fact twice for their education because they also have to pay poll tax. Now we have learnt from the hon. the Deputy Minister that for their secondary education they are going to have to travel to some Bantu homeland at some considerable cost to them as well. I believe that in no aspect of this Government&#x2019;s administration have they shown just quite how cheap they really are. Here we have 82,000 Bantu people educated at private schools at no cost to the Government. We have 3,000 community schools and approximately 2,000 farm schools for all of which the Government only pays a proportion of the costs. Who in this country is then paying for the education of the Bantu&#x003F; It is the Bantu themselves. I believe that we should bow our heads in shame because we allow this thing to go on. I, therefore, again turn to my hon. friend who spoke a short while ago and I say that if he is really concerned about Bantu education, he must <span class="col_6401-6402" refersTo="page_0462"/>have a little closer look at this report. The Government does not pay a brass farthing to educate so large a proportion of the population. If we look at these schools a little closer, what do we find&#x003F; We find that one of these Bantu schools last year had a 100 per cent pass in J.C. and only one failure in matric. This is in respect of the school at Marian Hill whose reputation is known beyond the borders of South Africa. Generally the standard of these church schools is higher than at the Government-controlled schools. It is these church schools which are in fact supplying the material to the university colleges. If it was not for these church schools, the enrolment at the university colleges would be a good deal lower than it is now.</p>

<p>Sir, if you look at a report which shows the matriculation results for the years 1953 to 1964, you will see that this report alone shows the role which the church schools have played in Bantu education. While the church schools were allowed to play their full part, the percentage passes in Bantu education was a great deal higher than it was in the years that followed. There are 1,900 teachers in these private schools, and the Government does not pay a penny of their salaries either. Some years ago, when the Government withdrew the subsidy from these schools, these teachers experienced tremendous drops in salary and hardship in order to continue teaching. The report shows as well that 14 church schools closed last year, while two new ones were opened. The year before, 11 church schools were closed. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister how many of those 14 schools and how many of the 11 schools which had to close the year before, closed because they could not make ends meet. I should also like to know how many of the 1&#x00BD; million books, at a cost of R400,000, which was supplied free to schools according to this report, went to these church schools. I do not believe that the Government can blithely sit back and ignore the part that these church schools are playing in our education, and say that they will have nothing to do with them except control them through their inspectors and make them carry out the functions of the department without paying a single penny towards them. Nobody is asking the State to finance church schools, but I do say that it is the duty of the State to finance any denominational school when the State is not in a position to supply a school of its own. If this principle were applied, fewer church schools would be forced to close than are closing at present. This is a principle which has been accepted in other parts of the world. In no instance should the subsidy to a church or a denominational school be withdrawn unless the State can supply a school in that area.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House find it very difficult to debate the question of Bantu education with the Opposition, particularly because of their negative approach to the whole matter. We now find ourselves in the position, as the hon. member for Rissik said, that we simply have to carry on without their support or even encouragement, or without their giving us reason to criticize them. I do want to refer to the hon. member for Berea. A moment ago he spoke about the number of pupils in matriculation classes. I just want to tell him that in 1955 the number was 674. It increased to 1,405 in 1965, which is an increase of almost 115 per cent. I say this just for his edification.</p>

<p>But I want to continue. Since it came into being the Bantu Education Department has succeeded in laying the basic foundation for the education, teaching and training of the Bantu youth of our country. In course of time the progress has been accompanied by tremendous forward bounds. It has indeed been remarkable. I am of the opinion that we are now on the brink of a new phase, of which I want to outline certain features. In the report of Bantu Education there is already an indication of this awareness of a new spirit of adjustment and change. On page 1, for example, the report states that pupils are more adaptable to the constant changes of to-day&#x2019;s labour market and to strange business conditions, as well as being able to master new methods and techniques. The ideas which are set out in this report are sound.</p>

<p>But it is necessary that Bantu education should tie up to an ever-increasing extent with the objectives of the Department of Bantu Administration. Meticulous co-ordination is essential. Education and teaching centres must necessarily form economic and social focal points. In course of time these focal points change into points of attraction&#x2014;we find this in white areas, and it1 is also the case in Bantu areas. We should like to discourage the creation of points of attraction for the Bantu in the white areas, whilst encouraging and stimulating such points of attraction in Bantu areas. It is alarming to see that in Bantu residential areas in white areas and in other areas there are 4,079 schools, compared with 3,143 schools in Bantu areas&#x2014;a ratio of 4:3 in favour of schools in white areas. This tendency must be stopped at all costs. We must do so through drastic planning measures. We simply cannot continue establishing any more Bantu schools in white areas.</p>

<p>Another aspect which is to a certain extent related to the foregoing, is also mentioned in the report of Bantu education. The report states that broadly speaking the era of the unskilled worker is drawing to a close and that there is a great demand for a new kind of worker, the trained and skilled artisan, the technician, the educated person who has knowledge of the new techniques and who can adapt himself to conditions that have changed.</p>

<p>In this connection it is essential that the importance of the location of institutions for training these people should be emphasized. Because this kind of training is expensive, territorial decentralization is understandable to a certain point. There are many good reasons <span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0463"/>for a policy of not locating these institutions in or near white areas. As far as these forms of education are concerned, co-ordination between Bantu education and Bantu administration, and perhaps also the Department of Labour, is essential. Bantu Education will soon have to devote attention to training and certifying Bantu artisans in Bantu areas. One should take care not to over-emphasize the technical and trade training at the expense of other fields of training, fields which must in fact provide the opportunity for the technicians and artisans to enter the labour market. But it is a wide field. It is not merely a matter of technicians and artisans. We need clerks, bookkeepers, managers, typists, post office clerks, bank clerks and others. Employment bureaux, health services and other services rendered by the State require trained people, and then there is also a demand for waiters, barmen, etc., in other tertiary industries.</p>

<p>But apart from the ordinary training facilities which have to be provided, there are other methods to which attention may be given. The training of technical staff, of artisans and office staff may perhaps take the form of in-service training. This possibility has not yet received the attention it merits. As far as this is concerned, the Department of Bantu Education may provide guidance to a larger extent.</p>

<p>In my view it is also quite justifiable that Bantu staff will be recruited for administration and trades in white areas with a view to the development of the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Another possibility is offering short courses for specific orientation and training. In this regard it is pleasing to note in the report of the B.I.C. that they employ these methods of technical assistance, offering advice, of training, and also of after-care.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a request of a local nature. The presence of other race groups in Zululand, north of the Tugela, is at present being investigated. The problem which arises is to replace the workers who are at present employed in hotels, offices, shops, mills and garages. The workers who are there at present have to be replaced, because they are members of other race groups. Add to this the unavoidable development awaiting that area, and you will appreciate that a real problem is experienced in this regard. I have received representations from various quarters for the establishment, inside a Bantu homeland, of a technical college where a variety of courses can be offered, courses which will be able to meet the needs of both the homeland and the area with which we are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand has referred to the establishment of educational institutions for Bantu in the Bantu homelands. The hon. the Deputy Minister as well referred to this matter as did various other hon. members. But I am surprised that the hon. member for Zululand referred to this. He was a lecturer at Ngoyte and he knows the circumstances under which students went there&#x2014; the difficulties, for instance they experienced to find accommodation; difficulties they encountered in going from the urban areas to a rural area. The hon. Deputy Minister referred me a while ago to Hammarsdale. Has he seen the conditions under which students in the secondary school at Hammarsdale have to live&#x003F; Does he know of the new industry that is being developed in the Bantu areas under decentralization of secondary education&#x003F; If the hon. the Deputy Minister has seen it, is he satisfied with conditions&#x003F; I want to appeal to him as well as to the hon. the Minister to do something about this immediately&#x2014;and not only at Hammarsdale but throughout the country. These conditions exist everywhere where there are institutions. Let us do something about providing accommodation for students if the Government's policy for decentralization of these higher education institutions is to be continued. Are the Bantu university colleges a magnificent achievement or are they premature white elephants&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have. Let us go back to 1953 and see what the position was then when Bantu education was taken over by the Department of Bantu Administration. The immediate effect was that they lost most of the trained staff they had.</p>

<p>How did this affect the matriculation figures&#x003F; In 1953, 259 Bantu matriculated. In 1960 it dropped to 182, nearly 60 per cent of the previous number. Why was this&#x003F; There was a vast increase in the overall number of pupils, particularly in the primary grades. But secondary school education deteriorated rapidly, resulting in relatively fewer Bantu passing the matric examination. Also it is resulting inevitably in relatively fewer Bantu going on with secondary education. That is what this country needs, particularly if this Government's policy of separate development is to succeed. The Bantu must qualify in huge numbers to help their own people to develop. Fewer students, particularly, qualify to become teachers, for the same reason. How can the Bantu, as I said earlier, develop separately without qualified people to educate and train them and to assist in their development&#x003F; For the same reasons very few Bantu secondary schools are able to teach the essentials for a student to go on to higher learning, for example Latin, mathematics and science. There are no qualified teachers, as you have heard the hon. member for Kensington say.</p>

<p>If the system inherited from the United Party had been continued, there would not have been this shortfall.</p>

<p>These subjects are basic subjects which are required for students studying for bachelors degrees in arts and science. The result is that, <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0464"/>when these students go to the university colleges to-day, they have to start with elementary lessons in Latin and science. The Bantu Education Commission resulted in this takeover, but the minority report at that time foresaw all this and recommended to this Government that for an interim period the development of secondary education should take prime importance; the development of higher education centres, such as the university colleges, should be left over. This, however, was rejected and now we see the results. To justify the establishment of the university colleges the Department has had to admit students without matriculation qualifications. They are there, undertaking diploma courses. Not that I am decrying that. At least we are putting them to some useful use.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>They are not, but they are attending these universities for diploma courses and they are going to make a useful contribution to the development of the Bantu people. In 1963, 36 per cent of the students at these university colleges were not matriculated. In 1965 there were still 35 per cent of them who were not matriculated. In 1965 there was a total of 939 students. Seven were studying for masters degrees and 24 were studying for honours degrees; 566 were studying for bachelors degrees and 342 for diplomas. There has been an improvement in the number of students studying for degrees, but is the Minister satisfied that he is turning out sufficient graduates fast enough for separate development to work&#x003F; I mentioned Ngoye earlier. The hon. member for Zululand was there. In the six years since Ngoye has been established, what have they turned out&#x003F; Forty one B.A. graduates, seven B.Sc. graduates, nine graduates with honours in the arts and 62 with diplomas in teaching or in commerce. This has been achieved with an average attendance of over 50 lecturers. In the colleges there are 939 students and 192 lecturers. The ratio of students to lecturers is five to one. In addition there is all the capital expenditure that is required. The question is: Can South Africa afford to make such poor use of our limited, and I mean limited, number of qualified persons and our limited financial resources&#x003F; Is the Minister satisfied&#x003F;</p>

<p>In conclusion I would like to say that it appears from the foregoing that the answer to the question that I posed earlier is that these colleges were premature and that they have up to now remained white elephants. I appeal now to the hon. the Minister and the Deputy Minister to take a realistic view of this position. Let us do something. Let us go on and no longer keep them as white elephants. Let them now serve the purpose for which they were intended and let the Bantu people of South Africa benefit from this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington made his customary introductory speech and, as could be expected, had a good deal to say on the fixed amount of R13 million. On this occasion I do not want to go into the comparisons which he drew in connection with the shortfall which, as he alleged, developed as a result of the depreciation of money. It is a common phenomenon. But the services which are rendered to the Bantu prove to us that there is no reason to review the amount of R13 million at this stage, as the hon. member would so much like us to do, particularly not if the correlation between the taxes which have to be paid and the educational fund is still unfavourable, as is the case at present, as a result of indifferent payment of taxes. Last year I dealt with this in great detail and I actually do not think it is necessary to give very serious attention to it again now.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member knows that. He said himself that this was the only one of the race groups in South Africa in respect of which such a special education fund existed. I said last year that it was proper that in the course of his development the Bantu should be taught that one of the most primary requirements for any civilized person is the payment of taxes. One cannot qualify for being regarded as a civilized person unless one is also prepared to be a taxpayer. I think it is a very good principle to correlate one&#x2019;s civilization with the payment of taxes as far as the advancement of a nation is concerned. L is also a very good savings requirement. But then the hon. members on the opposite side should appreciate that seen from an over-all point of view the Bantu are getting more and more education. Everybody who should receive education and who is able to do something with education receives L. The Deputy Minister and others quoted some figures here. There is no need to repeat them. They are such general facts as that our percentage of Bantu who are enjoying education is higher than that of other countries in Africa. Even more attention is to be given to all this work which we are now going to undertake in connection with activating the Bantu authorises. It goes without saying that more attention will be devoted to education. I predict that this will be one of the reasons why the Bantu will realize more effectively than before that the payment of their taxes is essential to them in order to achieve those objectives which they can achieve through education. I think it is a <span class="col_6407-6408" refersTo="page_0465"/>very good principle that these two are linked. It is not something that we have to be ashamed of and for which we have to apologize to anybody. The progress in education is obvious in every respect. If one considers the number of children at school, the number of teachers, the matriculants and all the different aspects which one may use as a criterion, one will see that progress is being made in Bantu education, which not only keeps abreast of the available funds but also of the needs they have to supply. I also want to say here what I have said in another context in this House, namely that it is of no avail to develop the Bantu in only one aspect of his development process, with the result that his development in this aspect outstrips and outpaces all other aspects of his development completely. In the field of education it will also be wrong if we do not maintain the balance between the general level of civilization and development of the nation as such and its intelligentsia, whom it gets through its educational systems.</p>

<p>There are simple ways of demonstrating spectacularly how education is expanding. It has been pointed out to me that if one studies the statistics they indicate that the schools of the Bantu are expanding to such an extent that it means in effect that one school per working day is being established for Bantu education in South Africa. There is an increase of approximately 75,000 school-children a year. That means 1,500 classrooms, or at least 150 schools of ten classrooms each. That tallies with the other figure which I mentioned here, of one school per working day.</p>

<p>If we compare the reality with readily laid down criteria, we have no reason to be as pessimistic and negative as many hon. members on the opposite side have in fact been to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Berea and Pietermaritzburg (District) referred most disparagingly to the university colleges. They referred to them as &#x201C;white elephants&#x201D; and &#x201C;premature&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It was most disparaging. I wonder how the hon. member would feel if I called his party a &#x201C;white elephant&#x201D;&#x003F; If an institution is called a white elephant, the hon. member should not tell me that it is not a disparaging remark. Of course it is a disparaging remark. I want to tell the hon. member that in the short period of their existence the university colleges have achieved a tremendous deal, and that despite the tremendous opposition and tremendous derision which they initiated. This is also proved by their expansion. I shall now quote some figures in this regard. Since 1964 they have expanded a great deal. From 1964 to 1966 the number of students increased by 283. In 1965, 145 degrees and diplomat were awarded at the colleges. Are these white elephant degrees, are they failures&#x003F; Are they not rather Bantu who can go and render services to their people, services which are essential&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Not only did more students attend the colleges, but courses were also expanded. I am now speaking from memory, because I did not look up these particulars. There are two things which occur to me immediately. In recent times courses in law have been introduced at one of the colleges, for example. A degree course in agriculture has also been introduced at one of the colleges for the Bantu. Thus further courses will be introduced. Indeed, so many new courses are added that one&#x2019;s memory cannot keep up with them. I therefore say the hon. members are most unfair and most disparaging when they say that the institutions are white elephants and are a failure, as has in fact been said. The hon. member for Berea used the word &#x201C;failure&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) spoke of &#x201C;white elephants&#x201D;.</p>

<p>It was also complained that there was too little education for the Bantu schoolchildren. In this connection regard should not only be had to the number of schools and the expenditure in that respect. I have indicated that in my view the expansion of education for Bantu schoolchildren has been proportionate to the needs. I want to point out that it is wrong to think of a shortage of money and facilities as the sole reason why there is not a greater increase in the number of Bantu schoolchildren. There are other reasons as well, and because those other reasons are human reasons, I do not want to discuss them and I hope they will never be discussed. We must have due regard to those reasons, however, and see to it that we make the best of the Bantu who do come forward to receive their education. That is why they come, and that is why there is a selection of Bantu who come forward from the community and who get the education they require.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea referred to the schoolbooks. He asked that books should be provided. In fact, he almost pretended that schoolbooks were not being provided at all. I could give the hon. member many details, but I do not want to do so. I just want to mention one fact at once. In 1955-&#x2019;56, R197,200 was spent on books which were made available free of charge to primary schoolchildren. These were the graded textbooks. Readers to the amount of R177,000 were also made available. Books were also made available to teachers. I know that the Bantu authorities raise funds by special levies imposed by them&#x2014; every week I have to approve such cases for submission to the State President&#x2014;and used to pay for all kinds of school facilities which they offer their pupils. It is therefore quite <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_0466"/>wrong to say or to pretend that Bantu school-children all have to buy their books themselves. Then I must remind hon. members of the fact that in our White education there are many cases of children whose books have to be bought. This is in addition to all their other expenses.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If there is time, you may ask it at the end of my speech. I am trying to beat the clock&#x2014;and it seems as though it is going to be hard to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton raised her customary objection, of course. Listening to the hon. member for Houghton one would think that the expenditure on Bantu education was only what came from the R13 million or from their taxes. I want to tell you that if we take the full picture in respect of education, as well as all the other developments of the Bantu which come under another vote and which were discussed on that vote, and if we relate all these, then it is apparent that the Bantu is getting a tremendous deal in services from money made available by this Parliament. This is amply justified by all the contributions they are in fact making, even in the form of indirect taxes. The picture must be seen in its full perspective. When we discussed education here, the hon. member spoke as though this was all that the Bantu received for the money contributed by him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also said that secondary education should be concentrated on. But all forms of education are concentrated on. Secondary education has also shown its usual increase, as from 1955 to 1965.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River also spoke about secondary education. He spoke about farm schools. The farm-school figure shows a great increase. The hon. member spoke as though there was stagnation. He did not say that directly, but he spoke in such a plaintive tone that one would think stagnation had set in as far as the farm schools are concerned. It did not. Between 1955 and 1966 the number of farm schools in South Africa doubled. It increased from just over 1,200 to more than 2,500. An average of ten to 15 farm schools per month are established, according to the methods which are being designed. The hon. member is shaking his head. Now I do not know what his point was. There is no intention to allow stagnation of the position, to restrict the number of schools.</p>

<p>I am very grateful for the attention the hon. member for Rissik devoted to those aspects of the expansion of Bantu education in the new perspective in which we are now seeing it.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Port Natal. He spoke about private schools. I want to remind the hon. member that there is a long history to private schools and their take-over by the Department of Bantu Education and the establishment of the State Bantu schools and the community schools, etc., under the Department of Bantu Education. I think the hon. member should go and look up that history. I do not think we want to go into that history again. I think that now even the hon. member for Kensington does not feel like discussing those matters again.</p>

<p>It is not I who wish to do so. I said in fact that I did not wish to do so, because I did not have to. The initiative for this discussion is therefore with the hon. member for Kensington. The resolution was adopted here, a resolution by this Parliament, that the private education be taken over. Now I want to ask the hon. member whether he thinks it would be fair or whether it could be reconciled with the implementation of Bantu education under the Bantu Education Act so far, if we suddenly started subsidizing private schools, in any form whatsoever; concerns which were not prepared to transfer their schools to the Department of Bantu Education&#x003F; Surely that is unthinkable. Surely we have to be logical. That would mean that everything would have to be turned back, that everything would have to be given back. No, those schools are not getting that subsidy; they are not getting assistance, for reasons which are easy to explain and on which we took our decisions years ago. The hon. member must see it in that light.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. member that the church schools which were closed were not closed because we did so. We did not order them to close. Many of the church schools&#x2014; most of them&#x2014;which have closed down, did so for other external reasons, and one very important reason is that they are no longer getting the support from individual Bantu which they got previously. As a result the schools went into a decline. The Bantu either preferred to send their children to a State Bantu school, or mostly to establish their own community school. This is a school which they themselves control directly. What control have the Bantu parents and community over the existing private Bantu schools&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>They closed when you withdrew the subsidy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. If a school declines to such an extent that it no longer justifies its existence, it has to close down. This is a natural phenomenon. It happens in any community. Now the hon. member should not try to impress us with the good results of certain schools mentioned by him. I admit that <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0467"/>the private school mentioned by him produced good results, but the hon. member should bear in mind that those good results were based on selected pupils. That school is not a public school in the sense in which a community school is a public school which can be attended by anybody who wants to attend school. At that school which the hon. member mentioned and which he praised so highly they select their pupils. They do not select the worst, of course, but in fact the best pupils, and consequently those results will also be better. It is not a good comparison which the hon. member made here. I do not want to mention the name of the school. It is not necessary. The school does its good work, and we appreciate that. But it should be realized that with selected pupils it is easy to produce good results in comparison with other schools which are public schools in the true sense of the word.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) succeeded in talking about Hammarsdale even on the Bantu Education Vote. Since January he has been talking about Hammarsdale on virtually every vote. I am sorry that no provision exists for changing the name of a constituency, because I think he could then be called the hon. member for Hammarsdale.</p>

<p>Yes, but better schools will then be established in the township. They will get better schools in the township. The hon. member also referred to the students at the university colleges who, as he put it, were unmatriculated. This is the kind of description the hon. member should refrain from. Those students are not unmatriculated; they do not have matriculation exemption, which is something else. But there are people who read these speeches and draw completely incorrect conclusions from them. In fact there are people who are fed on that kind of speech. Those persons who are admitted to the university colleges as students are students who do not have matriculation exemption to enable them to take degree courses. However, they can take other courses. They probably have the Standard 10 certificate. According to my information no students are admitted to the colleges without a Standard 10 certificate. The hon. member said they were unmatriculated. Students without exemption are admitted to our white universities as well. They do have a Standard 10 certificate, however, and they go there to take diploma courses. The hon. member should therefore not give representations of that kind in this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>First of all, I wish to take this opportunity of expressing appreciation from our side of the House for the long years of service given to his country by the Secretary for Justice, Mr. Greeff, who has had ten years&#x2019; service in this Department and is about to retire. We who have had to deal with him at different times have always found him conscientious and most obliging and approachable. We hope that he will have many years of enjoyable retirement after his long service. I also want to congratulate him on the report he has laid before us for the Department of Justice, and I especially want to mention that we appreciate it that we got it in time before the Justice Vote was discussed. Too often we find that we have to discuss a Vote without the latest report from the Department, and in some cases the reports are as much as two years in arrear.</p>

<p>This report makes interesting reading and I am very glad to note that the Secretary has gone to so much trouble to deal with the administrative problems of his Department and the shortage of properly trained staff. Regional magistrates are operating, as far as I know, efficiently and successfully. It was a new innovation when it was introduced, to give these senior magistrates work to relieve the Judges, and power to deal with crimes which are not considered to be quite so serious. I notice on page 2 of the report that he says that these magistrates receive special training before appointment. That I expected, but I see that they also have an initial trial period, and they are given training by experts who check their judgments regularly. I think this is a very good innovation, because we must realize that these regional magistrates have higher jurisdiction than the ordinary magistrates, and they are in a position to give heavier sentences, and although it may be said that the criminal who is dissatisfied with his sentence can always appeal to a higher court, it is nevertheless a very costly business to appeal. So it is to be appreciated that the Department is taking special steps to see that the regional magistrates know what they are doing and that they are receiving proper training.</p>

<p>But the report goes on to deal with prosecutors. The practice in the past was for prosecutors to tour the country with the regional magistrates. This has now been stopped and I approve because there is no doubt about it that there was a feeling among the accused, when they saw the prosecutor and the magistrate travelling around together, that the magistrate might be influenced by the prosecutor. Now I see this practice is not being continued and I welcome that innovation. What worries me is the remarks by the Secretary on the lack of properly trained prosecutors. This is a very serious matter. We come across it too often that prosecutors present the case for the State not knowing the proper procedure as to evidence and how to adduce the evidence. We have, of course, contended, and I think the Department is in agreement on this issue, that all prosecutors should be public servants and not members of the Police Force. It is most unsatisfactory to have the police investigating a case and then prosecuting as well. We have often raised that objection in this House before, and I hope it is the policy of the Department to appoint as many civil prosecutors as possible so as to relieve the police of the necessity of having to prosecute their own cases. But unless the prosecutor is trained, the system will not be as valuable as we thought it would be, because a prosecutor not only has a duty towards the State to present the case against the accused, but he also has a duty towards the accused, and that is to see that the Bench is placed in possession of all the facts which should influence the court, even if those facts are in favour of the accused. Too often we find that prosecutors really become persecutors and do not place all the available information before the court. It is essential that prosecutors should be trained not only in how to obtain a conviction but also to see that there is no miscarriage of justice, and I hope that in training the prosecutors special emphasis is laid on this duty towards the accused.</p>

<p>I notice that in the Estimates there is an increase of R20,000 in the fees paid to barristers. That is an increase of more than 25 per cent and I shall be glad if the Minister will tell us why this is so. Are the barristers being paid more, or are they being employed more often than in the past&#x003F; Is this amount for the employment of barristers in criminal prosecutions, or is it for civil work done on behalf of the Department&#x003F; It may be that it includes <i>pro deo</i> defences. I would like the Minister to tell us why there was this big increase.</p>

<p>Under the general remarks the Secretary had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government will have to realize that in order to maintain the administration of justice on a sound footing it will have to compete in the open market as far as remuneration is concerned for the services of persons with a legal training, even though this will make it necessary to differentiate between officers of this Department and those of other Government Departments. The danger signs of inability to handle the administration of justice properly owing to the dwindling number of qualified staff has become critical, and positive steps to curb this danger can be indicated.</block>

<p>The remarks I made in regard to the training of prosecutors can of course be applied also to the training of magistrates and their legal qualifications. It is essential that the men sitting <span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_0470"/>on the Bench are properly trained and have proper legal qualifications. These men, I submit, should be treated as professional men. This complaint about the difficulty of getting properly qualified personnel does not only apply to the Department of Justice in regard to getting legally trained men to sit on the Bench, but it also applies to the Master&#x2019;s Office and to the Deeds Office. There we have also suggested, and so has the Law Society, that senior officers should be treated on a professional basis, because if they are not they will be employed by professional firms who also find themselves short of properly trained personnel. In the provincial services they find, for instance, that they cannot get sufficient engineers, simply because these men, who are professional men, are put on the same footing as other members of the staff who are not professional men. If you want to attract professional men, they must be treated on a different basis from that of the ordinary public servant.</p>

<p>The report goes on to deal with some of the difficulties experienced by the Department and which makes for unhappy conditions of service. A lot of space is devoted to the lack of proper accommodation. Some other hon. members on this side will raise specific instances, but I think it is generally known that most of our offices are very old and not up to modern standards, and unless the staff are working in comfortable conditions they cannot give their best service. Another important point raised by the Secretary is the question of housing. The staff of necessity are transferred from place to place and they often find, especially now with the housing shortage, that it is impossible for them to get suitable houses. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Transkei, who opened the debate on behalf of that side of the House, did not advance many contentious arguments. On behalf of this side of the House I want to associate myself with what he said about the Secretary for Justice. We always found him a most approachable, friendly and humble man and in particular a person who was most devoted to his duties. It was our experience that he listened most attentively and devoted his attention to any matter with which we approached him. We are actually sorry that he has now reached the stage where he has to retire from the Service. However, we on this side want to wish him all the best in the years ahead.</p>

<p>I also want to make some observations with reference to the annual report of the Department. In particular I want to congratulate the Department on the fact that it has now established a training section. There was a great need for this, as the report also indicates, and it is now beginning to meet the great demand for trained people which prevails in the Department. I also want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Transkei said when he stated that certain trained people in the Department were actually professional persons and that for remuneration purposes they should not be regarded as clerks or as part of the administrative staff. They are in actual fact professional officers. If we regard these persons as such and remunerate them accordingly we will perhaps also attract many more people to the Department, people who now go to the private sector.</p>

<p>It is true that it is difficult to get staff. We are also aware of the difficulties the Department has to cope with in that regard. We do not want to blame the Minister for that, because we cannot blame him. The manpower shortage is after all not restricted to this Department, but is being experienced throughout the country. We know that the accommodation problems have also contributed to the fact that people do not stay in the Department. We are aware of the difficulties in that connection, because we know that the State cannot increase its expenditure, on account of the inflationary conditions prevailing at present. I do think, however, that as soon as the persons in question are regarded and classified as professional persons, we shall eliminate one of the major reasons for resignations.</p>

<p>Because I do not know whether I will get another turn to speak in the course of this debate, I want to take this opportunity of raising a certain matter, and this relates to liquor distribution in South Africa. You may remember that some years ago we passed legislation in terms of which white liquor could be sold to the non-Whites of South Africa. This had many important advantages, but it now appears that some evils have arisen as a result of this position. We now have the state of affairs that non-Whites, particularly Bantu and particularly in our smaller towns, and also in our large cities, can come to the white areas to buy their white liquor. Instead of taking their purchases home, they consume the liquor in the town or the city, in backyards or wherever they may be, if inside facilities are not available to them. They consume the liquor there and consequently we have the unpleasant evil of non-Whites who are drunk in white residential areas and other white parts of our cities and towns. We also find that on Saturdays the Bantu actually crowd the Whites in our smaller towns while buying this kind of liquor in the white areas. This is a very great evil.</p>

<p>Then another evil has arisen. We find that new holders of off-sales licences establish their off-sales at strategic points, i.e. near stations, where people have to be transported, or near a Bantu residential area or industrial area, because such places offer them a good market for their liquor. We know that if certain hotels are re-classified they are granted off-sales facilities which need not necessarily be on the hotel premises. These facilities serve as an incentive for obtaining higher classification. As a result there is such a strong flow of Bantu to these places that a great deal of unpleasantness is caused. Great unpleasantness is caused for the white inhabitants of that town. <span class="col_6419-6420" refersTo="page_0471"/>In this regard I also want to mention that the practice of delivering white liquor for Bantu is giving rise to a large number of evils and provides strong encouragement to the so-called &#x201C;shebeen queens&#x201D;. I have information which I obtained as a member of the re-settlement board and which indicates that on the Rand there are certain concerns which have a turnover of R80,000 to R100,000 a month from off-sales deliveries. From this one may deduce the scope of the evil that arises from it. These people concentrate. purely on selling this kind of liquor to non-Whites. I therefore want to ask that the Department and the Government should consider whether Whites should not get their liquor in the white areas while the non-Whites should get their liquor in the non-white part of the city, in their residential areas. In this way many of these evils can be stopped. We know that 80 per cent of the profits which are made on liquor sold to Bantu in the Bantu residential areas is re-invested in the development of the Bantu areas. But of the profits which are made by people who sell liquor outside the Bantu townships&#x2014;and they make tremendous profits &#x2014;not a cent goes to the Bantu. The Bantu population see nothing of that. I think the interests of our large Bantu population should be much more important to us than the profit a few liquor licences can make from the liquor trade.</p>

<p>I am bringing this matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister and I merely ask that it should enjoy attention by way of an inquiry in the near future. I think this evil is assuming dangerous proportions and is giving rise to great abuse.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was dealing with some of the difficulties encountered in obtaining satisfactory staff. In that connection too I want to say that it seems a pity that when we are so short of fully qualified staff they should have to take on so many other administrative duties which are not related to their legal training at all. The Secretary in his report states that the administrative work has multiplied because of the drought. What is the position of the magistrates in the smaller towns&#x003F; They find that they are confessor and adviser to the farmers; they act for the Land Bank; they give farmers assistance; they act as labour bureaux in getting Bantu labour for the farmers; they act as welfare officers; paupers have to come to them for rations; the district surgeons fall under them and they have to send them out in certain cases; pension applications go through them; all old-age pensions and other disability grants that are applied for go through them. In addition we find that they are chairmen of or act on hospital and school boards. They also sit on divisional councils in the Cape. I say that we expect far too much from our magistrates, who are legally trained men and should not have to spend their time doing all these extraneous duties. They also have to deal with social welfare cases. We find that mental cases are brought to the magistrate too, and often he is stuck because he does not know what to do with them. The police do not want them in their cells and there is no hospital to which they can be sent. While I am talking about mental cases, I should like to say that I was very upset to read this report in the <i>Argus</i> on the 29th April, of an address given by Mr. L. C. F. Swanepoel, a crime psychologist at the University of South Africa. He dealt with mental cases. What upset him most was that these people are often released from gaol before they are properly cured. He puts it down to the fact that we are not properly trained to deal with these cases. He says:</p>

<block name="quote">The shortage of clinical psychologists made it impossible for much research work to be done in this line. In 1957 there was only one hospital where clinical psychologists could be trained and now there were only three such institutions where only eight clinical psychologists graduated a year.</block>

<p>The report continues as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">In this area of research the outside world was far ahead of South Africa. The only answer to the problem was early diagnosis and if a clinical psychologist could undertake research or investigations at primary schools, many serious crimes and disrupted lives could be prevented.</block>

<p>The Minister might say to me that this is a question for the Minister of Health to deal with, but he as Minister of Justice is vitally concerned in what happens to these mental cases once they are convicted of committing a crime. I would like to know from him what his Department is doing about it. Are they acting with the Department of Health&#x003F; Are they taking any steps&#x003F; Are they trying to solve this problem at all, or are they just letting it drift and expecting the Minister of Health to deal with the matter&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then I want to say a few words about prisons. First of all I want to thank the Department of Prisons for having made the trip to Robben Island possible. We were shown over the whole island and through the prison. We could see what we like. We certainly appreciated the opportunity. I am not going to deal with the conditions at the gaol just yet. I shall deal with it later. What I want to mention now is a most serious position in regard to gaols throughout the country. That is in regard to the number of escapes. I see that up to March this year there were 40 escapes from gaols. In the 12 months before that there were more than 160 reported cases. These prisoners escaped from our security gaols, not from Robben Island, but from Pretoria Central and practically any other gaol in the country. The fact is that the people who escape are usually long-term prisoners. They are usually desperate men. The result is that when they do get out, they do not really care so much what their future prospects are and <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0472"/>what their punishment is likely to be. They know that if they are caught again they will be severely dealt with. We find that they are usually dangerous criminals. The country is warned. It is not a very pleasant thought to know, when you are living in the country districts, that a dangerous criminal is wandering around. We raised this question once before in the House. We dealt with it from the police point of view then. I think it is a shocking thing that the Police, who have spent so much of their time tracking down the criminals, once they have caught them and had them convicted, have to go and find them again to put them back in gaol. It is waste of time. We are not so overstaffed in our Police Force that we can afford to have them running around looking for criminals whom they have already caught once before. I want to know whether the Minister can give us a statement on this question of escapes from gaol, because it must be giving him and his department some concern. It is no good telling us that it happens in other countries as well. We know it happens in other countries as well, but I say it is far too prevalent here at the moment.</p>

<p>When the Minister took over as Minister of Justice, he was saddled with one of the most onerous and unpleasant tasks, namely to deal with bannings. Powers have been given to him by this Parliament to ban. From what I can recollect, he said that he was going into this whole question of banning. Nobody will say that they welcome the provisions relating to banning. It is a source of criticism not only from the outside world but also in this country. Any lawyer looks askance at provisions of this nature. Anybody who is trained in the law feels that it is wrong. I should like to know from the Minister what he has done, or if he has given any thought to this question, what the procedure is to be and if he intends changing it in any way. When he took over the portfolio we understood that this was one of the matters he was going to deal with.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I associate myself with what the hon. member said, I first want to mention something in connection with the report of the Secretary for Justice. In the conclusion to his report I find a most significant sentence. This is that the magistrate&#x2019;s office is a show-window of the Public Service. I think this is a noteworthy approach and an approach which merits special consideration. Like the hon. member for Heilbron, I also want to support the hon. member for Transkei with regard to the matter of a professional status for certain professional officers in the Master&#x2019;s Office, the Deeds Office, etc. Where the hon. member for Transkei mentioned, perhaps quite rightly, that the rural magistrate had too many duties to do justice to his legal duties, I want to ask a question in the light of the staff shortage: Who else is there in the rural areas who can perform those other duties&#x003F; He is, after all, the first citizen of that district, because the magistrate&#x2019;s office is the centre of the State, particularly in the rural districts. Who else can people turn to&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned our visit to Robben Island. On behalf of this side of the House I want to convey our sincere gratitude to the Minister for the opportunity which he afforded both sides of the House to visit that island and to see the institutions there. Before we visited the island we would have been impressed by a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 16th February. It appeared after the hon. member for Houghton had had the privilege, before us, of visiting the island. The prominent headline read: &#x201C;Robben Island grim place&#x201D;. [Interjections.] If the hon. member would give me a chance I would continue. I have only ten minutes. I do not intend wasting my time. It was a very pleasant surprise when we arrived there to see the place. We were impressed by the remarkably neat buildings and &#x003F;he cleanliness of all the institutions, and also by the facilities provided to the prisoners. I am thinking of sport and recreation. I am thinking of a library, a very well-equipped hospital, opportunities for study, a balanced diet, and work in the open air. That was the &#x201C;grim place&#x201D; referred to. Even the hon. member could not find that these people were being ill-treated. In a report she said in all fairness and quite rightly: &#x201C;There was no evidence that they were ill-treated or that they were in ill-health.&#x201D; We talked to the prisoners at considerable length on their treatment. We heard certain complaints from them, but do you know what the complaints were&#x003F; They related to the monotony of the food. They did not like this kind of food or that kind of food. Those are the typical complaints one hears from hostel boys outside Robben Island. There were no substantial complaints about their treatment. We should also bear in mind that these people are not guests of a five-star hotel. The people on Robben Island are pre-eminently some of the most dangerous members of our criminal population. If with reference to the visit I measure the institution by the minimum standards laid down by the U.N. Congress for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, I find that South Africa meets these minimum standards remarkably well. But, Sir, if you think my testimony is not enough, I may just point out that in March of this year a book appeared by a certain Dr. E. M. Rhoodie, who made a scientific survey of prison conditions in what he called the &#x201C;old countries of the British Commonwealth&#x201D;, namely Australia, New Zealand, Canada, England and South Africa, because he commenced this study before we became a Republic and completed it subsequently. This book, which has just appeared, gives us a most scientific survey of the prison systems of these five countries. Thus I find the following on page 20 of this book:</p>

<block name="quote">Penal systems of the Commonwealth: A criminological survey against the background <span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0473"/>of the cornerstone for a progressive correctional policy.</block>

<p>I think the hon. member for Houghton should like this, because it is a &#x201C;progressive correctional policy&#x201D;. On page 20 the author says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of all the Commonwealth countries, few have seen such a remarkable growth in the community&#x2019;s interest in crime and correction than the South African Republic. In the field of criminology, four of its fourteen universities have expanded their faculties of art to include a fully-fledged department of criminology, while in less than eight years a completely new character has been given to South Africa&#x2019;s activities in the field of the correction of offenders. To-day South Africa&#x2019;s model prison farms, its central reception centre with diagnostic unit, modern prison architecture and the increasing use of university students in the correctional service are serving as &#x201C;a model for the rest of the African Continent&#x201D;, a status conferred upon it by George Brouxham, Advocate-General of the former Belgian Congo.</block>

<p>This analytical survey was not made from afar. The writer visited this country personally and made his surveys <i>in loco.</i> With reference to this I want to refer you to some of the aspects mentioned by him in the comparative study he made. On page 122 he discusses the matter of opportunities for study afforded prisoners. Then we find this very striking conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From personal observation the observer believes that education in South African prisons is well-organized and sufficiently developed to meet the demands of basic institutional education, namely: The integration of classes with national education, so that the inmate can continue his studies upon release; provision for primary, secondary and higher education; adequate facilities and personnel who specialize in the educational field.</block>

<p>We now come to the question of staff training, and we get a remarkable testimonial from this scientific criminologist who has made a comparative study. I should like to mention this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has undoubtedly a more vigorous and constructive approach to the question of personnel than the other countries and appears to have a sound policy for implementing this ideal in practice. Its preservice training of custodial personnel has a scientific and professional basis. It has actively encouraged university graduates to join the Service and has materially assisted its own officers to obtain university degrees in criminology and penology.</block>

<p>He then continues and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the first United Nations Congress and the declaration of the American correctional association.</block>

<p>He then continues in this chapter and then deals with England first, and then says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Compared to South Africa and England. Canada and Australia have little reason for satisfaction.</block>

<p>As far as the question of labour and training of the prisoners themselves is concerned, we get another testimonial for what is happening in our prisons. On page 190 the writer of this work says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the important subject of vocational training, while the most comprehensive study of prison labour yet conducted by the United Nations emphasizes its vital role in the over-all correctional programme, the evidence is that this is imparted in proper degree only in Canada and South Africa.</block>

<p>A moment ago the hon. member for Transkei mentioned matters such as research. What do we find in South Africa as far as the question of research is concerned, in comparison with the other countries of the world&#x003F; On page 196 of this publication the writer says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as research is concerned, here again South Africa and England seem to have attempted considerably more than the other countries.</block>

<p>If we look at all these observations and findings by a scientific criminologist who carried out an investigation locally, we find a glowing testimonial for this Department. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer the hon. the Minister to the provisions of the General Law Amendment Act (Act No. 54 of 1949) in so far as it refers to the possession and the sale of dangerous weapons. Section 10 reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who sells any dangerous weapon shall be guilty of an offence, unless he is able to prove that he had good grounds for believing that the person purchasing it required it for a lawful purpose.</block>

<p>The same section further provides that it is an offence to be in possession of a dangerous weapon unless it is required for a lawful purpose. Dangerous weapons, as the Minister will know, are defined <i>inter alia</i> as daggers and knives, including pocket knives, the blades of which can be fixed when opened, and knives, including pocket knives, any blade of which exceeds 3&#x00BD; inches. Under the Customs and Excise Act of 1964 there is a provision that knives with cutting edges of four inches or more can only be imported into South Africa with the permission of the Commissioner. It is <span class="col_6425-6426" refersTo="page_0474"/>my submission that the law regarding the supply and possession of dangerous weapons, and in particular knives, is completely inadequate at the moment and is certainly not being properly enforced. I would like to ask the Minister how many convictions, for example, under these two quoted sections took place in 1966. I believe that lethal knives can in practice be bought anywhere at any time and by any one. If you will permit me, Mr. Chairman, I will show hon. members two exhibits from the Supreme Court, both of which were responsible for the loss of life of the victims. This is a dagger, easily obtainable at any shop, and this is a pocket knife, known as a three-star, which is a very popular exhibit in the Supreme Court! These are easily obtainable. They only cost about 30 or 40 cents. They come easily into the possession of criminals and the incidence of stabbing recently has increased out of all proportion in South Africa. In fact, I think it is fair to say that there is an epidemic of stabbing in South Africa. I have taken the trouble to get statistics from the local hospitals and these sort of figures of course do not only apply to the Peninsula. They apply to all the other towns in South Africa. Groote Schuur in 1963 had 3,473 assault cases. In 1966 that figure increased to 4,430. Karl Bremer Hospital in 1966 had 3,096. The Conradie Hospital had 3,685. According to Mr. Pansegrouw, who is the chairman of the Karl Bremer and the Conradie Hospital Boards, most of these cases were the victims of stabbing.</p>

<p>Dealing with stabbing cases themselves, where separate records are kept in hospitals, the Victoria Hospital at Wynberg had 7,250 assault cases in the last six months, 1,939 of which were stabbings. In the Somerset Hospital there were 734 assault cases in the last four months, 357 of which were stabbings. To conclude, the Rondebosch Cottage Hospital in 1966 had 2,014 stabbings. In other words, if one takes 50 per cent of the total number of assaults handled by these hospitals, it amounts to 12,000 stabbings in the Pensinsula alone, treated by those hospitals per year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Your arithmetic is probably better than mine; if you want it that way, then that is correct.</p>

<p>As to our hospitals, the side-effects of this epidemic of stabbing are very serious. There is already a shortage of staff. They are working longer hours, particularly over the weekends, than should be necessary. The victims are using beds which are required for other purposes, and there has been a vast increase in hospital fees in the Cape Province recently, which can be attributed to some extent to the treatment which has to be given to the victims of stabbings. Sir, it is having further side-effects. It throws extra work on the police and the courts; there are a multitude of files in the various magisterial offices and they simply cannot cope with the crime wave at the moment. In the Supreme Court judges are submerged with cases that require review; the prison population is increasing and the burden of it all is falling on the taxpayer of South Africa. Sir, there is a further side-effect on society as a whole, leaving aside the sentimental aspect as far as the victims&#x2019; families are concerned. There is the incapacity or the loss of the breadwinner, the adverse effect on industry and commerce as a result of an increased turnover of labour; there is a regime of fear in the townships, and an appalling example is being set to the Coloured youths in those townships. Sir, I know that the modern tendency is to try to find an excuse for wrongdoing, generally in sociological factors; I know that you can make out a case for saying that in some of the townships there are inadequate recreational facilities; that they are not properly supervised and that there are no liquor facilities in the townships. Liquor facilities, as the hon. member for Heilbron has said, are readily available in the cities to those who have to travel back long distances to their townships. There is also an absence of street lighting in many of them, and I suggest that these may be aggravating factors, but under no circumstances can they justify the use of the knife.</p>

<p>I would like to make some suggestions to the Minister for his consideration. First of all I would suggest that the carrying of a knife in a public place be created a special statutory offence. At the moment when someone who carries a knife is charged with assault, he is sentenced on the charge of assault and not separately on both counts. I would suggest that the sentences should be made consecutive and that would be the case if the carrying of a knife was made a separate statutory offence. I would suggest further that cases where people carry knives or supply knives unlawfully be referred to the Regional Courts which are able to impose stricter sentences and not to our ordinary magistrate&#x2019;s courts. There was a recent case in Durban where an Indian youth of 16 years of age took part in an assault with a knife as a result of which a man was killed, and he was given six strokes with a light cane. Furthermore I would suggest to the Minister that he could try the same experiment as was tried in the case of unlicensed arms and that he should call upon the public through large scale advertisements in the Press to hand in knives of a certain defined size and type. I am sure that he would get a welcome response, not only from a surprising number of those who carry knives, some of them for the purpose of self-defence, but also from other people who would inform on those people who carry knives. Fourthly I would suggest that he give consideration to the registration of dealers in knives and the creation of police reserves in the Coloured townships.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00c9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with what was said here by the hon. member <span class="col_6427-6428" refersTo="page_0475"/>for Heilbron in connection with the problems arising from the fact that non-Whites have their liquor facilities in white areas, but I want to raise the matter particularly from the point of view of the Coloureds here in the Western Province. For years we here in the Western Cape and in the Cape Province were accustomed to the fact that the Coloureds had their liquor facilities on the same basis as the Whites. For years the Coloured bought his liquor at the same bottle-store, at the same off-sales attached to hotels, as the Whites. In most places the residential areas were not yet separated in those days. Coloureds live in mixed residential areas all over the towns. Now that greater finality has been achieved in bringing about separate residential areas for the various races, particularly in the northern parts of the Peninsula, and now that each race is living in its own residential area, this state of affairs gives rise to many problems and many nuisances. This has had mainly two results. As yet there are just about no bottle-stores in the Coloured areas; the established bottle-stores are still in the white areas, where the Coloured then comes to buy his liquor, but he also buys his other commodities at the shops in the white areas, and naturally there cannot be many objections to that at this stage. This is a problem which will be ironed out gradually, as the Coloureds get their bottle-stores in their own areas. It is a problem which will solve itself in course of time, although I think that more should be done to encourage this process. The main problem is that the Coloureds not only buy their liquor in the white areas, but that they stand drinking it on street corners in the white areas. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to take very severe action against people who open bottles of wine in the streets and drink them, irrespective of whether they are White or Coloured. Such people should be severely punished. It is not only Coloureds who are guilty of this. There are many bad Whites who stand on street corners drinking bottles of wine with the Coloureds, from the same bottle, in sight of everybody. I think this is an evil which the hon. the Minister should combat. The other great problem is that Coloureds have on-consumption rights in white areas. Coloureds come from miles away in the Coloured residential area at 10 or 11 o&#x2019;clock at night, to the main street of a white town where no Coloureds live; they come to the hotel, and if they have had enough to drink, they molest people in the streets; they commit all kinds of crimes; they bother the people&#x2019;s domestic servants. The problem of theft and burglary in the white areas is largely due to this. Sir, the Coloureds did not have this privilege previously. There are, of course, still areas such as the central part of Cape Town where there are many Coloured residential areas in the white area, and in such cases it is not so easy to solve the problem, but then there are towns like Parow, Goodwood and Bellville where the Coloureds live in their own separate residential areas, and in those towns the Whites can see no reason why Coloureds should be allowed to come and drink their liquor in the white residential area at 10 o&#x2019;clock at night and paint the town red. Sir, I appreciate that this is a very difficult problem, but I want to make some recommendations for the consideration of the hon. the Minister. In the first place the question may be asked: Where should the Coloured have his on-consumption; why may he not drink after hours&#x003F; I would admit that it is very difficult to build hotels for the Coloureds in their own areas. There is simply not such a demand for hotels in Coloured areas, and an hotel is an expensive thing to build, but I want to ask whether we should not allow Whites temporarily to get liquor licences in Coloured areas where this is necessary, and then I also want to suggest that at the same time on-consumption facilities should be created for the Coloureds there by way of restaurants or something else. In other words, what I have in mind is that there should be a bottle-store where the Coloured can buy himself liquor and that just next-door, attached to the bottle-store, there should be some kind of restaurant where the Coloured may drink under supervision, because at this stage it is not practicable to build hotels everywhere. I am not suggesting that the Whites should be allowed to exploit the Coloureds, but at the moment there are not enough Coloureds who have the means and the opportunity to provide those facilities. I want to suggest that it should be done on a short-term basis by Whites, who should create these facilities in the Coloured areas, and after five or ten years such facilities should be transferred through the Coloured Development Corporation to the hands of qualified Coloureds. I do not think there is any justification for the fact that these Coloureds, who are not the best elements among the Coloureds&#x2014;the decent Coloureds buy their liquor and take it home, but these are usually the poorer type of Coloureds&#x2014; should go and drink in the hotels at night and then make trouble. As an interim measure I want to ask whether the Minister could not consider authorizing liquor licence boards to impose certain restrictions on liquor licences granted by them under these circumstances. For example, they may be authorized to grant a liquor licence in a place such as Parow on condition that the Coloured, because there are no other facilities for him, will have on-consumption rights for half an hour or an hour after the ordinary businesses have closed; in other words, if a Coloured works in a shop and wants to go and take a few drinks, he could do so for half an hour or for an hour afterwards and then return to his residential area. But it should not be possible for him to stay in the bar till midnight and then make whoopee in the streets. I think it will meet the problem in the meanwhile if the liquor licence boards have the right to grant certain licences subject to certain restrictions; and then, oi course, I want to plead that these facilities should be created in the Coloureds&#x2019; own areas, and that where hotels are too expensive other <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_0476"/>facilities, for example restaurant bars, should be created for them in order that they may drink there instead of in the white residential areas.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>First of all, I should like to say that I do not advocate in any shape or form, that the sale of liquor should constitute any form of separate development for Coloured people. Having said that, I also want to disagree violently with the hon. member for Parow, who advocates that white people should be permitted to run licensed premises in Coloured townships, even on the basis that at some time in the future, those businesses should be taken over by the Coloured Development Corporation. The white people cannot have it both ways. The Coloured people are being isolated more and more, in terms of Government policy, and they are being lodged in townships, but the facilities for Coloured persons in regard to the sale of liquor remain in the white areas. The hon. member referred to drunkenness on the streets. I think there is a law in existence, which can deal with that aspect of the problem, because any person consuming liquor in public on the street, is liable to prosecution. The point I wish to make is, that Coloured people seeking liquor licences have conditions placed upon them, which, once upon a time, used to mean that an individual applying for a licence had to get himself nine partners, making ten in all, and he himself could not control more than 40 per cent of the shares. That basis has now been altered, so that now he must get himself 19 partners and he can only control 20 per cent of the shares. The result is that the entrepreneur, the man with the brains and the ability to run a business, is unable to control the business he wishes to establish. I do not wish to criticize that arrangement at all, except to say, that the Prime Minister himself has referred, in his remarks at the recent opening of the meeting of the Council for Coloured Affairs, to the fact, that there are a large number of bar-cum-restaurants already established in Coloured areas, and in terms of Government policy there is nothing much wrong with that, but what do we find&#x003F; The position has now arisen, where liquor licensces in white areas, whose bars are far removed from the Coloured townships, are being urged&#x2014;and I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us on whose recommendation they are urged, to do what they have been doing&#x2014;to build suitable outlets on the roads leading to the Coloured townships. These people are setting up in business, either on the recommendation of the police, or of the Department of Justice. The Liquor Licensing Board has granted licences for bottle-stores long distances from the actual site of the existing licence, opposite Bantu bus-stops, and along the roads leading into Coloured townships. There are many examples of this. These people now complain, as Whites, that Coloured persons are getting the licences inside the Coloured townships. The other side of the coin is, that the Coloured persons in the townships are complaining, that these people on the perimeters, are getting the lion&#x2019;s share of all business that is offering, and that they really have no right to be there. What I would like the Minister to tell us to-day, is what the policy of the Government is. If we are going to have separate development in this aspect of our economic activities, in regard to Coloured persons, why do we not have it properly and fairly, without any strings attached&#x003F; There are places where Coloured bars constitute a nuisance. I agree entirely with the hon. member for Parow, that there is an element amongst the Coloured community, which drinks to excess, and make nuisances of themselves on leaving these Coloured bars in the white areas. But, I repeat, that the white people cannot have it both ways; you cannot have your cake and eat it. If the Coloured man is to be driven out of the white areas, he must have the exclusive right to trade. There are cases on record where white licensces are operating, not only on the perimeter of a white area, but also in buffer strips, pieces of land set aside by Community Development for the sale of liquor, and businesses have been set up. Dealing with the Bantu, where the off-sales licence is opposite a Bantu bus stop in a particular instance I have in mind, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is correct that these people pay normal taxes, whereas the local authorities operating inside the Bantu townships must pay 80 per cent of the proceeds of the sale of hard liquor into a special account for the benefit of distant Bantustans. So once again we come back to the point I want to make, that we cannot have it both ways. If white people do not want to have Coloureds trading with them, and living among them, and support a policy to have them excluded, then they must give up this side of their business. They must make sacrifices, and they must agree that the Coloured man must now be on his own and trade on his own in the Coloured townships. It is as simple as that. We have many Coloured persons applying for licences. They have great difficulty. Capital is not easily obtainable. There are bottle-stores in Coloured areas, in many cases run by Indians, who were classified as Malays, and as such they are treated as Coloureds. I feel that the opportunity is here for the Minister to make a statement in regard to his policy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to ask him whether or not consultations have taken place, and whether or not, it has been agreed between the Police, the Department of Justice and the Department of Community Development as to who should grant these off-sales licences in white areas convenient to the Bantu and Coloured customers, who are going back to their homes after work. The last point is this. I want to ask the Minister whether complaints were made to him about such licences, and whether such licences were objected to by local authorities or by the Coloured Affairs Department or other interested bodies; and if so, why in the face of those objections did <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0477"/>the Licensing Boards decide to grant the licences notwithstanding&#x003F; To summarize, I say that if Coloured people are to be isolated in townships by themselves, and left to run businesses, which will be financed by the C.D.C., then white persons cannot expect to trade with those same people under the conditions now obtaining, namely by shifting their licences from their present businesses to distant places. One case I have in mind&#x2014;and I think the Minister is familiar with it&#x2014;is where an off-sales licence was granted at least a mile away from the existing licence of an hotel. I should be very pleased to hear what the Minister&#x2019;s policy is in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#swiegers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. SWIEGERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to take this opportunity to address the hon. the Minister in connection with a matter which has already been raised by the hon. members for Heilbron and Parow. I want to pursue this matter somewhat further, and I want to confine myself specifically to the white residential areas. I want to ask the Minister that when an applicant qualifies for a hotel licence with off-sales facilities, such a licence should be granted only if the premises concerned are situated in a business centre. A liquor licence is a business in the true sense of the word, and in my opinion it belongs exclusively on premises inside a business centre. Such licences in the heart of white residential areas result in the congregation of non-Whites until late at night, and in most cases they are guilty of unruly behaviour to the disadvantage of the white land-owners and inhabitants in the vicinity of such premises. I would concede that this matter poses considerable problems, but I do want to ask the Minister to devote attention to the matter. The position of Whites in the vicinity of an hotel or a bottle store is sometimes indeed desperate. In most cases the licensce fails to maintain order. He cannot be blamed for that, however, because if he takes firm action he runs the risk of losing his customers, and the white inhabitants have to bear the brunt. In my view licences in white residential areas prejudice the education of our youth, who day by day have to face the behaviour and actions of people who have had too much to drink. The abuse of liquor is increasing among our white youth. It is an evil which should be combated at an early age. The properties of white owners in the immediate vicinity of such hotels or bottle stores are also prejudiced because their value is considerably less than that of premises which are not situated near an hotel or a bottle store. If such a licence exists or is granted in a white residential area the value of the adjacent properties decreases immediately. I admit that the Liquor Act provides explicitly that if a liquor licence is granted in respect of premises situated near a church or a school, business should be conducted in such a way that the activities of the church or the school are not prejudiced. I therefore want to ask the Minister whether these provisions of the Liquor Act cannot also be applied to white residential areas with a view to the protection of their inhabitants. I would admit that in rural areas it may perhaps be difficult to implement this provision, but I nevertheless think that in urban areas it can be fruitfully implemented.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which I should like to raise. I feel that I would be failing in my duty if I did not do so. On page 6 of his annual report the Secretary for Justice refers to office accommodation and the erection of new buildings. I do not want to dwell on this at great length. The Secretary is aware of the position in my constituency. I am convinced, if I may put it that way, that the comments in the annual report are actually also applicable to the magistrate&#x2019;s office in my constituency. I know there are problems in this regard. I know the Public Works Department is at present negotiating with the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure on the acquisition of certain premises. Nevertheless, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that conditions at the magistrate&#x2019;s office at Uitenhage are truly shocking, that Uitenhage should also enjoy priority in this respect.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister, and I do so as a former public prosecutor. I want to refer the Minister to the fact that in the rural areas and also in the urban complexes we find that the public prosecutor not only has to cope with his functions as public prosecutor, but is also burdened with additional duties. I would admit at once that this may be ascribed to the fact that there is a staff shortage. But we find that the public prosecutor is unable to do his work properly. He cannot fulfil his function properly. I have had personal experience of that. In the first place the prosecutor does not have time to devote the necessary attention to the police dossiers in preparation for a court action. I know of rural areas where the prosecutor is also clerk of the criminal court and clerk of the civil court; he may have to assist in the registration of births and deaths, and in many cases he is also the Secretary of the Liquor Licensing Board. If the prosecutor cannot do the necessary preparatory work for his case, matters are rather difficult in court. Sometimes the prosecutor does not get an opportunity to grant the necessary interviews to the police, investigating officers and to other witnesses. Yet the prosecutor has to bring the case before the court and he has to appear for the State. I therefore want to ask the Minister that where a public official acts as a State prosecutor, it should be endeavoured as far as possible to see to it that he does only legal work in order that he may do justice not only to the accused but also to the case of the State. One sometimes finds that an attorney comes to court in a case after having had two or three weeks to prepare himself. On the other hand the prosecutor walks into court that morning and because he has to perform all the additional administrative duties, he may possibly see the police dossier in court for the <span class="col_6433-6434" refersTo="page_0478"/>first time. He then has to scan the various statements quickly to determine what the State&#x2019;s case is.</p>

<p>Finally I want to ask the Minister that if it could be arranged that prosecutors have to perform only legal duties, a distinction should also be introduced in the salary structure. Hon. members who spoke before me also referred to that. There must be differentiation in the salary structures of the official who has already qualified in law and the officer who has not yet qualified. I think this will be an incentive to the clerks to qualify themselves in law as soon as possible. To me it was a great incentive. It will be an incentive to young clerks to qualify themselves in law as soon as possible in order, perhaps, to reach the top of the ladder in the Department of Justice.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself, first of all, with the remarks made by the hon. member for Transkei as far as the retirement of the Secretary for Justice is concerned. I personally have always had the most courteous and helpful treatment from him, and I wish him a very happy retirement.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to come to something a little more contentious. I want to deal with the whole question of the implementation of the 180-days law. Up to the end of 1966 the figures that I could obtain from the hon. the Minister reveal that something like 247 people had been held under section 215<i>bis</i> of the Criminal Procedure Act. I have not been able to get more recent figures. They have not yet been obtainable.</p>

<p>I said originally, when I opposed firstly the 90-days law and then its little sister&#x2014;or big sister&#x2014;the 180-days law, that by their very nature these are the types of laws that lend themselves to abuse. The reason is, of course, that they are subject to no public scrutiny, and that the implementation of laws like this is carried out without all the protection afforded by the courts of law, the ordinary safeguards that one can expect in the implementation of laws. I may say that the stage has been reached where in the implementation of the 180-days law it seems to me that the Special Branch is virtually a law unto itself, and it certainly seems to act without any regard to the other branches of the police and, on some occasions, has apparently even transcended prison authorities and prison regulations. I think that it is high time that the Minister stepped in and exercised his authority by a much more significant scrutiny of the way in which this law is being exercised. I want to give two ways in which I believe that the 180-days law is being abused.</p>

<p>In the first place there is the way in which it has been implemented. I may say at once that it is very different from the description which was given to this House when that law was passed by the then Minister of Justice when he described to us the very tender care which was going to be meted out to the people who were detained as witnesses under the 180-days law. I will give one or two quotations. According to Hansard, vol. 15, column 8105, he said on the 14th June, 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just imagine me detaining a witness and treating him badly.</block>

<p>On the 12th June he also said the following, according to Hansard, column 7978&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be extremely foolish to treat one&#x2019;s witnesses badly, it would be extremely foolish to keep their family away from them, unless there was a danger of intimidation or something of that kind. All things being equal, it is self-evident that under the circumstances we will treat these people well and make things easy for them, and that we will make them as happy as possible under the circumstances.</block>

<p>I may say that he was a bit evasive as to whether or not this law was going to be used for the purposes of interrogation, although the present Minister has been a little more positive in this respect because he has denied that this section is used in fact for the purpose of interrogation.</p>

<p>In dealing with that point he did say that there were a number of cases where persons, originally detained as witnesses, subsequently &#x201C;became tired of that and were prepared to talk, whereby they incriminated themselves&#x201D;. Well, I do not know how many cases there have been of persons who actually got tired of being detained and as a result made incriminating statements against themselves. I want to say this, however, that there have been several allegations of interrogation under duress and of ill treatment. Here I want to deal particularly with one specific case, namely the allegations made by the accused in the case of the <i>State</i> v. <i>Weinberg</i> on which the Chief Justice had some very trenchant things to say. According to the S.A. Law Reports, 1967, page 667 the Chief Justice stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the assumption that her uncontroverted evidence is, for present purposes at any rate, to be accepted, she was questioned by a team of six interrogators, in relays, in a small room, closely shuttered, for a period of three days and three nights without intermission, except for the occasions when she was allowed to leave the room for purposes of nature accompanied by a female attendant who was always present on duty. She was not allowed to sit on a chair or fall asleep. She had either to stand or to sit on the floor or on a radiator.</block>

<p>The Chief Justice went on to say that threats were uttered and added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although a witness so detained could no doubt be asked to make a statement, the purpose of the detention is not interrogation <span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_0479"/>in confinement. The declared purpose of such detention, as far as the witness is concerned, is to protect his evidence against the danger of tampering or intimidation, to prevent the witness from absconding, and in general to safeguard his interests. If the appellant&#x2019;s evidence is true, her custodians, in obvious violation of their plain duty under this section were themselves the intimidators and resorted to methods which were certainly not calculated to serve her interests.</block>

<p>Earlier in the session I put a question to the Minister about this case and he told me&#x2014;I think it was on the 10th March&#x2014;that he was still having the matter investigated. So, I hope this afternoon he will be able to give us a little more information about this particular case. There is also the case of the three Indians who were detained under the 180-day law on charges of suspected passport falsification. They were arrested in December and released in April. As far as I could gather all of them made statements to the Police either on arrest or within a very short period after their arrest. Yet they were detained until April. I want to know why it was necessary, after these people had made full statements and after two of them had actually agreed to become State witnesses, to detain them further. I should like to add that when their case finally came to court it was immediately dismissed by the court. But I cannot see any danger of persons like these absconding or being intimidated&#x2014;no more in any event than in any other case where witnesses are called upon later to give evidence. Furthermore, I cannot understand why these people were detained under the 180-day law at all. I should like the Minister to give us some information about the Weinberg case if he can. I want to state that there have been three cases where persons detained committed suicide within 2, 16 and 37 days, respectively, of their arrest. Serious doubt, I think, should be cast on the nature of the so-called protective custody of witnesses held under section 215<i>bis.</i></p>

<p>Another way in which I think this 180-day law is being abused is, to come back to the three Indian detainees and others, the fact that it is obvious, to me in any event, that people are being held under this section who were never intended to fall under the aegis of this section at all. Here I should like to remind hon. members that part II of the Criminal Procedure Act lists the offences in respect of which people may be detained under the 180-day provision. These are sedition, murder, arson, kidnapping, child stealing, certain offences promoting Communism, sabotage or conspiracy to commit any of the above, treason, robbery with aggravating circumstances and housebreaking with intent to commit an offence where aggravating circumstances are present. We have had cases of people detained under the 180-day law for alleged falsification of identity cards. I cannot by the wildest stretch of my imagination understand how falsifying identity cards falls under any of the offences I have just read out, not even under the very wide heading of offences promoting Communism. I might say that the implications of the alleged falsification of identity cards have not yet come up before a court. These detainees were released at the end of March after, in the words of the Attorney-General, they had made satisfactory statements and there was no longer any danger of their absconding. In December 1966 we had reports of the arrest and detention of Indians and Chinese and an undisclosed number of public servants in connection with charges of fraud and charges under the Immigration Act. These offences also are not listed under part II of the Act. I know it has been said that some of these cases are cases where persons were smuggled into the country, some of whom are alleged to be Red Chinese. But may I state that the Commissioner of Police is reported to have said&#x2014;in <i>Die Burger</i> of 12th December, 1966; the <i>Express</i> of 12th February, 1967, and the <i>Star</i> of the 8th February, 1967 that there was no political motive connected with the entry of illegal immigrants. But by no stretch of imagination can I see how these cases can be considered to have fallen under the aegis of section 215<i>bis.</i> Also the reported falsification of passports can hardly be regarded as cases of that nature.</p>

<p>And perhaps the hon. the Minister can tell me about the shooting of Sea Cottage, and how that case fell under the 180-day law&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Right at the outset I want to thank hon. members for the congratulations they conveyed to the retiring Secretary for Justice. As he will be retiring shortly, I should like to take this opportunity to give some particulars of his career. He was born in Jansenville in 1902 and was a schoolteacher in 1921-&#x2019;22 until he entered the Public Service in 1923 in the Department of Justice at Volksrust. Until 1948 he served in the following capacities: clerk, assistant-magistrate and magistrate in various places in the Republic and also on the relief staff. In the meantime he passed, through private study, the Public Service examination in Law and gained the B.A. LL.B. degree at the University of South Africa. In 1948 he became chief clerk, grade I, at the head office of the Department of Justice. From 1948 to 1952 he served as a public service inspector; from 1952 to 1955 as Secretary of the National Housing office; from 1955 to 1956 as Deputy Director of Public Works; and from 1st August, 1956, until the present as Secretary for Justice. On 1st August of this year, i.e. 1967, he will retire from the service. In terms of the Public Service Act he should have retired on 7th July, 1965, but because the Government deemed it to be in the public interest to retain him in service, his term of service was extended by two years. At his retirement he will have a term of service of 44 years and 29 days behind him.</p>

<p><span class="col_6437-6438" refersTo="page_0480"/>His term of service of 11 years as Secretary for Justice was certainly among the most difficult times experienced by the Department. In 1960 a state of emergency was proclaimed. From then on legislation was introduced virtually every year to cope with onslaughts on the security of the country. He was most intimately concerned with all these measures and their implementation, and his contributions were of inestimable value. During his term of office many of our laws were tightened up. Only recently we repealed a mass of old statutes in order to clear up the Statute Book. But great progress was also made on the administrative level during his term of office, as is clearly apparent from his recent annual report. He is well-known to both sides of the House for his friendliness and his readiness to be of assistance. We shall all miss him very much. The fact that in 1965 the Government deemed it to be in the public interest to extend his services by a further two years, bears clear testimony to the confidence reposed in him. I could add nothing to that. On behalf of the Government and of myself I want to thank Mr. Greeff for his years of service and I want to wish him a pleasant retirement.</p>

<p>While I am dealing with this, it is also a pleasure to announce that Mr. J. M. Oberholzer, until now Deputy Secretary of the Department, has been promoted to Secretary of the Department with effect from 1st August, 1967It is equally my pleasure to announce that Mr. F. J. le Roux, at present Chairman of the National Liquor Board and Under Secretary of the Department, is to be appointed to serve as Deputy Secretary in Mr. Oberholzer&#x2019;s stead. I expect great and good services from these two new officials.</p>

<p>To come back to the Vote and to the various matters which were raised, I want to refer in the first place to the matters mentioned by the hon. member for Transkei. He mentioned the necessity for properly trained public prosecutors. This is exclusively a question of how much work there is available for a prosecutor on a particular station, or of how much work is expected of him. This is partly also a reply to the hon. member for Uitenhage. One could appreciate that in the smaller places, in particular, there are very few prosecuting duties in the criminal courts. Consequently the services of a police officer are used in such places. If there is enough work, a full-time prosecutor is appointed immediately at a particular station. Even in cases where police officers are used, it is not unusual &#x2014;in fact, this is what happens daily&#x2014;that if a difficult case arises, the Attorney-General designates somebody to handle such a case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei also raised the question of outside barristers. He asked what the large increase in the expenditure on outside barristers was attributable to. I may just mention that it is attributable mainly to the prosecutions in the Parity case. There is another matter which ties up with the question of qualified officials. The Department experiences great difficulty in retaining its officials. In the past three years no fewer than 86 officials with an LL.B. degree left the Department. In the first two months of this year ten officials with an LL.B. degree resigned from the service of the Department. I am grateful to be able to say that following a resolution of the Cabinet approval was recently obtained from the Public Service Commission to pay higher salaries to senior councils and state attorneys in the professional section. It is my hope that this will have the desired effect.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to an amount of R20,000. This is the additional amount, and I have replied to this. The hon. member also referred to the work done for other departments. This is the case. Unfortunately the Department of Justice is burdened with all work which other departments are not prepared to undertake at this moment. Over and above the functions mentioned by that hon. member, I could mention several others. The hon. member may well appreciate that it is surely the position that every Department cannot always have an official in each centre. Sometimes there is so little work that the Department of Justice must necessarily be asked to lend a hand. The Secretary of the Department, in his report of last year, mentioned the possibility that legal duties would be separated from ordinary administrative duties. A matter of this nature demands very thorough consideration before it is undertaken, of course, for as hon. members will appreciate, separating legal duties altogether would mean the expansion of the regional court. In respect of the administrative work it will also virtually mean an extension of the regional concept. This matter is therefore still under discussion, and at this stage I cannot give a more conclusive reply to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of escapes from our prisons. At the outset I want to say that nobody is more concerned about the question of escapes from our prisons than I myself am in my capacity of Minister of Prisons. At the same time we should see these escapes in the proper perspective. As a result of our good communications system&#x2014;the various newspapers and the S.A.B.C.&#x2014;one is inclined to hear about the same escape when it takes place, and perhaps again when the person is recaptured, and then again when he appears in court, with the result that one eventually gets the impression that there are more escapes than there actually are. It so happens that the newspapers and the S.A.B.C. repeat reports on the same escapee on several occasions, so that the public eventually gets the impression that every single prisoner has escaped from the prisons. This is not the case. I just want to mention some interesting figures. The dangerous type of prisoner who was referred to and who escapes represents .009 per cent of all escapes. Most escapes take place from the work teams. You know that the work teams consist of A and <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_0481"/>B groups. One could almost say that they are the &#x201C;tame&#x201D; prisoners. Many of them are the kind of prisoners who bring the warder home at night, rather than the other way around. Most escapes, approximately 77 per cent of our escapes, take place from that group. I want to draw the conclusion that we should see our escapes in the proper perspective. Although one is most concerned about preventing their continuation, we should not lose our sense of proportion. I also just want to mention that we have made a survey to ascertain what the highest percentage of escapes was to have taken place at any time. It was found that the highest percentage that ever escaped was 3 out of every 10,000, if I have my mathematics right. I want to ask hon. members to see escapes from our prisons in the proper perspective. They should bear in mind that a great deal of publicity is given to escapes and that the dangerous type who escapes constitutes a very small percentage of the total.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the daily average during any period. We have in the vicinity of 75,000 prisoners, and the highest daily average in any period was .3 per cent. That is not per day or per year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei also raised the question of restrictions. As regards restrictions, I have in the recent past suspended a considerable number of the restrictions. In 18 cases the restrictions were suspended completely; in 11 cases the restrictions were suspended virtually completely, the only remaining restriction being that they may not attend gatherings. In other words, one may say that in 37 cases the restrictions were suspended virtually completely. Moreover, relaxation of restriction orders has been granted from time to time. The present number of restrictions is: Male, 256, and female, 26. No I have made a mistake; this is the number of detainees in terms of section 215, to which the hon. member for Houghton referred. Unfortunately I do not know how many restrictions there are at the moment. I think I have now disposed of the matters raised by the hon. member for Transkei.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Heilbron and Parow ventured into a very difficult field, a field which also causes me headaches. The hon. member for Heilbron pointed out that Bantu consumed liquor in the streets of small towns and that the same happened in the cities. Unfortunately this is not something which I can do anything about. There are already legal provisions which prohibit this. It is purely a matter for the police. The police must simply see to it that the streets are cleared up. In the second place the hon. member said that hotels which get off-sale facilities are inclined to establish their off-sale facilities near bus stops where Bantu get up and near industrial townships. There are such cases&#x2014;in this regard the hon. member for Karoo referred to the Crescent Hotel in Kimberley&#x2014;where certain hotels obtained off-sale facilities and established their bottle-stores near bus stops. The hon. member for Karoo quite rightly pointed out that in the case of the Crescent Hotel the local authority objected because it believed that the bottle-store would compete with its own liquor sales in the non-white residential area. The magistrate recommended it very strongly. The other objector was the owner of a bottle-store who had established his bottle-store in the same place, 100 to 150 yards away, even before the 1963 Act came into operation. In spite of this the chief magistrate of Kimberley felt that it would be in the best interests of the community as a whole if the licensce concerned were allowed to open his bottle-store in that place. As for industrial areas, this is not the case. The National Liquor Board and I myself adopt the attitude that where an application is made by an hotel with off-sale facilities to locate a bottle-store near an industrial area, it must simply be rejected. It is in fact possible that there are still such bottle-stores near industrial areas at present, but under the present dispensation and the present policy such applications are not granted.</p>

<p>As regards delivery in Bantu areas, this is a matter which is enjoying serious consideration. Without anticipating the Bill, I may say that in the Liquor Act, which is to be amended, provision may perhaps be made in this connection. The hon. member also made the point that each race should be able to enjoy its liquor facilities in its own residential area. It would of course be the ideal position if each race group could get its liquor in its own area, and could consume it there and nowhere else. Unfortunately the present practice is one which has developed through the years. In the Cape, in particular, where one deals with the Coloureds, white liquor distributors have through the years relied to a very large extent on the support of non-Whites. This ties up with the point made by the hon. member for Parow. One has the position at present that the Whites become dissatisfied if liquor is consumed in their area by non-Whites, particularly Coloureds who then become a nuisance to the Whites. I cannot subscribe to the idea that Whites should be allowed to open liquor premises inside Coloured areas.</p>

<p>It is the experience with matters of this kind that temporary measures become permanent measures. Once people have gained a vested interest, it is very difficult to deprive them of it later. I agree with the hon. member for Karoo that within Coloured areas Coloureds should be the distributors of liquor. In fact, the Department of Coloured Affairs subscribes to the same point of view. <span class="col_6441-6442" refersTo="page_0482"/>It has happened&#x2014;and the hon. member for Karoo referred to this, and I think he has Paarl in mind&#x2014;that upon application a certain bottle-store moved its on-consumption premises to a place near a Coloured area. But actually there is nothing extraordinary about this case, because at that stage there had been quite a few others. It was not an exceptional case. I may just add that the same applicant also applied to move his off-sales to those premises, but that this was not granted. What it all boils down to is that there is a conflict of interests. One should like to give the white community their dues, and also the Coloured community, and then unpleasantness arises and this is one of the problems that causes us headaches. It is not so easy to say when we shall manage to have it sorted out. I just want to express the hope, as regards the Coloureds, that the C.I.C. will enable Coloureds as soon as possible to open their own liquor distribution points inside the Coloured areas. It has been mentioned that previously there could be an association of ten and now it had to be 20. The fact of the matter is that licences which are obtained are so profitable that it was felt that it was too much for ten people, and that it could just as well be given to 20 people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown referred to the question of dangerous weapons. He apologized for being unable to be here when I reply. Nobody is more strongly aware than I myself of how dangerous these long knives and daggers are, and how easily people can be stabbed to death with them. I may testify that at every meeting of the Executive Council where we deal with capital cases, at least 50 per cent of these cases arise from stab wounds inflicted by non-Whites. This is indeed an evil, but the necessary legal provisions are already in existence, i.e. that it is illegal to be in the possession of such a knife or dagger. This is again merely a question of enforcing the Act. I think with these words I have replied to everybody except the hon. member for Houghton, and I should now like to deal with what she said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton asked me whether I could tell her any more about the Weinberg case. This morning I received the following information. When Weinberg was subpoenaed as a state witness in the Supreme Court during 1966 in the case of the <i>State</i> v. <i>Heymann and Dingaka,</i> she refused to be sworn in and to give evidence. This was followed by an inquiry in terms of section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and the State&#x2019;s refusal to make a statement made by Weinberg to the police available to her was also dealt with. The court then decided that for the purposes of the inquiry in terms of section 212 she had no claim to the statement. The advocate who acted for Weinberg for the purposes of the inquiry then called her as a witness in extenuation of the sentence. In her evidence in extenuation Weinberg then alleged that as a result of torture which continued for several days and nights she was forced to make the statement. After Weinberg had given her evidence she was sentenced to three months&#x2019; imprisonment in terms of section 212 (1). She then appealed to the Appeal Court and it was during that hearing that the statements were made by the Appeal Judge. The Appeal Judge said he wanted to instruct that the particular case be referred to the Attorney-General. It was referred to him and the Attorney-General investigated Weinberg&#x2019;s evidence and found that it was completely false. [Interjection.] The hon. member will pardon me if I do not give any more information than I have available. If the Attorney-General found that there was no truth in it, who am I to say that there is in fact truth in it&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member said, furthermore, that she felt that the 180-day provision was not always invoked for the purpose for which it was introduced. She referred in particular to the detentions which took place in connection with the passport case. In that respect I am informed that this passport case related mainly to Chinese persons from Red China. Statements were taken from 400 witnesses, and after statements had been taken from 400 witnesses, only 21 of them were detained. The large majority of the 400 were Chinese persons from Red China who entered South Africa illegally. It was only after a protracted inquiry that it could be determined how they had entered the country. It was found that the methods used to bring these Chinese persons into the country illegally were the same as those used by the communists to station their agents in foreign countries. In other words, our conclusion in that respect is that the detentions did in fact relate to communist activities. The Attorney-General of the Transvaal has pointed out that in most cases where witnesses are detained, there is a real risk that they may be intimidated into leaving the country. He says that it is easy to cross South Africa&#x2019;s borders unnoticed and that evidence will be lost in this way, of course, and for that reason he certified their detention. He also referred to the case of Singh, who was detained and whose wife asked for <i>habeas corpus,</i> in which case the court concurred with the Attorney-General that the detention was quite in order, and that this was one of the cases which came under the ambit of section 215<i>bis.</i> For the time being I think I have now replied to all questions.</p>

<p>It is a pity though that those facts which were stated so convincingly seem to have made no impression on the hon. member. But I do not want to allow this opportunity to pass without also <span class="col_6443-6444" refersTo="page_0483"/>conveying my good wishes to the retiring Secretary for Justice, Mr. Greeff. I knew him for many years. He occupied that position honourably for 11 years. I shall remember him as the person who, during his tenure of office, and because of his sympathetic approach to local problems, simultaneously promoted three additional magisterial districts in the Marico constituency, namely Koster, Swartruggens and Thabazimbi to full status. That was indeed an achievement and I want to pay tribute to-day to his share in that and thank him for it. I want to wish him and Mrs. Greeff a well-earned rest. Then I also want to refer to his instructive report. Apparently this will be his last report before he retires. It is a businesslike and instructive survey of the important activities for which his Department with all its officials is responsible. I think that the Secretary, as a responsible person, expects careful attention to be given to the few remarks which he has made in his Report. In his Report he referred to a few serious deficiencies which he was very concerned about. We find these in the section under the heading &#x201C;General Remarks&#x201D; at the end of the Report. I am of the opinion that these matters sought to be stated in this House for its information. It is one of the major deficiencies with which many other Departments are also having to cope, i.e. the problem of office accommodation. He states it so clearly and so well here that it cannot really be improved upon. On page 6 we find the following under the heading &#x201C;Office Accommodation&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the provision of buildings is concerned, therefore, the Department of Justice is affected in several ways, and to me this is a matter of deep concern &#x2026;</block>

<p>He has in mind here the officials working in the buildings who have to fulfil their duties there from morning to night. He is also concerned about their residential accommodation. That is why I think it is important for us to emphasize this here. The Report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in my humble opinion the Government should undoubtedly pay serious attention to this matter &#x2026; It is with regret, however, that I have to report that, in spite of every possible effort made by the Department to cope with the situation, the administration of justice in various centres is conducted under deplorable conditions &#x2026; Supreme court accommodation is not always satisfactory&#x2014;in fact, there are some centres where the accommodation is not only antiquated but completely inadequate and unsuitable &#x2026; The conditions under which judges often have to perform circuit court duties at magistrates&#x2019; courts are shocking. I wish to express my gratitude to the judges for the fact that they are still prepared to administer justice in these circumstances. I regret to state that at many magistrates&#x2019; offices the circumstances in which the citizen comes into contact with the Government are often appalling and disillusioning &#x2026; The magistrates&#x2019; office is a show window of the Public Service.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here the prestige of the State is at stake and I wish to make a plea for special provision for suitable accommodation of the Department&#x2019;s sub-offices.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize these statements. A comparison between the office accommodation in certain sectors of our public life, for example in the business world, in our industries and local authorities and much of the accommodation supplied by the Public Service, particularly in the rural areas, reveals that there are major differences. We find that office accommodation in other sectors is sometimes not only comfortable but is in fact also luxurious, well adapted and well finished off. Happily accommodated officials are the best workers one can ever hope to have. That is why I believe that the esteemed Secretary for Justice, who is a responsible person, made these remarks in the hope that heed would be paid to and cognizance taken of them. Ways and means must be considered and found to cope with this undesirable situation.</p>

<p>As far as residential accommodation is concerned, I just want to quote this sentence from the above-mentioned report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the prominent position of magistrates it is only reasonable to expect that houses which will enable them to uphold the dignity of their office be placed at their disposal.</block>

<p>Now I want to come to my own constituency. After glancing through the report it seems to me that the Secretary has paid personal visits to some of the magistrates&#x2019; offices in my constituency. I recently visited the magistrates&#x2019; office at Zeerust which needs a thorough cleaning, and I made the following remark to the assistant magistrate there: &#x201C;All one needs is for some moss to grow on the mouldy and flaking plasterwork in some offices and they will then serve as ancient subterranean dungeons.&#x201D; I also have here a statement concerning the accommodation at Groot Marico which supports the Secretary&#x2019;s statements. On 8th May the firm of attorneys. Van der Bergh &#x0026; Company, wrote to me as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is my opinion that the building in question is in a miserable condition and creates a very bad impression. The building is impractical and the magistrates&#x2019; quarters are very cramped. The police quarters are very dilapidated in appearance and create a bad impression. In general the floors are very poor, they are full of holes, worn through and cracked. The courtroom creates a very bad impression with, <i>inter alia,</i> a sagging <span class="col_6445-6446" refersTo="page_0484"/>ceiling and wooden partitions which do not provide proper separation between Whites and non-Whites. The records and exhibits room is not fireproof, as it ought to be. There are bats and mice in the roof, and there is no access to the roof so that one can get rid of them. In addition the roof leaks at various places and in various offices. As far as the courtroom is concerned, it certainly does not add lustre to the proceedings.</block>

<p>One finds it painful to have to sketch conditions like these. There are without doubt beautiful and functional magistrates&#x2019; buildings in our country. However, when we point to these unsatisfactory buildings we are merely advocating that these unsatisfactory conditions should receive attention. We feel that since our country is in any case enjoying a period of economic prosperity at present the State should definitely make larger amounts available to the Department of Public Works, etc., which is responsible for the renovation, cleaning and erection of buildings. There is room for improvement. The reputation of our administration of justice is at stake. The prestige of the State is at stake when we note the wonderful buildings which have gone up like mushrooms in the other sectors. The rest of the serving and working public everywhere is being comfortably accommodated &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will leave the hon. member for Marico amongst the bats in the belfry and I am sure that he will sort that one out with the hon. the Minister. I want to return to the remarks which the Minister made and to say that I agree with him when he said that some of the issues raised by hon. members are matters of a delicate and difficult nature which cannot be simply taken at their face value. I agree with him and I hope that he will stand by his policy of recognition of vested interests where those interests are serving a public need. I hope that he will not, as I think is tended to be done at times, regard liquor as though it were something different from normal trade. It is a business undertaking subject to normal economic laws. I get worried sometimes at the attitude which is taken up that, because liquor has special rules and regulations attached to it, it must be treated as quite different from any other trade. It would be ridiculous to say that this or that race group may only shop in this or that area. I hope that that approach will not dominate thinking in regard to the provision of what is and was described as such by, I think, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, as, in many cases, an agricultural product. The Minister inherited the administration of the Liquor Act which in 1963 took a major step forward in the amendments which were then introduced. These introduced a more enlightened approach, and I hope that that direction will be continued, rather than that there should be more restrictions. The approach should be towards more progress and more enlightened consideration of the problem. But that legislation in 1963 was experimental in certain respects, and by now, as must be realized is inevitable, a number of problems have developed.</p>

<p>I want to deal with what I regard as the major problem and that is the approaching deadline for the classification of hotels which now looms too close ahead for comfort. I appreciate the assurances that have been given that there will be no arbitrary action. I accept that. But the position is a serious one. The figures given by the hon. the Minister in reply to a question I asked in March indicate that of the 1,560 hotels in South Africa with liquor licences, 605 had applied for classification. 292 had been approved and 259 rejected. I understand that the latest figure is that 328 are classified or in the process of being classified. That is only approximately half of those which have applied; the other half have been rejected. It stands to reason that those who applied are those who considered that they had the best chance. That still leaves approximately 900 hotels which have not applied. It is quite clear that with an average time of five to six months for considering each application, and there are some cases where they have taken nine to ten months from the date of the lodging of the application and they have not yet received classification, under those circumstances it is going to be totally impossible to handle this problem before the end of next year. Reference has been made to the slowness with which applications are coming forth. The President of the Federated Hotel Association dealt with this matter a week ago. I should like to quote what he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Why so many should not have applied at this comparatively late stage, I cannot say, unless it is through sheer weight of despondency and the fixation that they will be unsuccessful.</block>

<p>That I believe is true. There is despondency and despair amongst a very large number of hoteliers who, having seen other hotels which have applied refused, have thrown up their hands in despair and said, &#x201C;What can I do&#x201D;&#x003F; The problem is largely a financial one. That was recognized initially. The Hotel Commission paid particular attention to that and in its report it referred to the extreme difficulty of hoteliers in obtaining finance at all, and to the high interest rates which they have to pay when they get it. It recommended that steps should be taken in that direction. In due course the Hotels Act was passed, money was voted by this House and it was believed to be for the purpose of assisting hotels to classify. Through the interpretation of that legislation the Hotel Board cannot help an hotel until it has already Spent the money necessary for classification. The average has been calculated to be in the region of R30,000 in most cases. That money is not easily found. It is not easily <span class="col_6447-6448" refersTo="page_0485"/>raised, and when it can be raised, it becomes a tremendous burden. I hope that the hon. the Minister of Justice will liaise with his colleague, the Minister of Tourism, to see whether something cannot be done to deal with this problem of the large number of people who simply cannot afford or cannot raise the money which is necessary to meet the standards laid down.</p>

<p>Only this afternoon I received an analysis done by the University of Pretoria, an interfirm comparative survey of the hotel industry, giving the total results of 160 hotels and motels. I do not have the time to go into the details but there is a complete cross-section of area, type, size, number of rooms, liquor and non-liquor. The average return on the owners&#x2019; assets invested is 7.35 per cent and the return on total assets 5.66 per cent. Some of these are classified. It is a cross-section of hotels all over South Africa of different types, tourist and residential hotels, large and small. [Interjection.] I understand that some of these were classified. If they can only make 5.6 per cent return on their capital investment and must now borrow money at 7 to 9 per cent interest, it becomes impossible for them. I believe that we are going to face a very serious position unless we can find a solution to this problem. I believe too that now that we have the Hotel Board we can eliminate some of the overlap and duplication of effort which takes place between the National Liquor Board, which controls the machinery for classification, and the Hotel Board. I believe that the Liquor Board should deal with normal liquor licences for off-sales, bottle stores, etc. The actual hotel part should be dealt with by the Hotel Board. If the Hotel Board registers an hotel, I believe that the National Liquor Board should then issue an hotel licence automatically so that one body deals with the grading, classification and inspection instead of the present system of multiple inspection by the National Liquor Board, by the local licensing board, by the Hotel Board and the local authority. We have now a Hotels Act. We have a Hotel Board, designed specifically for this problem with people serving on it who know the problem and have practical experience. I believe that that is the body which should take over the classification as well as the grading. I hope that the hon. the Minister will indicate that he too feels that this is the correct direction in which to move. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) raised certain matters here in regard to the classification of hotel premises to which I think a little more attention should be given. He referred in particular to the speech made recently by Mr. Lister and certain other matters which the people in the Hotel Industry felt concerned about. At the outset I want to say that certain of these vexatious matters which this hon. member has mentioned here year after year and which he has also mentioned under the Tourism Vote, are really rather unfounded, and people in the industry itself have on occasion repudiated what he has had to say in regard to certain aspects. By so doing I do not want to introduce an unsympathetic note into this debate, because all of us realize how much capital has been invested in this industry. All of us realize that it is a serious matter and that these are people with established interests, that they are people whose interests are being affected here. It is a matter with which one would like to deal sympathetically. Before I go any further I want to associate myself with the fine ideas expressed by the hon. the Minister in regard to the three officials in question, particularly in the case of Mr. Oberholzer, for it so happens that we come from the same part of the country.</p>

<p>As far as the liquor cases are concerned, there is a measure of concern that it will not be possible to deal with all the applications for classification in time. I think that this figure of 600 hotels which will not be able to acquire funds in order to make improvements, and the accusation that existing interests will be affected because the classifications are being delayed, and that the persons trade may be affected, should be seen in the correct perspective. In the first place, I would just like to refer the Committee to what these minimum requirements which have to be complied with before an hotel can receive an &#x201C;F&#x201D; classification, really are. An &#x201C;F&#x201D; classification entitles it, if the Minister should so decide, to two very important benefits. The one is off-sales on premises at any place within such a municipal area, as far as municipal hotels are concerned, and within the district in question as far as rural hotels are concerned. In the second place, a ladies&#x2019; bar may also, with the permission of the hon. the Minister, be allocated to such an hotel. This requirement is the minimum which can be expected from any business which merely wants to supply the public with a reasonable amenity. As far as the number of bedrooms is concerned, the minimum number in an urban area is ten bedrooms, and in a rural area five, and of that number only 25 per cent must have a bathroom, or 10 per cent must have bath rooms and 25 per cent of the rest of the bedrooms a shower. The other rooms are then normal bedrooms. What is also of importance, is the admission factor, for which provision is also being made in the regulations. It means that if the hon. the Minister is satisfied that the minimum requirements cannot be complied with owing to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant he can, within his discretion, make an additional concession to a maximum of 10 per cent. This requirement which is being laid down is in fact not an onerous one at all. As far as the other requirements are concerned, a telephone must be available on the premises only for outside calls. It is not even necessary to have telephones in the rooms. The ratio of bathrooms and lavatories to beds in the normal bedrooms is one to eight. Here too there is an admission <span class="col_6449-6450" refersTo="page_0486"/>factor which the hon. the Minister can consider. Only one diningroom is required. As far as the head chef, the head cook and the head waiter are concerned, it is required that one waiter should be in full-time employ. Floor service must be available for 16 hours a day for the serving of light refreshments. As far as the reception office service is concerned, the only requirement is that it should be possible to call a member of the staff to the office, counter or entrance by means of a bell. If it is a building with more than three storeys, only one lift is required. What is also of importance, is that all fittings, crockery, and everything used in the kitchen must be of good quality. That is really an absolute minimum. I do not want to waste the time of the House by furnishing the additional specifications which are given, such as the size of the rooms, etc. I am merely providing a general survey of the regulations. This is all that is necessary to comply with an &#x201C;F&#x201D; classification. If that is obtained, there are two other important assets which are allocated to such an hotel. There has not been a single case of a refusal to allocate this. I may just mention that I have been informed, and that it has also been my experience in respect of applicants who have already made application, that the National Board will in these cases tend to be in favour of the applicant, rather than against him. Every attempt is being made to supply these people with all the necessary information in order to make it as easy as possible for them to receive classification. I do not think that the main difficulty lies, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) said, in the fact that people are beginning to get discouraged because they cannot find the money and because such a great percentage of the applications are being refused. The question of refusal plays no very great part in this matter because the factors vary from one case to another. I shall come to the question of money later, but my submission is that this is not important either, as appears from an article in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 8th May, where a senior official mentioned that of the 300 hotels which had already been classified, only two had subsequently applied for monetary assistance. I take it therefore that it all depends on the facilities required by the Hotel Board. I think that the reason why only a small number of people have applied for classification is due to the fact that people have not in the first instance woken up yet. In the second instance they are people who really see their way strewn with non-existent difficulties. I really think that hotel licence holders see their way strewn with non-existent difficulties in respect of this classification. I would like to suggest that all these licence holders who are considering classification should in the first instance contact the police officer in that district, who is trained in that work. He must communicate with the chief of police, to whom this matter has been entrusted, for advice. I do not know who occupies that post at present. Formerly it was a Colonel De Witt. In addition they can communicate directly with Mr. Le Roux and the staff of the Central Liquor Board for advice. Then the people will find that it is actually much easier to obtain classification than they originally thought before they contacted those people.</p>

<p>In these cases of people who have not yet made application for classification they cannot afterwards say that there was insufficient time or that they had not been warned in time. They have five years to set their affairs in order. They are being warned repeatedly by leaders of their own Association. I am referring in this connection to a warning issued last year in August by Mr. J. J. Hoffman of the Congress of the Hotel Association of the Transvaal. He is the President of that Association. He issued a very clear warning there that licence holders must apply for classification as soon as possible. Subsequently, in April of this year, Mr. E. Mitchell, the Chairman of the Hotel Association of Natal South Coast, again pointed out to members in his area that they should apply for classification as soon as possible. If they thought that any concessions would be made apart from what the Prime Minister had said when he was Minister of Justice or apart from what the hon. the Minister is at present saying, or what was laid down by the regulations, then they were living, as he put it in his speech, in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. These people are continually being warned by Dr. Wiehahn, the chairman of the Hotel Board, and again at the recent congress they were warned by their own president, Mr. Lister, that they must set their affairs in order as soon as possible. It may well be that there will be cases, at the end of this period, where the circumstances are so exceptional that it may not be possible to apply these regulations to them at all.</p>

<p>Of the approximately 1,800 hotels which exist at present, there may perhaps be a few such hotels. I still think that these licence holders would be acting very sensibly if they tried instead, in terms of this, to get their affairs in order now. At this stage it cannot be expected that money be made available for the financing and subsidization of classification. There are so many benefits which arise from classification that I do not think that acquiring those funds will be a fundamental problem. To invest funds in such a matter is no bad investment. It will be possible to obtain off-sales and other benefits which are associated with the matter. I think that at this stage it is a lack of knowledge which causes these people to see their way strewn with difficulties. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree with the hon. member who has just spoken that in many cases people do not apply because they do not know or have not studied sufficiently the regulations and the laws affecting classification, but it is not as easy as the hon. member makes out. I have a case here where a hotelier applied. The Minister is aware <span class="col_6451-6452" refersTo="page_0487"/>of it. I do not want to deal with details. His application was rejected. He wrote and said: But I thought that I was in order. Please tell me where I have gone wrong. Please tell me where my premises do not qualify. The reply was in the first place that he could not have his plans back because they were part of the record. The letter stated further.</p>

<block name="quote">As regards the numerous respects with which your client&#x2019;s establishment does not comply, I wish to inform you that it is not the function of the National Liquor Board to point out to applicants in what respect their establishments do not comply.</block>

<p>The hon. member said that one can merely go and ask the Police, but the board itself refuses to give that information. The board refuses to say. The letter goes on to say that the hotelier must inspect his own premises. He had obviously done so when he made the application. He obviously thought that he complied. There is another case here, and I believe that these are things which should be ironed out. There is a case in Durban involving what I regard as one of the best hotels in Durban. It is certainly in the top category of hotels.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>No, it does not even have one star. The hotelier has been refused classification on five grounds. He did not have hot water in the men&#x2019;s toilets. He had hot water in the bedrooms but not in the public toilets. His mirrors were 5-f square feet instead of six square feet. He did not have a stool in the ladies&#x2019; toilets and his coat hooks were behind the bathroom door instead of the bedroom door. These are minor, piffling, ridiculous things on which to turn down a classification of one of the top hotels in the country. All that was necessary was for the inspector to say to the hotelier, &#x201C;Look, these things are wrong,&#x201D; and the hotelier could have fixed them up while the inspector was still inspecting. But the policy of the board is that even an inspector who goes to the hotel may not tell the hotelier what is wrong with his hotel. He is not allowed to say to the man, &#x201C;If you take that hook off that door and put it behind that door we will classify you; if you put a stool in here or a glass shelf in there you will comply&#x201D;. He is not allowed to tell the hotelier anything at all. [Interjections.] Sir, that is correct. The inspectors are not allowed to tell hoteliers, when they do the inspection for the purpose of classification, in what respects their hotels fall short of the requirements. This matter was raised only last week in my presence and the chairman of the National Liquor Board said that inspectors were not allowed to disclose that information. To my mind that is tying up the whole thing in red tape. I accept that the Chairman of the National Liquor Board is able and sincere. He is trying to do his best in coping with this tremendous task but he cannot handle every application. The Minister kindly arranged for him to call at various centres to interview people, and I heard afterwards that over 300 people were interviewed on that tour, people who had problems and who wanted to discuss them, and this is going to multiply. Incidentally, while I am on that subject I must say that I have had a number of complaints about the arrangements made, certainly in Cape flown, for these interviews. People were given a particular day for their interview but they were given no particular time and they had to wait until their turn came. They were treated courteously when they were interviewed. [Interjections.] Some of these people came in from the country and arrangements were made for them to be given an interview on a certain day but they were not given any definite time; they were told to wait until it was their turn to be interviewed. When their turn came, they were treated courteously and their problems were dealt with but I do feel that better arrangements could have been made to suit the convenience of people, particularly in the case of those who had to come in from outside areas. However, that is a minor matter. My main complaint is that for one person to try to handle every single application and for the inspectorate to be tied by red tape as they are, is tantamount to trying to create a public utility of the hotel service. Hotels are essentially things of a personal nature; their character is created by the personality of the owner or the manager. You have luxury hotels for tourists; you have businessmen&#x2019;s hotels serving the travelling businessmen; you have family hotels for holidaymakers; you have seaside hotels; you have hotels catering specially for fishermen and so on and so forth, each serving a purpose, and it is quite wrong to my mind to try to apply one rigid, irrevocable blueprint to everyone of these hotels. There was a case on the Natal South Coast of a fishermen&#x2019;s hotel where they have a wide verandah on the first floor where the fishermen keep their rods, but they have to go out of the verandah to the bathroom. The hotelier has now been told that that verandah must be glassed in. The local health people, on the other hand, say, &#x201C;No, if you glass in the verandah there will not be enough air&#x201D;. The National Liquor Board says, &#x201C;If you do not glass in the verandah then people have to walk out on to the cold verandah&#x201D;, and, Sir, this is Natal on the South Coast where everybody is looking for cool air. Apparently the National Liquor Board is afraid that people will catch a cold on the cold verandah. These are fishermen who are out fishing all day and night; they are wet all the time but they cannot walk along a verandah; it is an unbreakable rule of the Hotel Board and that hotel therefore cannot be classified. Sir, it is these things which I believe are wrong. I believe there should be much more flexibility in these matters. In some cases you find that hotels are disqualified because rooms are one foot below the <span class="col_6453-6454" refersTo="page_0488"/>tolerance. Sir, you have holiday resorts in the mountains where people do not want luxury hotels; the hotels there cater for a particular type of clientele, and I believe that to try to apply this rigid formula to every hotel is to treat them like a public utility. Hotels are not like buses or trains; people go there of their own free will. The hotel industry is a private industry run by private initiative and part of the charm of a hotel is its individual character. I hope that if the National Liquor Board is to continue with classifications, it will be given far more flexibility to deal with the special type of hotel.</p>

<p>Sir, just for the record I want to say that in an earlier debate I raised the question of a circular from the Minister&#x2019;s Department which I had received from an hotelier. What I said was correct; I had got it from a hotelier, but it is also correct that the original was addressed to an association. What was given to me was a letter to the association. I want to correct that for the record, but what I said at the time was correct, namely that I had received this from an individual. Sir, I have since received other circulars. I feel that this is a matter which requires reconsideration. It was raised at the conference of the Federated Hotel Association and a plea was made that the rigid restriction imposed by the Minister should not be imposed, that is to say, that a bilingual person must be on the premises for 24 hours a day to serve the public. That means that every hotel, if the owner does not live there, must employ a person 24 hours a day, on the premises, to give service in both languages. Sir, this is creating great difficulty and I believe it is unnecessary. The hotels are prepared to co-operate as much as they can, but if the hotels have to provide bilingual services, then it is only fair, when circulars are sent out by the National Liquor Board, that those circulars should also be in both languages. I have copies here of statements by the Minister; I have information here on licences granted and various other documents, all drawn up in one language only. Sir, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. What is good enough for the hotelier must also be good enough for the Government Department dealing with this matter. I should, however, prefer to accept the position as it is now handled by the National Liquor Board i.e. that you deal with a matter in either language and leave it to the choice of the person dealing with it to choose which.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will pardon me if I do not follow up on what he has said. He created the impression here that he had made or was busy making a thorough study of our hotel industry. Very well, we shall now leave him to the hon. the Minister. I am certain that the hon. the Minister will be able to furnish him with information in regard to the bottlenecks he mentioned here.</p>

<p>The matter which I am actually rising to talk about deals with one of the provisions of the Masters and Servants Act. I believe that hon. members on both sides of the House will agree with me that all of us in this House are contravening this particular provision, and for that reason I want to make a friendly appeal to hon. members on the opposite side to support me in my representations to the hon. the Minister. The Masters and Servants Act provides, as hon. members know, that the employer of a Bantu employee may not advance him more than R10. If he advances more than R10 then he has no protection in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act. If a Bantu employee enters into a contract with a white employer and the employer at various times lends him varying amounts of money, then the employer cannot institute criminal proceedings against him in order to recover those loans. I do not want to advocate here that the Act be amended; I know that that is not permissible. But I do want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider the desirability of effecting a change in this regard. I want to say at once&#x2014; and I am thinking here in particular of the hon. member for Houghton; I hope she will understand my plea&#x2014;that hon. members must not think that we want to oppress the Bantu. Hon. members themselves know that to-day R10 is not worth much.</p>

<p>If one of the members of a Bantu employee&#x2019;s family should die, then R10 is not even enough to cover the funeral expenses. I am not even talking about the price of a coffin now. What the Bantu usually do is to buy loose planks and then make the coffin themselves so that the relatives can be properly buried, and R10 is not even enough to buy the necessary planks. Sir, I am myself a farmer and I have a considerable number of Bantu in my employ. The security which a Bantu offers his employer is his labour. His master gives him a loan and his master gives him financial support in proportion to his value as a labourer. I think that we will all agree that the security which a Bantu labourer offers in the form of his labour is worth more than R10. If one advances one&#x2019;s Bantu labourer an amount in excess of R10, then one runs the risk of losing that money, because if one lays a charge against him with the police then they simply refuse to prosecute him. I think that all of us sitting here are contravening the Act every day as far as that specific provision is concerned. If one does not want to run the risk of losing one&#x2019;s money or if one wants to obey the Act, then one finds it simply impossible to help a Bantu employee who is in urgent need of money for some reason or other. It is in the interests of the Bantu himself that he should be able to receive a loan for a larger amount than R10 from his master, and I want to recommend to the hon. the Minister that the amount be increased to at least R50. That is all I have to say about this matter and I merely want to <span class="col_6455-6456" refersTo="page_0489"/>make an appeal to hon. members not to try to make political capital out of this matter; it is not necessary. We will accommodate the Bantu if we regard his credit as being in good standing and if it is possible for this amount to be increased considerably.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The fact of the matter is that with the help of the Bantu Commissioner you can advance him a much larger sum than R10. I have done so myself. A Bantu wanted to buy a wife and I took him to the Commissioner and I think I lent him R50. One enters into a contract before the Commissioner and in terms of that contract it is a completely valid loan. All that must be prevented&#x2014;this is what the Act is for&#x2014;is that Bantu should not be bound to employers with money. But if one goes to work in the right way then the Bantu may, with the permission of the Commissioner enter into a proper contract to borrow a larger amount of money.</p>

<p>I just want to rectify something I made a mistake with just now. I said that I did not know whether my figures were entirely correct. The number of escapes, the .3, is three out of a 1,000 and not three out of 10,000. The figure includes those who were not dangerous as well as those who were dangerous. 13.5 per cent of all the prisoners who escaped were dangerous. The .033 of the average daily detentions are the dangerous escapees. I am merely stating this for the record.</p>

<p>I am entering the debate at this stage in regard to the liquor matters which the hon. member for Durban (Point) touched upon. In the first place I want to congratulate the hon. member for Potchefstroom and thank him cordially for the way in which he replied to the hon. member for Durban (Point). The fact of the matter is, as the hon. member for Potchefstroom made clear, that to acquire an &#x201C;F&#x201D; qualification is very easy; in fact it is a trifle. [Interjection.] Half of them do not get it, not because they cannot acquire it, but because they do not know what the obligations are or what they have to do. I just want to mention how few these are and how paying a proposition it is. If an hotel such as the Pofadder Hotel, the smallest of hotels in the smallest of places, can qualify then surely most hotels can qualify. I do not know in whose constituency Pofadder falls, but that hotel has qualified. The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to the slow qualifications. That is so, because people are not applying quickly enough. They must realize that 31st December, 1968, is very close and that the period expires after that date. I do not want to say at this stage that on that date we will cut off all the hotels and that they will merely become malt and beer houses, but the fact of the matter is that the people will have to be classified and I have gone out of my way to ask the chairman and Colonel Prinsloo of the National Liquor Board to visit various centres. They have just undertaken this tour. They have submitted a long report which I do not want to burden the Committee with now, but the gist of it is that people do not know what is being expected of them. The regulations are clear but they do not take the necessary steps to acquaint themselves with what they have to do. They have informed me that as a result of this tour, which was not part of their task but which I specially asked them to undertake for the very purpose of facilitating the classification, at least 600 hotels will apply for classification next year. They received thanks and appreciation for the work which they did everywhere they went. There are extracts from letters which they received thanking them for their help. The hon. member said that the arrangements were not so wonderful, but I do not think he should have said that. These two gentlemen of the National Liquor Licensing Board sacrificed their lunch-hours.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. member should have mentioned that. He ought merely to have expressed his thanks for the arrangements which have been made and for the fact that people have gone out of their way to help hotel owners. Then the hon. member referred to the trifling grounds on which classifications are being refused. I think the case he referred to was an hotel in Durban. The last paragraph of the letter informing them that classification was being refused read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once the outstanding matters are put right, the matter will be considered further.</block>

<p>I have even had cases where I had upon the recommendation of the National Liquor Board, already given my permission for the classification only to be told that we would not issue the certificates until a few minor matters had ben rectified. That shows how it is being done. People are being accommodated in all spheres.</p>

<p><span class="col_6457-6458" refersTo="page_0490"/>The hon. member referred again to a case which he has already brought to my attention, a case where the National Liquor Board refused to tell an applicant precisely what was wrong with his hotel and why he had been unsuccessful in obtaining classification. We had inquiries made to see precisely what was wrong. I do not want to mention the hotel&#x2019;s name, I shall only say it was in Scottborough. There were no less than 36 deficiencies, such simple things as the following: The backyard is extremely untidy and dirty; the hotel needs to be painted and cleaned; the roofs of garages have rusted through and need to be replaced; Bantu servants quarters are in an extremely poor condition and have to be cleaned; there are inadquate seating facilities in the bar; the laundry is filthy and the electric wiring is dangerous; there is no soap or towels at the washhandbasin for the staff; there are no clothes hooks in the cloakrooms. Just imagine a cloakroom where you have to hang up your jacket, and there are no clothes hooks. Surely one would expect every hotel owner who applies for classification will be aware of these things.</p>

<p>He ought to know about them. Surely it is clearly stated in the regulations. In any case, in this way there were 36 deficiencies, and as the National Liquor Licensing Board rightly said, it is not their function to continue pointing out the faults. It is a statutory body which lends its approval according to regulations which have been clearly laid down for the applicants. Where they can be of assistance, they offer it, but one must not expect that an applicant in Scotborough can write to Pretoria and simply submit a plan, And, incidentally, the plan did not comply with the regulations because there were no measurements indicated on it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, let us be honest now. The difficulty is that many hotel owners are not taking the necessary trouble to establish what is being required of them for the purpose of classification. They sit down and write to the National Liquor Board and say that the Board must tell them what is wrong with the hotel. [Interjection.] All these things are contained in the regulations.</p>

<p>Reference has again been made to the statement which I issued and which appeared only in Afrikaans. In passing I can say the statement was given to SAPA. in Afrikaans and they said that they would translate it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that, but there have been others as well.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The National Liquor Board, out of the goodness of its heart, thought that it would do the hotel industry a favour by informing it immediately of the statement. I readily admit that they did so in Afrikaans and not in English, whereas they had received a letter from an English-speaking person. The correct thing would have been to have stated it in English, since the letter had been in English. Conversely, it would have been as easy for them to have written the letter in Afrikaans and then nobody would have had the least objection to that.</p>

<p>In regard to the application of bilingualism in the hotel industries, I can say that I regard the matter very seriously. I feel that any person in this country has the right to walk into an hotel and if he wants to speak Afrikaans there must at least be somebody who can see to his needs in Afrikaans, and the same applies to English. I am not the only one who thinks so. Here is an edition of <i>Wine, Spirit and Malt,</i> the publication of the liquor trade and there they state that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us say clearly that we are in full agreement with the view that every South African man or woman serving the public in one way or other type of business should be sufficiently bilingual to enable him or her to carry out their duties and work satisfactorily. Immigrants should be encouraged to become bilingual as soon as it is practicable for them to do so &#x2026; Looked at objectively, common courtesy and common business sense require that the customer who patronizes a liquor licensed establishment should be treated linguistically in the manner he prefers. The grant by the State to a person of a liquor license really leaves the licensce no alternative.</block>

<p>I think that is right. There are already hotels which have been classified and it has been incorporated in their conditions that their menus and wine lists, etc., have to be bilingual. This does not mean that the waiter should necessarily be able to speak Afrikaans or English, because in such a case one can merely point with one&#x2019;s finger and indicate what one wants. All that is being expected further is not that the receptionist or the telephonist must be conversant with both languages, but that there should at least be someone, one white person on the premises, who can help the public in either English or in Afrikaans. I think that is fair enough. I think I have dealt with the matters which the hon. member for Durban (Point) raised, except for one thing. He said that we must treat liquor as an ordinary product. I think he is on very dangerous ground there. If we were to treat it as an ordinary product, it means that we will have to lift all control, and then he must be free to sell it to whom he wants to and I do not believe Fedhaza will be satisfied with that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like, on behalf of the Coloured representatives, <span class="col_6459-6460" refersTo="page_0491"/>to join those hon. members who have paid tribute to Mr. Greeff, the retiring Secretary for Justice, and to express to him and to his family the hope that they will have many years of good health during his retirement. At the same time I would like to offer our congratulations to those who have received promotion.</p>

<p>I do not intend to pursue at great length the question of liquor licences, except to say that on page 9 of the report of the Department of Justice there appear certain figures in regard to applications by Coloureds. What concerns me, is the number of refusals. I cannot deal with 1966, because 39 of those cases are still under consideration, but in 1965 38 applications were refused. I have raised this merely to say that there are no doubt Coloured organizations who did apply for liquor licences, but apparently they have not been too successful. 38 out of 61 have been refused. I think about 22 were approved. Almost 33&#x00BD; per cent succeeded, but it does seem that far too many have been refused. Perhaps the Minister could give us some information. I do not want him to give me detailed reasons why the 38 were refused, because it will take too long, but perhaps he could tell me privately or I could get a letter from his department to justify this.</p>

<p>I am taking part in this debate to ask the hon. the Minister to train more Coloured people in his department. I understand&#x2014;I think my information is correct&#x2014;that a new court will be established in Athlone. and I think we are very grateful for that. But up to now it would appear that that court will be staffed with mostly White people, whereas I think that in a predominantly Coloured area such as Athlone the staff should be completely Coloured. The hon. the Minister may say that we do not have sufficient Coloured people, but I see nothing in this report which indicates that in regard to prosecutors, for instance, and that seems to be one of the departments where there is a shortage, Coloureds are being trained. I refer to the item on page 10, &#x201C;prosecutors&#x2019; courses&#x201D;. It does give the number of people who have attended to the courses. The humber of Justice officers is 27, and the total is 67. Then there are also figures as to the number of officers in the Departments of Bantu Administration and Development, Police, Prisons, etc. But there is nothing to indicate whether there are any Coloureds being trained for that particular part of the department. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to do what was done in the past. Perhaps it is being done, but there is nothing apparent from the report. What was done in the past, was that a police sergeant acted as prosecutor in many cases. Surely, there must be enough Coloured police sergeants in the Force with sufficient experience to be able to act as prosecutors in these cases. I particularly refer to the statement made by the Secretary for Justice on page 6, which has already been referred to, but I think it bears repetition:</p>

<block name="quote">The danger signs of inability to handle the administration of justice properly, owing to the dwindling numbers of legally qualified staff have become critical, and positive steps to curb this dangerous trend are indicated.</block>

<p>I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister. I have done it on all the Votes. The Coloured man is there to be trained and to be made use of. He is capable of filling these positions and if indeed the Government is sincere in its policy of separate development, I want to have positive evidence from every Minister and his department that the Coloured man is having the training which will eventually fit him for the position which he must occupy in his own area. I would therefore ask the Minister to do everything possible to see that the training of Coloureds takes place. As I say, there is nothing apparent in this report. I have not seen it. I hope the Minister will put me right.</p>

<p>But I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that there is a department where he can help the Coloureds. I refer to the State Attorney&#x2019;s division for which provision is made on page 288 of the Estimates. Here I would like to say that it seems to me that the State Attorney&#x2019;s department is growing incessantly. It has become a legal business. Does the hon. the Minister not think the time has arrived when he should give more State work to practising attorneys, to lessen staff and use them for other divisions&#x003F; The Minister has increased his staff by 8 personnel and 4 more State attorneys. What is the reason for the increase in this department of legal work which can be performed by legal firms outside the department&#x003F; If the Minister wants his one-third allowance, he can get it, as he always has. But I do say that the Government is taking the food out of the mouths of poor attorneys. I cannot see why this should happen. It does not apply to me any more, because I am not practising. But if I look at the hon. member for Transkei, he is starving. He is growing thinner all the time. The point I want to make &#x2014;here I might say that I am not quite aware of whether I am right or wrong&#x2014;is: Are these attorneys entitled to have articled clerks&#x003F; They are practising attorneys. Why can Coloured people not be articled, or are Coloured boys articled in this department&#x003F; If not, I think the time has come for the hon. the Minister to start articling them, to make them professional men for the positions which they must inevitably occupy in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy. The Minister is kind-hearted, and I am making this appeal to him. I sincerely trust that soon we will hear that a Coloured man is going to get these opportunities. That is all I am pleading for. One cannot bring forward reports year after year as the Secretary for Justice has done to say that there is a deficiency in the number of people <span class="col_6461-6462" refersTo="page_0492"/>that are required, when there is a large reservoir of Coloured youths capable of filling those positions. I do ask that they be trained. I do not think I need take the matter further. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Boland will pardon me if I do not follow up on what he said. I should like to bring a few minor matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The first is in connection with what the hon. member for Lichtenburg&#x2014;unfortunately he is not present in the House at the moment &#x2014;said in regard to the R20 which may be advanced to a Bantu and his request that it should now be increased to R50. As far as that matter is concerned, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister not to accede to the request. He has already replied to it and stated that one can apply to the Bantu Commissioner to have the advance increased to R50. But in many cases one is approached by a Bantu who asks you for a loan of as much as R100 so that he can pay for his wife. But when, after a few months, he realizes that he cannot pay back that R100, he makes his master angry and leaves, with the result that one loses all that money.</p>

<p>There is another matter in regard to the Verwoerd Dam which I would like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The position at the Verwoerd Dam is that there are no facilities there to enable the workers there to obtain liquor. All one has there is a motel, and this does not have an off-sales permit. The nearest hotel is the one at Norvals Pont, about seven to eight miles from the dam. Working at the Verwoerd Dam at present there are between 3000 ad 4,000 non-Whites and almost 1,000 Whites. All these workers must, if they want liquor, make their off-sales purchases at Norvals Pont. This causes a major traffic jam, particularly on Friday afternoons and Friday nights. Some Bantu go on foot and some travel by bicycle, while the Whites usually go in motor cars to buy their liquor for the weekend. And that is what they are going to buy&#x2014; we need not deny it. As a result of the heavy traffic on that road, approximately 10 people have already been killed. The bridge across the Orange River is a narrow one, and when a driver has had a few drinks he cannot perhaps see as straight as he ought to. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention to the provision of a bottle store at the Verwoerd Dam. Who must apply for that is in the hands of the Liquor Licensing Board. I know that there are certain conditions associated with a licence&#x2014;for example that there has to be a certain number of rooms at the off-sales, although this is not really necessary as far as accommodation is concerned, because there are more than enough houses there. What is in fact necessary there, is a bottle store so that the workers can get their liquor there.</p>

<p>Then there is the position at Petrusville which I should also like to bring to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention. A position similar to that at the Verwoerd Dam will later arise at the Van der Kloof Dam as well. But should we not plan for the future now and not wait until a large number of people have been concentrated there&#x003F; At the moment there are already approximately 1,000 non-Whites, and between 200 to 300 Whites. The number of cases arising out of contraventions at the Van der Kloof Dam is already far in excess than those at Philipstown. I think the Commissioner of Police will testify to that. I am not saying these things to the detriment of Philipstown &#x2014;not in the least. To-day Petrusville falls under Philipstown. If anybody is caught at Petrusville to-day he has to be taken to Philipstown by police van over a distance of 25 miles. That is why I am advocating that a proper prison, or lock-up, be provided at Petrusville because once the work at the Van den Kloof Dam is in full swing there will be several thousand non-Whites as well as a few thousand Whites there. Under the circumstances assault can be expected and that is why a proper lock-up or prison at Petrusville will be necessary. It will be impossible to take these people to Philipstown each time and there the facilities are in any case rather restricted. To-day the Philistown magistrate is serving Petrusville&#x2014;he goes to Petrusville once a week, or once every 14 days. This will also result in difficulties in practice because the number of cases which will have to be heard at Petrusville will greatly exceed those at Philipstown. That is why I say that we must plan now already for the future. We must at this stage already think of supplying Petrusville with a magistrate&#x2019;s office. I want to repeat that I am not, in addressing this request, trying to be prejudicial towards Philipstown. Nor is it necessary that it should suffer as a result. With the large number of expansions at the Van der Kloof Dam which are being envisaged the amount of business at Petrusville will increase a great deal. In addition there is the canal which has to be built for which thousands of workers will be necessary. We must plan ahead now for the ultimate provision of liquor at the Van der Kloof Dam as well. The nearest hotel is at Petrusville, approximately 7 miles from the Van der Kloof Dam, and we shall therefore have precisely the same difficulty there as we are at present experiencing at the Verwoerd Dam. I am addressing these few requests so that it will be possible for us to make arrangements in order to cope with any difficulties.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to raise a matter in which by virtue of my name I have as it were pride of interest&#x2014;firearms. Earlier in the session I asked the Minister: How many firearms were owned by civilians during each of the years from 1960 to 1966&#x003F; How many crimes of violence in which firearms were used were reported during these years&#x003F; How many accidents involving the use <span class="col_6463-6464" refersTo="page_0493"/>of firearms, excluding those in which the Police and military personnel were involved, were reported in those years&#x003F; The reply of the Minister was that in view of the volume of work involved to collect the particulars asked for, it was not practicable to furnish the information required. This is, I believe, not good enough. Steps must be taken immediately to discover what firearms are being held by the civilian population. We must do this for their own safety as well as for the safety of the State. If one looks at the annual report of the Commissioner of Police one sees that three policemen were killed in the course of duty in the year ending 1965 by criminals using firearms. It also indicates that thefts of firearms amounted to 1,500; illegal possession of firearms by non-Whites to 1,500; illegal supply of firearms to non-Whites to 46; and the pointing of firearms to nearly 1,000. The total number of offences amounted to nearly 5,000 for Tie year ending June, 1965.</p>

<p>The report also reveals that there were 63 cases of robbery in the Witwatersrand area alone, robberies in which firearms were used and in which a total sum of money of R159,000 was stolen. Nearly 2,800 firearms were reported stolen whilst 2,600 odd were recovered. The question, of course, is how many firearms were stolen but were not reported&#x003F; It is also interesting to note that within a two-year period in the rural areas of Natal no fewer than 1,584 firearms were confiscated from the Bantu. These particulars reveal a shocking situation and it will remain shocking until we decide to do something about it. The civilian population in South Africa is most probably the most heavily armed of all civilian populations. As a result crimes involving firearms are increasing in number and will continue to increase still further unless some restrictive measures are taken immediately. In the last amendment to the Firearms Act provision was made for a central registration bureau, but it is obvious from the replies to questions which I have asked of the Minister that this bureau is not yet in existence. It seems strange to me that the central registration bureau for motor vehicles is going ahead, but where the firearms central bureau has got to, nobody seems to know. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that a firearm is just as lethal a weapon as a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>Crimes involving the use of firearms will increase, they will continue to increase until the Government stops dilly-dallying about the question of registration of and strict control over firearms.</p>

<p>The central registration bureau must be staffed without delay, and I would suggest that all people possessing firearms be compelled to register them at a given date. Existing licences, if necessary, should be ignored, and because of the carelessness of people safeguarding these weapons they should be made to produce their firearms to a licensing officer, a police officer or a magistrate. It is my own feeling that they should produce these firearms over a period of one or two years, because it is no use somebody going along with a registration certificate to register a firearm which very likely he himself has not seen and he does not even know where it is. So I do believe that until we take some action to put this whole matter in its proper perspective, the loss of life caused by firearms, particularly in he hands of criminals, is going to continue. When one questions people who have firearms they quite often do not know where their arms are. They had not seen them for some time. They locked them away, and very often the weapons have been stolen already for some period. It is also a fact that a person obtaining a licence for a firearm to-day can keep that licence until his death. There is no check whether he in fact still has the firearm concerned.</p>

<p>I believe that the only way to overcome this &#x2014;and this is a very serious matter&#x2014;is for people who have firearms to report to and deliver their weapons at a central bureau. I think, too, that when a person applies for a firearm licence he should be examined by the police to see that he is competent to use that firearm. I think that at the moment it is far too easy to obtain a firearm. I know of many instances where members of the civilian population have firearms which they have never fired, and if they were to try to fire them there would be all sorts of accidents. We continually read in the papers of children finding firearms in drawers, in desks, and so on, and obviously people who treat firearms in that manner should have their licences withdrawn.</p>

<p>Therefore, in conclusion, I wish to appeal to the Minister in all sincerity, because not only are the lives of innocent people at stake in this matter, but also the lives of our policemen who so often come across criminals who have obtained these firearms.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in reply to the hon. member for Port Natal I should like to state that it is the intention to come forward with a totally new Arms and Ammunition Act at the very earliest possible opportunity. I agree with him that the only way in which proper control can be exercised is to have a total re-registration of firearms and then to compile a central register.</p>

<p>It is rather interesting to know that in Natal more firearms have been recovered than have been reported lost.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As a reply to the hon. member for Colesberg I want to inform him that a letter from my Department is on its way in connection with an application at Petrusville. The position a&#x2018; the Verwoerd Dam is briefly as follows. Recently a club licence was allocated there. That meets the requirements of the Whites. As far as off-sales are concerned where non-Whites can be served, it is unfortunately the case that one <span class="col_6465-6466" refersTo="page_0494"/>cannot grant a bottle store licence for the area. It is a rural area and no provision is made for a bottle store licence in such cases. In order to meet the requirements of the large number of Bantu to whom the hon. member referred the only solution appears to be for the compound manager to apply for a 100sex licence. This is similar to those issued to local authorities selling beer in locations.</p>

<p>As regards the question of Petrusville and Philipstown. and the possibility of a prison at the former, I just want to say that as circumstances change and as the needs arise attention will be given <i>&#x2018;o</i> this matter. In any case I will refer both matters which the hon. member mentioned, namely the question of a prison and court facilities at the two places, to my Department for the necessary inquiry.</p>

<p>I definitely think the Coloureds were very well treated as far as liquor facilities were concerned.</p>

<p>As regards the question of the training of Coloureds as attorneys, and in fact by the State Attorney, I want to say that the State Attorney has a list of probably a hundred names of people waiting for training. For that reason I do not believe that there will be an opening in the near future.</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. member correctly he said that the State Attorney should also brief Coloured attorneys. There is no objection to that, particularly if Coloureds are concerned in the case. There is no objection to that.</p>

<p>As regards facilities for Coloureds in the legal profession in the Department of Justice I want to say that on 1st July the new magistrate&#x2019;s courts at Athlone are being opened and we hope that there will be work facilities for Coloureds there. When I speak of work for young Coloured men and Coloured women then it will probably be mostly clerical work in the beginning. It will depend upon the Coloured man and his ability to qualify himself in the legal profession in order to act as prosecutor, or even later to handle cases himself. There is nothing to prevent this. To tell the truth, we are looking for those kind of people: we should very much like them to come forward. Up to now, however, we have not been able to find them. Provisionally there will be two magistrate&#x2019;s courts at Athlone. It appears that there will be work enough for three. Provisionally we are going to make a start with two courts. For the time being the staff will consist of Whites. At the very most we can make use of Coloured by perhaps using them as typists or ordinary clerks, in paying out maintenance, and that kind of work. Where it is possible to make use of their services, I want to give the hon. member the assurance that we will not hesitate to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am rising in order to bring two matters to the notice of the hon. the Minister. In the first place, I want to express my concern about the increasing number of accidents that are taking place involving fire-arms because imitation firearms are being sold as toys in the various shops and bazaars. We are aware of various cases in which people lost their lives when they mistook a genuine weapon for a toy. I am aware of a case in my own constituency where a person was injured to such an extent that he was declared permanently physically unfit for work and is now receiving a disability grant from the State. When this accident occurred he was 35 years of age. He has five children and to-day the State has to look after that person, purely as a result of negligence. I mention this in order to call attention to the negligent way in which fire-arms are handled, fire-arms which ought to have been locked away or stored in a safe place, but which the owners left lying around. I want to appeal very urgently to the hon. the Minister to investigate this matter thoroughly. These imitation fire-arms have been copied so realistically that one cannot distinguish between the genuine article and a toy. I am the last person who wants to spoil the fun of the boys; we know how fond boys are of playing with imitation fire-arms, but I want to ask that something should be done so that one may distinguish properly between an imitation firearm which serves as a toy, and a genuine fire-arm, which is a threat to human life.</p>

<p>The second matter I want to raise concerns the tariffs that are charged for convict labour. I want to refer more specifically to convict labour used on farms. Various tariffs are imposed in various areas. In the A areas the tariff is 50c a day per work unit where use is made of the services of a guard, and 35c a day per work unit where the services of a guard are not required. In the B areas the tariff is 45c per day, with a guard, and 30c a day per work unit without a guard. In the C areas&#x2014;and these are the areas which actually affect the smaller rural areas and the farms&#x2014;the tariffs have now been increased to 30c per day, with a guard, and 21c a day without a guard. The farmer employs this labour for a maximum period of approximately six hours a day. There are cases where farmers whose farms are situated more closely to prisons, may perhaps have convict labour at their disposal for more than six hours a <span class="col_6467-6468" refersTo="page_0495"/>day. I also want to call attention to the fact that at present convict labour is no longer cheap labour. We must take into account the fact that a prisoner is a person who was committed to prison because he had been convicted of a crime. I want to ask whether the hon. the Minister would be prepared to review these tariffs. There is a much higher tariff in the case of labour hired at farm prisons, where the farmers themselves erected the prison, because the capital outlay involved in the erection of the prison has to be redeemed. I also want to call attention to the fact that we find from time to time that certain people level accusations and reproaches at us&#x2014;and this is intended for overseas consumption&#x2014;to the effect that prisoners in South Africa are treated badly. As far as we know, the prison diet is a balanced one; they are accommodated there and when they go out to work on the farms, the farmers treat them very well. After all, the convict who is serving his sentence has to work; he cannot remain in his prison cell the whole time, and I am merely asking that these tariffs should be reviewed. Although the services of convicts are hired out to farmers, one nevertheless does not expect the State to make a profit out of them. We know that there are administrative costs as well, but I am asking the hon. the Minister to order a proper inquiry into these tariffs. On the other hand I also want to risk saying that we should not make the stay of convicts in our prisons so attractive that they become a refuge for people who do not want to work. These people are sent to prison to pay for a crime they committed. We know that cases occur where prisoners that are set free, are back in prison within a few days because they regard it as a convenient place to stay. I do not want to exaggerate on the other side, but we should, after all, not make luxury hotels out of our prisons either. We must make the prisoner realize that he is serving a sentence for a crime of which he has been convicted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for his courteous if not altogether satisfactory reply to me. I must say it is indeed a pleasant change to be able to raise matters here and to get a reasonably objective reply to one&#x2019;s complaints. I want to say only in reply to what he has told me about the Weinberg case, that there have, of course, been many other cases where witnesses have complained that they have been badly treated during their 180 day detention and that they have been subjected to standing interrogation and so on, and I sincerely hope that each one of these complaints is properly investigated, because that was not the purpose of the 180 day detention. I want to say too, in reply to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s answer, that people have been correctly held under this 180 day law that in the event, the charges which have arisen so far out of the cases of the Chinese and the Indians, have all been charges related solely to the offences of theft, falsification of passports and identity documents and none of these offences is listed under Section 215<i>(bis).</i> I want to mention too that the Indians that I mentioned originally were all held in solitary confinement or segregation and kept locked up for 23 out of 24 hours in the five or six weeks immediately following their detention. Things did improve after that, I must admit. I wish to place these facts on record.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the question of prisons which was raised earlier by other hon. members, and I want to say right away that the hon. the Minister and I have had a brisk exchange of correspondence over prisons since the beginning of this Session when I was allowed to go and visit Robben Island and I later on paid a visit to the Pretoria Local gaol. I am grateful for the permission granted to me, but I do want to say that I do not think that an M.P. should constantly have to ask for permission to visit prisons. I think M.P.s ought to be encouraged to visit gaols; I think it is a very good idea. In England, for instance, there are panels of prison visitors, consisting of people who are well-known in public life. They are allowed to visit prisons whenever they like; they do not have to get special permission on each occasion; they simply go along when they wish to do so and I think this is a very good idea. It does permit of some sort of contact with the prisoners and it makes them feel that the world has not entirely forgotten them. I also think that it is a good idea from the point of view of the prison system itself; it should be open to this sort of scrutiny.</p>

<p>As far as my visit to Robben Island is concerned, I want to say that of course I found it to be a grim prison. If the hon. member over there who spoke a little earlier thought that I was going to come back and say that this is a pleasure resort, a charming island overlooking mountain and sea, he is very much mistaken. Robben Island is a maximum security gaol and, of course, it is a grim place; it is not a seaside resort. To the best of my knowledge there was no ill-treatment <i>per se</i> of the prisoners there, although I found that there were certain complaints which I passed on to the Minister and which he has had investigated. I do not propose to go into those complaints now. But what I am interested in is the fact that there are no proper work facilities for long-term prisoners. There are prisoners who are there for life. This is a maximum security gaol. There are about 1,000 prisoners on Robben Island, and I think the State ought to set up proper workshops so that people can do some sort of constructive work on the island, other than the &#x201C;hard labour&#x201D; work which they do&#x2014;I use this term in inverted commas because it is no longer used in our courts, but in fact it is hard labour that they are performing, work in the slate quarries and work in the sand quarries and the collection of seaweed and so on. They work in the slate quarries and the sand quarries. <span class="col_6469-6470" refersTo="page_0496"/>The hon. member over there says, &#x201C;Hoor, hoor!&#x201D;, but surely in modern civilized countries this sort of work is not done for long periods by prisoners. I want to tell the hon. member that being sentenced to gaol for life is a very heavy sentence indeed and further punishment should not be imposed within the prison system itself because of the crime for which the person has been sent to gaol. I think it is very important that Robben Island should have proper work facilities established since this is going to be a prison which will have people there for a long time. I do not agree with the hon. member who said that the recreational facilities are adequate. I do not think they are, especially over the week-ends, but I know that a new recreation hall has been built and I hope that the long-term prisoners, the special prisoners whose crimes resulted in very long sentences, will also have access to it. I think, too, that for a modern gaol it is quite wrong that there are not proper facilities for hygiene and cleanliness such as the provision of hot water. I hope the Minister will look into it. This is not just another modern convenience, but a matter of hygiene.</p>

<p>As far as the other prisons are concerned, I want to say at once that there have been improvements. I have only had the opportunity since last year of visiting Robben Island and Pretoria Local, but certainly improvements are being introduced all the time, for which one is duly grateful. In Pretoria I understand that there will be facilities for other forms of work for the long-term prisoners there. I am glad to hear that, because just sewing mailbags and cleaning cells is not the type of work to give to the special type of prisoners accommodated there, as far as the Whites are concerned. Many of them are educated men who have committed crimes for which they are being punished, but they are nevertheless a rather special category of prisoners. I am also hoping that the Minister will think again about this question of allowing further study facilities. Most of these men are studying for degrees and some of them already have degrees, but they wish to do postgraduate study, and the prison regulations encourage further study. I hope the Minister will again give his attention to this, because there is no reason why, if one does a post-graduate degree, one needs closer contact with the people giving the instruction. It can be done by correspondence course, as is done by the University of South Africa. I do not think that particular reason is valid. I also think that the recreational facilities should be improved, because these men are going to be there for many years. Also, I do not know why they should be cut off from all contact from the outside world and why no newspapers are allowed and why they are not allowed to listen to news broadcasts. I am not asking for five-star hotel treatment, but ordinary prisoners who have committed rape and kidnapping and assault are entitled to these privileges, and while these men stay at Pretoria Local they should also get these privileges. The Minister could choose a newspaper of his own taste, even one supporting the Government, although I would not like the unfortunate prisoners to listen to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;! If ever there was a captive audience for this programme &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D;, it would be such a one. But I repeat, it is very bad to cut people off altogether from contact with the outside world. When they come out they have no knowledge of what has gone on in the world in the meantime, and they are supposed to be rehabilitated when they leave prison. They should be able to keep contact between the outside world and their relatives and themselves. I want to ask the Minister, too, to consider the question of re-grading again. I do not think this is going fast enough. I know the Prison Board constantly revises these cases, but it seems to take a very long time. We find that there are still three white prisoners in &#x201C;D&#x201D; Grade after a long time, according to the last answer the Minister gave me, and there are no white prisoners at all in the &#x201C;A&#x201D; Grade. Some of them have been in gaol for two or three years already, and I find it difficult to believe that not one of them is qualified for the &#x201C;A&#x201D; Grade. I believe that the prison authorities should not use the grading system as a sort of punishment within a punishment. The courts have laid down the severity of the sentence and I do not think that the grading should thereafter apply only with reference to the behaviour of the prisoner in gaol. I also want to ask the Minister to reconsider the question of remission of sentence for this particular group of prisoners. The answer he gave me when I discussed it with him originally was that the nature of the crimes was serious and in the interests of a deterrent and of security he did not consider that relaxation was justified. I just want to point out that there are other serious crimes as well, like rape, assault and robbery, and in those cases the prisoners are considered for remission. That is the general rule and I do not think it should be laid down that prisoners who have committed this type of crime should not be entitled to remission of sentence. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#swanepoel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. F. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to a point which I think should perhaps have been raised in this House a long time ago but which has been neglected. I should like to exchange a few thoughts on emergency planning.</p>

<p>If we assume that civil defence is probably the primary duty of the State and if we see what is being done, then it is shocking. In the past few days, when I felt that I should like to speak on this matter, I drove around a little and made a few telephone calls in order to find out what was happening in the city as regards emergency planning and civil defence. I shall return to that aspect, but before I do so I want to put it to you that at present civil defence is actually a factor which is being forced upon any state owing to modern warfare and these new trained saboteurs, those people who commit arson and sabotage. When <span class="col_6471-6472" refersTo="page_0497"/>it comes to sabotage, internal riots and arson, then the primary and most important factor that has to be considered is the fire brigade. If one sees what is being done under emergency planning and the part the fire brigade has to play in it, I want to say that the fire brigade is the primary and most important protective service, particularly if one looks at the purpose of the fire brigade. Its purpose is to fight fires, to rescue people and to salvage their goods. The fire brigade must be brought into such a matter, and that is why I want to make the plea that the Minister should integrate the fire brigade with emergency planning to the fullest extent. This emergency planning or civil defence will have to play the most important part in the event of rioting. For this reason I feel that we should exchange a few thoughts on this very important matter of civil defence and the fire brigade. To the best of my knowledge a committee was appointed by the Minister a year or so ago, a committee which consisted of a number of fire brigade chiefs and other public servants, who travelled all over the country at great expense, to make a survey of the fire potential in the country, and certain areas such as Durban, Cape Town, Johannesburg. Pretoria, etc., were described as &#x201C;target areas&#x201D;. These people returned and submitted to the Minister or to this emergency planning board a report in which certain proposals were put forward. The gist of this proposal was that every city council or local authority had to equip itself with the necessary fire-fighting equipment so as to enable them to undertake all the fire fighting in the event of such a state of emergency. But because the cost involved in this matter was so high, the matter simply rested there. Nobody could afford it and that was the end of it. Now we feel that, particularly with a view to civil defence, the State should play a much greater part in the event of a state of emergency, should it arise. In the past few days I have received information that the State is even prepared to purchase or to assist in purchasing machinery and equipment for these target areas by subsidizing such purchases. But I want to know in what respect it would be of any use to purchase such equipment. I also want to ask this question, namely whether the State is being served with the best advice in purchasing this equipment. Is use being made of the services of experts who are experienced in the field of fire-fighting&#x003F; I am merely asking these questions because this is of the utmost importance. Is the State satisfied that in purchasing this equipment, it is purchasing equipment that may yield the best results and that it will be possible to make the best use of that equipment for emergency planning and civil defence&#x003F; The answers to this can only be supplied by the experts in the fire brigade. In this regard my first request to the hon. the Minister is the following: I want to ask that on this board, namely the Emergency Planning Board, younger men should be appointed instead of the retired officials who serve on it at present. In particular I want to ask that a senior fire brigade officer should be appointed to that board. He must be a person who can serve this board with the best advice, particularly in these times in which the world is making such rapid progress. I understand that there is a possibility that large fire-fighting machines may be purchased. The whole trend in the world at present is to do away with these large machines. At present two-thirds of the Continent use small machines that are manned by four persons. It is a type of jeep with a very powerful pump as well as two hoses and a ladder. One can almost buy ten of these machines for the price of a large one. And because it has been found that four or even ten machines can fight fires at ten different points whereas one big, unwieldy machine can only do so at one point, there is already a tendency to put these smaller machines into service. But there is a second aspect. This Emergency Planning Board was appointed in Cape Town. What I have seen and been able to find, were the few pamphlets which were sent out and which contain instructions as to what one is to do in the event of an emergency or even in the event of a nuclear attack. I want to ask that this board, to which I hope the Minister will appoint a senior fire brigade official, will from time to time summon all the chiefs of stations in these target areas so that ideas may be correlated and there may be proper collaboration, also with a view to standardization. I may tell you that in the past few days I myself as well as others acting on my behalf telephoned various places. What resulted from those calls, was absolutely shocking. I can tell you that in this complex, namely the target area of the Cape Peninsula, there are only two stations that may be of assistance to each other. There is only one other station that can co-operate with the Cape Town station. That is the position because there is no standardizing of equipment. Now I ask that if this Emergency Planning Board, which has for a year been in a position to do something in this respect, could not even succeed in standardizing the equipment of three or four of these stations, has it not become time to appoint to that board people who must protect the interests of women and children and of you and me in the street. It is time we stopped appointing people to serve the country when they have become too old to operate their own stations, and started appointing young fire brigade engineers to serve the Minister with good advice. Secondly, Sir. What is the use of all this equipment being purchased and the <b>State spendin</b>g millions to purchase these machines, if there is not sufficient staff to man these machines&#x003F; But that brings me to a second aspect I want to mention. In view of the fact that these local fire brigade depots cannot train the necessary staff for the State, I want to plead very strongly to-day that the State should establish a training centre, a fire-brigade academy, where these firemen can be trained to man the machines the State now wants to purchase. I want to plead very strongly with the hon. the Minister for an academy or a <span class="col_6473-6474" refersTo="page_0498"/>training centre to be established. In other countries it is the primary duty of the State to train these people. Five years ago Italy had as many as 300,000 trained firemen. In West Germany every citizen must, when he receives his compulsory military training, also take a course in fire-fighting for a certain period. In England every citizen who is liable to military service must take this course as well. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kimberley (North) has raised an interesting matter, namely the planning for civil defence. I do not wish to take the matter very much further because it is no longer the responsibility of this hon. Minister. It is now the responsibility of the hon. the Minister of Defence. I do however wish to say this to him in fairness to his criticism. He has been criticizing the local committees in the Cape Peninsula as to what they might or should have done in the meantime, but I think he should also accept for his side of the House a little bit of the blame, because there has been a little dithering as to which Minister and which department should be responsible for it on the Government benches. The matter is now firmly, I believe, in the hands of the Minister of Defence and perhaps the commandos which are to be formed under the new Defence Act will do something about civil defence for the future years. But, Sir, there is one matter which does arise very seriously from the points that were raised by the hon. member for Kimberley (North) when he talked about fires and subversive activities, and that is a matter which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. What powers does he have to follow up and to ensure the prosecution of those who are guilty of subversive activities and in regard to saboteurs who might cross our borders into other countries&#x003F;I want to bring the hon. the Minister back to a question which was put to him by the hon. member for Transkei on the 25th April of this year. The hon. the Minister was asked then whether the constitutional change to a republic in 1961 affected the then existing extradition treaties, if so, how, and secondly, with which countries the Republic has extradition treaties. The Minister then evaded, if I may say so, giving a direct reply by saying that the question has so many facets and implications and that it could not be answered by a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; and that it was not in the public interest to make public the particulars of any further extradition treaties and that we could have a private approach to him to find out what the position was. Unfortunately the Minister is bound by the legislation of this country. In 1962 the Extradition Act was passed which was to give effect to all existing extradition agreements at the time of the adoption of the Republican form of constitution for this country. And I think the hon. the Minister should tell us whether we from our side have ratified those agreements again, or have said that we will stand by them, and whether all countries &#x00BD;with whom we did enter into extradition agreements are similarly standing by those agreements. Because this is very important to the maintenance of law and order in this country. We should be able to follow up and get back for trial persons who have made themselves guilty or liable to prosecution for subversive activities or sabotage in this country. We want to know where these people can be followed up and can be brought back for trial to this country. I hope the hon. the Minister would perhaps elaborate on that. The Act does make it compulsory upon him to publish in the <i>Gazette</i> any agreements that are concluded. We know of the agreements that have already been published. I certainly do not think that the House expects the hon. the Minister to be embarrassed by his being asked this information. I would not ask him with whom he is negotiating now because we know that when he has completed an agreement he will publish it in the <i>Gazette.</i> I do not want to know with whom he is negotiating. But I do want to know whether all the existing agreements of 1961 and which we confirmed in Parliament in 1962 are being recognized by both sides with a view to the safety of our own country and in dealing with our own criminals. There is another matter which I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister. I should like to ask him whether some consideration cannot be given to the legal disabilities under which minors, that is persons under 21 years of age, have to face certain aspects of life at the present time. We have gone a long way since the time when minority was fixed at under 21 years of age. To-day in this country we find youths in their seventeenth and even in their sixteenth year subject to military service&#x2014;as a matter of fact, many of them have already gone on active service at 17 years of age. We find that an 18 year old is entitled to drive a motor vehicle and can cast his vote. At 17 and 18 he is liable to pay his taxes under the P.A.Y.E. system if he earns sufficient. Yet the other day I saw an eminent surgeon having to use the services of his office to find a parent or guardian to give consent to an operation on a youth of 20 years and 9 months! It seems quite ridiculous that there is still this waste of time and energy in present day South Africa; it seems ridiculous that consent is still required to perform an operation on a person who is obliged to render military service and is entitled to vote. It is, of course, easy to say that the surgeon can do the operation if he regards it as necessary and if he is prepared to take the consequences. But why should he be expected to take the consequences when our approach to these matters is somewhat antiquated&#x003F; Furthermore, there are these difficulties in connection with opening a banking account. So many of our young people are earning and want to open their own little savings account. Yet they have to go along and get parental consent for this as for so many other things. There is also the difficulty of entering into a contract. Here again a person who for all intents and purposes is regarded <span class="col_6475-6476" refersTo="page_0499"/>as an adult when it comes to service to the State is required to get consent if he wants to enter into a contract with his fellow citizen. As regards marriage, I think perhaps they ought still to be protected against marriage and that we should retain the consent required by a minor to get married! But these are aspects which the Minister ought to investigate to see whether we have not reached the stage where these restrictions and disabilities should not be limited to those under the age of 18 years, for instance.</p>

<p>I shall not follow up the arguments of the hon. member for Green Point because the Minister is sure to reply to his questions in due course. I want to confine myself to a certain aspect raised by the hon. member for Heilbron this afternoon. His request was for liquor supply points to be provided in the respective areas of the various population groups. At the moment we find that Coloureds congregate at the liquor supply points in the White areas. There they have often caused disturbances and run amuck. I have sympathy with the request of the hon. member for Heilbron, because what often happens, particularly in rural towns, is that these facilities are abused by Coloureds. I nevertheless feel that we have to approach this matter with a great deal of care, because many people will be prejudiced by such a step&#x2014;particularly the holders of liquor licences in rural towns. There many of these businesses are old established family concerns which have been built up over the years and new ones which have been purchased on the assumption that they may also do business with non-Whites. At present their white clientele is decreasing in number as Whites move to the cities and their businesses are becoming dependent to an ever-increasing extent on their Coloured clientele. If we now proceed to provide liquor facilities for the Coloured, for example, in his own area, it will mean that these businesses will go down even more, even to the stage where they will have to close down not only to the owner&#x2019;s loss but also to the detriment of the rural community concerned. Rural towns need this type of business because they attract travellers and in general create some interest in the town. I agree with the hon. member for Heilbron that the present state of affairs creates problems, but in view of what I have said, we should rather try to reduce these problems to a minimum if we cannot eliminate them altogether. I too have experienced some of these problems in my constituency. I went to the police who took steps in this regard with the result that the position has improved. My representations are that we should not take away the rights of these rural liquor licensces summarily, because that will adversely affect not only them but also the rural community served by them.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The first question I should like to raise with the hon. the Minister is the application of the amendment to the Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Admission Act in 1964, an amendment which provided that the Minister of Justice would have the power to determine by regulation which types of work only attorneys may do. The hon. the Minister will be aware that the proposals, which seem to have been made to him by the Association of Law Societies, as to whether or not only attorneys, notaries and conveyancers should be allowed to administer estates has caused great public concern. The hon. the Minister has indicated that he was negotiating with other interested bodies, such as the banks, and that he would negotiate also with the accountants. What we should like to know is what stage these negotiations have already reached&#x003F; Has the Minister already seen all interested parties&#x003F; When does he expect these negotiations to be completed&#x003F; One appreciates that the Minister has indicated that he will not make any regulations operative until such time as he has published his proposals for general information. But we should like him to give us an idea of how far this matter has already progressed. It is a matter of great public interest and public importance. It is not a matter that one can usefully discuss until one knows exactly what the Minister&#x2019;s proposals are. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to report on this matter to us.</p>

<p>The report of the Secretary indicates, as the hon. member for Transkei has said, rather an alarming state of affairs in the administration of justice in this country, particularly as regards the shortage of prosecutors and staff in the Attorney-General&#x2019;s office. I think it is one which merits some immediate consideration. I appreciate that it is difficult to train people straight-away, but I want to ask the Minister whether he makes enough use of the Bar of South Africa, in other words, whether the Attorney-General briefs enough members of the Bar. Should he not in fact brief more members of the Bar&#x003F; One appreciates that this is going to cost a little more, because the costs of briefing barristers to prosecute in the supreme court is going to be considerably more than the salary which would be paid to one of the Attorney-General&#x2019;s professional assistants. But it is rather like what the provincial authorities are doing to-day. Very few of them construct roads with their own machines and personnel; they put them out for contract. They get the most skilled persons to do that job. It seems to me that, particularly in the field of justice, where we have a great reservoir of very highly skilled talent for that particular job, perhaps the time has come for more persons from the Bar to be briefed to prosecute.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this is touting for the profession generally. There have been pleas by members of the side-bar for them to be employed too. I feel that it is only fair that the Bar should likewise stake its claim! When one is dealing with the administration of justice, <span class="col_6477-6478" refersTo="page_0500"/>of course one cannot measure it in terms of money in any event. One should have these people, and at a much more realistic rate of remuneratation, if l may say so, than has hitherto been the case.</p>

<p>The next matter which I find in the Secretary&#x2019;s report relates to buildings. He says the following on page 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The importance of the administration or justice in an orderly community can hardly be over-emphasized. The liberty of the individual is constantly at stake, and the task of the courts must always be conducted in a serious and dignified manner. It is with regret, however, that I have to report that, in spite of every possible effort made by the Department to cope with the situation, the administration of justice in various centres is conducted under deplorable conditions.</block>

<p>I do not think that anyone who has been into the magistrates&#x2019; courts in Durban, for example, would disagree with this statement. The conditions there are deplorable. The conditions under which the magistrates have to move from their offices to the courts themselves are, to say the very least of it, undignified. I know that the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor had cause to make exactly the same comments as the Secretary for Justice has made. I appreciate that new buildings have to be built. I appreciate that Durban is one day going to get a new magistrate&#x2019;s court. But this has been going to happen for 15 years and more. Here is, I believe, an opportunity for the Department of Justice to get down to designing a court when that stage is reached. I do not think that I have yet seen a court which was designed by both the persons who use the court and by architects. One thing which I think that one must always remember in designing a court<b>,</b> when dealing with a court, is that the most important person there in that court, certainly in the criminal court, is the public. It is not the prisoner&#x2014;the most important person is the public. Justice must be seen to be done, as the Secretary has pointed out in his report so far as circuits are concerned. The public must have access. But more than that: We rely on the public for the prosecution of all our criminal cases. The witnesses are therefore the most important people in every trial. If we do not provide proper facilities for witnesses, then we are not setting about things in the correct way. I think that this should be the first consideration. The facilities for witnesses in the courts of Durban are absolutely shocking. It is quite disgraceful that even in the supreme court it is very difficult to find the toilet. It is an important thing for a witn<b>ess</b> who may have to stand around for a whole day waiting to be called. Quite apart from anything else, they have to sit around outside the court, in the open as a rule, on a bench under a verandah. There is no proper room for them, there are no proper facilities in that regard either. There is no place where they can go and wash their hands. It seems to me that in re-designing this court in Durban, perhaps consideration could be given to suggestions which I am sure will be forthcoming, if they were asked for, from the General Council of the Bar, from the side-bar, and from the Attorney-General&#x2019;s offices as far as the facilities which should be provided are concerned.</p>

<p>One of the most deplorable conditions existing in all our lower courts is that the magistrate is deposited somewhere or other where, whenever he moves around, he is in constant view of the public. We do not want that. I believe that he should be cut off completely; he should be given his own quarters from where he can come straight into court and return.</p>

<p>When justice must be seen to be done, another aspect of this which does not appeal to the public is that in the circumstances, because they are all thrown together, one finds that the public prosecutor in the lower courts is in constant conversation with and thrown together with the magistrate. That does not help the cause of justice. It does not help to find that the presiding judicial officer&#x2014;and I am not suggesting that he is affected by this&#x2014;is seen publicly, as he is, together with the prosecutor.

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, commencing with the hon. member for Wolmaransstad&#x2014;with reference to his representations in regard to prison labour&#x2014;I want to tell him that the tariffs for prison labour were determined in consultation with the Department of Labour. The idea is that prison labour, all things considered, also the fact that the prisoner is cared for, must have some relation to the general pattern of labour in the district. Therefore, however much one may want to accommodate the hon. member, one cannot really depart from that. This is also a question of approach. The approach of the hon. member is that here one has a prisoner who has to work for his keep. I want to tell you, Sir, that the new approach, and this is one which will be forced on us, is that the prisoner himself has to receive a portion of the income from his labour. This is the new international approach. All things considered, the fact remains that the labour tariff for prisoners in the Wolmaransstad district was determined in consultation with the local bureau.</p>

<p>Mention was made here of real pistols which had been mistaken for toy pistols, something which had led to accidents. I can tell the hon. member that I myself am very concerned about this matter. The other day I read in the newspaper of a four or five-year-old child who shot a little friend through the head with his father&#x2019;s revolver. Another young child killed his mother by firing a shot. We find such outrageous cases. I want to give the assurance that we shall take very strict action in the future. Where any negligence has been involved in cases of this nature, the licence of the licence-holder of the fire-arm concerned <span class="col_6479-6480" refersTo="page_0501"/>will be cancelled immediately. There is no legislation which prohibits the use of a toy pistol. I do not know of any legislation which prohibits that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton once more made her usual plea in connection with the various prisoners. She has brought that pertinently to my attention on so many occasions &#x2014;also in private&#x2014;that it is practically unnecessary for me to reply to her in that regard. I have already told her what we intend doing in Pretoria in connection with the prisoners who are in the Pretoria local prison at present. We hope to improve their facilities. Part of the prison is being fitted up to accommodate them as well&#x2014;although that is not specially being done for them alone&#x2014;and there they will have better working facilities. I must say, unfortunately, that they themselves are responsible to a large extent for being in the Pretoria local prison and not in the Central prison. Things happened there which compelled us to take them from the Central prison where they had all the privileges and to transfer them to the Pretoria local prison.</p>

<p>As regards the question of facilities for study, I want to say that we shall give further attention to the matter. When a post-graduate course is being followed, outgoing and incoming correspondence cause difficulties. Such correspondence has to be checked every time to see to it that something does not possibly slip out which may not slip out.</p>

<p>No, I have no proof of that, but that is why permission has not yet been granted in the past. As I have said, I am quite prepared to go into this matter once more.</p>

<p>As far as Robben Island and the working facilities there are concerned, I want to say that the position at the present moment is that so much building work has to be done on Robben Island that we have not yet been able to give large scale attention to workshops. As soon as the work which is still being done has been completed it will be possible to give attention to the facilities in the workshops there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (North) referred to emergency planning. I am very glad that he did so. In this connection I can hardly make promises, because the sub-department has already been transferred to the Minister of Defence. I nevertheless want to make a few general remarks. As regards emergency planning, we must not expect it has already been finalized at this stage. This is a new field we are entering. We had to conduct research first. We had to plan. Those steps have now been completed. The project is now coming into operation. We have now reached the stage where the system is coming into operation. It is precisely because we have reached this stage that we are accommodating local authorities to such an extent as far as fire brigade facilities are concerned. This year R460,000 will be spent to subsidize local authorities. These subsidies will vary from subsidies of 50 per cent to subsidies of 100 per cent so as to enable local authorities to streamline their fire brigade facilities for service in times of emergency. As far as purchases are concerned, I may just mention that in this connection the services of the South African Fire Brigade Institute will be employed in drawing up specifications. The Institute acts in conjunction with the C.S.I.R., which is also conducting research and is making certain suggestions. I do not believe that one can create better facilities for purchases. I do not want to make any promises. The hon. member spoke of older people whose services were still being employed. At this particular stage we do so as a result of the manpower shortage. As the hon. member knows, the new Act provides that the services of men in the Defence Force may be employed. I am thinking of training in particular.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point said there had been dilly-dallying in regard to civil defence. That is not the case. This is a new field we have entered and we should rather go too slowly and do the right thing than go too quickly, do things precipitately, and subsequently possibly do the wrong thing. He referred to the question which the hon. member for Transkei had asked in regard to extradition treaties and to which, to his mind, I had not given a satisfactory reply. I am afraid that the question was framed in such a manner that it made things somewhat difficult for me. I am, however, prepared to tell the hon. member exactly what the present position is. At the moment there are only three extradition treaties which were directly entered into by South Africa with other countries. They were entered into with the U.S.A., Israel and the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The two latter countries&#x2014;the Federation has, of course, become Rhodesia and Malawi signified their approval and new extradition treaties were entered into with them. A similar treaty exists with Italy. This gives us five countries with which we have such treaties. At present we are negotiating with Britain. These negotiations have progressed far. The same applies in the case of Germany. The white Commonwealth countries&#x2014;Australia,New Zealand and Canada&#x2014;as well as Ireland, have been approached with a view to entering into negotiations. In the case of Australia and New Zealand it is merely the possibility of negotiations that is enjoying the attention of the Governments concerned, whereas negotiations with Canada and Ireland have progressed to the stage where draft agreements can be forwarded to them for consideration. We are also negotiating with our neighbouring states, Lesotho and Botswana. They too have already shown their willingness.</p>

<p>The hon. member is right when he refers to the 1961 Act. The position is that our original <span class="col_6481-6482" refersTo="page_0502"/>treaties with various countries were entered into by Britain in terms of the British Extradition Act, 1870 and 1906. At that time South Africa was under Britain&#x2019;s protection and those treaties were also made applicable to us. On becoming a Republic we accepted all rights and obligations under those treaties. We, South Africa, accepted them. It is not yet possible to say to what extent the other countries to which they were applicable have accepted them. We do know that Portugal accepted them. Thirty-nine other countries still have to indicate whether they are prepared to accept them. One will only get to know that when circumstances calling for these treaties arise. Everything is, of course, qualified by the fact that not a single country is prepared to include persons whom they regard as &#x201C;political refugees&#x201D; in their extradition treaties.</p>

<p>The hon. member then referred to the position of minors. He pleaded for more privileges for them. He referred to the case of the young man of 20 years and nine months who must get his father&#x2019;s or mother&#x2019;s consent to have an operation. I think the answer is to be found in the question whether or not the child is emancipated.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Durban (North). I am very grateful for the suggestions made by the hon. member in regard to the planning of courts. The Department will most definitely bear the suggestions in mind. As far as the latest and newest buildings are concerned which the Department of Public Works is erecting for my Department, the plans are referred back to my Department for approval. I want to tell the hon. member that some of the latest buildings are truly well-appointed. I am nevertheless very grateful for his suggestions. As far as the Durban court is concerned&#x2014;or rather, the Durban courts, for I think they are accommodated in seven buildings&#x2014;I just want to say that I have every sympathy with the hon. member. I know the position there is not what is to be desired. I did my best this year to have Durban placed as high as possible on the priority list. In this regard our problem is that this is a project which will cost R5&#x00BD; million. We cannot start on that project and then leave it quarter-way or half-way. Once we start that project we have to complete it. Unfortunately the allocation of funds was such this year that we could not give Durban priority. We are nevertheless fully aware of what is happening there.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked whether we made sufficient use of private advocates. My reply is that we do make use of them. We do so to a large extent. I just want to quote the figures to indicate what we paid private advocates in the past three years. In 1964-&#x2019;65 we paid an amount of R27,198 to outside advocates. The following year, i.e. 1965-&#x2019;66, we paid R34,965, i.e., nearly R35,000.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. This year&#x2014;i.e., 1966-&#x2019;67&#x2014;we paid R54,321 to private advocates. Therefore it appears that we do make use of outside advocates and that we do so on a large scale.</p>

<p>Only one matter remains to be dealt with. The hon. member asked me what the latest position was in respect of my negotiations concerning the reservation of work for attorneys. I want to state very clearly what happened. Events took the following course. The attorneys made certain proposals to me to issue regulations in terms of the section mentioned by the hon. member whereby certain work, which they regarded to be their field, would be reserved to them alone to the exclusion of, <i>inter alia,</i> the banks, the accountants, trust companies, and quite a number of others. Because I realized that that would affect other people, I felt that I could not proceed blindly and in good faith I first consulted the banks. I have completed my negotiations with them and I shall tell the hon. member what has happened and how far I have gotten with them. I have already consulted the accountants too. I am on the point of consulting the trust companies. I have given the assurance to all the bodies and persons I have already consulted that if I issue regulations, or rather if I issue any regulations&#x2014;because it is not sure that I am going to issue regulations &#x2014;I will first issue them for general information, because there are more people than <span class="col_6483-6484" refersTo="page_0503"/>banks, accountants and trust companies who will be concerned in the proposed regulations. If I issue the regulations, people will also be given the opportunity to make representations to me.</p>

<p>As far as the banks themselves are concerned, a big deputation came to see me for an entire morning. The general managers of six banks, accompanied by their trust managers, came to see me. They were accompanied by a senior as well as a junior advocate. Altogether there were 14 of them. In addition they had an attorney. They put their case and they put their case very well. As a matter of fact, I told them so and they thanked me for my kindness. I was occupied with them for the entire morning. I also gave them the assurance and if I issued any regulations I would first give notice of such regulations so that they might make representations. But the matter did not remain at that. As far as I was concerned, I thought that we were through for the time being. But when I opened my eyes telegrams and letters were pouring into these Houses of Parliament. I telephoned them immediately and asked them what they were doing. I asked them, &#x201C;Are you trying to embarrass me&#x003F; It seems to me you people have instructed your various branches to prevail upon your good clients to send telegrams to Members of Parliament and the Minister before they know what the Minister is going to announce.&#x201D; That is what it amounts to. They resented my saying to them that they had given instructions and denied it. I now want to read four letters to hon. members. One comes from a bank manager at Richmond in Natal. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir,</block>

<p>re: Your Will</p>

<p>We wish to draw your attention to the fact that the law societies are endeavouring to bring about legislation which would seriously curtail the rights of the individual to nominate whomsoever he pleases to undertake the liquidation of his estate on his death. Amongst those whom the law societies wish to see prohibited from undertaking this work, are the banks. Draft regulations under the Attorneys&#x2019;, Notaries&#x2019; and Conveyancers&#x2019; Admission Act, which has been agreed upon by the law societies, are at present being considered by the Minister of Justice. If these become law, the banks will be prevented from accepting office as executor under your will. The bank has lodged its objections, but in your own interests we suggest you petition your member of Parliament or the Minister of Justice without delay by letter or telegram urging that the proposals of the law societies be rejected.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Manager.</p>

<p>This is what was written by someone in Richmond, Natal. Now hon. members must listen to the strange letter written by a man in Warrenton, quite a different place. He does write in Afrikaans, though he is a Swanepoel, by the way.</p>

Banke is onder diegene wat volgens die wetsgenootskappe verlang, verbied moet word om die werk te onderneem. Konsepregulasies ooreenkomstig die Prokureurs-, Notarisse- en Transportbesorgerstoelatingswet, waaroor die wetsgenootskappe ooreengekom het, word tans deur die Minister van Justisie oorweeg en as hierdie regulasies wet word, sal die bank nie toegelaat word om eksekuteurskap kragtens die testament te aanvaar nie. Die bank het sy besware ingedien, maar ons stel voor dat u in u eie belang sonder versuim &#x2019;n petisie rig aan u Volksraadslid of aan die Minister van Justisie deur middel van &#x2019;n brief of &#x2019;n telegram met &#x2019;n dringende versoek dat die voorstelle van die wetsgenootskappe verwerp word.</block>
