</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#bennett">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No.</li>

<li>(2) No, because voluntary service rendered by members of commando squadrons is not comparable with compulsory military training which commando ballottees must undergo in terms of the provisions of the Defence Act, 1957. Pilots of commando squadrons, for example, do only six days per year flying training whereas commando ballottees have a military training commitment of three weeks per year. A ballottee cannot be exempted from his commitments to enable him to enrol as a volunteer in another organization, which offers him a more favourable training commitment.</li>

<heading>MINING RIGHTS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Chapter II, clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer to clause 7 in Chapter II and say to the hon. the Minister, that I was disappointed yesterday afternoon to find, after the representations I had made about the exclusion of Coloured persons from the right to obtain permits for prospecting, that the only reply that he could give me was to refer to the question as to whether or not I had taken advantage of the sitting of a select committee. May I just say with great deference and due respect to the hon. the Minister, that the place where these matters are to be raised and dealt with finally is Parliament&#x2014;this very House&#x2014;and it is no answer on his part, when a member raises a point in Parliament, to suggest that because a select committee has been sitting and because that select committee has come to a unanimous decision, no discussion should take place nor any criticism levelled here and that we should just accept what has been recommended <i>in toto</i> or lock, stock and barrel. The second portion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply was to the effect that Coloured persons were going to receive more under this Bill than they have been receiving under the existing law. I want to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity to explain in some detail or as far as he possibly can exactly what the differences are in the facilities granted to Coloured persons under the present Bill, as distinct from the provisions which apply to them under the old law. The hon. the Minister has referred to the fact that Coloured persons may get prospecting licences on State-owned land, on land owned by Coloured persons and on land which falls in Coloured areas, but I think it should go further than that, and I ask the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that he has made concessions to a certain extent&#x2014;we are still waiting to hear to what extent&#x2014;if he will not consider the question of deleting all references to Coloured persons. I can see no reason whatsoever, <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0213"/>why one should have any type of restriction based on a person&#x2019;s colour or his race classification, in the prospecting for or the discovery of precious metals, base metals, minerals, precious stones and rare earths. I think the future of this country is going to depend to a larger extent upon discoveries which may still be made. Untold hidden wealth lies beneath the surface of South Africa. I would ask the hon. the Minister, therefore, whether even at this stage he will not agree to the deletion of all references to Coloured persons, or if he will not agree to that, then at least to make considerably more concessions to Coloured persons than are envisaged under the present Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>As far as State land is concerned, the position is that a Bantu may not prospect on such land. As far as Coloured persons are concerned, they may prospect on State land in the Cape Province. Therefore there are approximately 1,800,0000 morgen of State land in the Cape Province on which Coloured persons may prospect freely. There is a restriction as far as other provinces are concerned and the question is why Coloured persons should not obtain the right to prospect there too. The fact of the matter is that as far as the other provinces are concerned, State land in such provinces is situated close to the Bantu homelands. The question is why the right is given to Coloured persons in the other provinces and not to the Bantu there because they have a stronger claim to that right than the Coloured persons there. The hon. member also referred to the rights of Coloured persons as far as the diamond industry was concerned. Even in this case one has a difference; they have mining rights in the Cape Province but not in the Transvaal. We feel that if this right to State land, as regards base minerals, had to be extended to State lard in the north, objections would be raised by prospectors in the north if that right was to be granted to Coloured persons. Consequently I feel that that right cannot be extended to the north.</p>

<p>As regards alienated State land, the position is that when Coloured persons or Coloured associations are the owners of such land in the Cape Province they may prospect on such land. This has now been extended to the north. This may also happen there. Even in those cases where a White person is the owner of alienated State lard he may transfer it to a Coloured person if he prefers to do so. As regards such land he is therefore free to do so. Then there still is private land. As far as base minerals are concerned the right to prospect on such private land in any of the four provinces and to exploit it without any form of legal authorization is vested in the holder of such mineral rights. Those rights may also safely be transferred to a third person. He may also transfer them to a Coloured person. There is no restriction. A prospecting permit or mining lease for the prospecting for and mining of base minerals on such land is not a legal requirement. A prospecting permit must only be taken out in respect of prospecting for a precious metal, such as gold, on private land. As far as we know there are no precious metals in the Cape Province. Therefore this restriction as regards precious metals and as regards Coloured persons is virtually meaningless because precious metals are not found in the Cape Province. As far as the employment of Coloured persons by the holder of a permit or the holder of a prospecting right is concerned, such a person may employ Coloured persons at any time under any of these circumstances. Therefore practically the only difference is that a Coloured person may not prospect on State land in the other provinces and that he may not prospect for precious metals. I therefore feel that as far as these other rights are concerned, there is virtually no discrimination between the races.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the vicinity of Phalaborwa in my constituency is a proclaimed mining area, but at the same time that land is also a proclaimed soil conservation area. There are many cattle farmers in that vicinity. These people have complained to me on various occasions and I am pleased to see that provision is being made here to grant recognition in respect of fencing, etc. We find, however, that many of the holders of claims as well as lessees destroy the surface of the land to an alarming extent. I myself have carried out inspections on a few farms. I mention the farm called &#x201C;Square&#x201D; belonging to Mr. Piet Bosman, the farm called &#x201C;Paul&#x201D; belonging to Roberts Construction and the farm called &#x201C;Pompey&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, if that area is a soil conservation area there must surely be co-operation. These people should not be allowed to destroy the surface in this way. The farmers leased the grazing rights from the State in terms of an earlier Act a number of years ago. These people also have certain rights. They pay for their grazing but their grazing is nevertheless being destroyed in this manner. I want to go further. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to see to it that proper safety measures will be applied as regards the digging of holes which are left uncovered. They are dangerous and very deep. The people&#x2019;s stock graze there. They fall into <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0214"/>those holes and perish. Those holes are a danger to human beings and animals.</p>

When one travels in that area one also notices many other things which are happening there. I am again speaking about surface rights for agriculture. Subsection (9) lays down which roads the prospectors may use. Many of those prospectors have no respect for a farmer&#x2019;s fencing. They cut the wire fencing of a farmer, pass over his veld and dig a hole there. I trust that the hon. the Minister will see to it that there will be proper supervision, and that he will instruct the mining commissioner to exercise proper supervision over occurrences of this nature and that our soil and the properties of farmers will not continue to be destroyed in this ruthless manner.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday during the Second Reading of this Bill I indicated to the hon. the Minister that it seemed to me that perhaps a consequential amendment was necessary to complete the work which this clause seeks to do. I suggested that because in the original Act in section 5 which lays down the duties of the Registrar, subsection (3) provides only for a single registration, in my opinion. In other words, when the first particulars are submitted to the Registrar by the officer holding an inquest, according to the wording of subsection (3) which I would like to read just now, I believe that the registration is then complete. I see no provision for the handling of the second report which should come from that officer. Subsection (3) of section 5 provides as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The completion of such form &#x2026;</block>

<p>It does not say &#x201C;forms&#x201D;. It is in the singular&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall constitute the registration of the birth or death recorded thereon and such form when so completed shall be deemed to form part of the relevant births register or deaths register as the case may be.</block>

<p>Now in clause 1 of the amending Bill which we are now discussing, subsection (3 ) of this new section 13A reads that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On receipt of the notice referred to in subsection (2) the district registrar concerned shall enter in his deaths register the prescribed particulars, and shall thereafter on receipt of a written request from any person on payment of the prescribed fee, issue a provisional death certificate on the prescribed form.</block>

<p>In other words, it would appear to me possible that the procedure of registering the death provisionally and issuing a provisional death certificate, might well be in the terms of the original act all that is required from the Registrar. Unless the Minister has some other particular aspect to put to us I would believe that a consequential amendment is necessary to amend section 5 of the original Act to provide for the insertion of these extra particulars.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to mention that I brought this matter to the attention of the law advisers and that they assured me that <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0215"/>they had gone into this aspect of the Bill very carefully, even when drafting it, and that this preliminary registration of a death would actually be of service to those people who are concerned only with the death as such. They also assured me that it would in no way affect the eventual second registration of the death and its other causes.</p>

<p>While I am speaking I may also say that another matter has been mentioned to me in private, namely that in the sequestration of estates and their liquidation, and particularly in their distribution, it is the position under our legislation that it may happen in practice that someone who is an heir may be an accessory to the death of a person. That aspect has also been gone into and I am told that it can be covered and is in fact covered. That is the reason why it has not been provided for in this Bill but under the Act relating to the Department of Justice, which deals with such cases. It follows, therefore, that although the objections and misgivings of the hon. member for Umlazi are quite justified, I may readily assure him that those implications will not arise.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon.

One would imagine that the cause of death could be determined within approximately seven or eight days after a post mortem. If this is so this amendment would not seem to be so necessary. Circumstances may, however, be different. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an indication of the period of time involved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I also put that question to the law advisers, and they tell me that the period of validity of such a registration would be determined by the date of the final report indicating the real cause of death. In other words, Sir, there will be a time lapse, and one cannot determine that the time lapse will be for seven days, 14 days, three weeks or even one month. The lapse of time will be determined by the time it takes to make the second registration after the completion of all investigations into the cause of the death concerned. It will thus be applied to the clause as such and the second registration.</p>

For example, if we should be negligent and allow foot-and-mouth disease to break out among our herds of sheep, the losses which the farmers of South Africa and the country itself will suffer within the space of a single year will run into several millions of rands. The reason for that is that we have certain types of virus in South Africa that do not occur in England and in other countries. This penalty provision with its heavy fine is directed against offenders who do not comply with the quarantine regulations. It is not directed against those unfortunate people who have diseases among their stock. It is only directed against offenders.</p>

<p>I move &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because there are various associations of breeders who have for a long time desired and looked forward to this legislation, I find it a great pleasure to move the Second Reading of this Bill. I find it a pleasure, not only because stock-farming is something which is near to my heart and probably also near to the hearts of many hon. members of this House, but also because our country is suitable for a large number and a large variety of stock breeds in spite of all sorts of natural limitations. I think that there are very few breeds which have not found a habitat somewhere in our country and which cannot adapt themselves readily to our conditions.</p>

<p><span class="col_397-398" refersTo="page_0216"/>Economic stock-farming, however, is to a large extent dependent on the quality of our livestock. Competition is too keen to allow one to think that we shall be able to achieve success if we keep animals with a low production level or which yield inferior milk or meat or wool. In other words, the inferior animal is only a boarder on the farmer&#x2019;s farm which makes his farming activities less efficient.</p>

<p>For the ordinary farmer it is essential that good breeding stock should come from the herds of breeders of pedigree livestock because such breeding stock represent the basic material for improving his own herds. That is the reason why the State-&#x2014;in the interests of the stock-farmer in general and also in the eventual interests of the food consumer&#x2014;has concerned itself indirectly with the registration of pedigree stock over a period of many years. I cannot describe the State&#x2019;s contribution in any other terms, because my Department is there simply to give guidance to and not to manage the affairs of the breeders of pedigree stock. Indeed, they do that themselves. They are responsible people who are very keen themselves to maintain high standards and to see to it that their integrity can never be called in question.</p>

<p>The standards of our pedigree stock compare so favourably with those of other countries that the possibility of exporting is even being considered. In this respect too&#x2014;as in many other fields&#x2014;South Africa has therefore reached maturity. It has herds of outstanding quality which may be regarded as being a national asset. New breeds have even been developed here and one of the amendments now before you relates to that. Changed circumstances have necessitated certain minor amendments to be effected to the Registration of Pedigree Livestock Act. I shall merely mention the most important of these.</p>

<p>Firstly, the amendment of section 1 (2) makes provision for an additional system of upgrading farm livestock. The Karakul Breeders&#x2019; Association, which is affiliated to the Stud Book Association, is constantly faced with the challenge of producing furs, by means of selective breeding, which will meet the changing demands of trade dictated by fashion. At times this compels breeders to introduce, contrary to the provisions of the Act, new blood of non-pedigree Karakul sheep. These practices occur in South-West Africa in particular and in order to make it possible to unite breeders in the territory and breeders in the Republic in one association with a single set of rules, it is proposed that the Act be amended so as to make provision for these exceptional conditions. Although there is no doubt whatsoever that the methods of breeding for Karakul fur production are sound, they do differ in principle in certain respects from those of other breeds of farm livestock which are registered with the Association as pure-bred livestock. If the proposed amendment is effected to the principal Act, it will be possible for the Stud Book Association, the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Karakul Breeders&#x2019; Association to follow a scientifically-founded breeding improvement system for Karakul sheep, which will meet the demands which may from time to time be made on furs because of trade considerations. At the moment this proposed amendment only has Karakul sheep in mind and it is unlikely that it will be extended to other breeds of farm livestock at a later stage.</p>

<p>Secondly, the insertion of a new sub-paragraph (c) in section 8 enables the Stud Book Association to grant recognition to associated societies. In terms of the provisions of section 1 (3) of the Act no newly-bred breed of farm livestock is recognized as such unless it has been bred for at least six generations as a closed group and has been recognized by the Association with the approval of the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. Consequently a society which is engaged in developing a new breed, such as the Walrich Merino and the Drakensberger breed of cattle, which is not really a new breed but a very old breed in South Africa, but is not registered in the Stud Book, cannot be affiliated to the Stud Book Association before the breed of farm livestock concerned has been developed up to the prescribed level. Therefore such a society has no claim at any earlier stage of the development of the breed concerned to the Stud Book Association&#x2019;s specialized assistance and guidance relating to aspects such as keeping acceptable and efficient breeding records, and the Stud Book Association in turn has no supervision over the activities of such a society. Basically it is essential that societies which are developing new breeds of farm livestock should receive the necessary guidance in order that this development may be properly planned from the very outset. In addition it will be possible for the Stud Book Association to ensure without the slightest measure of doubt that the provision, namely that the breed must be bred as a closed group for at least six generations, has been complied with when application is made for such a breed to be recognized. Although the Stud Book Association initially tried to make provision for associated societies in its constitution, this would have been contrary to the provisions of the Act and on that account this amendment is essential.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a new sub-paragraph (d) is inserted in section 8 in order to enable the Stud Book Association to register a prefix or suffix for a breeder and to issue a certificate in respect of such registration. In terms of the Stud Book Association&#x2019;s constitution and in accordance with traditional practice prefixes and suffixes are already being registered for owners upon payment of an annual fee. It is desired, however, that this power should specially be laid down by legislation and my Department supports this request. In fact, this is not a new principle, because when the old Act was amended in 1951 to make provision for possible autonomous societies, it was provided in section 11 that even members of autonomous societies still had to register their prefixes or <span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0217"/>suffixes with the S.A. Stud Book Association. Therefore it would appear that the legislature already at that stage supported the central registration of prefixes and suffixes in principle.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to mention that the S.A. Stud Book Associaiton and the Stud Book Advisory Board supported the amendments contained in this legislation. As a matter of fact, some of the amendments originated in representations made by these bodies because these bodies deemed it essential to render that assistance and by rendering such assistance being able to exercise the necessary control. This Amendment Bill is therefore intended to facilitate the activities of the S.A. Stud Book Association and to ensure that when one is dealing with new registrations one will be sure that the conditions imposed in respect of the breeding period have been duly complied with. I gladly move the Second Reading of the Bill and I trust that this House will give it its favourable consideration.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support the Second Reading of this Bill for all the reasons mentioned by the hon. the Minister, i.e. that it originated with the Stud Book Association itself and with those people who should like to form associated societies. In point of fact the Bill deals only with those people, the associated societies, and also changes the definition of farm livestock. I consider the change made in clause 1 (2) particularly important, i.e. that farm livestock will now be considered to be stock bred by a particular system of breeding recognized by the Association with the approval of the Minister. In particular I want to say that in South Africa, despite the fact that we try to keep our stock as pure as possible, outside circumstances frequently demand, particularly in respect of sheep, that one should not merely breed sheep for a particular purpose, but that one should breed them with more than one object in view. There are many people, of course, particularly among the leading farmers, who are not in favour of cross-breeding, but I think it has become essential that we should evote a great deal of attention to that aspect. I think that where such an associated society in South Africa finds it necessary to breed a good dual-purpose sheep, for example, there is no reason why that should not be done, because conditions frequently demand that one should have a good dual-purpose sheep. I have to admit that so far we have not succeeded in breeding a good dual-purpose sheep in South Africa which can be of great value, particularly to the extensive regions, which can yield wool and mutton and which can be resistant to the conditions obtaining there. [Interjection.] Yes, there has been some progress. There is a sheep like the Dorper, for example. There are people who cross the Romney Marsh with the merino, for example, but I do not think that the desired success has been achieved so far. The hon. the Minister mentioned that the consumer is also entitled to buy the best meat and the best milk, and consequently there is indirect interference, as he put it, on the part of the Department and of the State. That is why they take such an interest in it. And the more interest they take, the better for both the producer and the consumer.</p>

<p>As regards the prefixes or suffixes, I think that this is also something which has so far been allowed in practice and which is now merely legalized. I am thinking in particular of well-known breeders who through the years developed some animal through their own method of breeding and who frequently showed that they had done pioneering work. I think it is essential that their names, or the particular directions they followed, should be preserved for posterity by coupling their names to the stock bred by them. People are still speaking of the Minnaar blood or the Dealie merino, or even of the Afrikander cattle. It is frequently essential to have regard to the background when decisions are made on the name to be given to such an animal. I think granting legal recognition to that principle is a firm step forward. For that reason we on this side of the House support this Bill. I think the amendments which are being effected here by the hon. the Minister are sound. We should like to wish the Stud Book Association and the associated societies affiliated with it everything of the best for the future and we hope that they will continue to breed better animals for South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister made particular mention of the Karakul farmers. It appears to me as though the hon. the Deputy Minister for South-West Africa Affairs also has something to say in this regard. The Karakul industry has made tremendous progress in the past 15 years, not only in South-West Africa, but also in the north-western Cape and in other parts of the country. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned the fact that it is frequently necessary for the Karakul farmers to adopt a different breeding method in order to breed a better animal. In that regard I just want to say that here in South Africa we can never do too much to promote our Karakul industry. Not only does the Karakul industry earn us valuable foreign exchange, but I think the Karakul sheep, as I have seen it in certain parts of the country, is one of the hardiest types of sheep one can farm with. It is one of the races which adapts itself best to our conditions. If the hon. the Deputy Minister wishes to assist that industry by means of this amendment, I can only say that this is a timeous measure and that the Karakul farmers should be given this support.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTHWEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am one of the farmers who are very pleased that this Bill is being passed here to-day. The present position is that as far as breeds of cattle are concerned, we have the South African Stud Book Association. Pedigree cattle bred in South-West <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0218"/>Africa is registered in the South African stud book, but as far as Karakul sheep are concerned, South-West Africa has its own stud book and the breeders in the Republic have their own stud book. This is an undesirable position. The Karakul industry, as the hon. member for Newton Park said, is a very important industry not only for South-West Africa but also for the north-western part of the Republic. It is a known fact that where we have more than 3 million Karakul sheep in South-West Africa the Republic already has more than 1&#x00BD; million. As far as pedigree animals are concerned there are certainly more registered Karakul sheep than any other breed of animal in South Africa. It is undesirable that we should have two stud books because then we have two standards. The Karakul farmers of South-West Africa and the Republic then agreed to approach the Minister and to ask whether the two stud books could not be amalgamated. To do so required certain legislation and hence the Bill we are discussing here to-day. Seeing that South-West Africa applies certain standards in connection with its stud book whereas the Republic applies other standards; and seeing that farmers in the Republic very often buy rams in South-West Africa and also because one finds farmers who have two farms, as I have&#x2014;one of which is registered in the Republic and the other in South-West Africa&#x2014;difficulties are always experienced in connection with what standard to apply in valuating animals, whereas there would only be one standard of valuation if the two stud books were amalgamated. As far as upgrading is concerned, I am very pleased that this provision is being written into the Act. It is a known fact that in South-West Africa as well as in the Republic we have a large number of animals which is a cross-breed of the Karakul ram with the Persian ewe. We find that even the fourth or the fifth generation of such cross-breeding yields an excellent fur. Such cross-breeding holds major advantages because the Persian sheep has a thin hide which is necessary to obtain a light fur and also has short hair which is necessary to obtain short hair in the Karakul fur and all these things combine to give one an excellent fur. On certain stud farms in South-West Africa we have cross-bred sheep of the 12th, 13th and 14th generations. We have entered them in our stud books. In this respect South-West Africa is very strict. No Karakul sheep are entered in the pedigree stud book there unless the 8th crossing has been registered for three successive generations and then only the 9th cross-breed is registered in the stud book. Therefore we may thank the hon. the Minister for accommodating us in that those animals will also be recognized as stud book animals in the future. They are excellent animals and many of them are better material than many of our pure-bred sheep.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to make one or two brief remarks in amplification of what my colleague, the hon. member for Newton Park has said in support of this Bill. The Bill provides for the recognition of breeding methods which have not necessarily been recognized in the past and also for the recognition of associated societies during the period of six generations that they are grading up by a system of breeding, until they can reach the stage where they can have the normal registration.</p>

<p>Sir, some of our stud breeders who belong to the old-established registered breed societies have in the past perhaps looked somewhat askance at the development of new breeds. But we in this country have a tremendous variety of climatic conditions, and that alone justifies the establishment of new breeds and also ensures that there will be a place for those breeds in our farming economy. We have too a rapidly increasing human population which is going to bring in its train a demand for even greater food output and that in turn will lead to the need for an increase in our animal population. We know that our sheep population is increasing but there is also a need for an increase in our cattle population, which has now remained relatively static for a large number of years. But apart from the increase in actual numbers we can also, by new scientific breeding methods, increase the production of animals in this country. The hon. the Deputy Minister has mentioned one or two of the new breeds. I think he mentioned the Drakens-berger and the Walrich Merino as examples of what can be done. I would like to mention one or two more because I feel that tribute should be paid to certain people. I would like to mention amongst others the Bonsmara and the Döhne Merino (mentioned here by the hon. member for Newton Park).</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to make particular mention of them because I feel that the officials of the Department have done a good job of work in this regard and in particular in the development of the Döhne Merino at the Döhne Research Station near Stutterheim. I should like to pay particular tribute to the officer who supervised the development of that Merino with the assistance of interested farmers in the neighbouring districts, namely Mr. J. J. Kotz&#x00E9;. The introduction of that breed has virtually revolutionized sheep farming in those areas south of the border. Where previously, due to very low lambing percentages &#x2014;;of perhaps 50 per cent&#x2014;it was never possible for the farmers to make progress with their sheep farming, to-day due to the developments of this new breed, allied with the control of parasites and so on, it has become possible for those farmers to make financial progress due to the tremendous progress they can make with their breeding programmes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is encouraging that this legislation has been supported by the South African Stud Book Association, because it shows that the stud breeders of the country as a whole do not have closed minds on this question. This trend towards the development of other breeds is also in keeping with what <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0219"/>has happened in other countries. In the United States, for example, they have had the development of various other cattle breeds such as the Beef Master, the Santa Gertrudis and the Brangus, and in a country like Brazil we find that they are developing a new dual-purpose breed of cattle based on Zebu stock. On the other hand, Sir, we do need to guard against mere indiscriminate cross-breeding and there is need for proper control in this respect. It is a matter for congratulation, I think, that this control will in effect be in the hands, not only of the Minister, but also of the South African Stud Book Association, because they are the representatives of the people who have maintained these very high breeding standards which we have managed to maintain in South Africa in the past. As long as there is the close liaison which there should be between the hon. the Minister and the South African Stud Book Association (for which provision is made in clause 2 (c)) when these new associate societies are recognized&#x2014;and one looks forward to having that close liaison&#x2014;I feel that the new breeding methods which it is possible to recognize under this Bill will not be in any danger of being abused.</p>

This work in point of fact is a good illustration of the quality of the services rendered by this Department. I want to give the assurance that there will be the closest cooperation between the South African Stud Breeders Association and the Minister to act as guardians to ensure that injudicious crossbreeding will not take place, as the hon. member requested.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is intended to amend the Wool Act, 1946, and the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act, 1960. As far as the Wool Act is concerned, provision is being made in the Bill, firstly, for more elasticity in fixing the dates on which the chairman and vice-chairman of the Wool Board are to retire. Secondly, provision is being made for the extension of the provisions in regard to the utilization of donated moneys. Thirdly, provision is being made for the amendment of the provisions in regard to auditing the accounts and balance sheet of the Wool Board.</p>

<p>For as far as the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act, 1960, is concerned, this Bill provides that the Wool Commission can, with the approval of the Minister, finance out of its own funds the purchase and manufacture of packing materials for wool, and that the Wool Commission itself can purchase and store such packing materials for the purpose of selling them later to woolbrokers and other persons who in the course of their trade are suppliers of such packing materials. Provision is also being made for the appointment to the Wool Commission of an additional producers&#x2019; representative when circumstances should necessitate such an appointment. As was done in the Wool Act, provision is also being made here for more elasticity in fixing the date on which the chairman and vice-chairman of the Wool Commission are to retire.</p>

<p>In clause 1 of the Bill the definitions of the words &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D; and &#x201C;regulation&#x201D;, as contained in the Wool Act at present, are deleted because they have become redundant. The word &#x201C;regulation&#x201D; is no longer used anywhere in the Wool Act, but only in the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act. The word &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D; only appears in section 34bis of the Wool Act, where there is provision to the effect that the levy imposed by the Wool Board is payable to the Wool Commission in such manner and at such time as may be prescribed. Provision that levy regulations may be made, is contained now in section 21 of the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act, and the word &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D;, where it appears in section 34bis of the Wool Act, meas &#x201C;prescribed by regulation made under the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 3 of the Bill seeks to make the position more clear, while the word &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D; is being defined in the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act in clause 6 of the Bill. In regard to the term of office of the chairman, the Wool Act, 1946, provides that the board has to elect one of its members to be the chairman and that that chairman holds office for a period of one year until the expiration of the period for which he was appointed in that board, whichever period expires first. In view of the fact that from the nature of the case the Wool Board cannot meet at exactly the same time every year, hon. members will realize that compliance with the present provision presents quite a number of problems. In practice the election of a chairman can normally not take place after exactly one year, and therefore it must necessarily take place before or after the expiration of one year. If the provisions of the Act are therefore strictly complied with, it may lead to all sorts of complications, and the object of the amendment in clause 2 is therefore <span class="col_405-406" refersTo="page_0220"/>merely to bring more elasticity into the relevant provisions. The same problem is being experienced with the term of office of the vice-chairman and the proposed amendment will also solve this problem automatically.</p>

<p>Section 35 (2) of the Wool Act, 1946, provides that the Wool Board may receive donations or contributions from any person. Any moneys acquired in this manner, must be utilized for the purpose designated by the donor or contributor, or if he did not lay down any conditions, such moneys may be utilized for any of the purposes of the Board. Therefore, when donations or contributions to this Board are in the form of money, there are sufficient directives in the Act as far as the disposal thereof is concerned. However, the Controller and Auditor-General rightly pointed out that donations or contributions were not necessarily made in the form of money only, and the purpose of the amendment in clause 4 is therefore merely to extend the provisions in respect of donations and contributions to all forms of donated goods and not to limit the application of the provision to money.</p>

<p>Section 36 of the Wool Act, 1946, contains certain directives in regard to auditing the accounts and balance sheet of the Wool Board. The Controller and Auditor-General pointed out that the directives in section 36 (1) in regard to the appointment of persons by the Controller and Auditor-General to assist him in auditing the accounts, as well as the directives contained in sections 36 (2), 36 (4) and 36 (5), are covered by the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1956. The amendment in clause 5 is therefore merely aimed at removing the redundant directives in regard to auditing the accounts and balance sheet from the existing Act. For the information of hon. members I can just mention the fact that these amendments enjoy the support of the Wool Board.</p>

<p>For many years now it has been the function of the Department of Commerce and Industries to keep supplies of wool bags and to finance the local manufacture thereof. This was necessary for strategic reasons in order to prevent the wool industry of the Republic from being disrupted by shortages which may be caused by poor jute crops or restrictions imposed by supplying countries on the export of jute. As a result of South Africa&#x2019;s dependence upon a raw material which is obtained mainly from non-sympathetic countries and also as a result of the detrimental effect of jute pollution on the good name of the South African wool clip, experiments were made with alternative raw materials. Accordingly it was decided recently to change over to the use of paper wool bags. Although paper of the required quality still has to be imported at this stage, it is, however, freely obtainable from Western countries. The danger of shortages has therefore virtually disappeared, and the provision of supplies as a function of the State can therefore no longer be justified. The distribution of wool bags to producers is being undertaken by woolbrokers, and soon they will therefore also have to accept responsibility for the financing and storing of manufactured wool bags. However, this will place a great financial burden on the brokers, firstly, because wool is a seasonal product and, secondly, because it is necessary to have a reasonable supply available at all times. If storing and financing were left to the manufacturers of wool bags, it may entail a considerable increase in the price of the producer.</p>

<p>It is being felt, therefore, that the Wool Commission should be granted powers to finance, if necessary, the purchase and/or manufacture of packing materials in order to prevent a possible interruption in the flow of supplies or avoidable increases in price. For this reason it is necessary for the Wool Commission to take over the further function of the Jute Controller, namely that of purchasing sufficient supplies. However, the Commission will not sell bags directly to the producers, but only to woolbrokers and to those persons who, in the course of their trade, are suppliers of packing materials to producers. The Act in its present form does not authorize the Wool Commission to carry out such functions, and in clause 7 of this Bill provision is being made for this. The ever-increasing competition wool experiences on the part of synthetic fibres has also brought the importance of sound marketing methods pointedly to the fore, and there is no doubt that this aspect will increase in significance. Even on international level more efficient marketing methods are being advocated.</p>

<p>It is the function of the Wool Commission to serve the Minister with advice on matters concerning marketing and, because his responsibilities in this respect may increase in extent, it is desirable that provision be made, as is being envisaged in clause 8, to increase the number of members serving on the Commission, when circumstances necessitate such a step, by an additional producers&#x2019; representative. This will involve the producer more closely in the marketing of his product, in which he has a real interest, and it will also promote continuity, which is essential. At present the Commission consists of only five members, of whom three are wool producers; the other two members are nominated by the South African Wool and Mohair Brokers&#x2019; Association and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing respectively. In terms of the existing provisions of the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act, 1960, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Wool Commission are elected for a period of one year. As in the case of the Wool Board to which I have already referred, such an election cannot always take place in practice after exactly one year, but usually takes place before or after a year has expired. The proposed amendment in clause 9 will remove any obscurity in this respect. The proposed amendments relating to the Wool Commission and Wool Amendment Act, 1960, do, of course, also enjoy the support of the Wool Commission. I hope that, since this amendment <span class="col_407-408" refersTo="page_0221"/>has become essential, it will also have the support of this House.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House would like to support this Bill, but I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a few clauses in the Bill in regard to which we have problems. In the first instance I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that in the principal Act the objects of the Commission are defined, and that there is only one. The object of the Commission is &#x201C;to stabilize the wool market of the Union in a manner approved by the Minister&#x201D;. It says no more and no less. The Minister will remember how jealous wool growers have been through the years in regard to this stabilization fund which they have built up to a level of some R32 million at this stage. The audited report of the Commission as at 30th June, 1965, states that the amount in the stabilization fund is R32 million. It has always been a tenet of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association that this fund has no other purpose and should not be utilized for any purpose other than the stabilization of the market in a manner approved by the hon. the Minister. In the past the Commission has been fortunate in that the Minister has always been prepared to approve of the manner in which it sought to stabilize the market, namely price stability with a reserve price, and that they have done so reasonably successfully over a long period of time. But apart from whether the amendment, as effected in the Act now, is permissible under the object as defined in the principal Act, namely that it should only be used for stabilization purposes&#x2014;I do not want to go into this matter because I know that the hon. the Minister will go into it before we reach the Committee Stage&#x2014;I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that even at the board meeting of the Cape branch of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association held last week, there was an attempt by the Wool Board to obtain some of the interest accruing to the Wool Commission in order to help them as regards their finances for this year. It should be mentioned that the .1 per cent levy imposed by the Wool Commission has already been made over to the Wool Board for this year in order to make its Budget balance. But as regards the decision to approach the Commission with the request that part of its interest or part of this amount be handed over to the Wool Board, the Cape wool growers decided last week that they would under no circumstances be prepared to hand over even as much as a part of the interest of this amount to the Wool Board. I also want to inform the hon. the Minister by saying that at the last National Wool Growers&#x2019; Congress held last year, this legislation had already been submitted to this House in draft form and that it was discussed by the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association. The information given there was that the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association or the Commission only had research in regard to wool bags and containers in mind. They were keen to finance it. Since then the Department of Commerce and Industries has indicated that it is no longer prepared to finance wool bags and the control over jute has been lifted, and complications have arisen in that regard which now makes it difficult for us to understand why the wool grower would at present, under these circumstances, be more prepared to spend an amount &#x2014;which may run into R3, R4 or R5 million&#x2014;on the manufacture or purchase of bags if they had not been prepared to do so at the congress and if at their congress they had not been consulted in this regard as to whether this amount could be utilized from the Wool Commission&#x2019;s funds. I was given the assurance by the chairman of the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association that this matter had been dealt with administratively by the Wool Commission and that the wool growers had not been consulted in regard to the purchase and/or manufacture of bags.</p>

<p>I just want to go a little further and, seeing that the Minister made reference in his introductory speech to the paper bag, the manufacture of bags, the financing and manufacture of bags and the importation of the paper at this stage, I want to tell him that the information is that the paper bags for the shearing season which lies ahead and which starts in September of this year, will cost the wool farmer <b>R2.45</b> up to <b>R2.50.</b> <b>The plastic bag,</b> which can be a by-product of either Sasol or a petrol refinery in this country, can cost as much as R1.30 or R1.40, which means that there is a difference of a whole rand between the price of the paper bag and that of the plastic bag. The present manufacturers of bags in the country have already sent several of us&#x2014;and me, too&#x2014;samples of the plastic bag. They are woven bags which are perforated and not solid plastic. The latter sort of bag will never be able to comply with the requirements of wool because wool must not be packed in air-tight containers. The perforated, woven bag can allow air to pass through. Even to-day, while this sort of bag is merely in the initial stage of manufacture, this bag is infinitely cheaper for the producer, as compared to what the paper bag would cost. I mention this, Mr. Speaker, because if the Wool Commission should in the first instance have to finance the manufacture and/or the storage of bags and the purchase of containers for wool, and if it were to become Government policy that supplies should be kept in stock in case of certain contingencies, in other words, if supplies were to be &#x201C;stockpiled&#x201D;, a great contribution may in due course be implied here, in the storing and manufacture of containers. The same combination of circumstances which may necessitate the financing of bags and containers, may also necessitate heavy purchases of wool. For that purpose this fund was established.</p>

<p>This side of the House does not want to thwart the legislation in this regard. If it is the wish of the wool growers that this stabilization fund should be extended in order that it may even embrace that object, namely the <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0222"/>manufacture and the purchase of bags, then we do not want to oppose it. The latest information I have received from the organized wool growers, namely the National Wool Growers&#x2019; Association, was that they did not want these funds&#x2014;these possible millions of rands&#x2014;to be utilized for the purchase of bags, but that they would freely spend money on research with a view to producing an improved bag</p>

<p>There are no other points in respect of which this side of the House has any misgivings, and consequently I want to support this measure on behalf of this side, with the request to the Minister that he should investigate the two points mentioned here, namely the objects of the Commission as defined in the principal Act and the approval of the wool growers in this particular regard, and perhaps effect the necessary amendments at the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. member that one can, of course, read the objects of the Wool Commission into the power granted them, or else one can read the power granted them into their objects. The object is to exercise a stabilizing influence on the wool market. If it means that the Wool Commission can keep the price low for the producer by means of the temporary purchase and sale of wool bags, then it does to a certain extent stabilize that market, and the Marketing Act specifically grants the right that, where there are boards which have to supply containers for certain purposes, they may finance such containers. They cannot carry on a trade in such containers&#x2014;they must sell them through the normal business channels&#x2014;but they can do that. For instance, take the case of the wooden boxes which are required for deciduous fruit. The boards in question can obtain the boxes in order to sell them again to the producer or those persons who distribute such boxes. Consequently I do not think that the Wool Commission&#x2019;s proposed action, namely to supply containers in order to bring about a better stabilized industry, will run counter to the objects of the Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members mentioned two things, namely the supply and the manufacture. Where these bags are more specifically manufactured to serve as containers of wool, special manufacturers are necessary for this purpose. It may be that there will be times when the Wool Board will have to render financial assistance in that sufficient supplies may have to be purchased to enable manufacturers to continue their work. It may be that such a situation may rise. However, it is not the intention that it has to invest money in a special bag manufacturing industry. That is not at all the aim of this measure, and the Minister will probably not attach his approval to such a thing either. It is merely aimed at temporarily financing such a manufacturing industry to enable the manufacturer to provide the bags.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s observations about plastic bags, I can inform him that research is continually being done by the C.S.I.R. and other bodies with a view to producing the best container. Unfortunately it has been found up to now that plastic bags&#x2014;not only as regards bags for wool but also as regards bags for other purposes&#x2014;are as yet not capable of standing up to normal handling, particularly as far as wool is concerned. Hooks and such things are used, and the paper bag is capable of standing up better to this sort of treatment. However, this does not necessarily mean that, if the Wool Commission is enabled to purchase bags in order to sell them again to traders, only paper bags will be purchased. If the plastic bag industry makes progress to such an extent that a better type of bag for packing wool is manufactured, it will of course also be possible to purchase bags of that type. Therefore, this does not really have anything to do with the sort of bag which is purchased; it is merely a power which is being granted here. If the Wool Commission exercises these powers, it must of course exercise them with the approval of the Minister. If these powers are exercised in such a manner that the Wool Growers&#x2019; Association feels dissatisfied about it, the Association will call the Commission to order, as the hon. member himself knows. It stands to reason that the Commission will not proceed to such steps if the people who are actually indirectly responsible for its establishment object to those steps.</p>

<p>The Commission feels that they can bring about a saving here if they carry out this function on behalf of the farmers, because the farmer will get his bags more cheaply. The farmer will not have to pay tremendously high financial costs and high rates of interest to the broker. This money is at any rate quite safe, because it is after all the producer who uses the bag and who has to obtain the bag from the broker, who, in turn, has obtained it from the Commission. The wool is, of course, supplied in that bag again.</p>

<p>Consequently I do not think that the hon. members&#x2019; objections are really material ones, in the sense that the danger has arisen that the Commission will be engaged in activities which have never been foreseen and to which the wool farmer will be totally opposed. On the other hand, the Minister still has the power, of course, to decide whether or not he will allow any particular proposal made by the Commission. It is felt that this authorization should be in the Act in the event of the situation developing in such a way that it becomes possible for wool bags to be supplied to the producer more economically. To a large extent their own money is being used, money they have accumulated in a fund intended mainly for this purpose, as the hon. member said, but, on the other hand, also for the purpose of enabling them to have their product marketed in the most economic manner. It is still their <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0223"/>own money which is being used for this purpose, namely to provide them with a low-priced container in which their product is to be packed.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members for their support, and if there are other problems the hon. member wishes to touch upon during the Committee Stage, we can deal with them then.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This measure seeks to effect merely a minor amendment to the powers which the Minister of Economic Affairs has in terms of War Measure No. 146 of 1942 (Proclamation 319/1942) to authorize payments from the External Procurements Fund.</p>

<p>The Fund which I have just mentioned was established under Wat Measure No. 146 of 1942, and the Minister of Economic Affairs was empowered to pay from this Fund any expenses in connection with the acquisition, transport, storage, etc., of essential goods. At present, however, these powers are limited to the payment of such expenses only in respect of goods acquired either by the Minister himself or by officials of the Department of Commerce and Industries or External Procurements Missions on the instructions of the Minister.</p>

<p>The latest developments in the Government&#x2019;s programme to make the country self-sufficient as far as possible in so far as having sufficient quantities of essential supplies at its disposal is concerned, have revealed that the Minister&#x2019;s powers in this regard are somewhat too limited. The Government&#x2019;s programme entails that for practical and administrative as well as economic purposes, it is essential that certain essential goods be acquired and stored by the private sector itself at the request of the Minister.</p>

<p>As could reasonably be expected the bodies and persons concerned approached the Government for financial assistance in this regard. The assistance requested is particularly in respect of interest on the additional capital which has to be invested for this purpose by the bodies and persons concerned.</p>

<p>By way of information it may be mentioned that although legal provision does exist for parliamentary appropriations for the purposes of the External Procurements Fund, the Fund has been operating on State guaranteed overdrafts from the Reserve Bank up to the present time. Those overdrafts are being repaid by means of revenue collected by the Fund on the instructions of the Minister in the form of handling charges and levies in respect of goods procured.</p>

<p>The proposed authority which is now being seeked is contained in clause 2 of the measure before this House. Clause 1, which is of a consequential nature, is merely intended to bring the Schedule to the War Measures Continuation Act, 1956, in terms of which the validity of War Measure No. 146 of 1942 has been extended, into line with the amendment proposed in clause 2.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that this House will agree that this is not an unreasonable approach, and consequently leave is asked for the Act to be amended so that the Minister may authorize payments from the External Procurements Fund also in cases where the private sector buys at his request. I move.</p>

<p>We support the Second Reading of this Bill. I want to remind the Minister that this is to amend the War Measures Act of 1942, and it was this Government which was going to repeal all the War Measures, but we are still operating under those measures. This is to give us an opportunity to stockpile certain essential materials. It is unfortunate that we were not given any details, no doubt because it is in the national interest that details shall not be given, and it is because of boycotts that essential material may have to be stockpiled for some considerable period and therefore the Minister is seeking these particular powers to give certain individuals, who may be authorized by the Minister, the right to stockpile certain essential materials. We realize that it is in the national interest and we will not oppose the passing of this Bill, but I want to remind the Minister that as far back as 1942 it was this side of the House which put this Act on the Statute Book.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House approves of the policy pursued by the Government for friendly coexistence and fruitful co-operation with countries in Africa with special emphasis on the Republic&#x2019;s ability to contribute to economic and technical development and the raising of the standard of living in Africa.</block>

<p>In dealing with this motion, which covers a very wide field, it is actually difficult to say what one wants to say in the short space of time available. It will therefore be my approach to cover the motion in broad outlines, while speakers on this side who will follow me <span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0224"/>will deal more fully with the particulars. In the 30 minutes at my disposal I first want to make five fundamental statements which will cover the broad background of our relations with our neighbours in Africa.</p>

<p>The first statement I want to make is that the White Republic of South Africa, in its present political constitution, is <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> an irrevocably permanent part of Africa, and the sooner the rest of Africa realizes, be it in despite of themselves, that they will have no choice but to live with us, the better. We have no intention of abdicating in South Africa.</p>

<p>The second fundamental statement I want to make is that the continent of Africa is at present strongly subjected to a multitude of political, economic and social problems, the ultimate solution of which will take several decades if not centuries, and will demand the utmost exertion and application. Thirdly, the only way in which true lasting political and economic stability will be achieved in Africa is through the closest co-operation of the African states in the field of politics and economics, in a spirit of true confidence in each other and on the basis of friendly co-existence. We stretch our friendship as far as possible, but we are not prepared to buy it or to obtain it in a way which is humiliating to any of the two parties. The fourth statement I want to make is this, that for various reasons South Africa, more so than any other country or concern, is at present in a unique position to contribute to a substantial and lasting solution to the Africa problems, and is also desirous of doing so, but her way is frequently obstructed by factors which are beyond her control and which arise from a misconception of her policy. And, fifthly, I want to elaborate on our task as I see it and on the contribution we can make.</p>

<p>In the first place, we adopt the attitude that we form a permanent part of Africa and that we make no apology for that. Historically we regard ourselves as a permanent part in view of the fact that we arrived in the southern part of Africa simultaneously with or at the same stage as the Bantu. We settled here, but we did not begrudge them the parts inhabited by them. We need not go back any further in history. In fact, if one went back even further one would find, and this is also a generally known fact, that the Bantu in any event did not inhabit Africa originally. We all know that the Bantu originally inhabited the region near Indo-China and Persia, and that it was only after many centuries that they decided to move southwards. One branch moved to the east, towards Australia, and the other branch up the Nile to Africa. In fact, it is interesting that the oldest Negro grave in Africa is only 5,000 years old. Furthermore it is interesting that 40 miles south of Wadi Haifa an interesting rock inscription was found in 1879 which states clearly that the Bantu were originally prohibited from penetrating south of that point. We need not go into the reasons why they did in fact move southward, but the fact of the matter is that one branch then moved to the west, to the present Ghana, and the other southward. When we originally arrived here in South Africa we arrived here virtually simultaneously with the portion that also moved southward. I want to put it this way: In South Africa&#x2019;s White history it cost us many years of hard struggle to achieve our ultimate independence here. I may put it this way, that there is no other state in Africa that experienced a similar struggle, extending over centuries, to achieve its eventual sovereignty the way South Africa did. It is only now, at a later stage, that various sovereign independent states have emerged in Africa. When the U.N. was founded there were only Egypt, Liberia, Ethiopia and South Africa. It was only in the fifties that these were followed by Lybia in 1951, Marocco, Sudan, Tunisia in 1956, Ghana in 1957, and Guinea in 1958, and in 1960 as many as 16 states achieved independent status in a bunch, so that there are now altogether 41 independent states in Africa. For that reason I reject the concept of &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D; which is so generally postulated. To me that slogan is as meaningless as would be the slogan &#x201C;America for the Red Indians&#x201D; or &#x201C;Canada for the Eskimos&#x201D;, for example. We regard ourselves as a permanent part of Africa, and the sooner that is realized by the Black states of Africa that have an interest in this continent, the better.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this Africa in which we live at present there is a variety of nations. We recognize them, but we also expect them to recognize us, and on that basis only can any international relations be established between them and us. We have no imperialistic ambitions; we have no intentions on any territory beyond our borders. In fact, we are engaged in the process of granting total independence to the Bantu nations inside our borders as they become capable of accepting it. But it would be a crime against the future of the Whites in South Africa if we did not prepare ourselves to be able to withstand any assaults that may be directed against us. The relationship between various states in Africa applies not only to that beweeen us and the other Black states, but also the relations between Black states and Black states. I think the isolation we are at present experiencing on the part of the northern states of Africa is in any event no more than transient. But what I would actually emphasize is that in our relations with the independent Black states in Africa we have to deal with tremendous economic and political problems, which is a feature of Africa that we have known for centuries. Africa was remote from the civilizations which developed in Western Europe and in the East. It has a tremendous leeway to make up and we may say that Africa is at present chronically impoverished. As far as politics are concerned, it knew virtually no political organizations other than the ordinary tribal organizations. In the colonial era boundaries were demarcated on <span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0225"/>the basis of rivers, mountain ranges and coastlines, with the result that <b>in</b> the <b>various inde</b>pendent Black states there are at present <b>no</b> units in the sense of a nation which is truly unified, spiritually and superficially. But in point of fact Africa with its problems, with its political independence, was woken up in an era of our modern history when all states underwent tremendous developments in the field of politics, and as a result of that there is at present tremendous disharmony among the Black states in Africa. The discord in the Organization for African Unity comes to mind as an example. At the last meeting Guinea, Mali, Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, Algeria, Somali and Congo (Brazzaville) finally left the conference. In the African states we see one <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> after another, which suggests that among the various Black states in Africa there can be as yet no mention of co-operation on a fairly large scale. But these are simply economic and political problems that face us at present, and that we shall have to face up to if we want to bring about peace and order in Africa. We want stability in Africa; we have an interest in that. We want the closest co-operation between the various states in Africa. But those international relations must be formed in accordance with recognized international rules. We want to form new ties; we want to reinforce the old, existing ties, but that can be done only if it is done honourably. Sound international relations can be created only by honourable means. Being here in the south of Africa at present, we therefore adopt the attitude that we shall not tolerate interference in our domestic affairs, and neither do we want to interfere in the domestic affairs of other states. We do not care what kind of government is in power there; we do not care what form of government they have; we do not care what internal, domestic rules they have, just as long as they also respect our own customs and traditions in our country. As far as our domestic affairs are concerned, we demand that neither the world abroad nor any African state shall prescribe to us, and it is only if a state is sincerely desirous of forming sound relations with us that she will respect our domestic traditions. It is my contention that South Africa, more than any other country, is at present in the ideal situation to help to solve the problems of Africa. It is a matter of sincere concern to us, firstly because we form part of Africa; secondly because our country, South Africa, is the most highly developed country in Africa and we are capable of making an important and substantial contribution. But the hon. member for Potchefstroom, who will follow me, will deal with that in more detail. But furthermore, we have had centuries of experience of conditions and problems in Africa. We are eager to form ties of friendship, but there are several obstacles in our way, obstacles that have to be taken into consideration. In the first place there are certain misconceptions as regards our foreign policy. We are subjected to hostility that arises from egoism, from ambition and from jealousy. But in the second place I want to say that if there they will have to abide by certain rules. As are states that desire friendly relations with us, long as states indulge in training saooteurs to fight against South Africa, for example, they can forget about ties of friendship and sounder international relations. There are also other factors that form obstacles in our way. I am thinking, for example, of the conspiracy against South Africa in which various Western countries are at present taking virtually the leading role at the U.N. I am thinking for example of a resolution which was recently passed at the U.N. by 106 votes against one, that South Africa should release its so-called political prisoners. Our Western friends should know better, but was there one amongst them who came to its sober senses? We waited in vain for that to happen. It is interesting that action is being taken against Rhodesia on the grounds that it has a so-called minority government, but how many minority governments are in power in Africa to-day as a result of <i>coups d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i>? Have our Western allies ever considered taking action against them? Then I must also mention the one major obstacle in our way. That is the U.N., which is at present virtually the focal point for action against South Africa and for co-ordination of the plans against South Africa. There the conspiracies against South Africa are being fostered constantly, and that is why I say that the U.N., as it is at present, is indeed one of the greatest obstacles to co-operation in Africa. That is why I say that I, for my part, will shed no tears the day South Africa leaves the U.N. I am one of those who maintain that we support our Western friends in the U.N. as long as possible in their struggle against the East and Communism, but we can do that only as long as we can do so honourably. Why should we pay and contribute financially so that action may be taken against us? In due course we shall probably have to take that situation into review. There are, for example, the agencies of the U.N. from which we are expelled from time to time despite the fact that we made enormous contributions towards founding those agencies. What ingratitude we are receiving now for our sacrifices and financial contributions!</p>

<p>But there is a further important obstacle to co-operation in Africa, and that is that as far as the political governments of the various states in Africa are concerned, clarity must first be obtained and stability achieved. When we offer assistance to a country we should at least know on what basis and to whom we are offering it. But the way things are in many states in Africa at present, one never knows what government will be in power to-morrow. I therefore maintain that it is high time, in the interests of the African states themselves, that they began to achieve some stability.</p>

<p>But how are we to perform our task in Africa? If we make contributions to help to improve the standard of living in Africa we are in any event not prepared to join the <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0226"/>bargaining between East and West, because such bargaining fosters an inclination to side with the one who is offering the highest price at the moment, and to sit on the fence with the sole and obvious object of pocketing as much as possible. Nor do I believe, in the second place, that the contributions we may make to the African countries should be made on humane grounds only. When disasters occur in Europe and elsewhere, we make contributions on humane grounds, and it is our duty to do so, but our experiences have not always been very pleasant. We recall, for example, how during the last war we donated the amount of R400,000 to one of the countries of our origin, i.e. the Netherlands, and how they repaid us by a contribution of R20,000 to the Defence and Aid Fund.</p>

<p>I therefore say that when we consider a permanent contribution in Africa, humane grounds alone should not be our principal consideration. Nor should we create the impression that we are doling out gifts and alms, for when a person receives gifts and alms he is inclined not to appreciate them and to expect more donations. I just want to mention one instance. Ethiopia, which is at present one of the ringleaders in the attacks on South Africa, has received R100 million from the United States of America since 1952, and after all these years only 5 per cent of the children between the ages of five and 14 in Ethiopia are at school, and they have only one doctor for every 96,000 inhabitants. But I notice that the United States of America is also beginning to feel and think sceptically about the alms which are being doled out to-day. Yesterday I read a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> under the caption &#x201C;Choice for Africa&#x2014;Fool&#x2019;s Gold or the real thing&#x201D;. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">President Johnson&#x2019;s warning this month that the United States will in future only grant aid to African States which reject the fool&#x2019;s gold of violence, represents a complete reappraisal by Washington of its affairs on this continent.</block>

<p>The report then states that since 1965 the U.S.A. has donated as much as &#x0024;4 billion to states in Africa of which seven, i.e. Morocco, the Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Algeria and Ghana have deserted her. Four of them have had a change of government. Two of them were on the brink of revolution. That is why one feels that it would be a good thing if other countries also adopted a more sober attitude towards these matters.</p>

<p>But we also believe that when contributions are made they are not intended for the leaders only. What happened to Ghana? Ghana received the colossal amount of R 1,140 million and let it slip through her fingers. They even used it to buy golden beds. That is why I say that we should think soberly when we decide to make contributions.</p>

<p>In the few minutes I still have left I want to say briefly that I believe the contributions we are able to make and which will be of use to African countries should for the time being be restricted to technical assistance as regards stock diseases, irrigation, soil conservation, the cultivation of agricultural products, etc., but that we should concentrate in particular on the expansion of our trade, because then only shall we have a sound basis on which true economic prosperity can be built for those countries. There are, of course, many problems in the way of proper inter-territorial trade with African countries. For example, there are existing trade ties with the metropolitan countries. There are various payment and trade systems, and then those countries produce only primary agricultural products. But I believe that a solution can in fact be found to draw those countries into an economic union with Southern Africa which will be of great benefit to them.</p>

<p>If one reviews our relations with the African states, I think that despite the tremendous obstructions that are deliberately placed in the way of sound relations with our neighbouring states, we are already making a breakthrough. I want to refer, for example, to the talks held with the neighbouring states Lesotho and Botswana. I believe that those states and the talks held with them can lay a foundation for future fruitful talks regarding our entire situation and relations in Africa which will be of advantage not only to us and to the African states themselves, but which will in fact make a contribution to the solution of the tremendous problems in Africa that the world is facing at present.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, desiring friendly co-existence and fruitful co-operation between South Africa and countries in Africa with special emphasis on the Republic&#x2019;s ability to contribute to economic and technical development and the raising of the standard of living in Africa, calls upon the Government to take more positive and immediate steps to achieve this end&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is necessary for me to try to prove at length how vitally imcotant our position in Africa is for us. Imagine what our position would be if a territory like South-West Africa, or Mozambique, or Rhodesia, especially in time of war, were to fall in the hands of an aggressive power. For so long were we part of the British world, and Southern Africa and the major portion of Africa part of the same world, that up to now we could afford to ignore Africa from the point of view of our security. Intruders were met and defeated at the northern extremity of Africa. But that position is now radically hanged. In the new Africa in which we live, we and the new independent <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0227"/>African states will have to learn to understand each other, and, above all, to respect each other, because our security is now inseparable from friendly relations with the rest of Africa. That is why a dynamic Africa diplomacy has become a matter almost of life and death for us. A sound Africa diplomacy is necessary also from another point of view. Imagine for a moment that our position in Africa was once again a relaxed one, and that our relations with the rest of Africa were normal. The economic benefits that would accrue to South Africa and the African countries concerned would be colossal. If our trade can expand, as it is doing, under present conditions of virtually no recognized contact between us and many of the African states, a whole new world would open up for South Africa if those relations with Africa were again normal. South Africa would then indeed become the booming workshop of Africa.</p>

<p>Politically the results would be even more startling. The rest of Africa to-day forms the spearhead of the anti-South Africa movement in the world, both inside and outside the United Nations. It was at the instigation of African states that South Africa was booted out of so much of the life of the international community. Western concern over the attitude of these new African states lies at the root of much of the violent hostility which we encounter among erstwhile powerful friends. Now imagine for a moment that all these things were at an end and that we were at peace with the rest of Africa. I do not think one could exaggerate the enormous upsurge we would experience in South Africa if we were at peace with the rest of Africa. Just think what it would mean for South Africa if some of the vast amount of money, time, energy and manpower that we expend on defence could be turned into more positive and more profitable channels. I submit that peace with Africa is worth a price. I am not suggesting that it is worth any price. Of course not. But I submit that peace with Africa is worth a price; and that is why we insist that a dynamic Africa diplomacy should become priority No. 1 for South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland has asked us to approve the policy pursued by the Government to achieve friendly co-existence. After listening to him, Sir, I must say that he has expressed little more than good intent. In fact I am afraid that in certain respects he even opposed the spirit of his own motion by continually complaining about Africa. I do not think we have ever not desired to live in peace with the rest of Africa, especially with our immediate neighbours. We know, too, that we have more or less always maintained some threads of contact, and that on the Onderste-poort level we have always been helpful to all in Africa. But, Sir, policy and good intent is one thing; the planning behind policy is another, and that is the important thing. We have very grave obstacles to overcome if we want to reshape our position in Africa, and what we missed in the presentation of the hon. member for Middelland is evidence of planning, of dynamic and comprehensive planning behind the good intent of friendly relations.</p>

<p>The motion speaks of &#x201C;friendly co-existence&#x201D;, and &#x201C;fruitful co-operation&#x201D;. The hon. member must know that the very first essential for the establishment of co-existence and co-operation between nations is proper contact. If there are to be any firm relations between us and the rest of Africa, there will have to be contact at ever so many levels of activity. There would have to be contact on Government level, contact on technological level, on educational level and in the field of economic co-operation. Without this kind of contact the whole concept of fruitful co-operation becomes a mere phrase, an empty phrase and of no real consequence. As far as contact at Government level is concerned, we recently had the summit meeting in Cape Town between the &#x201C;two Johns&#x201D;, the hon. the Prime Minister of our country and Chief Jonathan, the Prime Minister of Lesotho. It was most certainly a step in the right direction. It was leadership of the right kind. Let it be known that in this matter the Prime Minister had the full support of the whole Opposition. But let me say and warn that this must not be seen as a case of mission successfully completed. It is but the beginning of something. We have merely begun to touch the problem. Far more dynamic leadership will be required in the near future if fruitful co-operation between us and an African country or two is to become an established fact. I am thinking particularly of the question of the exchange of permanent representatives. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking at the congress of the United Party in the Transvaal not so long ago, very emphatically said on behalf of the Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must act. We must accord friendly African states the full recognition which we accord other friendly states, and we must see to it that they are fully accepted in the diplomatic sphere.</block>

<p>We had nothing about that from the hon. member introducing the motion. The Leader of the Opposition also pleaded that we should be first in line to give material assistance when we are requested to do so. For years the previous Prime Minister tried to promote the idea of roving ambassadors, hopalong ambassadors, between South Africa and our African neighbours: here to-day and gone&#x2014;the same day! But right from the beginning this idea was suspect to the African states, and was rejected by them, for the simple reason that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s motives were obvious. Everybody knew that this concept was designed to avoid day-to-day contact on a normal footing in South Africa. So the African states, the few who at this stage are willing to co-operate with us on a basis of non-interference in each other&#x2019;s internal affairs, are <span class="col_421-422" refersTo="page_0228"/>waiting. This is certainly clear from answers which the leader of Botswana, Sir Seretse Khama, recently gave to questions that were put to him. They are waiting to see if we are going to recognize their dignity, recognize their full independence as sovereign independent states, equal in status to ourselves, and whether we are going to allow a full exchange of political and trade representatives. I was rather sorry to see that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs declared in a recent interview which was meant for foreign consumption, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the way in which our future relations will be conducted has not been determined yet.</block>

<p>Why not? Why not face the inevitable, or rather the essential now? It would be far better for us to take the initiative than to be forced by events later to do what becomes necessary. The Government will find no substitute for the conventional way of expressing friendship in foreign relations. The geographic proximity of South Africa to other states, like Lesotho and Botswana, is not going to prove a very helpful excuse, because Rhodesia is not so very far away, neither is Moçambique. We, least of all in Africa, can afford to apply glaring double standards in our formal relations with these nations. We suggest that the Government steer clear of the abnormal, which always attracts analysis. If there are to be friendly relations, let those friendly relations be normal in the conventional sense, let them be natural and relaxed.</p>

<p>Apart from this, I think that it is in our own selfish interests that we make boldness our friend. There can be no fruitful co-operation without thorough understanding: they must understand us and we must understand them. But understanding can only be brought about&#x2014;understanding of internal policies, understanding of motives&#x2014;if there is a proper exchange of permanent representatives, if you have the day-to-day interplay of diplomatic exchange.</p>

<p>The very purpose of diplomatic contact is the day-to-day promotion of understanding between governments, and where permanent missions are lacking, there must of necessity also be a lack of proper understanding.</p>

<p>But let us also not forget that serious efforts are going to be made by hostile powers to cajole our neighbouring states into becoming bases for all kinds of unfriendliness towards South Africa. This should be reason enough for us to have our on-the-spot men there who could at any moment put the case for South Africa, and for us always to understand what is going on in these states. I think that it is necessary for us to accept that we will have to have a proper exchange of diplomats and representatives on the conventional basis.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration, Mr. Speaker. I think it is in the highest interests of all of us that countries bordering on South Africa should not be ruled by extremists. But, if we want to see sound governments remain in office in these African states bordering on our country, we must not place the moderate leaders in any indefensible position in their own parliaments. As sure as we are sitting here, if we delay for any suspiciously long time the question of diplomatic relations, which affect the dignity and the status of countries, we will be playing directly into the hands of extremist leaders in a country like Lesotho. Already the leader of the Opposition of Lesotho has made a violent attack on Chief Jonathan, the Prime Minister, for the fact that he came back without an invitation from South Africa to exchange representatives. I believe we must make it possible for moderate leaders to maintain their position in their own countries.</p>

<p>But there is a consideration of an even more pressing nature, and it is this. If we in South Africa can set a pattern in Southern Africa&#x2014;to start off with&#x2014;of sincere economic co-operation and sincere political co-existence between the Republic and even one or two African states, like Lesotho and Botswana, there can be little doubt that it will have an enormously beneficial effect on South Africa&#x2019;s damaged image abroad. If we can prove to the world that those who live closest to us can live amicably with us, can co-operate with us, can co-exist, then, of course, those that are far away will have to start thinking again about their attacks upon South Africa.</p>

<p>I know that there are many obstacles in the way of normal relations. We on this side have, of course, always warned that we should steer clear of any extreme forms of forced colour apartheid, because we were not solving any old problems but actually creating new ones. We on this side have also contended that public opinion in South Africa was not so helpless as some people believe it to be. I referred to the meeting of the two Prime Ministers in Cape Town. When the Prime Minister of South Africa, the White leader of the Nationalist Party here, and Chief Jonathan, the Black leader of the Nationalist Party in Lesotho, who once worked for four years on the mines on the Witwatersrand, met and ate together in Cape Town, colour became irrelevant. The Prime Minister had to brush the apparatus of apartheid aside and dealt with his counterpart from Lesotho on a basis of man to man, without regard to colour.</p>

<p>The significance of this to me was not so much the action of the Prime Minister, as the reaction of the public, the favourable way in which the public of South Africa responded and supported the Prime Minister, and approved of what the Prime Minister had done. This proves a point, Sir, and that is the most important aspect of this meeting. I believe that, given the right leadership, our people will be more than ready to face up realistically to the facts of the new Africa and the new world in which we live. Friendship is a two-way street, and all good relations must start with the recognition of dignity and with the <span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0229"/>establishment of natural contacts. In the second place: most of us are ignorant of the facts of Africa. Government agencies like the radio tend to foster an image of the whole of Africa as being in chaos. Even the hon. member opposite tried to create the impression that the whole of Africa were in chaos. Sir, Africa has its troubles, but the picture is not as bad as it is painted all the time, and I believe that we are going to defeat our own ends if the authorities do not help to create a state of mind in South Africa where people will look fairly and objectively at the facts of Africa as they are. We shall be defeating our own ends of trying to create friendlier relations if we create a wrong state of mind about Africa in our country.</p>

<p>Finally, I think there should be far greater appreciation and promotion by the Government of Dr. Anton Rupert&#x2019;s inspired concept of industrial partnership. This is a South African concept of which all of us can be proud, and the fact of the matter is that the breakthroughs achieved by Dr. Rupert for South Africa with his concept of industrial partnership amount to more than anything achieved by the machinery of Government on the political front. There should be far more appreciation of this concept, with its avowed opposition to exploitation and its belief in sharing the rewards, because, according to that concept, nationals must always hold at least 50 per cent of the equity. Others have been quick to learn. I notice from a report that one of the first business ventures in Lesotho will be a publishing firm in which the firm of MacMillan&#x2019;s in London will hold 50 per cent of the shares and Lesotho the other 50 per cent. They were very quick to learn, and I believe that our Government should be awake and encourage our big businesses to help new states with development on this basis and in this way help to promote friendly co-operation and fruitful co-existence between us and the African states. So our amendment rightly calls upon the Government to give a more imaginative lead and to take more positive steps in achieving cooperation between us and the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to detract from the speech which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has just made. Nor shall I reply to it as far as matters of principle are concerned, because attention will be given to that aspect at a later stage. However, I just want to say, also in the spirit of a contribution to the debate, that hon. member always creates the impression in me in this kind of debate of fear, fear of the outside world and fear for our position in regard to the outside world. I am satisfied that we have nothing to fear because we know all the people in our country. Militarily speaking we fear no one as far as Africa is concerned. I do not think we must ever allow that spirit to take root in these debates. Each state has a responsibility towards itself in respect of its own safety, and by that I do not mean its military safety only&#x2014;and I am not going to restrict myself to that&#x2014;but in fact its economic and technological safety. That is also the reason why, as far as this debate is concerned, we are also taking an interest in affairs in our own country as well as affairs outside our country, particularly in Africa and in what is taking place there and how that position can affect us. As an independent state we are also entitled to try and prevent any developments which may be contrary to our interests. In this connection I should like to take a look at Africa from the point of view of the economic principle in the under-developed countries, the rich country as opposed to the poor country, as well as at the problem arising from that, and I should like to try and make a humble contribution towards any positive ideas on what may possibly be done about it.</p>

<p>It is virtually only South Africa and Rhodesia which cannot be regarded as an underdeveloped country in Africa. If one glances in the first place at the position in the sphere of posts and telecommunications then it is clear that, particularly as far as telecommunications are concerned, practically all the other countries in Africa are unable to act independently. They are totally dependent upon monetary, technical and administrative aid from the rest of the world. As regards the number of telecommunication circuits in Africa, the comparison is as follows. In Nigeria there are 24, in the Congo 9, in the Cameroons 76, and the comparative figure in South Africa is 384. On 1st January, 1965, for example, the figures in respect of the number of telephones per 100 inhabitants in a few Africa countries were as follows. In Lesotho .16; in Ethiopia, where the headquarters of the Organization for Africa Unity is situated, .10; in Ghana .42; and in South Africa, for all races, White and non-White, it is 6.4. Approximately 18 months ago the number of telephones in Africa was 2.4 million, and of that total more than 50 per cent were in South Africa. The position as far as railways is concerned, compared with countries which have more or less the same geographic features as South Africa and are of the same size although they are greater in numbers, is as follows. In 1964 in Egypt the passenger traffic was 108 million, in Algeria 2.5 million, in Ghana 5.7 million, in Nigeria 8 million, and in South Africa the suburban passenger traffic alone totals 400 million. Rail miles in Algeria, an exceptionally large country, total 4,440 miles, whereas in our country it is more than 13,000 miles.</p>

<p>We shall come to that later. As far as education is concerned the percentage of literacy in Africa varies from one to ten per cent. In South Africa the position is that in respect of school-going Bantu children there is 85 per cent literacy. In other words there has been an improvement <span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0230"/>in our country of 600 per cent in comparison with the position in 1925. We have 6,000 student teachers and already have more than 3,000 Bantu graduates in this country. Compared with that there are in the 13 former British colonial territories, which are at present independent states in Africa with a total population of more than 80 million, not even 1,800 graduates. Without taking into consideration student teachers in our country, one out of every 74 White persons in South Africa are attending universities. That is the second highest figure in the world. In this respect we are surpassed only by America, with one out of every 52. In England the comparative figure is one out of every 450. If further comparisons are made with the gross national income figures, the difference is even greater. The gross value of mining, when Zambia is compared with South Africa, is R275 million as against R878 million. Take factories. There the figure in Ghana is R107 million as against our R3,188 million, and I can continue in this vein. The gross national product <i>per capita</i> compares as follows. In Ghana it is 193 dollars, in Kenya 79, in Nigeria 82 and in South Africa 554. It is generally known that this economic colossus which we have built up, particularly over the last 100 years, at the southernmost tip of Africa, produces 70 per cent of the world&#x2019;s gold. We are second in the world as far as the production of antimony and asbestos is concerned. We are the third largest maize producer and the fourth largest wool producer, but what is of particular importance is that we are one of the 12 best-fed countries in the world, expecially when one considers that of the total world population of more than 3,000 million people, more than half of them suffer from malnutrition to a high degree. Since the First World War South Africa&#x2019;s average productivity and labour capacity has maintained an average annual increase of between 2.6 and 3 per cent, the corresponding rate of growth in highly developed countries such as America, Britain and West Germany, as well as others, was only from 1 to 2 per cent, whereas in the rest of Africa it was less than 1 per cent where it has not remained static or decreased. Our entire gross domestic product increased between 1940 and 1965 at an average annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent, which is one of the highest in the world. According to the latest figures our total trade, imports as well as exports, amounts to R3,762 million, which affords us the thirteenth place in the world. I am just sketching this contrast between the underdeveloped areas and a developed country such as ours. [Interjections.] I am not doing so in a derogatory spirit but because I wish to sketch the background of the problem of the developed country in contrast to the undeveloped country, and what our problem in Africa is. This gap between the rich and the poor countries is to-day one of the root problems we are having to deal with in South Africa and is something we have to take into consideration in our relations with the other African states. The position is that the average growth in <i>per capita</i> income per annum during the period between 1957 to 1964 was 3.1 per cent in the developed countries as against 2.3 per cent in the lesser developed countries. This problem is growing to such an extent that where the average income of the Bantu in Africa varies from R40 to R60 as against R920 in Britain and R1,280 in America, it is planned that the income in the year 2000 will be R4,000 <i>per capita</i> in Britain, whereas in Africa it will be R100. That means that the gap between the rich country and the poor country is becoming wider and wider, and is doing so at a much faster rate. But the other danger arising from this is economic imperialism, if it could be called that, because the more the rich country pays for its labour, the less it pays for the poor country&#x2019;s produce. A typical example of this is that during the period between 1950 and 1962 the value of exports from poor countries decreased from 31 to 21 per cent, and in the same period the rich countries doubled their gross domestic income. This condition is developing in Africa and as an economic colossus we are saddled with the problem of having to do something about it in our planning. But it is even more serious if one notes that in 1963 Africa received no less than 36.9 per cent of the total expenditure of the United Nations budget in terms of its technical aid programme. In 1959, four years prior to that, this figure had only been 14.1 per cent. In other words there had been an increase in this injection of aid by the United Nations of 22 per cent while at the same time there was a decrease of 10 per cent in the gross value of these countries&#x2019; trade. You see therefore what problems have arisen as a result. One third of the total aid received from the Western countries by Africa is spent in the five large countries on the coast of the Mediterranean. There are approximately 57 million people, but in the central part of Africa and further south there are approximately 224 million people who have to be content with the remaining contributions. Over and against this problem of a rapidly widening gap between the rich and the poor countries, there is also the problem of communistic aid coming from the other side. That aid has mainly an ideological basis. They believe that the strength of Western capitalism is primarily situated in the colonial or quasi-colonial markets and investment opportunities in the form of cheap materials. They believe further, and their economic programme is based on that belief, that if the West can be separated from these economically unstable states in Africa, its prosperity will begin to dwindle, and the severing of economic ties between the lesser developed countries and the developed West is therefore enjoying top priority from these people. They believe further that by making the recipient countries economically less dependent upon the West, they will also be less dependent politically. That is why economic aid from Soviet Russia and China is being concentrated on <span class="col_427-428" refersTo="page_0231"/>Africa. The Chinese state bluntly in one of their pamphlets that they regard Africa as the focal point of the struggle between East and West and they are also proving this with their contribution and particularly their changed attitude over the past number of years.</p>

<p>Up to March, 1965, for example, 40 per cent of Russian aid and 43 per cent of Chinese aid to non-bloc countries went to Africa. During the period 1956-&#x2019;60 however, China devoted only 4 per cent of its total aid to Africa. In 1961-&#x2019;64 the corresponding share in Africa rose to 30 per cent. Mr. Speaker, these are aspects which cannot readily be argued away and arising from them we get the following problem with which we are also faced. The colonial governments which endured for so many years in Africa gave rise to tremendous economic stagnation. Following on that there came the tremendously rapid rate at which political independence was granted to those states. But economic stagnation also led to these people developing a sense of political and military frustration and impotence; and the changes in world conditions and relationships also helped to develop in these people a feeling that they had to have the right to a decent existence. Throughout Africa, notwithstanding all the influences at work, there is one fundamental idea which obtains and that is the idea of race. These Africa leaders want equal rights in all respects for their race, and to a large extent that desire must be traced back to that economic stagnation which arose after the long colonial rule to which they had been subjected. But as it becomes possible to give these countries greater economic and social stability they will also become politically calmer, and when they calm down politically then we shall be able to maintain much more pleasant and peaceful neighbourly relations with those people.</p>

<p>In the world to-day, which has shrunk as a result of improved means of communication and trade, places where disquiet and dissatisfaction prevail as a result of poverty constitute a great threat to world peace. We are saddled with the problem. It is in our own interests to see to it that we are able to maintain sound and strong economic relations with these countries; we cannot trade with a poor country. But another aspect which is important is the fact that through sound planning on our part we can contribute to the establishment of a stable proprietary class in those territories. We can contribute to that, and if we can do so, then we are also contributing to a stable government and a stable application of the democratic system of government, which is not prevailing there to-day. To-day it is still in many cases a question of the strongest man who governs. We would like recognized democratic principles to prevail there. But another important factor which we must consider in connection with aid to other Africa states is that the further we are able to develop these areas technically and economically, the more precarious we will be making the foothold which communistic influence is trying to gain in these countries. But the principle to be applied in furnishing aid to these countries must always be that the aid must help the recipients to help themselves. This will be done; it is the policy of our Government and the policy of the National Party. Any deviation from this principle will defeat its own purposes and will amount to &#x201C;show-place aid&#x201D; in regard to which Senator Allan J. Eilender of the U.S.A. had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is amazing that these administrators simply cannot detach themselves from incorporating into the African programme the &#x201C;show-place&#x201D; type of aid that has failed so dismally in the past. It seems to me that by now it should be fully understood that &#x201C;dollar diplomacy&#x201D; is not the solution to the world&#x2019;s ills.</block>

<p>This misguided American aid has already produced particularly strange results. I just want to mention two examples. The Haille Selassie University in Ethiopia, to which the U.S.A. contributed &#x0024;1,200,000, was built in a country where no network of proper feeder schools exists. In the Republic of Somali a harbour was built to export wheat, of which commodity scarcely enough is cultivated in the country to feed the native population. That is not the way in which we want to render assistance. This planning, directed towards countries abroad as well as that for undeveloped areas on our borders and even within our borders, must also be co-ordinated. At the moment we have the position&#x2014;this was not as a result of planning on our part but I am mentioning it in passing&#x2014;that there are hundreds of American &#x201C;Peace Corps&#x201D; people in Botswana who are rendering assistance there. They are advising the people in regard to the building of roads, the construction of dams and other projects there. It is entirely praiseworthy and a very good thing, but the people are also conveying the American idea to the inhabitants of the country in which they are doing their work. A group of students from the University of the Witwatersrand went as a group to Botswana and have been there for the past fourteen days. In their spare time there they helped in the construction work on a school, and if my information is correct, they built approximately two classrooms in that time. What they made there was a positive contribution. But I want to mention another matter for the consideration of the hon. the Minister and ask him, if he deems it fit, to inform the House in this regard and give us all guidance on this matter. It is as a result of the appeal which the hon. the Prime Minister made to the effect that everyone should help to make South Africa better-known in the outside world and also as a result of the plea made by Dr. Dönges to the effect that we should make our ideals known beyond our borders and reveal our greatness of spirit and vision. Leading industrialists and financiers are pleading for contact with African territories in various fields such as cheap power generation, a strong &#x201C;rand bloc&#x201D; and expansion of international <span class="col_429-430" refersTo="page_0232"/>industries. Others lay emphasis on mutual consultation and collaboration. In this connection I want to ask whether the hon. the Minister will not take this House into his confidence and inform us of his views in regard to the idea that an advisory council should be set up, an advisory council such as has already been propagated in the Press, but a council which goes further than a mere council composed of people from the private sector, or a council composed of senior officials of the various State Departments. I should like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views on the establishment of a body which (a) has as its task the proper planning of South Africa&#x2019;s position in respect of all under-developed areas, at home as well as abroad; (b) the coordination of all aid which can be rendered in the economic, technical, agricultural or any other spheres; (c) which is composed not only of senior officials of Government Departments and statutory bodies but also of experts in various fields from the private sector; and (d) which will fall under the direct control of the Government. Mr. Speaker, there are African leaders who are no longer viewing us with hostility, and I have every reason to believe that if we are able to make our ability to render economic and technical assistance fully available in a properly planned way we will ultimately, and perhaps even sooner than we expect, be able to take our rightful place in this sphere as well in Africa. I gladly support this motion.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The motion which is before the House is one of considerable importance. The fact that it received high priority, suggested to us that it might be Government-inspired. We ourselves welcomed the opportunity of ventilating this whole issue as we hoped that from the discussions here there would emerge a pattern, a blueprint, which would indicate what our future relationships might be with the African states. We were therefore somewhat disappointed with the introduction of the hon. member for Middelland, because having stated five guiding principles, which guide his own thinking in this matter and with which we do not seek to quarrel at this stage, he then devoted the rest of his speech to telling us of all the obstacles that exist and which prevent us from doing anything which is in fact worthwhile.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Potchefstroom gave us a detailed statistical assessment which I think was calculated to indicate that South Africa is in fact in a position to supply economic and technological aid to the more backward states of Africa. This we do not quarrel with. I think the hon. member also quite rightly drew attention to the vast gap which exists at the moment between what is commonly called the have-states and the have-nots. Mr. Anton Rupert put his finger on this particular issue when he said, &#x201C;If they do not eat then we cannot sleep.&#x201D; One could perhaps put it differently and say that &#x201C;envious neighbours are dangerous neighbours&#x201D;. We fully support that particular contention. But, Sir, here we have an important problem that faces South Africa, and perhaps one should view it against a broader canvass; perhaps one should analyse it more systematically and ask the ordinary conventional questions that one does under these circumstances, and these questions are: What, why, how, by whom and when?</p>

<p>I think the &#x201C;what&#x201D; part is fairly easy because it is clearly stated in the motion before us. This is a statement of intention. The object, the aim, is quite clear. We must seek to establish friendly relationships with the areas to the north of us. With this no one can quarrel; we certainly support it; we endorse it. Why is it necessary that we should do so? It is because, as has already been indicated, we form part of a vast continent and in the past, perhaps because our efforts have sometimes been repulsed there has been a tendency to withdraw; there has been a tendency to turn away from the areas of conflict, but the world has changed in such a way that we cannot do this any longer. We therefore see implied in this motion recognition that we must play our rightful role in Africa. We see also recognition of the fact that we live in a world where it is estimated that at the turn of this century 70 per cent of its population will be non-White. We find ourselves in a continent where even at the moment probably 98 per cent of it is non-White. We cannot escape from this situation; it is there; we must learn to face it and we must approach it positively and constructively. It is a source of great regret to us that we have been kept out from most of the scientific and technical societies in Africa; it is a source of great regret to all of us that we have at the moment virtually no diplomatic representation elsewhere in Africa, and although it is true that this represents their loss, it is, of course, in a meaningful, significant way also our loss. The motive therefore is clearly established, but I think one can add additional considerations to this particular issue. I suppose with nations it is very much as it is with people; they do things either for the purpose of self-gain or they do it for altruistic reasons, and very often it is a combination of both. In this particular case as far as South Africa&#x2019;s relationship with the rest of the African continent is concerned, it probably is a combination of both. People have ventured forth in the past and have sought to extend their borders because of military considerations, but as has rightly been pointed out by the mover of this motion, not even our greatest enemy can contend that we have territorial ambitions. We have never had them in the past and we do not have them now. In any case what would we gain by extending our territory? There is nothing beyond South Africa that we seek that we do not have at the moment. Indeed, if we were to extend our territory, we would severely aggravate the existing problems in South Africa, in view of the population composition in the rest of Africa, and we would not come anywhere nearer to their solution.</p>

<p><span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0233"/>It is true too that a people very often seek to extend their sphere of influence <b>because of</b> economic considerations, to which the hon. member for Potchefstroom has referred. There are people who maintain that sentiment <b>does</b> not enter into business or into trade, but it <b>does.</b> We can quote significant statistics to show how our trade with the African territories is increasing, but these figures are not altogether meaningful because they do not reflect potential losses in trade, and I myself <b>can vouch</b> for this. You go to a place like Tanzania where they require mining equipment and you say to them: &#x201C;These particular items you can buy in South Africa at half a million pounds and delivery will be given within a month; alternatively, your other source of supply is America where you will have to pay twice as much and it would take three times as long to deliver.&#x201D; Invariably these people say, &#x201C;We will order the equipment from America&#x201D;.</p>

<p>This is not right, because we have here a position of vantage as far as economic and trade matters are concerned. At the moment we are industrializing and for the time being we can feed our expanding domestic markets. Soon, however, these will reach saturation point. Where then are our natural markets? They are in Africa. There are some even who talk in terms of a common market for Southern Africa and although this might be premature at this stage it is certainly true that greater trade might lead to greater political affiliation.</p>

<p>This brings us then to the political factor. It is natural for all countries in the world to create a sphere of influence around themselves. America set the tone in this regard many years ago. We live in a world where a form of multilateral diplomacy operates, where people think in terms of blocks and groupings of nations. Therefore it is quite natural that we should seek allies. And if we are attacked at U.N. what better defence could we have than to have important members from Africa itself who could rally to our side? This, I think, answers clearly the question why we must do these things.</p>

<p>Now we come to how they should be done. Here we come up immediately against certain fundamental problems. If we accept this motion with all its implications, it will bring in its wake certain very dramatic adaptations of our existing views. You cannot, for example, do this type of thing on a one-way communication system; two-way communication is required. Furthermore, if we do this on the massive scale on which it should be done so as to make a real impact, then there would be large numbers of people who would want to come here from Africa and elsewhere, people with whom we would wish to confer and negotiate. But here we immediately run up against some of the existing legislation of this country. Hewever, if this matter is one which is earnest to the Government then these issues must be approached and tackled and must be overcome. There are probably many different ways in which this could be done. If it is embarrassing to us at the moment to bring these people in and superimpose them on our existing structure, then we shall have to consider other possibilities. What is there, for example, preventing the Government from establishing a new town where normal conventional legislation could be held in abeyance and where norms which are universally acceptable would obtain? This is not as far-fetched an idea as it might seem. The U.N. premises in New York, although on American soil, do not belong to America and even have its own police force. Way back the Australians, when they had to create a new capital, selected a piece of bare veld. In that way Canberra, their existing capital, arose. We accept that these arrangements have disadvantages but, as I said, if this matter was really meaningful to us, we might have to resort to this type of arrangement.</p>

<p>But there is yet a further consideration. Are we, in the existing setting, prepared to use our non-Whites, for example, to the fullest extent? If we look to the north our non-Whites can clearly establish rapport much more easily than any White man can. Is this not the advantage which, for example, China enjoys at the moment because they can rightfully say that they are non-White? And what is more we have the resources here; we have the people. Mr. Speaker, I have spent a long time in testing the aptitudes of thousands of black people coming from all over Africa south of the Sahara and I can say here with conviction that those we have here in South Africa have attained a standard which is infinitely higher than that attained by others further north. And it is not surprising that this should be the case, because those here represent the more dynamic and virile groups which decided to emigrate to the south many centuries ago. Furthermore, they have been in close contact with the White man here for a longer period; they have acquired a much greater degree of know-how; they have a much greater degree of acculturation. So we have here a vast potential of people who could be used in the interests of South Africa. But would the Government be prepared, for example, to give them the training that would be necessary? Would they be prebared to grant them the facilities which would be necessary to operate in our interests? Would they see to it that they are remunerated on a basis which would make it possible for them to do this work? Or have we for so many years thought of the non-White merely as presenting a problem that to-day we can no longer see him as an asset?</p>

<p>Then there is the whole organization of <b>our</b> diplomatic service. If this is meaningful to us, then the Africa section of our Department of External Affairs will have to expand. I am not sure what this section contains at the moment. According to the Budget the head office has 148 people of whom 95 are shown as being lesser staff&#x2014;one presumes clerks and typists. But compare this with some of the other states with massive organizations of advisers, experts and fringe organizations which <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0234"/>can supply technical information. If this matter is really of consequence to the Government, then it shall have to give serious consideration to this aspect.</p>

<p>Now we come to the question, by whom must this all be done? And here, again, we come up against certain fundamental difficulties. Here we must not see the problem as we see it, we must project ourselves and see it as people elsewhere in Africa see it. What is the image they have of this Government? It is an image which is tarnished; it is an image which, as far as they see it, is entirely based on making race the supremely important factor; it is an image which rests on the whole ideology of establishing the superiority of one&#x2019;s skin, one&#x2019;s white skin. And what does this do? It immediately evokes feelings of the greatest resentment and it engenders the deepest passions of revulsion. Here, then, is the fundamental problem we have to face, and we must face it because the Government must move in this direction and should move in this direction. It is, however, caught up in the vice-like grip of its own dogma.</p>

<p>Then we are left with the question, when? Here we, on this side of the House, perceive a measure of urgency, something which we have not seen on the Government side&#x2014;indeed, it does not appear in the motion which is before us. This must be done now, immediately. Already we have lost 20 years. Experts from all over the world are flocking to Africa and are taking all the cherries while we will be left with the crumbs. But it is important that it be done now also for another reason. In these African states there is at the moment a certain degree of reappraisal. After the first flush of independence some of them are now beginning to realize that they have to live under conditions of co-existence. This might well lead to more conciliatory political attitudes towards South Africa and that is why we must strike now whilst the iron is hot.</p>

<p>The attitude of this side of the House towards this motion is, then, that we fully accept the objectives of the hon. member and we fully accept the motives behind it. However, we have the deepest reservations regarding the Government&#x2019;s ability to carry them out. However, we are at least pleased that this particular motion has come before the House, because observers of the South African scene tell us that within the Government we have those who are outward thinking and those who are inward thinking. This type of motion certainly suggests that those who are outward thinking have won this particular round. It is because we too are conscious of our role in Africa, it is because we too have a vision for South Africa, a vision which we believe is broader, bolder, embraces more and is likely to be longer lasting, that we thought fit to put forward our amendment to this particular motion in the way we have put it forward.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The opportunity to discuss this well-considered, comprehensive motion on such an extremely important matter in this House is indeed welcomed by all of us. I want to thank the mover of the motion, his seconder and the two hon. speakers on the opposite side. The speeches, particularly on this side of the House, testify of sincerity, enthusiasm and thorough study. That is certainly encouraging to me and also to my Department, and we shall give very thorough consideration to, and where possible use, the ideas and wishes expressed here, from the opposite side of the House as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout was less constructive for the major part of his speech. He was less helpful. In particular he complained about a lack of planning, a lack of sound diplomacy, and he even mentioned separation in the field of colour, I do not know with what object. I want to tell that hon. member that his allegations are quite unfounded, as I shall in fact demonstrate in the course of my speech. The hon. member for Hillbrow asked me a whole series of questions, Mr. Speaker, to which I shall reply as far as possible and as far as time permits. This motion emphasizes the crux of our policy in respect of Africa, both as regards the spirit in which we approach those relations and as regards the object and the aims of our policy towards Africa. In that regard I want to stress right at the outset that the Government&#x2019;s approach to our relations with the states in Africa is one of cordial readiness to help. And although the Republic of South Africa is undoubtedly the most prosperous and in most fields probably also the most highly developed of all the states in Africa, South Africa&#x2019;s task on the continent of Africa is not to dictate condescendingly to others in Africa what they should do and how they should manage their affairs. On the contrary, we must avoid that attitude at all costs, because it is in conflict with the principle of non-interference, a principle which we support very strongly. The object of the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of Africa is to assist the nations of Africa and to help them to stand on their own feet, to work out their own salvation and to secure their own future, and to do so without losing their self-respect. In this regard I want to caution that we should never create the impression that we seek to overhelm or dominate Africa. We are all agreed. I think, that we are pre-eminently able and prepared to give expert advice and assistance to the African states as far as possible. And I think we are also agreed, Mr. Speaker, that most of the African states are in dire need of such assistance at the present moment. It is no secret that things are not going very well with the vast majority of the independent states of Africa. Not so long ago President Julius Nyerere said that 1966 had not been a good year for Africa. The events of the past year proved indisputably that most of the African governments are unable to derive full benefit from the independence they have gained, that they are unable to relieve the plight of the masses of Africa. In fact, authorities on Africa maintain that poverty is one of the main <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0235"/>causes of all the unrest in Africa at present, and they predict that unless radical changes are made and unless food production in Africa increases considerably, many parts of Africa will be faced with a grave famine in the last quarter of this century. Things are not going well with the Organization for African Unity either. At its last meeting that Organization was compelled to reduce its budget by two-thirds. The Organization also suffers from a chronic lack of unity. As a result of that discord they are unable to make any noteworthy contributions to the solution of Africa&#x2019;s most serious problems. So far the only factor that served to unite them to some extent was their hate of White regimes in Southern Africa, and their inability to bring about any change in that regard. But in that respect, too, the front of unity is not so firm any more, and there are tendencies in Africa to form groups in which the extremists join forces while the moderates form another group. It is a fact, for example, that several members of the Organization are openly refusing to participate in economic sanctions against neighbouring states merely because those neighbouring states are under White rule. One can only trust that the ranks of the moderates in Africa will be strengthened, as has happened through the admission of our two youngest independent neighbouring states to that Organization.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have frequently predicted in the past, here and elsewhere, that a day would come when greater realism would &#x2018;be displayed on the part of the African states. And that is precisely what is happening. It is happening as the extremistic, irresponsible leaders of Africa are replaced one by one. I believe that the hostile spirit towards South Africa, the fashion to vilify us and to attack South Africa in season and out of season, will gradually change as all other fashions do, if it is not changing already. I believe that the day will come when more and more of the African states will accept and no longer scorn the hand of friendship that has been extended by South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to comment on the merits or otherwise of the large-scale assistance rendered to Africa by other foreign powers, but what I do want to do is to emphasize that we neither want to nor can compete with the major powers in respect of assistance in the form of enormous financial contributions. In the first place, we cannot do so because we lack the means, and because we have very heavy commitments as regards the development of our own non-White citizens in the Republic. And in the second place, we do not want to do that because we are convinced that it offers no lasting solution to the problems of Africa. In our view the solution to those problems is rather to be found in co-operation and assistance aimed at helping people to help themselves. We do that on one condition, however, and that is that the recipients of such assistance should be prepared themselves to put a shoulder to the wheel and that they should throw in their full weight. Unless that happens all assistance is in vain and wasted. I am convinced, Sir, that we can make considerable contributions, contributions out of all proportion to our population figure and our means, if compared to those of the major powers. South Africa has proved that she can do that. Let me remind you, Sir, of the enormous contributions we made in connection with organizations such as the C.C.T.A., the C.S.A. and others, which were founded after the Second World War. Unfortunately, as the hon. member pointed out, the co-operation which existed in those organizations came to an end. But despite that there has been constant cooperation with our immediate neighbouring states, with all of them. In some cases that cooperation also extended further northwards. In recent times the circle of those who would like to co-operate with us has been growing continually, has been expanding. The contacts between the Republic of South Africa and other states in Southern Africa are increasing. The traffic is increasing in a large variety of fields. Since July last year ministers from Africa passed through Jan Smuts Airport on more than 50 occasions <i>en route</i> to South Africa or elsewhere&#x2014;and in giving this figure I do not include the guests who went to attend the independence celebrations. Such ministers are regularly received and assisted by senior officials of my Department. Personal contact is made with them, and in that way a great deal of goodwill is created, to such an extent that the broadcasting corporation of a major African state recently thanked South Africa publicly for the good treatment its citizens had received on Jan Smuts Airport.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I need only refer, without expanding upon them, to the three historic events which occurred in the past six months. I am thinking, of course, of the historic meeting between the late Dr. Verwoerd and Prime Minister Jonathan in September. I am thinking of the independence celebrations of our two neighbouring states, where as Minister of Foreign Affairs I myself represented South Africa, and where I myself and the officials who accompanied me made many valuable contacts with members of the governments and with officials, contacts which are already producing good results.</p>

<p>Thirdly I am referring to a further historic event, when Prime Minister Jonathan visited Cape Town to meet our present Prime Minister here and to hold talks with him. I think we are all agreed that that meeting will have far-reaching consequences for Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Those are not the only instances, however, of contacts with the governments of African states. In the case of all our immediate neighbouring states reciprocal official visits are virtually everyday occurrences. But apart from liaison with the governments of those states, eight official and semi-official missions from the Republic visited other African states during the past 12 months, while several such visits were made to the Republic. Four more visits by official missions from African states will take place in the immediate future. All these missions relate mainly to technical co-operation.</p>

<p><span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0236"/>Let me give you a few further examples, Sir. Recently an African state which is not one of our immediate neighbouring states applied to us for assistance in connection with certain important air navigation aids. We made those aids available to them, and also expert officials to assist them in installing them. They applied to us for assistance as regards architects and townplanners, which we also made available to them. Last year a technical mission from the Republic visited a distant African state to advise the government of that state on the development and exploitation of minerals. At the request of the head of government of another African state, many thousands of miles from here, we sent a geological team to that particular country last year. I should like to read some extracts from a letter which the head of government of that country recently wrote to our present Prime Minister&#x2014;I am reading from an English translation thereof&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Mr. Prime Minister,</block>

<block name="quote">You were so kind as to accede to my request to send a study mission to determine the needs of my country as regards research and mining and the possibilities of prospecting. This mission visited my country from 27th October to 21st November, and I had the privilege of holding discussions with the geologists on various occasions, initially about the object of their mission, and subsequently, towards the end of their stay, about the results of their work. It was with interest that I subsequently read in one of your public statements that your country was prepared to co-operate with all the African states, and to play an important part in the struggle against underdevelopment. I am particularly honoured in that you should have chosen my country as the first example of that will to co-operate&#x2026;</block>

<p>Incidentally, it was not the first example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I am therefore of the opinion, Mr. Prime Minister, that the work of the first mission will bear fruit and that it will usher in an era of co-operation between our two states.</block>

<p>I can assure you that this visit will be followed up. Various other applications for technical assistance are under consideration at the moment and relate to a large variety of matters which range from the construction of roads and railways to health services. For example, we have already agreed to train nurses in the Republic for certain states in Southern Africa. As was mentioned in the joint statement issued by our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Lesotho, Prime Minister Jonathan has also submitted to us certain proposals covering a wide field. Some of those proposals have already been dealt with and others are still under consideration. In addition, discussions with several neighbouring states are contemplated with a view to the utilization of rivers of mutual importance and to co-operation as regards water and power problems.</p>

<p>There is also a considerable deal of cooperation in the economic field, of course. The economic traffic with all our neighbours in Southern Africa is developing in a normal and satisfactory fashion. We also have trade agreements with most of them, while others among them who are also members of G.A.T.T. are receiving most-favoured treatment here in the Republic. In the case of one African state, a Black state, we are on the point of concluding a new trade agreement. That is over and above the monetary and customs union with Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland, which has been in existence for a long time. I may mention in passing that this customs union will be taken into review shortly.</p>

<p>The private sector is of course making significant contributions to economic co-operation with the rest of Africa. In that regard the private sector enjoys the support of the Government, which must give permission for exports of capital to foreign countries. Economic co-operation usually takes place within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s export credit re-insurance scheme, and that is what happened in the case of the construction of the pipeline from Beira to Umtali, and the erection of a sugar mill in Malawi at a cost of approximately R2.5 million.</p>

<p>The independence of Botswana and Lesotho, with that of Swaziland in the offing, is of course welcomed by all of us, as also by the Government. Amongst other things those developments offer us an opportunity to expand and develop our Africa policy even further. But I agree that they also bring greater responsibilities and obligations. It was therefore decided towards the end of last year that the responsibility for handling all matters affecting all three of those territories would in future vest in the Minister of Foreign Affairs and my Department instead of in the Prime Minister and his Department, as was always the case in the past. In other words, those three neighbouring states will in future receive exactly the same treatment, and the same procedure will be followed with regard to them, as in the case of friendly sovereign states. This should meet with general approval and will also greatly facilitate the co-ordination of our foreign policy, particularly in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Interest in our relations with Africa has probably never been as intense as at the present moment, both here in Parliament and outside. The Government welcomes that; my Department and I welcome that too, because we are continually deliberating on how to meet that challenge in the best possible manner.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to say that the Africa Division of my Department is the pivot on which everything hinges. The head of that Division is an official who has already been an ambassador. He holds the rank of a deputy secretary and he is assisted by capable and experienced officials. Amongst other things, the Africa Division is at present performing the <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0237"/>functions which are usually performed by an embassy abroad. They do so by paying regular routine visits to the various capitals and by means of consultations with ministers and officials of those countries. They also receive reciprocal visits from neighbouring states, and in that way personal contacts are built up, just as it is done by an ambassador and his staff in any country. In this regard I may say that the telephone is also playing a very important part, because our immediate neighbours are contacted telephonically on all levels virtually every day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout again trotted out his old hobby-horse, namely the question of diplomatic relations. I want to point out right away that diplomatic relations between the Republic and the other countries in Southern Africa do in fact exist. In some cases, however, we do not have permanent diplomatic representatives in those states. I must tell you frankly, Sir, that I believe that there will in fact be an exchange of diplomatic representatives with African states at some future stage, but let me add at once that that is not a real problem at the present moment. In this regard we may learn very useful lessons from our own history, particularly from the days of the Great Trek and the two Boer Republics. Our forefathers frequently sent or received envoys to negotiate with Bantu peoples about specific matters. But there was also one very important exception. No less a person than the late President Paul Kruger appointed a consul with diplomatic status and privileges to represent the Transvaal Republic in Matabeleland, which was then governed by Lobengula, who was on friendly terms with the Transvaal Republic. That consul was a certain Piet Grobler, a farmer and businessman, originally from Waterberg and later from Ermelo. There may be relatives of his in this House. He was appointed to go to Bulawayo, the capital of Matabeleland, in the capacity of consul for a period of two years, taking his family with him. Unfortunately he was not there for very long, because he was murdered by members of some other people during a journey which he undertook in a neighbouring state. But despite this precedent as regards diplomatic representation in our own history, I want to say that at this stage there is no need to exchange permanent representatives with African states in which we do not have such representatives yet. In the first place it is far too expensive, and the exorbitantly high costs involved are not justified and cannot be afforded by the parties concerned. Secondly, the present arrangements are quite satisfactory to ourselves as well as to those states. Nor, in the third place, is it quite novel or unprecedented to arrange relations between states in this fashion. It may not be generally known, but in the Middle East certain friendly neighbouring states follow exactly the same procedure in their negotiations. In other words, they conduct their mutual affairs without having permanent representatives in the capitals of the friendly countries. In that regard, therefore, there is really no problem whatsoever that need cause hon. members any concern at this stage.</p>

<p>A good deal has been said and written recently on the necessity for putting into operation new machinery to promote co-operation with Africa, and it is therefore essential that I should give the House the assurance that satisfactory administrative arrangements are already in existence as regards both economic and technical co-operation, in that there is a permanent inter-departmental advisory committee for co-operation with foreign countries, and its chairman is the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In the past, over a period of many years, that committee concentrated mainly on foreign trade relations. The committee is in fact called the Foreign Trade Relations Committee. In recent times the committee has also advised the Government on wider co-operation with other states. This committee has, for example, rendered very valuable services with regard to questions and proposals which arose as a result of my recent visit to South America. At the moment they have their hands full with affairs concerning Africa, and this will be the case to an ever-increasing extent. One of their principal functions is to co-ordinate. Not only do they form the link among the various Government Departments concerned, but members of that committee, who are usually heads of Government Departments, are also in constant contact with institutions such as the I.D.C. and the C.S.I.R., and also with private concerns interested in co-operation with foreign countries. I should like to use this opportunity to thank the private sector for their interest and for the assistance we have received from them. They need never hesitate to come and talk to me or my Department: we shall always receive them and assist them, in consultation, of course, with the relevant departments.</p>

<p>I do not believe the increased activity will involve exceptionally large additional expenditure for the State. The Government will of course have to decide from time to time on specific projects which may involve large capital expenditure, such as the Kunene scheme, which we have already commenced with, but in general it should be possible to render technical assistance in quite a few fields at relatively low cost, as we are already doing. Time does not permit me to deal with further examples of such assistance, however, and I must conclude by saying that I am firmly convinced that we shall be able, through the channels which I have indicated and which we are already using, more and more to make important contributions to the development of African states which believe, as we do, that mutual respect and fruitful co-operation are possible between nations and governments in spite of their perhaps having divergent political views. I am firmly convinced that we shall succeed in that object and that we shall be able to prove to the world that peaceful co-existence in Southern Africa is possible provided that we always act in the same spirit as that in which the talks between our Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Lesotho were conducted.</p>

<from><span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0238"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>After the encouraging, semi-dream-world, from which I have to pull my thoughts&#x2014;with the friendship and cooperation which we all seek&#x2014;and which, according to the hon. the Minister, has been achieved to such a large extent in Africa, one wonders why it is that so much attention, so much thought and so much interest should be centred in this subject. The Minister has indicated to us that in area after area in which, judging by what one hears even over the S.A.B.C. and in the Government Press, we are under fire from all corners of Africa, in fact that should not be the position; that in fact we have channels of communication; that we have friends in Africa and that our assistance is being offered, accepted and utilized. Sir, what is it then that puts South Africa in the isolated position in which we find ourselves in the councils of the world? If there were this friendship, one would expect that it would show itself in some form or other: one would expect that some of these states with which friendly relations have been built up. would come to our aid and support when we need aid and support, in the discussions which take place at the United Nations and elsewhere. And yet we find this motion introduced by the hon. member for Middelland with a violent attack on the states of Africa, a violent attack on their leaders, on their forms of government, on their totalitarianism, on the non-representative character of their governments, an attack designed not to try to create the grounds for friendship but to point out how impossible it is to achieve friendship. We find the mover of the motion taking that line, pointing out the difficulties and problems and attacking the people with whom we seek friendship. On the other hand we find the Minister telling us that that friendship has in fact already been created. I do not believe that we should bluff ourselves; neither do I believe that we should regard everyone as being against us and take too gloomy a view of our situation in the world. What we have to do is to keep our feet on the ground and neither bluff ourselves into a sense of false security nor to allow ourselves to become despondent because of the difficulties that we face. I think one of the problems has become very clear from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. Towards the end of his speech he made it clear that his policy and the policy of the Government was an <i>ad hoc</i> policy, a policy of dealing <i>ad hoc</i> with different states and with individual problems, a policy of sending missions and technicians or having discussions at Government level as and when circumstances necessitate it.</p>

<p>You cannot force the pace.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir. I accept that you cannot force the pace, but I also accept that you must have a policy. You must have a plan; you cannot deal with international relations on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, hoping that here and there you will make some progress, because by the time you get round the circle and pick up the threads again, you have lost what goodwill may already have been created. Our reason for moving an amendment to this motion is that while we agree wholeheartedly with the need and the desire of the people of South Africa, of all races and all parties, for a state of peaceful co-existence and fruitful co-operation with the states of Afrca, we believe that it cannot be achieved either by wishful thinking or by <i>ad hoc</i>, half-baked measures. We believe that there must be proper planning, more positive, more realistic and more urgent progress towards the achievement of that state of peaceful co-existence. Time is one of the factors of which we are short; time is one of the things that we cannot play with, because with each passing year we lose time which we can never regain. The purpose of our amendment is to pin-point what we believe to be the urgency plus the need for greater planning and greater intensity in our efforts to achieve the objectives set out by the hon. member for Middelland. Therefore whilst we are the first people to express our joy when progress is made in any field, just as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout conveyed his congratulations and expressed our wholehearted support of the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister in his dealings with the Prime Minister of Lesotho, so in the other fields in which progress has been made, the Government has our full support, but we believe that it must go further than that and that it must go faster than it is going to-day. I regret that I cannot accept that everything in the garden is as rosy as the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has indicated. Listening to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech one wished that one could remain in this House instead of having to find oneself in another world when one walks out here at half past six or seven o&#x2019;clock. One wished that one could remain in this happy situation outlined here by the hon. the Minister. But unfortunately we cannot remain here. We are going to have to go out tonight and if we are unfortunate enough to have to listen to &#x201C;Current Affairs&#x201D; we are going to hear of the unfairness of the attacks made on South Africa by the states of Africa and of all the evil that takes place in those countries. That reality is thrown at us day after day, so we cannot remain in the atmosphere of this debate; we must go out and face those other realities, the things which the hon. the Minister did not tell us about. I have very little time at my disposal and so I cannot deal at any length with the detail of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. I want to take the opportunity, however, to put forward an idea which I had framed as a private member&#x2019;s motion but which fell away in view of the priority of this motion. This is one of the practical suggestions which could be applied for hastening and improving contact on the technical and economic level with the states of Africa. I want to put to the Minister the suggestion that we should create in South Africa an organization of voluntary specialists in the various fields who would be available to <span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0239"/>assist those states who are friendly towards us and willing to accept such assistance. Thereby, instead of the <i>ad hoc</i> kind of contact which the hon. the Minister himself sketched, instead of aiding one country with mineral development and another with another problem, instead of individual assistance such as is being given to Lesotho by two prominent South African citizens, namely the principal of the Natal University and a leading industrialist, assistance could be co-ordinated into a planned machine. I am thinking of something on a much higher level as far as technical skill is concerned than the American Peace Corps but nevertheless something along those lines where specialists in the various fields in which African nations require assistance could be co-ordinated by the Government, financed where necessary by the Government, and placed at the disposal of the states of Africa. We here in South Africa have at our disposal people far better acquainted with the problems and individual characteristics of the African continent than many of the countries who are to-day lending aid to Africa. We know the problems of Africa and we know the peoples of Africa. We know the peculiar circumstances which you cannot learn in books and which are part of the feel of being part of the continent itself. Just as members on that side, so we too accept that South Africa is a permanent and integral part of the African continent.</p>

<p>That knowledge and that feel for Africa is something which we should be making available on a much larger scale and on a much better planned basis than the giving of <i>ad hoc</i> assistance wherever we can slip it in in regard to one or other isolated problem. The fields in which we can assist are for instance, education, soil conservation, water conservation, mining, transport, communications, and all those other fields where our conditions and our problems are similar to those of the rest of the continent. Instead of that we stand back and we allow other countries less conversant with the needs and problems of Africa to give the assistance and therefore to exercise their indirect influence on the progress of many states. I feel that the Government should give a lead in this regard. It is all very well having a foreign aid committee with the Secretary for Foreign Affairs as the chairman but that aid should make use of the best of the brains available from the whole of our country and should channel that assistance wherever it can be used and wherever it will be accepted. One could deal at some length with the sort of work which could be done and the sort of assistance that could be given. One could deal at length with the sort of problem in regard to which we could give guidance where other countries may not be able to do so, but I think the issue is so clear, it is so straightforward and understandable that one does not need to go into those details.</p>

<p>This is one of the positive practical suggestions amongst many others which could and should be considered to try to speed the tempo at which we can build up our friendship and co-operation with those States willing to work with us. In building up that co-operation we will have to face many of the problems listed by the hon. member for Middelland and it is no use our bluffing ourselves that we can close our eyes to the realities or the hurdles which we will have to cross before we achieve the ideal of co-operation. Those hurdles are the hurdles of the Government&#x2019;s own making in many cases and which the hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs has got to jump. He has an unenviable problem and task because he is fighting not only the outside world but he is also to a large extent fighting against the deeds of his own Government and his own party. It is in that sense that we will have to take a broader look at our approach to the problems of international co-existence within the African continent. Therefore we on this side of the House, supporting as we do the ideal and the aim of this motion, cannot accept that we have gone far or fast enough and we in our amendment urge the Government to take more active, more realistic and more urgent steps to achieve that ideal. I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in entering this debate, I am, possibly to the surprise of hon. members, not going to be political at all. I am going to try to keep the whole question of for instance the race relations in South Africa out of this very important issue to-day. I do so for several reasons because I think that I have made my attitude on this aspect of the matter very clear on innumerable occasions and pointed out the need for change if basic relationships between ourselves and the rest of the world, let alone the African continent, are to change. Therefore I do not want to repeat any of those quite obvious things that I have said before. Furthermore, other members in the House to-day have I think highlighted this aspect of the problem. I want instead to make one or two practical suggestions to the hon. the Minister which I believe will speed up the process that he outlined for us this afternoon, a process which all of us are I am sure very glad to have learnt about and one to which, I must say, more publicity should be given. I feel that possibly the Government itself fails to highlight the better aspects of its own actions in the field of foreign relations. I think that there are many hon. members in this House who did not have full knowledge of the various steps which have been taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that they are good reasons why one does not broadcast everything that the Department of Foreign Affairs does, but I can see no good reason why the public of South Africa, the African States and the world at large should not be told of the positive efforts that South Africa is making to assist the under-developed countries <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0240"/>in Africa. I can see no good reason why in fact these good aspects of South Africa should be kept from the world. We are always complaining about the unfavourable publicity we get overseas. It may in some measure be due to the fact that we do not bother to put out any of the good news about South Africa. I think that we might have a better reception overseas if we did put out this good news.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has told us that there are many technicians who are South Africans working in the rest of Africa and that we are available for advice and consultation on many of the problems confronting the African States. This of course is as it should be. I agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that of course there are other countries that are doing far more in Africa than we are. I am not talking of the very rich countries like the U.S.A. whose last annual expenditure, to my knowledge, on aid for Africa came to as much as &#x0024;200 million. I am not discussing countries of that magnitude and with those resources to spend. I am not even discussing the amount of aid given for instance by Britain to the African territories, or even France. I am talking of a small country like Israel which has done a remarkable job and I think the hon. Minister knows that they are&#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, they do not have a hostile climate against them because they do not have a racial policy similar to that of this country. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>An HON. MEMBER; Did you say that they do not have a racial problem?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not say that. I said they do not have a policy of discrimination. I should like to keep this on a nonpolitical basis, but it seems that I am not going to be allowed to do so. The point is that a country that small is able to send hundreds of technicians to the African countries. This is naturally being responded to with a great deal of friendship from those African states, and indeed the other way around as well. They invite African students to come to Israel to attend their university to acquire knowledge at first-hand. It might interest hon. members to know that when I paid a visit to Israel a few years ago I was interested to find Africans studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, one from French-speaking Africa and one from English-speaking Africa. The interesting thing is that the only common language that these two African students had was Hebrew. There they were, conversing in Hebrew. The whole atmosphere of friendship and exchange has been engendered by this type of assistance. I believe that we could be doing far more in this field. We have, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) rightly said, a first-hand knowledge of conditions in Africa, namely climatic conditions, conditions of the soil, geographical conditions and geological factors, etc., and in these fields we could render enormous assistance to our African neighbours. I would say that the hon. the Minister should not hesitate to ask for further allocations of money in order to extend our programme of technical and other assistance to the rest of Africa. Let us spend less on defence and more on this form of buying friendship. It will pay more handsomely and I assure this House that the dividends will be far greater. It was the American Secretary for Defence who said that one can go just so far in purchasing peace by buying military hardware. I think we have gone far enough in our purchases of military hardware. We should now be doing something about buying friendship. That would be a much more important commodity for future generations.</p>

<p>Is it paying off in England?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I think it is paying off, strangely enough. One of the ways in which we can do this, apart from rendering high-level technical assistance, which I think we are obviously in a good position to do, is for us to take a positive interest in the difficulties encountered by the under-developed African states in establishing themselves as stable trading nations of the world. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs will know all about organizations such as E.C.A. and organizations such as the United Nations Committee for Trade and Development, U.N.C.T.A.D., as it is called, with the 77 developing nations that belong to it, which are going to have a meeting sometime this year. They are going to attempt to achieve a stabilization of prices of crops, for instance. One of the great difficulties of the African states is that many of them are onecrop exporting countries and they have the most tremendous difficulty because prices are not stabilized throughout the world. South Africa should be making encouraging noises in the international trade circles in which she moves about the stabilization of prices of these staple crops from the African countries. This is one very important thing which could be done to help these countries become more economically viable. This is their main problem. They are all learning that economic independence must of necessity carry with it some form of economic viability if there is to be any future for them.</p>

<p>The other thing that we can do, which I believe is important, is to assist in the establishment of some form of preferences in African trade to assist those countries to get on their feet as exporting countries. I think this is very important. That would be another way in which we could assist them.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not know&#x2014;in fact, this is one of the things the hon. the Minister deemed it better for us not to know&#x2014;what we are doing about contributing to the Growth and Aid Fund which has been set up for the underdeveloped countries. I believe that the ideal to <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0241"/>be aimed at has been estimated at 1% of gross national product to be given by developed countries for this fund to assist the under-developed countries. The figure of 1% has not been attained by anybody. I think the country which has come the closest to this figure is France with a figure of .67%.</p>

<p>Our own problem is that we have so many of our own under-developed areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I fully appreciate that we have under-developed areas within our own country. Of course, my solution to that is for us to consider South Africa as one economic unit and to allow White capital and enterprise to assist in the development of those areas and not to rely only on governmental sources as we are doing at the present stage. My attitude towards that is naturally different from that of the hon. the Minister. We clearly must do something about making our contribution towards the development of the under-developed countries if we want to keep our place and our prestige as one of the modern industrial countries of the world, which I believe we certainly should be rated as, or certainly will be in the near future.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say that there is a third way in which we can assist. That is in the establishment of something at a lower level than the one suggested by the hon. member for Durban (Point) namely, the technical assistance which we should be giving to these countries. I believe that we should be establishing something on the lines of the American Peace Corps. I think that would be an excellent thing for us to do not only from the point of view of improving the race relations and the human relations with the other African states, but also to give our own young people an outlet of service. I think this is very important in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Peace Corps is very successful. I shall come to that in a minute. Our young people should be given the opportunity of volunteering for service in our own reserves, in the adjoining territories such as the former High Commission Territories (now the two independent territories and Swaziland) and in the other states of Africa. America and Britain are both doing magnificent work in this field. This is not highly qualified technical assistance. These corps, both the British Overseas Voluntary Service Corps and the American Peace Corps, the first of which was established in 1958 and the last-mentioned one by the Kennedy Administration in 1961, are aimed at young people who generally spend a year after leaving school and before going to university in this way, or otherwise go after they have attained their degrees at university and before they have embarked on their full-time careers. In other words, they offer a year or two of service.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>They may be immature people, Sir, but they are nevertheless people with the spirit of service. This is very important for young people and the hon. member should not sneer at it. It is something which is very important. At the present stage there are something like 12,000 to 14,000 young Americans working in 46 countries all over the world. Many of them are working in East Africa and in West Africa. They are bringing assistance; they are teaching; they are helping to build; they are nursing; they are teaching the elements of agriculture, of hygiene, to people who badly need such instruction. In Britain too there is a voluntary service organization under whose auspices young British people are working in every country in the world, and in particular in Africa. It seems to me that it would be an excellent thing for the South African Government, not to run such an organization, but for the Government simply to give its blessing and some financial aid and allow this to arise out of the voluntary efforts of the young people themselves. [Interjection.] The hon. member is distressed at the thought. Has he no confidence in the ability of our young people to give as good service in under-developed countries as the young people of Britain and America? I may say that many other countries have started these corps as well. The territories themselves are learning by example and are using their own more educated people in turn to render service in their less developed areas. I believe that this would be an excellent way for South Africa to assist those countries and at the same time to earn a great deal of goodwill for South Africa. I believe it would be an excellent thing for our own young people to be given this opportunity for service.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with great interest that I listened to the hon. member for Houghton. Her speech was to a great extent merely another attempt to present her policy of integration here in the House of Assembly. The hon. member accused the hon. the Minister of according insufficient publicity to these attempts and assistance which is being rendered from time to time by his Department to Africa states. But the hon. member must bear in mind that there are many matters&#x2014;as the hon. the Minister rightly stated by way of interjection&#x2014;which are in a delicate state of negotiation, and if these matters were now to be given loud publicity it would only afford the hon. member and her party another opportunity of confounding our diplomatic relations abroad. From what I could gather from the criticism which has in the past been levelled by the hon. member and her party both here and abroad, it is clear that their only aim is to place every possible obstacle in the way of the Government and of this hon. Minister so that our overseas policy may not succeed. She also referred to the number of technicians being sent by Israel to African countries, but <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0242"/>she omitted to say that they never sent any to Arabian countries. Now I also want to say to the hon. member that these things are not all done for altruistic reasons. She is probably as aware as other hon. members are that Israel to-day is as great a diplomatic problem at the United Nations as South Africa is. To a certain extent they are sending these people in order to gain favour for their country when voting takes place at U.N. I see nothing wrong in that but I just want to point out to the hon. member that that is one of the principal reasons why a small country like Israel, with such a small population, is sending so many technicians and people to African countries.</p>

<p>I now wish to return to this idea of a peace corps which is being advocated by the hon. member. As we all know this peace corps has had a very tragic history for there are few countries in which the corps had been successful. I wish to refer to only one example and that is the tremendous <i>faux pas</i> which a woman member of the peace corps made a few years ago in Nigeria when she sent a letter to a family member in America in which she criticised very severely the conditions which she had encountered in Nigeria, <i>inter alia</i>, the extremely unhygienic conditions in which the natives there were living. It caused such a tremendous furore and the repercussions were so widespread that the lady in question had to be recalled to America.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>With one example you condemn the whole scheme.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>There are very few cases in Africa where the scheme has really succeeded. The plea made here by the hon. member, namely that White boys and girls from South Africa be sent to neighbouring countries, is merely another clever political wile to try and promote political integration between Whites and non-Whites so that they can, at that impressionable and indoctrinable stage in their lives, come into contact with integrated social conditions.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say the following. It was with great interest that I listened to the hon. the Minister and that anecdote he told us about the consul&#x2014;a certain Piet Grobler&#x2014;who in President Paul Kruger&#x2019;s time was sent to Matabeleland. It seems to me it is a dangerous diplomatic post. If one considers what is happening in Africa today, if one considers what happened to General Ironsi and Tafewa Balewa in Nigeria, where they were thrown to the vultures, then I should like to request the hon. the Minister here this afternoon preferably to make use of roving ambassadors.</p>
