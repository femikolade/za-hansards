<p>Whether his Department has conducted a survey to establish the number of war veterans of the 1914-&#x2019;18 war who would be eligible for the war veterans&#x2019; pension if the means test were abolished; if so, (a) what was the result of the survey and (b) what is the estimated additional expenditure involved; if not, why not.</p>

<p>No (a) and (b) fall away.</p>

<p>There is no reason why the means test should be abolished in respect of these veterans in that, for war veterans who have attained the age of 70 years, the means limit has been extended considerably and those who are in need of financial assistance are already in receipt of such assistance.</p>

<from>Mr. G. N. OLDFIELD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Indian Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) How many Indian children are at present attending schools in Natal and (b) how many are receiving meals in terms of the school feeding system;</li>

<li>(2) whether his Department intends to withdraw the present school feeding system; if so, (a) from what date and (b) for what reason;</li>

<li>(3) whether his Department intends to assist under-nourished school children: if so, (a) in terms of what authority, (b) on what basis will assistance be granted and (c) what will the maximum assistance per child be.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_indian_affairs" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) Latest available figure as at December, 1966, is 132,006.</li>

<li>(b) 87,695 now receive supplementary feeding.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(a) 1st April, 1967.</li>

<li>(b) The school feeding scheme which was taken over from the Natal Provincial Administration sought to provide supplementary nourishment to indigent pupils in primary schools on a monetary allocation of 1-2/3c per indigent pupil per school day. The Natal Provincial Administration recently abolished all school feeding schemes, thereby bringing the position in Natal into line with the other three provinces.<br/>The Department of Indian Affairs is of the considered opinion that the feeding of children is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the home and the parents. Any feeding at school must of necessity be inadequate. since children attend school for approximately 200 days per year only. Furthermore the feeding <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_0964"/>scheme was intended merely to supplement the basic meals of indigent children.<br/>The fate of pre-school children in indigent homes must also be taken into consideration. If supplementary feeding becomes essential, it would be more efficacious if feeding could be supplemented in the home. Supplementary feeding must, therefore, be viewed as a welfare service rather than as an education service.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(3) Yes.</li>

</ol>

<p>(a), (b) and (c) My Department, through the welfare services it administers, already affords considerable financial assistance and relief to Indians whose circumstances are such that they are unable to provide for themselves and their families. Favourable consideration will be given to applications for relief or assistance by parents of children who were provided with free supplementary meals at schools under its control, provided that the parents qualify under the prescribed regulations and my Department is satisfied that the parents are unable to provide adequate sustenance for their children. School principals have already been requested to bring to notice cases of serious underfeeding among their pupils.</p>

<p>The extent of the assistance or relief provided will depend upon the circumstances of the family concerned and the welfare scheme under which the necessary assistance can be granted.</p>

<heading>NATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last evening I had made reference to the Cape Education Ordinance of 1956, an Ordinance which was introduced by the Nationalist Party-controlled Provincial Council, under a Nationalist-appointed Administrator, an Ordinance which was accepted by the Nationalist Party in the Cape Province and an Ordinance the terms of which have so far been honoured by the Nationalist Party in the Cape Province. Sir, I think it is necessary that I should perhaps remind you of certain of the provisions of this Ordinance, and <b>I</b> propose to read two sections to you to indicate what was Cape Nationalist policy as recently as 1956. <b>I</b> read first of all from section 182 (1) of the ordinance. This provides for the medium of instruction up to Std. VIII&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The medium of instruction of every pupil in all standards in a school up to and including the eighth standard shall be either Afrikaans or English according to which of these languages he knows the better, provided that if the pupil knows both the said languages equally well, the medium of instruction of such pupil in the said standards shall be either Afrikaans or English as the parent may elect, and if the parent fails to exercise such right of election, as the principal teacher may decide.</block>

<p>It goes on further to include this further proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And provided, further, that on admission of a pupil to the sixth standard the parent of such pupil may claim to have the medium of instruction of such pupil changed if he produces a certificate by the principal teacher of the school at which such pupil passed the fifth standard, countersigned by an inspector of schools, to the effect that such pupil knows both languages sufficiently well to be able to receive instruction in either medium.</block>

<p>That is up to Std. VI.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I would then proceed to read section 183 of this ordinance for the information of the hon. member for Malmesbury and others who sat in the Provincial Council at that time. Section 183 (1) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The medium of instruction of every pupil in the 9th and 10th standards of a school shall be Afrikaans or English, as the parent may elect.</block>

<p>Now it will be seen that the Cape Nationalist Party in the Provincial Council of this province enshrined in the educational system this particular ordinance which contains certain basic factors. The first is that at least in the Cape there is recognition of the fact of bilingualism; in other words, that a pupil might well receive instruction in either of the official languages, and if such a situation were to arise, that the parent should elect in which language that child should receive instruction after Std. V. Up to Std. V the ordinance enshrined what was the recommendation of educationalists, namely that in the primary standards, up to Std. V, it was desirable that the language in which the child was most proficient, the home language, the mother tongue, should be the medium of instruction. Thirdly, this ordinance accepted that there were three categories in which parental choice should operate. The hon. member for Algoa yesterday&#x2014;I can only attribute it to ignorance of what has occurred in this province&#x2014;attributed any suggestion of parental choice to some sort of aftermath of British sentiment. Sir, the parental choice was accepted in the Cape Province by the Nationalist Party and by the United Party and it has worked successfully. In the limited time still available for this debate I hope that one or other of the hon. members who fought strenuously for this ordinance in the Provincial Council and who now sit on the other side of the House will tell us why there has been this change of approach. This system in the Cape has stood the test of time. It has offered a certain flexibility for our children and it has been used by English-speaking as well as Afrikaans-speaking parents. This latitude has been and is being used by hon. members on that side of the House. They deem it is sufficiently good for their own children that they can use this latitude and choose to send their children to an English-medium school, but they wish to deny it to the rest of the country. I want to ask hon. members opposite whether one of them will tell me that the University of Stellenbosch suffers because of the number of students from English-speaking schools in the Cape who go to that university? They go to the university because they are able to mix with the Afrikaans-speaking students. They have been able to mix with both language groups in the schools and they are able to switch to higher education in either language with great ease and to the benefit of the universities concerned. [Interjections.] <b>I</b> believe and <b>I</b> accept that the Cape tradition is perhaps foreign to a number of members of this House. It is something they do not understand, but <b>I</b> want to draw attention to the fact that we have just celebrated the fifth year of the <span class="col_1905-1906" refersTo="page_0970"/>Republic and a little before that, in 1960, we celebrated the 50 years of Union. <b>I</b> want to remind you, Sir, of the words used by Mr. N. J. de Wet, former Chief Justice of South Africa on that occasion, and I want to ask whether we are progressing in the right direction in the legislation we are discussing to-day. Mr. De Wet said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Few, if any, of the leading figures that shaped the Union will find anything to rejoice about on this 50th anniversary of its founding. Apart from lip service, they would find little done to realize their ideal of welding Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans into one united nation. As one of the minor figures, it has been a great privilege to know practically every one of the great men of the Convention and to observe and admire the high ideals and lofty expectations for the unity of South Africa which had inspired them. Yet to-day in the educational sphere English- and Afrikaans-speaking children were not allowed to attend the same schools.</block>

<p>That was the criticism in 1960. What criticism would come from those members of the Convention, those founders of our nation, if they were able to sit here to-day and observe the legislation now before the House?</p>

<p>Sir, I believe that this is misguided legislation, and I say it with the utmost respect. I believe it is misguided because it provides that education policy in future will be prescribed by the Minister and he will put education into blinkers. It will replace the development in the mind of the scholar, the capacity to think, to reason and to decide according to the ageless principles of morality which do not need laws to enforce them. Our history in this country from its commencement has been strengthened by the determination of our people of English and of Afrikaans and of Huguenot extraction to get away from regimentation in the bringing up of their children. Now we attempt in this Bill to regiment to do what was abhorrent to the Huguenots and to the 1820 Settlers and to the Voortrekkers&#x2014;to regiment the education of our children.</p>

<p>I want to take one other aspect. I do not wish to deal with the necessity of a religious and proper Christian background, which <b>I</b> accept. <b>I</b> do not want to question the necessity for an understanding of true South Africanism in education. <b>I</b> accept it. But what <b>I</b> cannot accept, and what the country cannot accept, is that the control by the parent of the child should be subject to the direction of the Minister. <b>I</b> would ask you this, Sir. Is the institution of marriage merely so that the parents can complete the biological function of producing children and then hand them over to the State? <b>I</b> would ask hon. members opposite to look, when they talk about Christian principles to be enshrined in this Act, at the service of marriage in their church and my church, to look at the service of baptism in their church and my church, and to say whether it is inherent that the State shall say how the child shall be educated, where and in what manner, or whether there is not a sacred responsibility on the parent, until the child has attained manhood? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to deal with one or two other matters in regard to the method in which this new system of education will be applied, this system which some hon. member with a fertile imagination has described as the Magna Charta of education in South Africa. What is the position? There is the sugar-coating. The Nationalist Press gave great publicity to it before this Bill came before this House. They gave it the sugar-coating that there would be uniform conditions of service, a provision which will benefit many who labour under disadvantages at present. It contains provisions that there will be free schooling and free books. That will benefit many who wish to save the cost of educating their children. It provides that there will be uniform salaries paid throughout the Republic, and this is of obvious advantage to many teachers who are discriminated against. It provides that the parent community shall be given a place in the educational system&#x2014;pious words, without any detail as to the manner in which they will exercise it. But these provisions collectively are merely the sugar-coating to the inner pill, which <b>I</b> believe is dangerous and something which this House should not be prepared to accept. This Bill provides, firstly, that the Minister shall observe what the hon. member for Kensington referred to as the Ten Commandments. But this is a facade to the fact that behind it is the authoritarian power of the Minister in terms of this Bill. What is he going to do? He is going to consult a council, but who are the members of the council? The members are appointed by the Minister and can be discharged by the Minister at will. He even goes so far as to say who shall represent the provinces on that council. <b>I</b> would have thought that the hon. members for Odendaalsrus and Benoni, whom <b>I</b> have seen at Administrators&#x2019; conferences which <b>I</b> have attended, fighting for the autonomy and the rights of their provinces, would have asked the hon. the Minister, as <b>I</b> will ask, whether he will not allow the provinces to nominate their own two representatives on that council? Will he not permit these teachers&#x2019; associations, whose suggestions will be considered provided they have had the blessing of recognition by the Minister, to appoint some people to the Council? He will call the Administrators to consult with him, and then no doubt he will meditate, and then comes what to me is the most extraordinary provision in any piece of legislation that <b>I</b> have ever seen. <b>I</b> refer to clause 2 (3). When the Minister has taken himself away and has quietly decided what policy he is going to adumbrate, he will then give notice &#x201C;in such manner as he deems fit&#x201D;. Having decided in solitude as to what is the right policy, he will then himself say how that policy is to be <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0971"/>conveyed to the parents and the country in general. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that no educationist is taken in by this so-called consultation and by these so-called councils of advice which will advise the Minister. If the Minister wishes to acquire and build up some co-ordinated education policy for this country, then surely he has this machinery now. He holds Administrators&#x2019; conferences. He has his superintendent-generals of education and directors of education or their deputies who can confer and settle a policy. If there is suspicion and hesitation in the country as regards the acceptance of this Bill, then it is the very powers which the Minister desires to take unto himself in this Bill which are the cause of these suspicions and the cause of the unrest in our education circles. It is still possible at this stage for the hon. the Minister to give some semblance of standing, of educational background to this council which he proposes to establish. That was done in the 1962 legislation. He still had latitude, although he did not please everybody, in the exercising of his powers but at least there was some attempt to create a council which was representative of education in all parts of the country. The Minister, I believe, can still undertake in respect of this clause 3 to accept amendments to make that council a truly representative one and with which he will consult, a council which will not be bound to his grace and favour for its appointment or ultimate removal.</p>

<p>I believe that the Bill as it is before us is a step in the wrong direction. I believe that the law which we have had enshrined in the ordinance of the Cape Province is the correct approach which should be made to education. I believe that it has worked. We have had the co-operation and the support of parents and past pupils to build up this education system. It is a system under which we have witnessed in our cities, as is the case at Rondebosch for instance the establishment of the great new Groote Schuur Hoërskool, planned in advance by a committee of parents, supporting, strengthening and taking a direct interest in that school, as parents have done in the past in the case of Rondebosch Boys&#x2019; High School or any other of the big schools. But that spirit will disappear and all that will remain will be for parents to take the instructions from the hon. the Minister as to how education shall be conducted. I believe that, that will be a fatal step in the educational life of our people.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise at this advanced stage of the debate, firstly to deal with the comments of certain members of the Opposition and then to confine myself to what I regard as the broad fundamental basis of this legislation. The hon. member for Durban (North) tried to make a point regarding the clause in the Bill which provides that a Christian character shall be pursued in this education policy. What is not quite clear to me and what I hope the speakers following me will be more explicit on is what exactly is meant by that. It is generally known that the first section of our Constitution Act professes and provides for such a view of life and of the world. For this and for other reasons the viewpoint set out by the hon. member for Durban (North) is not quite clear to me, except that it seeks to disseminate and arouse suspicion. I have a further problem, namely the objection to the description of the broad national character. Broad nationalism is in no way founded on the narrow concept of race theories and restricted political views, but on love for one&#x2019;s family, one&#x2019;s own state, Christian convictions, respect for the past and the desire for liberty which is founded on selfcontrol and self-respect. In view of the fact that there have been references to the difference between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking South African citizens, I should like the Opposition speakers to explain to me whether the Afrikaans- and English-speaking citizens do not have this concept of broad nationalism in common. The hon. member for Salt River said that despite the assurance in the wording of this Bill and that given by the Minister in his second speech, he saw politics in the Bill. I think the time has come to remove these political spectacles of the Opposition for a moment. Is it their opinion, by implication, that there are English-speaking South Africans who do not share or cherish this attitude regarding our Christian and broad national views? They should tell us, because the public outside wants to know that. Here it is in the Bill&#x2014;the broad national and the Christian character in accordance with which our training shall take place.</p>

<p>I want to refer the hon. member for Durban (North) to what the British Church said as long ago as 23rd April, 1923, regarding the liberal viewpoint which is propagated as the antipode of the viewpoint embodied in this Bill. It is reported in the <i>Church Times</i> of London, of 23rd April, 1923. They cautioned against the godless, scientific humanism, the Bolshevism, which sought to destroy the Christian faith and the English Church. Does the hon. member for Durban (North) acknowledge and accept this statement and viewpoint on the part of his own church, when he ventures into theological views such as those which he tried to advocate? I think it is time we settled this matter. On the very narrow front of the United Party and the attitudes they adopted in the past few days, specifically in respect of these two basic principles, namely the Christian character and the broad national character <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0972"/>which education is to assume, are they advocating the standpoint of nationalism in its true sense or are they advocating the standpoint of the liberalism, which endeavours to strike at this specific attitude to life? Liberalism knows that if it succeeds in striking at the tradditional and cultural heritage of a nation, it can also automatically neutralize and cause the extinction of that nation&#x2019;s urge for liberty and national determination. Do we find in the standpoints of the Opposition an unexpressed revelation of the alliance with this line of thinking, as revealed throughout the world? Is it a &#x201C;phoney&#x201D; front under the colours of pretended South African piety, but with one hand behind the back, in the power of liberalism, which does not promote national control but liberal tyranny in the world and also in this country? This is an appalling and sobering basic truth in respect of which the United Party should give us some clarity in this debate. They should say whether in the attitude they have adopted in respect of this Bill they are entering into an alliance with liberalism and with those people who want to undermine everything which is traditional and cultural in order that they may also neutralize and ultimately destroy that nation&#x2019;s urge for selfdetermination. I think they owe it to the Christian and English-speaking citizens of South Africa to tell us where they stand in respect of this basic premise. There have been references to the restriction of the right of parents, etc. Clause 2 (1) (h) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The parent community be given a place in the education system through parent-teachers&#x2019; associations, school committees, boards of control, or school boards or in any other matter.</block>

<p>This is an acknowledgement of the parents&#x2019; democratic right to take an active part&#x2014;not a theoretical part&#x2014;as regards the education of his child. To this hon. members are adopting the attitude that they do not trust it, that it is autocratic, that it is being imposed from above. To me that reveals pretence. Those hon. members should reveal their true attitude, and motivate it in clear-cut terms, as this Bill is motivated.</p>

<p>On the front of human relations throughout the world the axiom that peace is war obtains at present. Cold wars are the order of the day, inside and outside virtually all national boundaries. The armament employed is neither the terrifying atom-bomb nor the military army, but front organizations, virtually innumerable ones, which launch one onslaught after another on the spiritual heritage of individuals and free nations. My question is: Is there an alliance between the liberal standpoint and pronouncements of the United Party and this world-wide phenomenon? As a weapon they employ the evil of undermining the cultural and traditional heritage of, take note, both White and black man. This weapon is used mainly by Communism, or to express it in more euphemistic terms, by scientific humanism. Their ideal and object are not national control and national rule, but liberal tyranny, and everything that hints of tradition and principle must be replaced by that which is lawless and unbridled. On the banner of the United Party and of their allies we read that they claim a liberal tyranny and liberal domination, and they do so in a hazy atmosphere of spiritual muddle and confusion. This is so; it is true&#x2014;a cold war, a war in peace-time.</p>

<p>This Opposition is engaged in no less in this country of ours. It is under these circumstances, and in view of the campaigns which have been launched and with which I should like to deal at greater length, that our Government is now introducing a national education Bill, a Bill which affects the education of our children and a Bill which is the most important bulwark against all these assaults. And a party, a &#x201C;phoney&#x201D; front here in South Africa, has the temerity to oppose it! If that cannot be explained as ignorance of what is happening around them, they are doing it from an ulterior motive&#x2014;political gain. There is no third alternative. Apart from the institution of the Republic and apart from the adoption of the principle of separate development of all the race groups in our country, I know no measure and I know of no greater effort on the part of this Government to act positively and with a view to the present juncture. In my view these are basically the ultimate motives for this legislation, and not the concealed motives which the United Party seeks to ascribe to us.</p>

<p>This Bill proposes to defend the greatest asset of any generation, the sound spirit and mind and the synchronized hands of its children, against those onslaughts. What responsibility can be greater? What effort can be more laudible than an effort to provide the means for securing this asset? This is indeed great legislation, and a great moment for the children of our country.</p>

<p>We read about front organizations such as the Hollywood Independence Citizens Committee of the Arts, Science and Professions, an organization which was described by the Californian Committee on un-American activities as &#x201C;the Communistic front to undermine and infiltrate the creators of the film and entertainment&#x201D;. [Interjections.] We read about the Anti-defamation League and its incomparable race integration ideologies as the public arm of Communism in foreign countries. We find manifestations of liberal infiltration in international student and trade-union organizations, and we read about expenditure of up to &#x0024;620 million per year by just one of these organizations, in order to bolster their onslaughts, onslaughts on what is traditional and essential to the survival of a nation. We read about church organizations which under the pretext of theological congresses discuss the physical overthrow of governments and autonomous states. Yes, Mr. Speaker, peace is war, <span class="col_1911-1912" refersTo="page_0973"/>and because this is the case, we thank the Minister and the Government all the more for this attempt to do away with the shortcomings in the efficiency on the front of the education of our youth, and for an attempt to establish a more effective national education policy by means of scientific planning, a policy which is aimed at the refinement of the human spirit, the enhancement of the talent and efficiency of our people, the development of the great potential of Western civilization and its reinforcement against the onslaughts of the vendors of those spiritual commodities which are trademarked &#x201C;liberal tyranny&#x201D;.</p>

<p>From the earliest days, from the times of the Celtic and Germanic romanticism, through the developing cultures of the Hellenics and the Romans, through the fabulous beauty of the Middle-ages, through the ennobling Renaissance period and down to the middle of the present century, the Arian Western civilization was characterized by its respect for tradition and the awareness of dignity in the human being, and by a great gift for realism, a gift derived from its love of order in the Creation. Directly opposed to this we now find the spiritual products of modern art, entertainment and politics&#x2014;which were also reflected in this debate&#x2014;products which are characterized by being consciously non-traditional, opposed to the concepts of human dignity, and which consequently lend priority to perverted, imperfect and warped psychopathic tendencies. Those are the alliances which are formed nowadays.</p>

<p>Although that is true to a large extent as far as the creative arts, such as painting and music, are concerned, it also applies to the applied arts, such as dancing and entertainments. Nowadays the plastic arts seize on abstract motives and reject realism virtually <i>in toto.</i> They want to break away from nature and its properties, from tradition and from nationhood. Where attempts are made to represent the human being, it is represented abstractly and the result is distortion&#x2014;of which we have a good example in the Gardens. The natural characteristics of mankind and state are sacrificed to the abnormal which is unnatural and, to us, devoid of all content, meaning and message. It neither is nor is allowed to be the aristocratic, the national or that which is founded on the community or the environment&#x2014;no, it has to be the personification of phantasy, the derivational; thus it moves further and further away from that which is conservative and natural.</p>

<p>Let us compare with this the bust of Julius Ceasar or the earlier Greek portraits of Alexander the Great, with their message of fine racial type and characteristic lines, in contrast with the faceless, raceless and masshumanitarian examples with which so many Christian churches in Europe are decorated nowadays.</p>

<p>The old Western music was and is characterized by pure note and melody; also as far as national music is concerned. A lofty appeal was made to the intellect and to the higher instincts in man. To what extent, I ask, are these characteristics now being replaced by the rhythm of the forest, coupled to an appeal to sensation and the primitive instincts in mankind?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am dealing with the onslaughts made on the survival of the traditional, and with the bulwark that education has to form against them.</p>

<p>The music trade has prepared the way not only for the assimilation but also for the idealizing of the forest dweller. Even now it is true of many Western countries that the cultural heroes of popular music are certainly no longer recognizable as Western. In most cases the heroes of popular music are non-White in origin. Where previously melody was coupled to elegance, sensation is now coupled to modern rhythms. Compare the traditional European dance to the &#x201C;limbo&#x201D;, the &#x201C;frug&#x201D; and &#x201C;Watusi&#x201D;. Compare the grace of classic ballet to the gymnastic practice pranks of modern ballet.

<p>This Bill does not provide for the realization of the narrow views which Opposition speakers find in it. For my part, the modern perils are so black and so red and matters on the battlefield of the spirit so disquieting that we are called upon to object firmly, positively and finely, and to build up fronts against this defeatism. We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the sham front of United Party criticism and other related negative fronts. For my part, the principle of this legislation is founded on the conviction that it has become urgently necessary to build up a defence against those onslaughts which are made on us and our children, onslaughts which are aimed at undermining our culture and traditions. This legislation is founded on the conviction that it is our bounden duty to create ways and means of safe-guarding our children against the results of these negative onslaughts, and at the same time to foster the positive spiritual and physical material offered by our children, inorder that there may be greater security as regards the survival of Western civilization on the continent of Africa.</p>

<p>I have listened attentively to the hon. member for Randburg and it appeared to me as though the hon. member wanted to entrust a virtually superhuman task to our educationists and to the <span class="col_1913-1914" refersTo="page_0974"/>hon. the Minister, because he wanted them to protect and safeguard the child and future generations in South Africa in such a way that no foreign ideologies whatsoever would have a chance to take root here. I want to tell the hon. member that he need not be so pessimistic, because all the things mentioned by him come about gradually. They come in cycles. From time to time it happens that people suddenly go in for wild dancing. The hon. member for Randburg gave a description of that which I do not want to repeat &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, wild dancing and mini-skirts. But essentially man always remains conservative; he wants to retain what he knows already, despite the onslaughts made on the human spirit, the human body and soul. I want to tell the hon. member that he need not be so pessimistic, and if he wanted to entrust this task to our educationists and to the Minister, he would be setting them a virtually superhuman task.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether we on this side of the House were not entering into an alliance with the world liberalists through our standpoint in respect of this Bill. No, I believe the attitude of this side of the House is truly South African, as we know South Africa and as we have built up South Africa with our two cultures, with the co-operation of both language groups in this country. This side of the House is most certainly not entering into the alliance with world liberalism to which the hon. member referred. This Opposition is firmly rooted in the soil of South Africa, and I think the hon. member is doing us an injustice when he accuses us of being prepared to co-operate with people and elements who are alien to our national tradition. Mr. Speaker, when the United Party Opposition adopts a certain attitude in this House on any legislative measure&#x2014;and that also applies to this Bill&#x2014;then we believe that we adopt that attitude in the interests of South Africa, with no liaison with anybody on the outside. This side of the House spurns any person or any element which seeks to force its attitude onto South Africa. They have no right to do so, and this Opposition is not prepared to listen to such elements.</p>

<p>I listened to the speeches made by hon. members on that side and in particular to the speech made by the hon. the Minister when he introduced the debate, and I wondered in what kind of a country we grew up; did we grow up in a barbaric un-Christian country? Did we grow up in a country where until now we have had no educational facilities? Did we grow up uncultured and illiterate? Listening to the way the hon. the Minister presented his case and judging by the reasons he advanced for this legislation, I thought that the progress we had made in the field of education had been very meagre until now and that only the steps the hon. the Minister was taking would help us here in South Africa to relinquish our barbarity and our unchristianity, and that through the adoption of this legislation a new day would break for South Africa. According to the hon. the Minister and according to other hon. members on that side, South Africa will now be able to wipe out its manpower shortage; once this Bill has been passed, we shall be able to churn out technologists, scientists and managers like sausages from a machine; give us a national education policy and we shall be able to solve all our problems. This measure is the magic wand we need to change this horrible South Africa, which cannot make any progress in the field of education, into a land of milk and honey, a country where in future we shall be able to pick up a scholar with heavy-rimmed spectacles and a brief-case under any tree. Once this legislation is passed, our thoughts in South Africa will be pure; our actions will always be correct; we will neither tell nor listen to a naughty joke; we will not even go and see a daring film. We must accept this Bill, for until now South Africa has been a Sodom and Gomorrah where no Commandment was obeyed. All this will be something of the past once we have a national education policy! What is more, once this legislation has been passed, we shall cherish no more unnational ideas; we shall all be inspired by a South African spirit, as the hon. member for Randfontein said. If one approaches on shipboard and one sees the blue Table Mountain appear in the distance, one will say: &#x201C;That is my old Table Mountain.&#x201D; The ship will move too slowly; for one will want to jump overboard and swim ashore, only too glad to breathe the air of Mother South Africa and to say: &#x201C;This is my country.&#x201D; That is the impression I got from the speeches made by hon. members on that side, that this legislation will be the Alpha and the Omega to place South Africa on the right track, on the way to Christianity, on the way to national sentiments, and will produce the very best results in education.</p>

<p>That is how hon. members on that side and the hon. the Minister wrapped this legislation in the wool of their imaginations&#x2014;pounds and pounds of imaginative wool&#x2014;and they have taken all this trouble to stop just one practice which they abhor, and that is the practice of so-called unnational elements in South Africa, according to them, who want to bring up their children in a language other than the mother tongue. That is the only reason for the introduction of this Bill. As long ago as 1959 we heard about this Bill from the then Deputy Minister of Education, Arts and Science, at present the Prime Minister of South Africa. According to <i>The Eastern Province Herald</i> of 29th September, 1959, he addressed a meeting at Fouriesburg. I quote from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Deputy Minister said the Nationalist Party felt that a national education policy <span class="col_1915-1916" refersTo="page_0975"/>should be introduced. A national education council would be appointed to advise on legislation, but education would not be taken out of the hands of the provincial councils. It would ensure that the basic principles, such as mother-tongue education, were applied as they were in all the provinces except Natal.</block>

<p>Even eight years ago it was said by the present Prime Minister that the object of this national education policy was to apply the principle of mother-tongue instruction in South Africa, as it is applied in all the provinces except Natal. The previous Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, said, according to <i>The Argus</i> of 8th August, 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">National education policy to be enforced, says Verwoerd. The Government would introduce legislation to enforce a national education policy.</block>

<p>I said that the hon. the Prime Minister said in 1959, when he was Deputy Minister of Education, Arts and Science, that legislation would be introduced to apply the concept of mothertongue instruction in all provinces except Natal. Despite all the fine words used here by hon. members on that side of the House, I see that as the only reason why this Bill is before the House to-day. If hon. members consulted Hansard on the debates held in this House five years ago, they would see that even then we told them that the proposed national advisory council was merely the forerunner of a national education policy. To-day we are just as strongly opposed to that national education council as we were then. At that time we told the hon. the Minister and members of the Select Committee put it to him very clearly, that we were prepared to give him a national education advisory council provided that that council would be constituted by the educationists of South Africa, who are best able to say whom they want on that council, but the hon. the Minister was not prepared to listen to that; he wanted to constitute that council in his own way. In terms of clause 2 of this Bill the principles of the education policy will be applied in South Africa in accordance with the ten principles set out therein. The attitude of this side of the House is consistent. Our attitude to-day is exactly the same as that which we adopted in 1962, when we said that we were not prepared to vote for the Minister&#x2019;s education council because the council would be constituted the wrong way, and, secondly, because it would be the forerunner of a national education policy. We maintain that a national education policy in South Africa is unnecessary. So far we have entrusted all those functions to the provinces and they have fulfilled those functions excellently, despite the fact that we may not like the temporary majority which happens to be in power in a particular province.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the speeches of some 15 members on that side of the House and I found the speech of the hon. member for Benoni rather surprising. What did the hon. member say? He said that it was not the task of education to bring about a united nation. I believe that there are many educationists on that side of the House who are qualified to speak on this subject, and here an hon. member who used to be a member of the Executive Committee of the Transvaal got up and said that it was not the task of education to bring about a united nation. How the hon. member could say anything like that surpasses my understanding, and that is why we entertain suspicions about this legislation. Hon. members on that side told us time and again: &#x201C;Surely you are not opposed to Christian national education?&#x201D; But an attitude exactly similar to that of the hon. member for Benoni was adopted by Professor Van Rooyen at that time. They do not see the necessity for bilingualism, and they do not see the necessity for mixing the two language groups on our school grounds. This is what Professor Van Rooyen said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want no language integration, cultural integration, religious integration or race integration. We are winning the medium struggle.</block>

<p>If the object of education is not to help to cultivate a united people in South Africa, what is its object? If the hon. member for Benoni was a teacher, he was most certainly not in the class of Professor Ben Taute in Stellenbosch, for what did that scholar teach us constantly, as future teachers, through his book on educational teaching? He said one does not simply offer the child an opportunity to learn to read and write and reckon, but that one should also make a good human being of him. What could be more educational in South Africa than helping our two language groups to come closer together? Surely that is education in the true sense of the word in our circumstances. I maintain that the statement made by the hon. member for Benoni is more or less like the objective of Christian national education, that bilingualism is not the object of education.</p>

<p>A further argument advanced by hon. members on the opposite side is that it is the duty of the State to protect the child of a foolish parent. But the parent is responsible every day and accepts more responsibilities every day in respect of his child. He is constantly taking decisions on behalf of the child. If the parent does not look after his child properly he is called a bad parent. The State has a responsibility only in extreme cases of ill-treatment, and then only to see to it that the parent is punished for such a crime. The parent is already accepting all responsibility for his child, and why should we not also entrust this responsibility to him? Surely it is extraordinary that he should have all responsibilities in respect of the child, and all we do not give him is the right to decide on the medium in which his child should be instructed.</p>

<p><span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_0976"/>Listening to some of the so-called educationists on that side of the House, I think it is a very good thing that the parent himself should decide on the medium through which a child is to be instructed, instead of leaving it to certain teachers and the State.</p>

<p>It was also said, and I want to conclude with this, that divided control should be abolished, but what is the case now? Here Parliament and the Minister will lay down the principles of a policy, but the provinces will be charged with executing them. In future this Parliament will have the right to talk about primary and secondary education, but the provinces may still do exactly the same as in the past. Surely that is nothing but more divided control. In due course Parliament will either have to take over primary and secondary education completely, or we shall find the position untenable and that the provinces and we will be able to decide on exactly the same matters. What is more, there will so frequently be the passing of the buck. We shall blame the provinces and they will blame Parliament. What will happen then? Then there will not be undivided control. Then, even more, there will be divided control in the future. We adhere to our opposition to this legislation, because we think that the council constituted by the hon. the Minister is the wrong one under the circumstances, and furthermore because we appreciate that the parent is the best person to decide on the fate of his child. The parent is no longer as ignorant as 50 years ago. They, too, have made some progress and they do only that which is in the interests of their children. I therefore want to conclude with the words written by Dewey in the chapter &#x201C;The Democratic Conception in Education&#x201D;, in his book <i>Democracy and Education&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Parents educate their children so that they may get on. Princes educate their subjects as instruments of their own purposes. Rulers are simply interested in such training as will make their subjects better tools for their own intentions.</block>

<p>And that is what the hon. the Minister wants to do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park said, <i>inter alia</i>, that one of the objects of education was to build a united nation. I am inclined to agree with him in that regard. It is one of the objects of education to produce good citizens for the country, but the difference is, of course, what kind of united nation is meant. If it is the united nation that the United Party pictures to itself, it will lead to a peculiar state of affairs, because in their nation they include the Blacks. The hon. member for Salt River said here that the Blacks were also part of the nation. As a matter of fact, their idea of a race federation includes the Blacks as part of the nation. They are also South Africans, as has already been said here by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as well. The United Party&#x2019;s concept of a nation is not the same as ours, nor is it the same as the one which is generally accepted as the correct scientific concept of a nation. I do not want to enlarge on that now, but I just want to point out that it depends a great deal on what kind of united nation one wants to be promoted by education.</p>

<p>The great deal of interest being shown in this legislation in our country is an indication of the intimate relationship that exists between education and the nation. It is true that the child is the focal point of education, as has been emphasized here by various hon. members, but the kind of nation that will be produced will depend largely on the kind of education received by the children of that nation.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is quite natural that the Opposition should be so concerned about what they call indoctrination, because the kind of nation the Opposition wants to build is not the same as what is generally regarded as a nation. They have their own idea of what the nation of South Africa should be.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be a nation without any principles. As their great former leader, General Louis Botha, said in 1905 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Questions of principle are the main causes of the disunity between Boer and Briton to-day. If we want to bring both nations together, we should not adopt too unbending an attitude. In the field of education we have had to yield.</block>

<p>That was what later came to be called conciliation. It was to produce that kind of united nation that General Botha had said that we should not adopt too unbending an attitude, and that principles were the main causes of the disunity between what he at that time called Boer and Briton. That is the nation they envisage, a nation without principles.</p>

<p>Secondly, it must be a nation without any inspiration, inspiration it would otherwise have derived from its own South African national tradition. It must be a &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; nation, a soft nation, and in order to bring that about, care should be taken in education not to tell the children that they have a national tradition of which they can be proud. For that reason the past should as much as possible be regarded as dead. For the united nation they want to produce they also regard it as dangerous to lay emphasis on the past or even to mention it, because they are afraid that the English-speaking section will take offence if the past is mentioned. For that reason it has always been and it is still being said that the past should be left alone. I mention this because the past is in many respects bound up with the history of education and the syllabuses. They do not realize that the English-speaking people in South Africa are no longer Britons, but that they are South Africans now. If their feelings are still offended if reference is made to the past in South Africa, they are not South Africans yet. I also want to say that I feel <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0977"/>much more at liberty to extend my hand to an English-speaking person if I am able to make him understand that my past is not something to be ashamed of, and I am sure he will also feel more inclined to take my hand if he knows that I have a past of which I need not be ashamed.</p>

<p>That is therefore the kind of nation they want. But if an English-speaking person is not prepared to accept that soulless, soft &#x201C;Sap&#x201D; nation without any principles, he is branded as a &#x201C;quisling&#x201D;, as though the generally accepted concept of a quisling is not that it is a person who places himself in the service of a foreign country and particularly of a foreign conqueror, as we experienced in South Africa when Boer generals became British field-marshals. No, I take my hat off to an English-speaking person who finds himself unable to accept that concept of a nation of the United Party and who has the courage to declare openly that he is a South African with a South African patriotism and loyalty to South Africa alone. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was so interested in this term &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D; that I looked up its definition in the Oxford English Dictionary. What does it really mean? I am sure that particularly the hon. member for Orange Grove will be interested in this. The Oxford English Dictionary gives the following definition, and this is very interesting:</p>

<block name="quote">Indoctrinate: 1. To imbue with learning, to teach, to instruct in a subject, principle, etc.; to imbue with a doctrine, idea or opinion; to bring into a knowledge of something. 2. To teach, inculcate (a subject, etc.).</block>

<p>Then the following sentence is quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Fully indoctrinated with a sense of the magnitude of their office.&#x201D; Hence, indoctrination, instruction, formal teaching.</block>

<p>I do not see such a terrible bogey here, Mr. Speaker. What it really amounts to is that the great danger hon. members opposite see in indoctrination&#x2014;as defined by the Oxford Dictionary&#x2014;is that they are afraid that the children will be taught. Because that is all the dictionary says. It means to teach them&#x2014;&#x201C;to teach, to imbue with learning&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In all fairness to the hon. members of the Opposition, however, I want to say that they apparently have their own dictionary and their own definition of &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D;. On another occasion I asked the hon. member for Orange Grove whether he could give us a definition of this word, and then he said the following: &#x201C;I should say indoctrination is to try and instil ideas into the mind of a child which are not in accordance with the true facts.&#x201D; That is his own definition of indoctrination. It is a very interesting definition. It means that as long as the truth is proclaimed at is not indoctrination. According to the United Party&#x2019;s definition the teachers of our country are at liberty to proclaim the truth, for example that the earth is round. They may also teach that during the evolution of a new nation in South Africa there was a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and barbarism. That is the truth. Let the teachers of South Africa take note that, according to the definition of the United Party, they will no longer be guilty of indoctrination in future as long as they proclaim the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in clause 2 (1) (f) and (g) reference is made to the needs of our country, to the fact that the education policy should be adapted accordingly, to the co-ordination of syllabuses on a national basis, and so forth. One of the needs in this country is a correct national concept. I want to suggest for consideration by the hon. the Minister that the guidance we had from President Kruger in this respect may serve to bring about a correct national concept in education. He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Progress is my motto too; progress in every respect, but progress in the right direction &#x2026; that we, as a Republic whose development is rooted in our national history, and recognizing the guidance of God in the past, should take the present as a basis for our united efforts to achieve national maturity.</block>

<p>On that basis we shall be able to build a nation &#x201C;rooted in our national history&#x201D;, a nation with a vigorous spirit, a nation inspired by its past, by its heroic tradition, a nation inspired by its consciousness of the sacrifices its forefathers made to win this country for civilization. Thus the heritage of our fathers will remain the heritage of our children.</p>

<p>As regards the syllabuses I want to draw attention to the importance of history as a subject, on this very basis, for the very purpose of keeping &#x201C;the roots of our national history&#x201D; strong and healthy. Every method should be applied to make history interesting as a school subject. There is a general aversion to history as a subject to-day. Why? I think the reason is that large numbers of minor facts are presented to the pupils, minor facts which even the teacher cannot remember. The teacher himself has to look up those facts again every time in order to be able to teach them to the pupils. Such minor facts have nothing whatsoever to do with the existing conditions, conditions that create problems which have to be solved by our children, whom we are trying to equip for that task. That makes the subject so uninteresting, so monotonous, that a certain amount of aversion is created among the children to this very important and. in fact, essential subject. In the teaching of history more use should be made of stories. History itself should be presented in the form of a great story, an adventure story of the evolution of a new nation in South Africa, and also <span class="col_1921-1922" refersTo="page_0978"/>of humanity. What is there that interests a child more than a story, Mr. Speaker?</p>

<p>I should like to tell hon. members of a teacher I had in my primary school days. The hon. the Minister and I had the privilege of having as a teacher a certain Dutch schoolmaster. I may say in passing that I find it a particular pleasure to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this Bill. In any case, the teacher to whom I am referring and to whom I want to pay tribute here, was a certain Mr. Munstra. I think the hon. the Minister and I were contemporary pupils of his in Stds. III. IV and V. I still remember clearly&#x2014;and perhaps the hon. the Minister will also remember &#x2014;how this teacher used to seat himself sideways on the table every Friday afternoon and then told us some fine story or other about the Eighty Years&#x2019; War. He did not tell us the history of that war, but he told us of the adventures Jan and Piet had in that war and, Sir, without actually realizing it we got to know the history of the Eighty Years&#x2019; War. I think it is most essential that attention be given to this method of teacing history in co-ordinating the syllabuses on a national basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this measure meets a very important need. With this legislation we can face the future with confidence to build a united and inspired nation in South Africa, a nation determined to hold its own in this world in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat has dealt with South Africanism, with indoctrination, and with the education policy which at present exists in South Africa. It appears to me to be an indictment of our present system. We are told from time to time that in South Africa to-day we are developing a true South Africanism. I think the hon. member points a finger at this side of the House to try and indicate that perhaps we, the United Party, are not persons who uphold true South Africanism. I contend that this is completely unfounded. We as members of the United Party have at all times endeavoured to be true South Africans, and at the present time we are practising true South Africanism as members of the United Party. We believe that we act in the best interests of South Africa. We believe in the policy which we adopted in the province of Natal whereby in terms of the Education Ordinance parallel-medium schools exist. We believe that those parallel-medium schools are serving a purpose in the best interests of South Africa. We believe that we as South Africans should bring Together our English and Afrikaans-speaking people at all times and at all levels. What better level is there where they can be brought together than in the schools? That is why it is an important principle of United Party policy, particularly in the province of Natal, that parental choice shall prevail. Moreover, parallel-medium schools is the policy of the United Party-controlled provincial council in Natal.</p>

<p>That is the aim and the policy of the United Party. We believe in free parental choice. Surely these are cardinal principles? Are these traditions, these principles which have been built up since Union to be cast out of the window of the Minister&#x2019;s office? We have heard so much of tradition, of South Africanism, and of the fostering of a true South Africanism. Yet a tradition which has been built up in Natal, and endorsed at election after election by the provincial electorate of Natal, is now to be circumvented by the policy of this Minister. I believe that this is the main reason why people, particularly those people who live in Natal, will support this amendment asking that this Bill be read &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;. If it was possible to have a stronger amendment, such amendment would be moved, Mr. Speaker. The people of Natal are incensed because their feelings are ignored and because the policy which they approve of and which has been the traditional policy in Natal, is threatened by this Minister. I do not wish to become personal, Sir, but I believe it to be even more pertinent when we consider that this Minister, who will administer this policy, is not even an elected member of this House. He is a Senator. What mandate has this Minister received from the people to bring about the change of policy which this Bill envisages? [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, because it suits you that it is a &#x201C;swak&#x201D; argument. I believe that the people of Natal have endorsed the policy in force there, a policy which has been adhered to by the provincial executive to the best of their ability, an executive which was elected by the United Party. These people believe that on behalf of the child and in his interests the parent shall have the right to decide on the language medium. Several hon. members on that side who have participated <span class="col_1923-1924" refersTo="page_0979"/>in this debate have placed a completely wrong interpretation and complexion on the present situation in Natal. I believe that they have done so in order to be able to thank the Minister for the action he is now taking. According to them there has been so much persecution and neglect of the Afrikaans-speaking people in Natal that the Minister was compelled to act. I believe that to be the main object of the speeches made by hon. members on that side representing Natal constituencies.</p>

<p>Hon. members from Natal, including the hon. member for Zululand, also alleged that a great deal of prejudice was exercised against the Afrikaans-speaking community of Natal. I believe that to be utter and complete nonsense. It is utterly and completely rejected by the facts. The facts are that where the provincial executive committee has the funds and the staff then additional schools are provided. And I mentioned earlier that in terms of the Natal Education Ordinance these schools in principle are parallel-medium schools. And, it happens, very often by agitation and by political motives that politicians try to split these schools on a &#x2019;basis of English-medium and Afrikaans-medium. I believe this to be a most retrogressive step if ever that step is taken, because it: is a most important and fundamental factor in bringing our people together and to foster true South Africanism. The position is that on occasions you have a group of parents, often led and agitated by a leading politician, leading member of the Nationalist Party, who then agitates for a separate school for those people. And if that separate school is not created we have these people making the type of speeches they made here to-day, saying that they are being prejudiced, neglected and persecuted. It is utter nonsense. Wherepossible the provincial administration has established such schools. It is the free will of the parents. Surely this is a fundamental factor in dealing with the whole education policy, namely this question of free parental choice and the feelings of the parents. The hon. the Minister referred to the question of the parents and their role in our educational system. It is a vitally important part of our educational system. I had the privilege to serve for a time in the Natal Provincial Council. In the constituency that I represented we had three Afrikaans-medium schools with Afrikaans as their language medium. If at any time 15 or more persons had wished the establishment of classes at those schools for the administering of English-speaking classes, it would have been possible for them to do so. Their case would have been placed before the provincial executive committee. However, I wish to mention that these three particular schools are some of the finest schools in the whole of the province. I believe the hon. member for Umhlatuzana was a pupil of one of those schools, namely the &#x201C;Hoërskool Port Natal&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>What about Voortrekker High School? [Interjections.] There are many fine Afrikaans-medium schools in Natal. And I lived in a particular area in Durban which is in the middle of these three Afrikaans schools. And I can remember many years ago as a small boy the building of Port Natal High School. It is still one of the finest schools in the province, not merely academically, but also in terms of brick and mortar and playing fields. They have one of the finest halls in the province. Their playing fields are regarded as perhaps the best in the province. The inter-district schools sports meetings and so on are invariably held at that sportsground. They have provisions and facilities at that school which I believe are the finest in the province. Now, when it was decided that there should be a primary school for the Port Natal High School, it was built by the Natal province, a brand new building, a brand new school and a very fine school indeed. That is the Port Natal Primary School, the &#x201C;Laerskool Port Natal&#x201D;. This is another very fine school built by the province at the wish and the whim of the desires of the people, tthe parents of the Afrikaans-speaking children. This is a very fine school indeed. I remember that after being elected as a provincial councillor, as a matter of fact my very second day after having been elected, I was asked to call at the Port Natal Primary School to discuss matters with the headmaster and also the chairman of the parents&#x2019; association. The parents&#x2019; association chairman also happened to be secretary of the Nationalist Party. But that made no difference whatsoever. The matters that were discussed concerned the acquiring of more land for the extension of that school. They required land for the purpose of a tennis court. And I certainly pay the highest compliment to the Afrikaans-speaking parents of Natal in that they are community conscious and that they are prepared to give full time attention to the matters affecting the education of their children. And when they were told that it would be necessary as is the case with all other schools, that that particular provision would have to be on a rand for rand basis, those parents rallied around and saw that the funds were available. These people raised those funds within a period of four or five months, and the province met their requirements by making a rand for rand contribution and a <span class="col_1925-1926" refersTo="page_0980"/>magnificent tennis court was erected at that school. Now, it was not long after that that the same Afrikaans-speaking parents came forward and said that they should now also have an infant school for the education of their children prior to the primary school. And there too a fine new building was built more or less in the same area where the Port Natal Primary School was built, so as to afford those people education from the lowest possible standard or class right up to matriculation. And I believe that the Natal Provincial Council, far from neglecting or being prejudiced against the Afrikaans-speaking community in Natal, they dealt with every case on its merits, irrespective of whether Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking parents were concerned. They dealt with it on its merits and the availability of funds. And I am quite sure that if greater funds were made available by the Central Government to the provincial administration in Natal we would see a true fulfilment of the educational policy as propounded by the Natal Provincial Council and by the Natal Provincial Administration. But, we must bear in mind at all times this whole question of building up true South Africanism. And I believe that the most important clause in this Bill is obviously the question of the development of education on a broad national character. And that is why there has been such a great deal of discussion concerning the broad national character of education. But there is a vast difference.</p>

<p>Naturally, I support it. I believe that if it is to mean true South Africanism, then naturally I support it. But, if it is to mean a sectional South Africanism then I certainly do not support it. [Interjections.] The emphasis must be on broad South Africanism. That is where the emphasis must be, and not on sectionalism. Unfortunately, from members opposite we have only heard pleas of sectionalism. The hon. member who spoke just before me made me think that he was living in the far distant past, in the bitterness of the past. Surely that is all behind us. Surely South Africa is now living in an atmosphere of South Africanism? Is the clock to be put back? Because, if the hon. the Minister does not accept parallel-medium schools and free parental choice, surely then there is a threat to building up a true South Africanism? Those are two fundamental factors in any educational policy. And that is why when the hon. the Minister replies to this debate I hope that he will give some indication and greater detail to his definition of the national character in terms of this Bill which he intends to bring about as the policy of education in South Africa. Here we have a Bill before us with vast powers being placed in the hands of one solitary Minister.</p>

<p>We feel very strongly indeed that it is not in the interests of education that merely this Minister&#x2019;s policy is the one that should be put into effect. There are many other educationists that disagree with many points concerning education as propounded by the Nationalist Party and by the Nationalist Government. The report of the Panel on &#x201C;Education and the South African Economy&#x201D;, a report published by eminent educationists, sets out very clearly many of the problems facing education. And, this is dealt with on a non-political basis. This to my mind is the very crux of the difficulty in regard to education, namely that it is continually being dealt with on a political basis. If it could be dealt with in the true interests of South Africa and of future South Africans then we must take cognizance of the views of these educationists. In this report there are some very important recommendations which cover the aspects of Central Government.</p>

<heading>REAFFIRMATION OF PRINCIPLE OFINDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT</heading>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House reaffirms the principle of independent development within the framework of a divided political structure, with special reference to greater labour self-sufficiency in the white man&#x2019;s homeland.</block>

<p>Other hon. members on this side of the House will illustrate some of the other aspects of this motion. As far as I am concerned, I want to confine myself to its first aspect. My story begins on 27th January, 1959, the date on which the former Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, made a speech in this House, a speech which, I think, history will still point out as being one of the most significant&#x2014;if not the most significant&#x2014;speech which has ever been made in this House. If I could summarize that speech, I should do so by quoting from it the following two sentences, words used by Dr. Verwoerd himself on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must ensure that the outside world realizes, and that the Bantu realizes that a new period is dawning. We want to build up a South Africa in which the Bantu and the white man can live next to one another as good neighbours and not as people who are continually quarrelling over supremacy.</block>

<p>If we look back at the period of eight years which has passed since these words were spoken, I think that as regards South African politics we can say to one another to-day that this speech of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s contains the final formulation of the principle of independent development. I say &#x201C;final formulation&#x201D; because this speech of his was really the decisive evolution of the apartheid idea, an idea which has always been supported by this side <span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0981"/>of the House over the years&#x2014;an idea to which new momentum was given by the speech made by Dr. Verwoerd in 1959. How dynamically, how glowingly has this formula for freedom, as I want to call it, developed in this country over the past eight years! Let us look at the external developments. Everybody who has had to live with criticism from abroad and anxiety about South Africa, can testify to the moral strength implied in this idea, in this formula for independent development within the framework of a divided political structure. If this idea of separate freedom had not developed so dramatically since 1959, where would we have been in South Africa to-day, particularly if we look at the position immediately across the borders of our country? Over the past eight years the development of this policy formula has given South Africa new hope in this the greatest crisis in its existence. Internally it was this formula which taught a black majority in South Africa not to aim at the whole, but also to seek their freedom within the framework of a divided political structure, a divided South Africa. In fact, this idea was so dynamic that it is without fear that we can say to one another in South African politics to-day that the break-through in respect of the concept embraced in this formula has virtually resulted in a complete break-through as far as our political reasoning is concerned.</p>

<p>The most effective proof of this is the present United Party Opposition&#x2014;as a matter of fact, all opposition in this country&#x2014;and the calcified, coelacanth situation in which they find themselves in South Africa to-day. That is a result of the dynamic content of this formula. What is this Opposition at present other than a group of frightened people, people who are still half-heartedly adhering to a sort of, let me call it, &#x201C;one nation theory&#x201D; within the framework of undivided politics? They are people who, in the second half of the 20th century, believe in white supremacy within the framework of an undivided political structure, people who do not have the courage to make new history in this country of ours. Sir, what is the basis of this formula, what is it that has given it this break-through I mentioned to you? I want to mention to you four basic principles in our political reasoning. The first is the admission, the realization in our present political reasoning, particularly over the past eight years, that no artificial bounds may be set to Bantu self-government; or to put it differently, that the urge towards liberty is fundamental with the black majority in South Africa. Nobody can reason that away. In addition one also has this truth, namely that any formula for regulating this inherent political urge in an undivided political structure, is not worth the paper on which it is written. It is this truth which is giving the Opposition that content which it does in fact have in South African politics at present. There is a second one, namely the realization that in the long run a white minority cannot continue to rule over a large black majority in the same homeland. Nobody can dispute that to-day. There is a third one, namely the acceptance of the truth that in our &#x201C;new world&#x201D;, in this new period which has dawned, the white man cannot remain the master simply because he has a white skin. The master-servant relationship is becoming something of the past. I want to repeat that in respect of these three points of reasoning a total break-through has been made in our South African politics. My hon. friends on that side are not opposing this basic stand. They are exceptionally quiet.</p>

<p>My fourth statement I want to motivate in greater detail, and I should like to formulate it as follows: The economic structure of the white man&#x2019;s homeland cannot be built on foreign black labour for ever. I want to put it from a different angle: Within the borders of its homeland a black majority in South Africa cannot develop fully into a nation in its own right, if it has to live mainly on income from labour which thousands of its people have to sell permanently to the white man&#x2019;s homeland. Practically speaking: We in this country cannot continue with this massive absorption of foreign black labourers in our industrial economy. We, the Whites, are a nation in our own right to-day. We are no longer a minority of settlers within the borders of our own country of residence. We have shaken off all forms of foreign domination. Even my hon. friends on the other side accept the new world in which we are living to-day. But now, what about our dependence upon this black labour which we have on our hands? Our present dilemma which has resulted from prosperity and development is, in as far as it means increasing dependence upon black labour, a terrible one indeed! But in this regard, too, we should say to one another, without mincing words, that this is the dilemma of all of us, that this is also the dilemma of my United Party friends who have white skins! To this country with all of its people&#x2014;Whites (Nationalists and United Party supporters), Coloureds, Bantu, to all of us&#x2014;this dilemma is a challenge which calls for new devotion and inspiration and ingenuity as regards the creation of new labour patterns such as this fine country of ours has never known in the past. I say that this is the dilemma of all of us! The United Party cannot dissociate itself from this challenge. The United Party always holds itself up as being the party which works for and strives after lasting relaxation of the tension in our race relations. Mr. Speaker, in the debate on the Part Appropriation we had such a clear example here; the hon. member for Yeoville rose and pleaded dramatically for relaxing the tension in race relations, and practically in the same breath hon. members on that side rejoiced over increasing economic integration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Increasing economic integration will constantly intensify the white/black <span class="col_1929-1930" refersTo="page_0982"/>contrast within the framework of undivided politics in South Africa. The arguments raised by my hon. friends fall away entirely. Mr. Speaker, white islands in a sea of black workers is a perfect recipe for future danger and tension in this country. That would spell doom for all of us, Nationalists as well as United Party supporters. Viewed from this angle, the United Party is at present the party of the greatest evil South African politics has ever known. It does not seek liberation through division; it seeks to base the future of the white man in South Africa on the foreign labour of other nations for all times. If the United Party thinks that this Government and that this unique political party of which I am a member will allow the principle of greater labour self-sufficiency in the white man&#x2019;s homeland to be invalidated by practical difficulties and economic laws, it will be mistaken in South African politics for the umpteenth time. This party prefers even &#x201C;economic impossibilities&#x201D; to be undertaken rather than an entire civilization and a nation being led to their downfall under the pretext of their being saved.</p>

<p>To summarize: Labour self-sufficiency as the fourth fundamental principle of our policy formula for independent development, has at present acquired new urgency for all of us, and that includes my hon. friends on the other side. At no stage in our history has the challenge, on the one hand, to lead the Bantu towards full independence in their own homelands and, on the other hand, to create a finer white homeland with dramatic effort, been issued to all of us so clearly.</p>

<p>In respect of the practical implementation of greater labour self-sufficiency in the white man&#x2019;s homeland, I would humbly make a few suggestions. In the first place, I want to plead here for the establishment of what I should call a permanent labour advisory board. If we plan our economic future to-day, the formula has already been developed over the past few years for making use of a permanent economic advisory board, a board in which South Africa&#x2019;s best brains are being concentrated, a board which from time to time furnishes this Government with advice and counsel in respect of shaping our economic future. The same is happening in numerous other spheres. For instance, I am thinking of the development of our water schemes in which our best brains are at present being enlisted to serve the Government with advice. Why can we not have such a permanent labour advisory board in which our best brains are being enlisted for the purpose of continually creating and formulating new labour patterns in this country?</p>

<p>There is a second suggestion I want to make, and that is a plea for an imaginative campaign against wasting labour in our homeland. This is a topic on which one can talk all day, because a current accurate analysis shows that there is no other Western country in which quite as much labour is being wasted as is in fact the case in South Africa. I want to mention this little example: A few days ago the hon. member for Vasco and I were about to drive back to Cape Town after visiting a certain factory in Bellville South, and as we got into the car it caught our attention that two strong, well-built, middle-aged Coloureds were engaged in watering the lawn in front of the factory in question, both holding onto the front part of a garden hose and pressing their thumbs into the opening. This caught our attention and we talked about it. From there we drove into town and in the space of that short distance of eight to nine miles we counted 28 adult, male, strong Coloureds who were watering gardens and lawns by means of hoses. Mr. Speaker, if you were to make a survey to-day to determine the extent to which labour is being wasted in the Cape Peninsula, you will be amazed.</p>

<p>There is a third suggestion which I want to make and for which I want to plead here. I want to do so by way of a question: Would I be too idealistic if in my plea for greater labour self-sufficiency in the white man&#x2019;s homeland, I advocated what I want to call living symbols purposefully created by us in order to grip the imagination of our people? I am asking this question in consequence of an article which I have here in my hand and which appeared in one of our newspapers last year. To me this was one of the most imaginative articles to appear in South Africa last year. It was written by a well-known Jewish author, Henry Katziw. It appeared in <i>Diepte-Beeld</i> on 28th August, 1966, under the heading: &#x201C;That first town will save our children&#x201D;. In his article this author says that we in South Africa need symbols; that we need something which will once again attract the attention of our people which will stimulate us into making history in this country; that we should not merely be negative by saying, in the first instance, that we should withdraw the Bantu from the Western Cape, but, on the other hand, that we should also positively make history by building new white towns, white communities. Sir, he does that on the basis of an example he mentions here, and I should like to read it to you. Also note the fine language in which it is written (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1953 Ben-Gurion, the then Prime Minister of Israel, resigned his office and went to live in the Nedjeb Desert. He said that Israel could only be safe if it used and populated the Nedjeb. Therefore he joined a group of young people who had previously gone to live in that desert, at the disconsolate little settlement called Sde Boker. This gripped my attention. Overwhelming journalistic curiosity attracted me to Sde Boker. A year later I was there, in August, 1954. The desert was as scorchingly hot as it could be; on and off I stayed there for seven weeks. Now, 12 years later, <span class="col_1931-1932" refersTo="page_0983"/>I can admit that there were nights when I cried. They were the tears of a person who had been brought to complete humility. A handful of young people, young men and women, and a former Prime Minister were living in wooden huts and defying the desert. It was so arrogant that it amazed one. To me it appeared to be defiance of nature far beyond the bounds of reason. How can these dust-storms be tamed? How can plants grow in this desolation? Fifteen months ago I visited Sde Boker again, and I was stunned with amazement and admiration. The disconsolate little camp of the pioneers, with its barbed-wire fence, its primitive wash-rooms and five rows of huts, no longer exists. At present there are lawns, orchards, sweet-peas, water, houses with cool walls and tricycles for the children.</block>

<p>I want to repeat this question. Do we not need an image in South Africa? Has the time not arrived for us to engage in purposefully making new history for the white man in his own homeland? Arising from this article by this Jewish author, I want to ask whether we should not start creating new white towns in this country, a town of white people where there will not even be Coloured servants to look after our children, a town which contains all the dramatic elements, which will attract attention and give new value through white family labour &#x2026; [Interjections.] Sir, if the hon. member wants to make a good contribution to this debate, he should stand in the lobby. I am talking about a town which will serve as a model of our white future in this country, a town or towns in which some of our key industries, such as our munition factories, will purposefully, yes, even in conflict with the economic laws, be concentrated; a town or towns with nuclear power-stations where South Africa&#x2019;s best brains will be assembled; a town with a new way of life, with new labour patterns, by means of which we shall show the world that we are not necessarily dependent upon the labour of other nations for our survival; a town or towns which may be the starting-point for making new history in the white man&#x2019;s homeland.</p>

<p>I readily want to admit that the hon. member made his speech in beautiful language. He is my representative, and I enjoyed listening to the hon. member for Moorreesburg. I do not want to find too much fault with what he said in the final part of his speech when he expressed his own ideas which I take it are not Government policy. They were rather interesting ideas which one could discuss but I merely want to refer to one aspect of the matter, and that is that as regards the case of Israel and Ben-Gurion mentioned hy him, there is one small difference between the policy proposed by him and that proposed by Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion set the example of resigning as a Member of Parliament and to go and work hard in the desert himself. I do not know whether the hon. member also intends doing something similar by the end of this session or even before that time.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am merely mentioning the fact that the hon. member for Moorreesburg said that Ben-Gurion set his. people an example by working hard and‘ making a success of it. Of course, in the case of Israel it is not at all a parallel one, and I think the hon. member is aware of that fact. A whole variety of other factors were involved. I am merely referring to the fact that Ben-Gurion was prepared to set the example himself and did merely not tell his people that they should go and work as farm labourers. I shall wait and see what members of the Nationalist Party will set that example. I shall wait and see whether the hon. members for Moorreesburg and Piketberg will do so. The hon. member for Piketberg is the person who said the other day that boys should once again learn how to work with a pick and shovel on farms. I was born and grew up in a region which those two hon. members represent in this House and I remember the days&#x2014;and it is not so long ago that circumstances changed &#x2014;when one found people who made a living by working as white labourers in the Sandveld just beyond Piketberg at a level of existence no hon. member of this House will advocate to-day. At the present time there are still small houses in the constituency of a former Prime Minister, Piketberg, which one cannot enter without bending down because the doorways are so low.</p>

<p>No, it is no disgrace, but it should not be the aim of this. Government to let people live in such houses once more. This is the difference between that side and this side of the House. The hon. member for Moorreesburg said&#x2014;I do not believe he meant it; perhaps it was a slip&#x2014; that it should be their policy to do the economic impossible. [Interjections.] Where does he get such nonsense from? Have you ever before in your life, Sir, heard a Governmentsaying that it was going to implement a &#x201C;pie in the sky&#x201D; policy even though it was an economic impossibility to do so? [Interjections.] I can tell the hon. member that there is an ideal place for such a township in his constituency. He will not have to make his experiments in a desert. He can go to Gouda in his own constituency. Gouda has been designated by the Government as the place where future economic development in the Western Province must take place. There is water at Gouda and there is a great deal of State-owned land with the result that no land need to be purchased. I now want to ask him to say that the. <span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0984"/>Government will announce that it will start this experiment of a white township at Gouda. Gouda has everything. It is even situated next to a railway line. Let the Government now translate words into action. What is the worth of all these discussions and long articles by jounalists which do not mean anything when one determines their value; it is merely &#x201C;pie in the sky&#x201D;. Why can we not be realistic? Why can we not speak of economic possibilities? [Interjection.] That hon. member does not know anything. He has never been anything else but a political organizer throughout his life. I say we are discussing the survival of the South African nation and I believe that there are sufficient Nationalists inside and outside this Chamber who are in real earnest as far as South Africa is concerned and who will not allow themselves to be flustered by political organizers. Things are now going too far. They have already gone too far. There is nothing wrong with being a political organizer That is no disgrace; there must be people like that and I, too, was a good organizer and so was the hon. the Deputy Minister</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Let me revert to the motion itself. The hon. member said in his speech that the United Party still believed in everlasting supremacy over the Native, something which the Nationalist Party discarded many years ago. Surely that is not true. With the advent of apartheid the basis of apartheid, according to the organizers of the Nationalist Party, was that the White man should remain master of the Coloured and the Native. Do I have to furnish proof of that statement? I can read the speeches. That was the whole idea that was created at that time and for that reason people did not want to accept apartheid. [Interjections.] Why does the hon. the Minister want to say that that was not the case? Surely it was. The idea of segregation, of separation, of separate development, is not something new which is peculiar to this Government only. When Cecil Rhodes came along with his Glen Grey Act the idea of separate development had already been accepted. Read all the speeches of General Smuts. His entire idea about the coloured question was one of separate development. He made many speeches on that subject but strangely enough he arrived at this one thing every time and that was that he said that although one commission after another had been appointed to investigate the coloured question and although they had come forward time and time again with separate development, there was one aspect to which they never referred and that was the political aspect. Just read those speeches. I say that where South Africa as a nation&#x2014;Government and Opposition&#x2014;believes in social separation and in the traditional pattern of separation and parallel development, this concept: of separate freedoms for which the Nationalist Party now stands is a new idea. The late Dr. Malan said shortly before his death that the ideal might be complete apartheid but that it certainly was not possible. This I think is the economic impossibility to which the hon. member for Moorreesburg referred. I think we must now start being realistic. We cannot come forward every time with a motto, as we came forward with the motto of apartheid, which at that time meant something completely different to what it means to-day, and then try to build a policy around that motto. It is not fair to do so and it is dangerous to do so, because once one starts with a matter of principle, such as the hon. member evidently believes in&#x2014;will the hon. member please listen and correct me if I am wrong, because I do not want to put words in his mouth. I ask the hon. member what he understood under a separate political structure, whether he meant a separate political state, and he said that that was correct. [Interjections.]</p>

These people come along with grand ideas, with mottoes, and then they try to build a pattern around that motto, instead of indicating a direction and saying that that is their policy.

The hon. member for Moorreesburg was right with regard to departing from the old pattern under which this Parliament governed the entire South Africa, <span class="col_1937-1938" refersTo="page_0986"/>as Dr. Verwoerd said, the hon. member for Moorreesburg was right. The late Dr. Verwoerd said what the hon. member also said here, but to that he added that that was as a result of pressure which was exercised from abroad, and that too the hon. member nearly quoted to me. We must not be frightened to death of the kind of advice and of the large mouths of Africa. The Government must carry on and must do its Christian duty, as it has been doing throughout the years, and all will be well. The Government must not become frightened. Fear has never solved any problems. How can a country be governed on the basis of man&#x2019;s two weakest emotions, namely fear and hate?

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before this House adjourned this afternoon the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education paid me a fine compliment for which I am very grateful. He said that I should bring the debate down to the normal standard, namely his standard and apparently also mine. <span class="col_1939-1940" refersTo="page_0987"/>I am sorry that I was too high-brow and set too high a standard. I am quite prepared to bring the discussion to a lower level. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do so now. I shall have to lower the debate considerably and I do not have the time to do so now, but I should like to repeat a few of the points I raised before.</p>

<p>In the first place we of the United Party believe that South Africa must be governed as a single political unit. We believe that South Africa must be governed in such a way that there is a home for all. We believe that leadership will have to remain in the hands of the Whites for many years. I just want to mention what I was told by an economist who came from West Germany to Tanzania not so long ago. Apparently he went there to ascertain in what way the economy of Tanzania could be improved to the advantage of all the citizens of Tanzania. When I spoke to him he told me a very interesting thing. I asked him what the possibilities were of Tanzania becoming a powerful country. He replied: &#x201C;There is little possibility of that, because they do not have the capacity to make use of the labour which they have at their disposal.&#x201D; This Government must take care that future generations will not blame it for not having utilized the labour at its disposal for the sake of political ideologies. If this Government proceeds with training the Coloured, the Bantu, the Griqua, the Malay, the Indian as well as the white man, to do his work to the maximum advantage of the entire South Africa&#x2014;instead of following &#x201C;pie in the sky&#x201D; policies, as I called them&#x2014;it will be rendering a service, but as long as we continue to allow some political organizers to come forward with all kinds of fantasies and with all kinds of mottoes which may win elections, but which will lose South Africa for the white man, as long as they continue to choose a motto and then want to build a policy around that motto, we shall remain on the road which leads to destruction. For that reason I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House condemns the Government for&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) persisting in the illusion that its policy of independent development within a divided political framework is realistic; and</li>

<li>(b) ignoring the fact that the races in South Africa need one another economically,</li>

<p>and, in order to test is <i>bona fides</i>, demands that it&#x2014;</p>

<li>(ii) formulate a practical policy for assuring a stable and efficient labour force to meet the demands of industrial and agricultural development, which will enable South Africa to achieve and maintain higher standards of living for all our people&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Do with the Native whatever you wish, if you do not want to listen to us. Do with the Coloured whatever you wish, if you do not wish to indicate his boundaries to him. Do with the Malay whatever you wish; do with the Griqua whatever you wish&#x2014;but tell the white man now where his territory is.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it pleases me that this House saw to-day that the hon. member for Sea Point, after all his years of Parliamentary service, had not yet learned how to move an amendment to a motion. I do not want to reply to the tirade of the hon. member. I am pleased that there was an interval which made it possible for a different atmosphere to be created. The only advice I have for the hon. member, and I think that that will be the only thing which will help the hon. member, is to place a &#x201C;jack&#x201D; under the level on which he conducts a political debate. I want to congratulate the hon. member for Moorreesburg on his fine exposition and the competent way in which he brought this important matter to the attention of this House.</p>

<p>My contribution to this debate is going to take the form of emphasizing the place which the Coloured population is to occupy within this pattern. If we speak of independent development, this concept means something different to the Coloured than to the Bantu. To the Bantu separate development means that that is linked up with an independent, own homeland, away from the Whites and the other races. To the Coloured it means parallel development within the boundaries of the: white part of South Africa.</p>

<p>There are persons who dream about a possible political division also in respect of the Coloured population and who have visions of a separate homeland being created within South Africa at some time in the future for the Coloured, where it will be possible for him to develop to complete political independence. This is a fine ideal because if it were at all practicable it would have brought about an ideal situation. To me, however, it is an&#x2019; unrealistic idea. Therefore, when we speak of greater labour independence within the homeland of the white man, it is important that we stress the share and the aspect of Coloured labour because the Coloured will always share the homeland of the white man and will always be part of it. What is more, when we speak of labour independence in the homeland of the white man, it means that the hold of black labour will be shaken off to an <span class="col_1941-1942" refersTo="page_0988"/>increasing extent. In a large part of South Africa Coloured labour is the obvious alternative labour.</p>

<p>I want to begin by agreeing with the farmers of the Western Cape and the employers of Coloured manual labour that the efficiency of Coloured labour has not exactly improved during recent years, in any event not anything near the ratio of what has been done, <i>inter alia</i>, in relation to the socio-economic uplifting of the masses. It is indeed a fact that there has been a considerable improvement in the case of the productivity of the labour of a large number of Coloureds employed in commerce, in industry and in the services in respect of the better type of work which is done by the better type of Coloured. Taken as a whole, we have therefore made some progress, but it remains irrefutably true that Coloured labour at present has major defects and shortcomings such as workshyness, irresponsibility, a lack of discipline, the low moral, standards of the masses, the terrible evil of addiction to liquor, immorality and a lack of leaders in various fields. These are all factors which assist in making Coloured labour what it is to-day. I wonder if all hon. members in this House realize how poor and inferior that labour is? To many people who have to manage with this labour each day, it is a real trial to do so. Now it is so that all these things are connected with the level of development of the Coloured. For that reason the State has quite rightly tried to tackle this matter at the root by means of the State&#x2019;s socio-economic development programme for Coloureds. However, there are many obstacles in the way. There are many things which hamper and obstruct the good work which is being done by the Department of Coloured Affairs and which neutralize and in many respects undo this socio-economic uplifting. In the short time at my disposal I want to spotlight one matter in particular. That is the negative, retarding effect which the presence of the Bantu in the Western Cape has on uplifting the Coloured.</p>

<p>The co-habitation of Bantu and Coloured in the Western Cape creates an enormous social problem amongst the Coloureds. In the Western Cape, and here in the Peninsula in particular, 20,000 illegitimate Coloured children are born each year. The fathers of many of them are Bantu. Before our very eyes we see that the population of young Coloureds are growing up and becoming blacker and blacker. We must remember that every brown Bantu is a person who is permanently settled in the homeland of the white man. He remains here with his mother. This process is changing the identity of the Coloured and is placing the Coloured&#x2019;s claim of being an appendage of a Western group in jeopardy.</p>

<p>These blacker Coloureds which are being produced are the people who, according to the United Party&#x2019;s policy, have to be placed on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll with the Whites. They are the people who, according to the United Party&#x2019;s policy, must sit with us in the House of Assembly. I make the statement today that the presence of the Bantu in the Western Cape had undeniably been instrumental in creating the pattern of Coloured labour which gives rise to so many problems for us. As a result of the unlimited, readily obtainable, cheap Bantu labour which had been available throughout the years before this Government imposed restrictions thereon, the Coloureds have been left to their own devices and as workers have been left neglected by the wayside for many years. What Dr. Eiselen said as long ago as 1955 when he addressed S.A.B.R.A. is indeed true. (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Much less attention has been paid to their rehabilitation and to their moulding into good, reliable workers than should have been done and would have been done were there not such a large source of Native labour from which the required manpower could readily be drawn.</block>

<p>The systematic removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape is very closely related to all our attempts to make the Coloured more prepared to work and to increase the productivity of his labour. The attempts of the Department of Bantu Administration have already met with success. I just want to mention one example, because I do not have much time. I want to read to you a report which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> of 17th February. The heading reads (translation): &#x201C;Removal of Bantu from the Western Cape. Dairy industry being reorganized.&#x201D; The report reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reorganization of the entire dairy industry, which will result in greater efficiency, has been in progress on a large scale in Cape Town since the Government&#x2019;s ban on contract Bantu workers in this and in nine other industries. Spokesmen of the dairy industry said yesterday that instead of this development being a step backward as some people&#x2014;supporters of the United Party in particular&#x2014;predicted, it would be a step forward in the dairy industry.</block>

<p>There you have it. I just want to mention one small point. Perhaps I do agree with the hon. member for Sea Point much to my regret. A matter which must receive the attention of the Minister&#x2019;s Department is the thousands of Bantu who are moving about in the Western Cape illegally. Our problem is not in the first instance the Bantu who work. The stumbling block is the thousands of Bantu who are here illegally, who do not have permits to be here and who are moving about amongst us. However, I want to pay a compliment to-day to the Department and to the Minister. I think that the attempts they are making deserve our whole-hearted support. I regret that I am not able to pay this compliment to the labour <span class="col_1943-1944" refersTo="page_0989"/>advisory committees, too, which were appointed a few years ago with a great deal of enthusiasm in an attempt to bring about the systematic replacement of Bantu labour by Coloured labour. I think most of these committees did not come up to expectations. I think we shall have to devise other means of tackling this matter more effectively. This brings me to the task of the Department of Coloured Affairs in this connection. The legislation Parliament is considering at present gives us the impression that the Department of Coloured Affairs and the Minister are deeply conscious of what an enormous task is resting on their shoulders in this regard to do everything possible at this very time for exploiting the potential of Coloured labour to its maximum. A great deal is already being done. We cannot get away from that. I cannot mention everything but in passing I should like to refer to the agricultural gymnasium at Kromme Rhee, to the technical college in Bellville South, to the directorate of Coloured labour, that co-operates very closely with the labour bureaux, to bring Coloured workseekers into closer contact with employers. I may mention the Department&#x2019;s full-time liaison officer who attends meetings of the inter-departmental labour advisory committee of the Orange River Scheme in order to ensure that all available Coloured labour will be utilized. But because we shall never have one super plan for solving this problem in respect of Coloured labour, and because we shall be compelled as a matter of necessity to work on various projects and undertakings, even in various spheres, I should like to make a few suggestions to-day which to my mind ought to be considered.</p>

<p>The first is the question of the Coloured&#x2019;s preparedness for work. In this regard I want to advocate the compulsory registration of Coloured unemployed. For this we do not need legislation. The only thing I am asking is for an existing Act to be applied by this Government in order to help solve this problem. I am referring to the Registration for Employment Act, Act No. 34 of 1945. Section 4 (1) of that Act provides that if a worker has been unemployed for more than one week, he has to register within seven days thereafter. If he fails to register or to comply with all the requirements in connection with registration, he is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine. Sir, if this Act was necessary in 1945, how much the more so to-day? This Act has the advantage that the Minister may make it applicable in respect of any area and in respect of any category of worker within any particular area. I want to ask that we should apply this Act and should not be afraid to do so in order to solve this problem with which we are faced. In order to be able to administer the Act effectively, there will have to be a drastic increase in the number of registration bureaux so that they may be within easier reach for the Coloured for registration purposes and so that the Coloured work-seeker will also be able to stay in closer contact with the bureau.</p>

<p>The second matter I want to mention by way of a question is this: Should the Government not involve and use the Coloured Persons Council to a larger extent to make their own people more prepared for work and to cause them to play a more positive role in the field of labour? Or should we not think in the direction indicated by the hon. member for Moorreesburg, namely to include some of the best Coloured brains in a full-time Coloured labour advisory board? Let it be the full-time task of those people to rack their brains about the problems of their own people and to serve the Government with advice as to what should be done in various fields. Sir, we have to teach the Coloured leaders that they will be obliged to accept responsibility in respect of their own people to a larger degree. This is one of the cardinal deficiencies in the uplifting of the Coloured. We should teach them that fewer of them should waste their time with politicking; that they should play less on political fields; that they should not try so much to be hangers-on of the Whites and that they should devote themselves more to working amongst their own people.</p>

<p>Sir, I have to leave the matter at that, because my time is getting very limited. I still want to mention a few other points. The fourth point I want to mention is Coloured education. We have to adapt Coloured education more drastically to the needs of the Coloured people themselves. It has become possible to do so now that Coloured education has been separated from white education. The Department of Coloured Affairs is already moving in that direction. In the Peninsula we already have five multi-stream high-schools for Coloureds at present where provision is made for ordinary academic education but where special attention is also being given to more practical education. I advocate a larger degree of differentiation in Coloured education. My plea is for a two-stream system to be followed eventually in every high-school for Coloureds in the Cape Province. Too much time and money is being wasted on Coloured children who derive no benefit from the ordinary school syllabus.</p>

<p>The fifth point I want to mention is Coloured housing. Coloured housing, like Bantu housing, should be directly connected with Coloured labour. The congregation of Coloureds in the cities have resulted in major advantages to the industries. The State in point of fact is subsidizing large industries in the form of Coloured labour and, on the other hand, the State is left with the housing problem. I do not think that it is unfair to ask that industries, as regards their Coloured labour, should bear a rightful share of this burden. On the other hand, we must encourage the farmers to provide better housing for their workers on their farms. But then we <span class="col_1945-1946" refersTo="page_0990"/>must also prohibit divisional councils to levy taxes on such housing.</p>

<p>In the fifth place I want to make a general plea for a drastic change in the labour pattern in the rural areas and that an investigation should be instituted into, <i>inter alia</i>, the tot system. I do not have the opportunity to elaborate on these matters, but I will contend myself with quoting from <i>The Cape Times</i> of the 18th instant, in which an article by Professor S. P. Cilliers of the University of Stellenbosch was published. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is therefore essential that the importance of agriculture for the future of Coloured labour be explored and that preparations be made to meet this demand. It means that on the one hand special attention should be given to the training and preparation of Coloured labour for more effective and diversified use in agriculture; that attention be given to the social, educational and cultural setting of rural areas for Coloured living; and that on the other hand agriculture, as an industry, will have to be prepared to compete with industry and commerce for additional labour to counteract urbanization.</block>

<p>My time has expired but I should like to refer in brief to the question of semi-skilled labour. As a result of mechanization and automation the demand for unskilled manual labour has, relatively speaking, decreased, but the demand for semi-skilled labour has increased. I also believe that the Coloured should be trained to have a share in this labour where white labour is no longer able to meet in this demand altogether at present; we simply do not have a sufficient number of Whites to do so. The very problem we are facing as regards Coloured labour which we have at our disposal to-day, is that we expect too much of badly equipped human material in that we want our ordinary labourers to do the work of semi-skilled persons.</p>

<p>The other matter which I want to mention is the pensions which are being paid to Coloureds. Sir, too many Coloureds are loafing about because they live on the pensions and the allowances and the maintenance allowances for illegitimate children which their family and their next-of-kin receive. I think this is a matter which requires the urgent attention of the Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow, with all the experience that he has had working in the Western Province, really shows a shameful lack of knowledge of the real problems facing the Coloured community who formed the basis of his speech here this afternoon, a speech which bears no relation whatsoever to the motion which is on the Order Paper and which we are expected to discuss. Sir, I have asked the Minister of Coloured Affairs and his predecessor what has happened to the reports of the committees which were appointed to look into all these matters along the Orange River and on the western coast of this country in regard to a multiplicity of subjects affecting Coloured persons. One of them was whether or not it was feasible and possible to do away with Bantu labour in the Western Province. My information is that it is impossible to do without Bantu labour in the Western Province, but we are unable to get any information from the hon. the Minister. I do not want to confine myself this afternoon to Coloured affairs because we are having this debate for the benefit of the Bantu Mnisters, all three of whom are here, the Minister himself plus his two deputies. But before I leave Coloured affairs, I should like to say this to the hon. member. He has experience of &#x201C;plaasvolk&#x201D;, but he seems to be ignorant of the real problems that the Coloured people face. There are many thousands of Coloured people of good standing and intellect, people as good as you and I, Sir.</p>

<p>The whole speech revolved around the fact that there are footloose and useless Coloured persons to be found on the farms in the Western Province. I say to you, Sir, that the position of the Coloured people in the Western Province is the fruit of the Government&#x2019;s policy towards the Coloured people. This is what we are reaping. These are the people who have been pushed away, who have been classified and got rid of. These are the people we have excluded from trade unions and applied job reservation to. These are the people we herd into little tinpot houses with no ceilings or floors or inside doors or any water to wash with. These are the products. iHon. members say that the leaders of the Coloured people should take an interest in them and that education is wasted on half the Coloured children, but let me tell you, Sir, that half the Coloured children never get into schools because the schools are not available. But I will say this for the present Minister of Coloured Affairs, that he is making an attempt.</p>

<p>This motion before us is rather a strange one. The Afrikaans version says &#x201C;die verdeelde staatstruktuur beklemtoon&#x201D;. The English version says &#x201C;the divided political structure&#x201D;. A &#x201C;staatstruktuur&#x201D; means a separate state, if I know any Afrikaans at all, and a state is not entirely a political structure. A state consists of economic factors and industrial factors and a multiplicity of other factors. It is not only politics, although the white state of which we hear so much is bedevilled exclusively with politics by the hon. members opposite. We hear about the white man&#x2019;s homeland and we hear the glib speech of the hon. member for Moorreesburg. We have lived for 300 years in the closest association with the Bantu and the Coloured people, and this country was built up on the sweat and the toil of the black man and the Coloured man, and every man who lived within the borders of the country as it exists <span class="col_1947-1948" refersTo="page_0991"/>to-day. The Minister of Finance laughed this morning at the suggestion that we are going to reverse the order and get all these Blacks out and do all the work through Whites. The hon. member for Parow himself said there were insufficient Whites to do the work even of the Coloureds, let alone the millions of Bantu. I think the time has come when we should look at these separate states and see the trend of Government thinking, because we are fast approaching a state not only of socialist tendencies and trends but also of communist trends. Only recently I had occasion to cross swords with the Minister of Mines in regard to diamonds. I will not go into that now, except to say this, that diamonds in Coloured areas must go to the State, that is, to the Coloured Development Corporation. Then there is the fishing quota for Coloured persons, which must also go to that Corporation.</p>

<p>The motion is that there should be this separate political structure and these separate states, but what is the kind of state we are buildng? The hon. member for Parow says that the Coloured people will have a state parallel with that of the Whites. I am trying to demonstrate that such a state must of necessity be within the white homeland. I am trying to demonstrate that in three basic principles such a state already departs from our own white principles, and these are capital and labour. Now we find ourselves dealing with the Bantu. The Minister of Bantu Administration has set his heart and mind, in terms of Government policy, upon developing the Bantu homelands. Why does he not get on with it? We have been at it for 20 years. We have only heard of one, the Transkei. The Bantu I want to talk about are these. When the Bantu are steadily moved and are returned to their homelands, there will be millions of Bantu left in the urban areas who will be there by right, by virtue of their birth and by virtue of the fact that they do not even know what their homelands look like. What are the Minister&#x2019;s intentions in regard to those people? The whole trend of the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to these separate states is to have South Africa in a state where all Bantu and black labour shall be migrant labour. We have heard what has happened from the hon. member for Parow, that Bantu men come into the Western Province and consort with Coloured women. I put it to you, Sir, that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has never, nor has any member of he Government from the Prime Minister down, said one word about the millions of Bantu who are at present on the perimeters of the urban areas and have been there for many years and will remain there, and who have their wives with them and whose families grow up there, for whom houses and schools are being built. I want to know how this independent state for the Bantu is going to work within the living body of the mythical white South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to go further and I want to emphasize the point made by the hon. member for Sea Point. When we speak of self-determination, when we start to consider the Griqua as a self-determined group, it is a well-known fact that the &#x201C;Bastervolk&#x201D; in Gordonia regard themselves as a people on their own, and they consider that they at least should be allowed to have an area of their own and to develop in the direction of self-determination. We find the case where Indians are in a class by themselves and Malays have been classified as Coloureds. When and where do the Malays get self-determination on their own? So I say frankly to the Government, without any fear of contradiction from any reasonable person, that the path upon which the Government is set can never and will never produce the solution and will never be the answer to any of the problems that face us. There are no real problems.</p>

<p>The hon. member who introduced the motion could only make one suggestion, and that was that we should have an advisory committee. Heaven knows we have had enough of these. I believe that the time has come when we should treat everybody within our borders as a person and use his ability to the best advantage and provide the educational opportunities and make him a person who is proud to be associated with the Western way of life of which we say we are so proud, and to be part and parcel of us, as he should be, because these are the men who do the work. There is nothing that is insoluble, and I say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that if he applied his brains, limited though he may be as far as that is concerned, we could find a suitable solution. But what the Government is doing is that they are running away from the problem because there are two schools of thought on that side. There are those speakers on behalf of the Government on the platteland whose line is, &#x201C;Dit sal nooit gebeur nie; moenie bekommerd wees nie&#x201D;, but when it comes to talking for outside consumption we have this mythical plan. If we were to ask, as I ask, why they do not accelerate the plan, why they do not get on with it, they will tell us that there are many difficulties. Of course, the biggest difficulty of all is that it cannot be done. Another difficulty is that there is not the money for it. The Minister of Finance is the one who will tell us that for that type of ideological nonsense no funds are available. But, Sir, I do not have to tell you that even to-day local authorities throughout the country have had all their capital works cut. All the opportunities that were being offered by local authorities for improvement of the lot of people within their municipal boundaries have been cut. Yet hon. members <span class="col_1949-1950" refersTo="page_0992"/>can get up here to-day and enunciate a theory and a thesis that we can separate a group of people who I think at the present moment are something to the order of 10 million or 11 million, from the 16 million all told&#x2014;these were the 1960 figures. The exact figure is 10,928,000 Bantu. They theorize that we can take 3,471,000 Bantu in urban areas and move all of them&#x2014;this is on that basis of 5 per cent compound interest in reverse&#x2014;together with 7,457,000 Bantu in the rural areas. They say that we can reverse the order and make the country not only white in appearance but also white as far as activity is concerned. Mr. Speaker, the whole history of this country indicates, proves and shows that the whole of our development from the diamond mines&#x2019; earliest days to the gold mines of to-day depends entirely on black labour. So does industry, so does commerce, so does trade. I should like the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to answer me this question. He has made through his Deputy a studied statement to the effect that he intends to reduce the number of Bantu in the Western Cape. Well, I want to ask the Minister why he does not start at Vereeniging, or at Bellville, because those are the places where he should start. Let us show by example and precept that we are sincere. Why does he not start in Bloemfontein? These are the places at which to start. Because then people will believe in the sincerity of it all. But let me go further. Why does the Minister not start on all the farms and get all those Bantu away? I am very anxious, and will be most interested to see the swarms of white youths going to work on the mealie lands of the Free State. These are the things I am curious about. A new industry was opened to-day near Postmasburg and one finds that there are 900 Bantu there who are going to do the work and about 150-odd Whites who are going to supervise them. I think the Whites are going to see to it that the other boys do not walk off with the material!</p>

<p>I really and sincerely feel that it is time that these things were put in their correct perspective. The Government is not sincere. The Ministers speak with their tongues in their cheeks.</p>

My contention is that unless the Government makes up its mind to educate and train the Bantu who must of necessity remain in our midst, we are going to find most serious competition commercially from industries established in Basutoland and Botswana, by financial interests from South Africa who will use South African money to finance these companies and corporations in these Bantu states and compete with us on a basis of cheaply produced goods. Many of us have seen a parallel in the way Japanese have been treated in this country for many years.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the limited time at my disposal I cannot do justice to everything which has been said and in addition deal properly with the fundamental question which is under discussion. In the absence of the hon. member for Sea Point who moved the amendment I am not going to take the trouble of replying to the things he said here. I shall nevertheless deal with his amendment later on.</p>

<p>I want to begin by thanking the mover of this motion for raising a matter here to-day which is not merely a very real one but also one which is fundamental to our way of life and to the future of all the various races in South Africa. It is a matter which lends itself to much dicussion in South Africa&#x2014;and which <span class="col_1951-1952" refersTo="page_0993"/>ought to be discussed at length&#x2014;and it is a problem on which individuals in particular in South Africa must do a lot of work. I want to congratulate the hon. member on his very fine statement of the fundamental matter here.</p>

<p>I now want to refer briefly to the amendment. I think I would be spending more than enough time on the hon. member for Sea Point if I merely dealt with his amendment, because it is now the property of this House. In his amendment the hon. member refers to the so-called illusion from which we are suffering in regard to independent development within a political framework of divided state structure. It is not illusion. It is a perfectly natural approach to acknowledge the separateness of races and help them to develop separately towards their spiritual destination. But the illusion which does exist is the illusion of the Opposition, the illusion of those people who imagine, as the hon. member in fact intimated here this afternoon, that the Bantu people, the Coloureds and the Indians in South Africa can be left indefinitely with unfulfilled political aspirations. That is an illusion. The people who awake from that illusion will awake from it too late. In the second place the hon. member mentioned in his amendment the development in the economic field; as he puts it, the races need one another economically. That the Whites and all the various Bantu peoples and Indians and Coloureds need one another and must be complementary towards one another economically is not something which we deny. Of course we admit it. All our legislations and measures make provision for that, but we do not accept that standpoint on the same basis of the hon. member who views this matter on an integrationary basis. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I have given that hon. member so many sermons in regard to integration here and he still does not want to understand it. I know what Votes are going to be dealt with this year and I shall then deal with this matter again. I cannot discuss it now. I must now discuss what I have to discuss and not what the hon. member wants discussed. [Interjections.] I shall be glad if the racket on that side of the House would cease. In addition the hon. member asked for clarity in respect of the boundaries of the &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; White homelands. I am filled with sadness and despair when a White man, such as the hon. member speaks of our homeland as a &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; homeland. South Africa&#x2019;s White area is the homeland of that hon. member and of myself and of all White persons. Its boundaries are known to all in South Africa. There is not a single White person or Black person in South Africa at this moment who does not know where the boundaries between Whites and Blacks in South Africa are situated. Everybody knows where it is. There are laws which control the position in so far as those boundaries have to be changed in view of the requirements of peoples and localities. There are laws which control those aspects. There is no arbitrariness, disorder or uncertainty in that regard except the arbitrariness and disorder of the politically contaminated who want to make political capital out of the situation. That is the only uncertainty which there is.</p>

<p>I hope that the occasion will soon arise that the hon. member for Karoo, who went through this unfortunate experience, may once again be present in this House to put the points to which I would like to reply. Whether I shall have an opportunity of replying to him then, I do not know&#x2014;we hope so, but in any case we express the hope that he will soon be back again to put his case here. I shall therefore not react to what he said.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Parow who also spoke, I want to thank him for emphasizing the right approach, i.e. that what this matter is concerned with, more specifically in regard to the policy in the Western Cape is the replacement of the Bantu by Coloureds, which thus implies the prerequisite that the Coloureds should be made to be prepared for labour, suitable for labour and above all, willing to do labour, which is a tremendous task, not only as far as the Coloureds are concerned but also as far as the other non-White nations are concerned, and I am afraid also as far as many of our Whites are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the accent in this motion really falls on the labout independence aspect. It is true that mention is being made of a divided state structure and of independent development. As worded the motion therefore has wide implications and we must not allow ourselves to be led astray by talking about all kinds of minor matters. Unfortunately that is what the hon. member for Sea Point did. He put me in mind of the contrast between those people who stand on the hillcrests to admire the horizon and those who sit on an anthill looking for the holes in it. That is what the hon. member did. He could not discern the wide horizons of an important matter, but busied himself with trivialities. It is absolutely essential that we view the question of labour independence in relation to these other two concepts which were mentioned in the motion, because independent development is the prerequisite in terms of our policy and is the perfectly natural way in which development will take place for each separate nation which we have in South Africa. Nothing can better stimulate this desire for independence in a nation or even in an individual than dignified labour. That is why it is so essential that labour be seen with reference to our state development as well as all the other developments. When our concept of separate development in the political field became known in our social life years ago it was not at all as well thought out as it is to-day, and that is why it happened that in those early times, a <span class="col_1953-1954" refersTo="page_0994"/>division of labour between the various nations in our country, when compared with the situation in the mother countries where we originated from. That is why our task is so much more difficult now to undo something which had gone wrong for so many years. This revision of the concepts, the customs and the habits of our people to which we have grown accustomed over a period of almost two centuries is extremely essential, and it is a very real problem which faces us to-day. But let us understand, and this is something the hon. member for Sea Point should also try and understand, that this revision is a re-arrangement which cannot take place all at once. We are considering our institutions and customs, but the last thing we want to do is to disrupt our economy by taking injudicious and overhasty steps. It is a gradual task which all of us are aware of, but the hon. member for Sea Point does not realize that. He is too inclined to want to challenge us and pretend that the things which we set up as our goals must be achieved immediately. The State as such is expressly concerned wih this concept of labour independence, because any state finds its highest degree of development in the measure in which it can be completely independent; and to achieve that hard work will have to be done, not only for constitutional independence. Work will also have to be done in the economic, agricultural, educational and all other fields. The State has very great duties in this respect, also as far as labour independence is concerned. But it is not only the State, the citizenry and the individual also have duties. The State must see to it that there is a livelihood. It must see to it that there is work for its citizens. It is for that reason that we, under this system of ours, must accept and see to it that the different peoples which we have must have certain assurances, especially those who have their own territories. There must be certain provisions where they receive priority. It is for that reason that we are stating so clearly that as far as the territory of a nation is concerned, the members of that nation receive top priority in that territory, and that the members of the neighbouring nation take secondary place. That is why we say that in the Bantu areas of South Africa the Bantu receive first consideration. They must receive priority. But as far as they are unable to do certain or most of that work themselves, the Whites must do it for them in a temporary supplementary capacity. For what period of time this will be a temporary arrangement we cannot predict. The same also applies in the White homeland, the word which the hon. member for Sea Point is so afraid of. [Interjections.] The same therefore applies to the Coloured and the Indians which are at present sharing the White homeland with the Whites. In their own context and in their own areas which have been allocated to them in the common homeland, there must also be priorities for them. That is why it is so important that in an area such as the Western Cape, where one has other groups as well&#x2014; Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu&#x2014;one must act according to the natural state of affairs; and the natural state of affairs in the Western Cape, as far as labour is concerned, is that preference should be given to the Coloureds over the Bantu. But it must not be a theoretical preference which we merely set down in documents; it must be something which we try to apply daily. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Sea Point states that he has no objection to that. Then he must help us to implement it. That is the entire philosophy on which is based the practice which the Deputy Minister must implement and which the Opposition is deriding so much, i.e. that here in the Western Cape preference must be given to the Whites and to the Coloureds as far as labour is concerned, and that the Bantu must receive secondary consideration only, and that it should be implemented in practice. It is we who have to administer these matters, who must see to it that it is done carefully and judiciously. The State has the duty of arranging and classifying these things, but the citizens also have their claims and their rights, and whether the citizenry are Coloureds or Whites, they also have their duty which is to prepare themselves and make themselves suitable for labour. That is not always so easy, because many of them are unwilling to do so. That is why such a great task rests on the State. It is definitely something in regard to which the organizations of the various races, and in particular the churches, can render a tremendous service. To prepare an individual member of a race, whether it is a White, a Coloured or a Bantu, for labour and to make him suitable for and skilled in labour, is something in which the family must be concerned, as well as the school, the university and society with all its associations and churches. The church, and particularly the mission church, have a tremendous task in this connection. I think hon. members will agree with me that one of the first decrees issued to man was when he was told that he would earn his bread with the sweat of his brow. It has been part of our religion over all these centuries that man has been ordered &#x2014;not condemned&#x2014;to do work. That is why this task also rests on our churches, to which I want to make an earnest appeal to undertake a great task, i.e. to make those who are White, as well as those who are not White, aware of the fact that they must be prepared for and proficient in labour. It is a tremendous educational task. We also have a cultural task. We have many cultural organizations, both English and Afrikaans. But in the present time, and with a view to the requirements of the future, we have no greater cultural task than making our people, White as well as non-White, Afrikaans as well as English-speaking, aware of and prepared to do labour. We have no greater task. I am not afraid of being accused or attacked, by anybody whosoever, when I as an Afrikaans-speaking person say <span class="col_1955-1956" refersTo="page_0995"/>that this task, creating labour consciousness, is a greater cultural task to-day than maintaining the Afrikaans language. I say that candidly, and as loud as I can. The other task, maintaining our language, must not be neglected, but this is a greater task because there are far less people in South Africa who are aware of the need for being prepared to do labour which every White person in South Africa must exhibit, then they are aware of their duty to maintain their own language.</p>

<p>We must wake up in time. When I say &#x201C;we&#x201D; I am talking about the white people. We must wake up in time and see what is going on in South Africa. We must see to it that that illusion which the hon. member for Sea Point, and perhaps many of his own people too, suffers, i.e. to think that the present state of affairs or the state of affairs which have prevailed for the past half century will continue indefinitely in South Africa, will no longer be tenable. The time is coming, and it is coming soon, whether or not it is as a result of the application of the policy of separate development on this side of the House, when the Whites in South Africa will be forced to do more of their own work, particularly their personal work, themselves. I have experienced this in my life already, and I am certain that many of the hon. members who are with me in this House to-day, have also experienced it in their lives. What must be done to achieve that, was stated by the hon. member for Moorreesburg and the hon. member for Parow. Unfortunately we have had very little positive support from the hon. member on the opposite side. What we must do is, first and foremost, to implant and imprint this aim which I spoke about in the consciousness and mind of every person in South Africa&#x2014;amongst the Whites, amongst the various Bantu peoples, amongst the Coloureds and the Indians&#x2014;i.e. that we must gird ourselves and be prepared to work. This awareness must be implanted in the family, it must be implanted in the school, in the church and in society, as I said a moment ago. In the second place we must be prepared to implement that aim in practice. If we did so, we would have a very good future, and that is the purpose of this motion. It is a motion which goes to the heart of all these matters and that is why it is very important that it has been raised here to-day.</p>

<p>Various lines of thought have been expressed here. What is undoubtedly necessary, as I have said, is a revision of our thinking and our ideas on the subject and we shall have to rationalize in our industries, in our organizations and in our managerial methods; we shall have to introduce standardization and new methods in all kinds of ways.</p>

<p>Allow me, Sir, to mention a rather simple example which came to me a moment ago. I am going to take Pretoria as an example because that is the city in which I live, it is practically the city in which I grew up. The same conditions prevail in Cape Town as well; I have already experienced it here. At this present moment, at four o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon on a Friday, hon. members can go to any of our major cities and see one bicycle after another being ridden out to the white residential areas. These bicycles have on their carriers a packet from the chemist, a parcel from the shop, a parcel from the butcher, a parcel from a music shop and from a book-shop. At this moment 15 to 20 of them are probably riding out in the direction of Wynberg or Bishopscourt or Parow, and in Pretoria to Arcadia, Hatfield and Brooklyn. Twenty of them in a row, all of them coming from one small block between four streets in the city centre. Riding those bicycles out to the residential areas are Bantu. Now, Sir, with a little rationalization, there could be a bureau, if need be a municipal one, where everyone could deposit their packets before four o&#x2019;clock. Then a small vehicle, with a driver and manned by three Bantu perhaps, to make deliveries, could transport those goods and deliver them to all those places. That means that it would not be necessary for the remaining 15 Bantu to transport packages on their bicycles. That is a single example which I can give here.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member asks me what they are going to do. They are going to do other work. That will definitely not cause any unemployment. After all we cannot tackle the one thing suddenly without tackling the others which go with it. There must&#x2014;and here I agree with the thoughts expressed by the hon. member for Moorreesburg&#x2014;be proper labour planning in South Africa. There are far too many people who are always lying about on the lookout in all kinds of places to see whether they can get work there, and they are more inclined to live off other people than they are to work. There must be much better labour planning in order to distribute our people properly throughout the country. I have said previously in this House that there is too much misunderstanding, amongst the Bantu for example. They think that because they were born in a certain town, they must, come hell or high water, remain in that town in order to acquire the rights in terms of section 10 of the Urban Areas Act, irrespective of whether there is work for them there or not or whether the work carries an insufficient remuneration. They think they must remain there. Those kind of ideas are outdated. I include all these things when I say that there must be better rationalization in regard to these matters. There must be better labour planning so that the people&#x2019;s requirements, the regional needs, the incidence of labour in various places and all these things can be taken properly into consideration m order to be able to make our labour arrangements accordingly. Those are all things for the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I conclude with the idea that I mentioned just now, i.e. that although the <span class="col_1957-1958" refersTo="page_0996"/>State has a task, many&#x2014;perhaps most&#x2014;of these things can be implemented if the citizenry, through their organizations, tackle these things themselves. Many of these things can be accomplished without there having to be any compulsion from above forced upon people. That is why I conclude with the thought that this realization should penetrate to our public, it should be brought home to our public, so that it will not always be necessary for the State to dictate from above what is right. We know what the signs of the times are and we must prepare the public for the developments which will follow.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having just listened to the hon. the Minister, I am afraid that even now I am less convinced than ever that there is anything in this policy of the Government. The Minister was very careful to avoid the political issue altogether; instead he concentrated on the question of labour. I must say that for once&#x2014;possibly the first, and quite likely the last time&#x2014;I agree with the Minister, as far as the inculcation of a desire to work in the people is concerned. Of course that should be done&#x2014;it is a laudable idea. Everybody and every nation should have that desire. But whilst people have that desire, that drive in them, surely there must be appropriate opportunities provided for them. Rationalization is all very well, but then we must see to it that everybody in South Africa gets a square deal.</p>

<p>To me this motion before us is another typical example of the chauvinistic approach of this Government. I am quite sure that it is because of that attitude that the Government were put in power and are on that side of the House. And that is why they are still there. Because, Sir, that is a natural consequence of something which has a great appeal to so very many people.</p>

<p>We are talking in this motion about a homeland. Where is this homeland? I do not want to repeat the arguments that have been raised time and time again, but we all know that all authorities have proved, time and time again, that nowhere at any stage will South Africa&#x2014;or, as they wish to call it, the white homeland&#x2014;have anything but a majority of Bantu people within its borders. What is more, if the present trend continues we shall not only have a majority of Bantu people, but very soon also a majority of Coloured people. Mr. Speaker, I do believe the greatest sin any government can commit, is to mislead the people of its country. That is exactly what this Government is doing. They are dangling this carrot of a white homeland, their apartheid, which is going to provide a white homeland for the people before them. It is true that the people fall for it and that is why they have supported the Government. The sin of it all is that well-knowing that it cannot be carried out, they continue dangling the carrot. But, Sir, the people are not donkeys and the carrot will have no significance to them. The tide is going to turn. You can bluff some of the people, as we know, but you cannot bluff all the people all the time. The day of reckoning is coming and this Government will pay the penalty. It will be sooner than they think.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have asked where this homeland is, because despite all the measures which the Government has taken, everywhere in South Africa we still have a greater number of Bantu. No, there is no homeland. There is certainly no homeland for the Coloureds. And of course it was mentioned here to-day that there is no question of a homeland for them, although the hon. the Minister just referred to certain little areas, I presume towns and villages, which will be considered to be the homeland of the coloured people. Are they possibly then in this political framework, which we are discussing, considering developing the Coloureds on the lines of the United Party&#x2019;s race federation policy? Indeed I do believe so, because it was only last year in this very House that an hon. member on that side, when he was asked: &#x201C;What is your ultimate aim for the coloured people?&#x201D; used our very phraseology which you will find in our booklet: &#x201C;We will develop the Coloureds so that they have control of all those things with which they are intimately connected.&#x201D; The very words in our booklet. But they do not, of course, go the whole hog. They cut it short, they carry out again a policy of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; over the coloured people, because they say: &#x201C;So far you will develop and no further.&#x201D; What is the final political outlet then of the coloured people? No, they have certainly not told us anything at all in that connection to-day. The coloured people are limited in their development, although even in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of this week the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s three pillars are very prominently displayed and he says: &#x201C;The third one&#x2014;separate opportunities.&#x201D; They are supposed to be separate and equal opportunities. Where is the equality for the coloured people in political development?</p>

<p>When we come to this white homeland in relation to the Bantu people, the hon. the Minister started by saying: &#x201C;Now we all know what the Bantu homelands are, in consequence of which we know what the white homeland is.&#x201D; I grant him that. Just at this present moment we know which is the Bantu area and therefore which is a Bantu homeland. But is that the homeland as it is going to be? We know the late Prime Minister&#x2019;s announcement of this policy that the present borders are not final. We know that even at this present moment the Ciskei is altering in its size every day. I want to ask the hon. the Minister where does the Ciskei start and where does it end, because we have statements such as the hon. the Deputy Minister made at the Nationalist Party congress, namely that 100,000 morgen of land must still be purchased from the white people of the Ciskei to replace 100,000 morgen that will be taken from the Bantu. Where is that going to be? Can we know in any way whatsoever what our position is in the Ciskei? <span class="col_1959-1960" refersTo="page_0997"/>In reply to a question last year when I asked him which were the black spots in the Ciskei, he gave them, and when I asked him what was going to happen to them, he said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it has not yet been determined and it is not possible at this stage to state whether they will be consolidated or removed.</block>

<p>As far as we were concerned in the Ciskei and anywhere, for that matter, consolidation meant the removal of a black spot to join it to an existing black area. Therefore if you are not going to remove it when you consolidate it, surely you are going to buy out the white area until it is consolidated with the Bantu homeland? Can hon. members imagine for one moment the insecurity, the uncertainty that develops as a result of that attitude? And yet the hon. the Deputy Minister was the one to say in this House that we caused the suspicion. I ask you, Sir, when he is the very one who creates that suspicion through his very actions because we do not know where we are. When they have established a homeland, they also create their own artificial one. How are we to know where this homeland is going to start and end? We have a typical example&#x2014;Mdantsane, near East London. Only a little while ago it was a white area. To-day it is part of the Bantu homeland. Then the hon. the Minister says to us that we know which the Bantu homelands are; the laws are there, I deny it categorically. I do not know, nobody does and least of all does he know where the Bantu homelands are. Certainly he does not know where it is all going to end.</p>

<p>To add to all this confusion, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration said that he was going to reduce the number of Bantu people within the white homelands. This is the usual contradiction in terms, because ver the years it has been the Nationalist Party policy to reduce the Bantu in the white homelands and to replace them by contract labour. Now we find that the reverse is taking place. The contract labour is being reduced, because the Government cannot touch the permanent Bantu in the white homelands. This was the fact. They quoted time and again to us that contract labour is the labour we want for white South Africa. After all, they would be like the Italians in Europe. They would go across the border and work and then go back. That was the whole basis of the Bantustan policy, so that they could get political rights in the homelands whilst working in white South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the mover of the motion mentioned that the economic structure must not be built on Bantu labour. But it has been proved time and again that this is the fact already. This knot cannot be untied. I do not think that the hon. the Minister has any right at all to say this afternoon that he will and that he can untie this knot. It is the very concept on which the border industrial development has been built, namely the fact that we rely on them and they rely on us.</p>

<p>In connection with this moving of the industries to border areas, it is, of course, as we have pointed out time and again a great advantage to have decentralization and in as much as it falls within our interpretation of decentralization of industries, we agree with it. But I do want to point out that the hon. the Minister is making a great mistake if he thinks that the effect is going to be earth-shattering, because if we take a place like Johannesburg alone, which has 344,000 Bantu working people, only 16 per cent of those people are actually employed in industry. Therefore the number that is affected, is far less than he considers.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that I have not heard this afternoon any argument that convinced me that the framework of a different political approach towards independent states works in any way. I am quite sure that the only solution for this country is what we have moved in the amendment, and I support it accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, our Parliament is a sovereign body and we are proud of that sovereignty. We know that our Acts and statutes take precedence over the ordinances and the byelaws of local bodies. It is quite clear and we proved it over the years that we are very reluctant to interfere with the powers that these subordinate bodies have.</p>

<p>At the same time, we as a Parliament cannot evade our responsibilities if these delegated powers are on occasion flagrantly mismanaged. My submission is that over the past years, a state of affairs has arisen in regard to wastage and maladministration in one particular province, in the Transvaal, which, at last, has called for the Parliament of South Africa to take notice of what is going on.</p>

<p>Therefore I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, while re-affirming its belief in the rights of the provinces, expresses its deep sense of shock at the revelations of wastage and maladministration in the Transvaal Provincial Administration during the past years and calls upon the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a judicial commission to investigate and report on the matter</block>

<p>I stand here as a believer in the rights of the provinces. Those rights, which involve control over hospitals, roads and education, have very seldom been abused. For this we <span class="col_1961-1962" refersTo="page_0998"/>have to thank the provincial administrations in the past. I am quite prepared to thank the provincial administrations of different political character, but when a ward continually fails to look after himself, we, as the guardians, must warn that ward to start looking after his own affairs in a better way. We are morally bound by our Constitution to enquire into what is going on.</p>

<p>We as a sovereign Parliament have a more than cursory interest in what is happening in the provinces. After all, every year we vote close on R170 million on Revenue Account and R40 million on Loan Account for them. I might add that the Transvaal gets the largest share of this amount. We, as a Parliament, and not the provinces pay the salary of R9,000 a year of the Administrators. It is my intention to prove that a large portion of the money in the Transvaal which we give as a Parliament is being mismanaged. These facts have been brought to light by the excellent work of a team of United Party members of the Provincial Council in Transvaal, ably led by two people whose names I should mention: First of all Mr. Harry Schwarz, the leader of the United Party in the Transvaal Provincial Council; and secondly Major Opperman, who, together with Mr. Schwarz, formed the members of the United Party on their Sessional Committee on Public Accounts.</p>

<p>Hon. members will ask me to mention instances of this alleged mismanagement. I shall give them instances this afternoon. I know that in all provinces there are, on occasion, cases of irregularities and unnecessary losses, but what has been happening in the Transvaal is quite unique. It is a case of growing irregularities on a scale which has never been seen or known in the history of South Africa in any provincial administration. It is a subject which has been continuing and increasing year after year. Now I shall give the House a few instances. My time is limited. I cannot mention all I should like to.</p>

<p>I want to deal, first of all, with the chaotic state of affairs in regard to the payment of teachers&#x2019; salaries in the Transvaal. The facts are almost unbelievable. In 1964 the Provincial Auditor had already warned of a serious lack of internal supervision and control in the section charged with the paying out of teachers&#x2019; salaries. But despite that warning, a year later the position was found not to have improved, but to have worsened. In last year&#x2019;s Auditor&#x2019;s Report the position was actually as bad as it has ever been, if not the worst. A test audit was made of only 10 per cent of relevant cases and it revealed over- and underpayments to the teachers of R 16.000. So what was the true position? The position was ten times worse&#x2014;R 160,000 worth of discrepancies in the payment of teachers&#x2019; salaries in one single year.</p>

<p>How bad the position is in the Transvaal will be seen from these facts admitted by the Transvaal Provincial Administration and guiltily admitted by them too. In the Transvaal there are 17,000 teachers. Do you know how many of them were paid wrongly last year? 4,160 were paid wrongly. It is an unheard of thing. It is a grotesque situation. There has not been something like that in this country ever in our history. Do you know how many mistakes were found? 14,000 were found. This is in the inner temple of Christian national education. No wonder there is the dissatisfaction in the teachers&#x2019; profession. A temporary overpayment does not benefit a teacher. He has to pay back that money. His personal budgeting is upset. Yes, Sir, there are 17,000 teachers and there were 14,000 mistakes in salary payments in one year.</p>

<p>There is one ugly characteristic in regard to all this. I see the hon. the Minister of Transport smiling. I wonder how many cases of discrepancies and mistakes there are in the Railways.</p>

<p>Good! I am quite satisfied that it will be much less. One ugly characteristic of the position in the Transvaal is the contemptuous indifference with which charges are dismissed. When the accounting officer of the Department of Education was asked what he was doing about these irregularities in payments of teachers&#x2019; salaries in his Department, his reply to the Provincial Auditor was contemptuous. He said: &#x201C;I disclaim responsibility for the large number of errors and am by no means concerned about the quality of the work done and the control measures applied.&#x201D; I am quite sure that he was speaking on behalf of the Exco member in charge of education in the Transvaal Provincial Council. Yes, Sir, I believe, and I am not using too strong a word, that we, the taxpayers of South Africa, through this mismanagement are actually being robbed by the Transvaal Provincial Administration and they are by no means concerned about what is happening. If there had only been signs that they were actively trying, and with fair results, to improve the position, it would not have been necessary to ask here this afternoon for a judicial inquiry.</p>

<p>The culminating point of this disgraceful and callous indifference, we saw this year&#x2014; last month indeed&#x2014;in regard to teachers&#x2019; salaries. Our M.P.C. for Von Brandis, Major Opperman, noticed a strange discrepancy in the budget figures presented to the provincial council; he investigated the figures. He asked the Administrator what was wrong. The Administrator looked and said: &#x201C;Yes, there may be something wrong; I will find out.&#x201D; You know, Sir, what they found out? They found out that last month, in January, 3,352 teachers in the Transvaal had been underpaid illegally to the extent of R24,000. As a result of the good work done by the United Party in the provincial council, those moneys were <span class="col_1963-1964" refersTo="page_0999"/>included in the next salary cheques, but what a new year it must have been for those 3,352 teachers who had been underpaid through stupidity.</p>

<p>Do you know, Sir, that last year the Budget of the Transvaal Provincial Council, through mistakes, was out by R3¾ million? Does the hon. the Minister know that they failed at one stage to make provision for the salaries of 752 teachers? Sir, I am particularly perturbed about this atrocious budgeting because it affects Parliament. Our Minister of Finance bases his allocations to the provinces partly on the estimates presented to him by the Transvaal province. If these estimates are out by millions, we might be paying millions too much or millions too little to the Transvaal and who are the sufferers? The taxpayers of this country. Sir, this is a grotesquely abnormal situation that must be remedied.</p>

<p>They should. Another unsatisfactory feature of the Transvaal educational system is the highly unsatisfactory state of affairs in regard to the repayment of bursaries and loans to students who were studying to become teachers. Many of these youngsters break their contracts to become teachers after they have had loans and then refuse to pay back the money. The amount owing by this group who did not become teachers jumped from R900,000 in 1964 to R 1,100,000 in 1965. I admit that not all these moneys were in arrears, but it was found out that 1,103 of these young men and women who had been educated at the expense of the taxpayers of South Africa and who had entered into contracts to become teachers, did not become teachers, and they are not repaying their loans as they should be doing. They either pay nothing or they send in an occasional small token amount. Sir, the position is not improving because whereas the amount outstanding the year before last was R 1,100,000, last year it was R1,400,000. It is not surprising that the Provincial Auditor finds it necessary to say: &#x201C;It is clear that efforts will have to continue to be made to collect these debts.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I now come to the next important department of the Transvaal Provincial Council, the hospitals. In Johannesburg there are two skeletons of steel and concrete which bear mute and sad testimony to the inefficiency and maladministration of the Transvaal Provincial Administration; there are the Johannesburg General Hospital and the Auckland Park Memorial Hospital, the J. G. Strijdom Hospital. They form a stark contrast to the efficiency of the municipal projects which surround them. Let us look at the sad story of these hospitals. The Auckland Park Hospital appeared on the Estimates of 1956. There was a slow start, and five years later, in 1961, little more than the nurses&#x2019; quarters had been finished. Do you know, Sir, that those nurses&#x2019; quarters have never yet been used? They were started in 1956, finished in 1961 and have never been used as nurses&#x2019; quarters. In 1961 the site of the Auckland Park Hospital was handed over to a contractor for completion of the work by 1964 and then the fun started really. Work went on for almost a year and then it was suddenly stopped from above. The plans were found to be hopelessly and utterly outdated for a hospital. The Nationalist administration had promised that they would appoint a committee to supervise the building and so forth, but that committee was not appointed until eight months later. It should have been appointed eight months earlier to see what was going on at the Auckland Park Hospital.</p>

<p>Sir, the Pandora&#x2019;s box opened and what flew out was not a pretty sight. The Provincial Architect himself&#x2014;not the United Party&#x2014; warned in writing: &#x201C;It is my considered opinion that this hospital cannot function in its present form.&#x201D; Sir, they discovered that five or six years after they had started building it. The Director of Hospitals had to admit: &#x201C;The hospital is not modern and there are deficiencies.&#x201D; The Provincial Architect said in his second letter: &#x201C;A great deal of money will be required to rectify the defects and to make the necessary amendments to put this hospital into a state in which it will function.&#x201D; Then a certain file was suddenly missing. Do you know, Sir, what happened to that file? The file bore the word &#x201C;Hospital&#x201D;, but it was not filed under the word &#x201C;Hospital&#x201D;; it was filed under the word &#x201C;Latipsoh&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister will see that that is the word &#x201C;Hospital&#x201D; written backwards. When they did discover that file, they found it under the letter &#x201C;1&#x201D; instead of under the letter &#x201C;h&#x201D;, and they found in it a letter giving instructions to the contractor, &#x201C;please start work on the Johannesburg General Hospital before the 3rd of February&#x201D;, in other words, before the provincial election. That letter was in the &#x201C;Latipsoh&#x201D; file. The result of the delay was that the contractor had to be paid an extra R1&#x00BD; million. Sir, there is nothing &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; about that side of the House when it comes to spending the taxpayers&#x2019; money. &#x201C;Let the people pay&#x201D; &#x2014;that is their motto in the Transvaal to-day.</p>

<p>Then I come to a second steel skeleton in their cupboard, the Johannesburg General Hospital itself. Sir, what a sorry state of &#x201C;stop&#x201D; and &#x201C;go&#x201D; is revealed in regard to that building, of vacillation, of altered plans and ever increasing costs. Thirteen years ago grandiose schemes were mooted for expanding the Johannesburg General Hospital. First of all it was to have an additional building of about 15 storeys, then of 22 storeys and then of 28 storeys, with incidentally a maternity home right at the top in spite of the fact that doctors objected to it. At any rate, since these wonderful plans were announced, the estimates of costs have grown. The original estimates provided for an expenditure of R3 million. To-day those estimates have grown to R24 <span class="col_1965-1966" refersTo="page_1000"/>million; an eightfold increase. Not even the Minister of Railways has ever equalled that record. Sir, what do we see after 13 years? You see a huge hole in the ground where they have been digging the basement and you see three unfinished storeys. It has taken 13 years to build the outlines, the skeleton, of three storeys. At the rate it will take more than 120 years to build the whole of the Johannesburg General Hospital and it will probably be opened in the Jubilee Year &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; or in 1978 when all the Native labour in Johannesburg, in terms of the policy of apartheid, will have gone back to the reserves. Sir, I said a minute ago that this building, the Johannesburg General Hospital, has been standing forlorn all these years. Perhaps that is the wrong word because there have been two periods of intense activity. I have already mentioned the first one when written instructions came to the contractor to say that he must please start building before the provincial elections &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. S. J. M. STEYN:, And they stopped immediately after the election.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>After the election everything died down, and now we suddenly discover that a couple of weeks ago there was again some activity at the Johannesburg General hospital; they are again building. I wonder why? Is there another election in the offing, and is it a pure coincidence that there is to be an election in Johannesburg next Wednesday? I do not know. Perhaps hon. members opposite can tell us.</p>

<p>In the limited time at my disposal I shall only mention the shocking story of the Pretoria Hospital in passing, where R24,000 is owed by two radiologists for the use of facilities at the hospital. I see the Minister looks horrified. I hope he knows about these things. R22.000 had to be paid by the Provincial Administration for admitted negligence in the treatment of patients; there was a shortfall of R85.000 in hospital inventories, and there was a failure to instal a proper system for the collection of hospital fees. There were seven cases of serious irregularity in large hospitals in one year.</p>

<p>I must make more than passing mention of the scandal about the linen banks. Does the Minister know what happened? In 1965 it was decided that all linen stocks for hospitals should be transferred to eight central linen banks spread out over the Transvaal from Pietersburg to Johannesburg and Pretoria. A couple of months later a horrified provincial auditor went to check on what was going on in these linen banks. He went, first of all, to the Pretoria linen bank and do you know what he found? He found first of all that all the linen had been transferred from that big area to this linen bank in Pretoria without counting how many pieces there were. But the auditor started counting, and this will shock you, Sir. It was found that in that one linen bank alone there was an estimated shortage to the value of R36,000 worth of linen. Never in the history of South Africa has such a thing happened. A few months later other reports came in from other linen banks&#x2014;by then the total of unaccounted-for linen had risen to R58,000. The provincial auditor who reported did not mince his words. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite repeated efforts, it was impossible to effect bookkeeping reconciliation between the figures in the available registers.</block>

<p>In other words, a lot of linen had disappeared. As the result of this, the auditor writes that the losses of linen after the establishment of the linen banks up to September, 1966, when there was no proper inventory or control, will never become known. Already they have admitted a loss of R60,000. How much more has been lost? Another R50,000? It will never be known and the taxpayer will pay this. An official was asked to comment on this system. He called it a &#x201C;bastard&#x201D; system.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the third major department of the Provincial Administration, and that is the Roads Department. Here I want to mention an instance which is almost without parallel in the history of our province. What happened was this. By 1962 it became apparent that certain strange things were happening in regard to the Heidelberg Provincial Road Unit. An inspector was sent out, but unaccountably the road unit was always warned beforehand that inspectors were coming. So, not strangely, these irregularities continued. Then an anonymous letter was written to the Provincial Auditor, and afterwards a letter was written by somebody in Heidelberg to the late Prime Minister, who was the Member of Parliament for Heidelberg. A cloak could no longer be drawn over what was going on and an investigation was started. The result was almost incredible. First of all it was found that State money, labour, machinery and property had been unlawfully appropriated. Secondly it was found that fruitless expenditure involving thousands of rands had been incurred, <i>inter alia</i>, through transport contractors being allowed to convey gravel over much longer distances than they should have done, as the result of which, I presume, they made a lot of money. But then this road unit really hit the jackpot. Listen to this, Sir. Without charging anybody a cent, without any permission at all from the Provincial Administration, this road unit completed a huge number of works for private individuals and private bodies, and even for some municipalities, quite illegally. The work included the building of no fewer than 26 dams on private properties for 25 farmers in the Heidelberg district. Surely this sort of thing deserves investigation? The farmers were delighted, I am sure, but I believe they have now been approached to repay that money. Work was also <span class="col_1967-1968" refersTo="page_1001"/>done without authority or payment for the Heidelberg Municipality and for the Municipalities of Balfour and Rensburg, and also for the N.G. Kerk. This must have been really a Christian national road unit! One private company borrowed the tar distributor of that road unit and built a lovely tarred road, all at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>I ask you, Sir, what is happening in the Transvaal Provincial Council? What are its Administrator and his Executive Committee, staunch Nationalists to a man, doing about it? I will tell you what they are not doing. There is a sessional committee, as I mentioned before, of the Transvaal Provincial Council, like the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and they were so shocked by this Heidelberg road unit scandal that they wrote to the Administrator saying that they recommend that he immediately appoint a commission to investigate the matter. Five weeks passed and then the Administrator and his Executive Committee wrote to the chairman of the sessional committee, a Nationalist-dominated body, stating that a committee of inquiry at that stage was undesirable and unnecessary&#x2014;unnecessary, Sir, when 25 private dams had been built with the money of the taxpayer! But, of course, Big Brother has spoken and there will be no provincial commission of inquiry. [Interjection.] Meanwhile I believe the police have been investigating. Mention has been made of a judicial inquiry, but to-day in this House, the Minister of Justice said in reply to a question I put to him that there had been no judicial commission of inquiry into this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I had the time my list of irregularities would be at least six times as long as this, but I do think that I have indicated the following. Firstly, there are serious irregularities on an unprecedented scale in the Transvaal Provincial Administration. Secondly, there has been wastage and maladministration out of proportion to what we have come to expect even from a Nationalist body. Thirdly, there is an astonishing and stupefying lack of internal control and supervision in matters such as teachers’ salaries, repayment of loans, hospital fees, linen banks, road projects and stock accounts. Fourthly, these irregularities and maladministration and wastage have tended to become progressively worse over the past five years. Fifthly, in too many cases there has been a shocking indifference to public protest and attempts to remedy the position have been carried out with reluctance and little effect. Sixthly, these irregularities are beyond all comparison with slight irregularities on a smaller scale in other provinces. They are as the beam to the splinter, as the deluge to the rivulet. Seventhly, it shows that the Transvaal Nationalist Administration cannot be trusted, without the gravest anxiety and reservations on the part of Parliament, to run the richest province of the Republic. I do not even trust them with running the monkey-house in the Pretoria Zoo. And, eighthly and finally, it has been proved that this whole sorry mess cries to high heaven for an immediate judicial investigation. Let me tell the Transvaal Nationalist Administration and the Minister that the wonderful party they have been having in the Transvaal is over, and that their day of reckoning has now come.</p>

<p>No, the National Party did, because it is the governing party. In regard to the other matters which the hon. member mentioned in regard to the Heidelberg road camp, I want to say that the hon. member knows as well as anybody else in this House that the police are investigating the matter. Why does the hon. member want a commission appointed? Has he no confidence in our police force? We, the Nationalists, have full confidence in the police, and for that reason are not prepared to appoint a commission. All that the hon. member wants to do is to institute a witch hunt. Now he suddenly asks the question, &#x201C;Why the building activities before the Provincial Council election?&#x201D; Now I ask the hon. member this question: &#x201C;Why the witch hunt here this afternoon in this House?&#x201D; Is that side afraid of the Johannesburg City Council election which is being held on Wednesday? That side is afraid. But I want to tell the hon. members on the opposite side, &#x201C;Alas, it is too late, you have already lost. That will be the outcome.&#x201D; We know the hon. member for Orange Grove. For how many years has he not been sticking his nose into other people’s business? For how many years has he been leaving this House empty-handed time and again? Now the hon. member is afraid of hon. members on this side and that is why he has gone to seek pastures new where he knows that the people who have all the facts cannot reply to him. Or does the hon. member no longer have any confidence in his own people in the provincial council? Does the hon. member want to take over the leadership from Mr. Harry Schwarz? Does the hon. member aspire to leadership in the Transvaal? The hon. member is now the new leader for the Transvaal. I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville now that he must look out because his leadership is in danger.</p>

<p><span class="col_1969-1970" refersTo="page_1002"/>Mr. Speaker, I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses&#x2014;</block>

<li>(b) its appreciation for the capable and efficient manner in which the Administration conducts all the affairs entrusted to it in terms of the Constitution&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>The trouble with the hon. member for Orange Grove is this. He thinks Johannesburg is the Transvaal, and he thinks the boundaries of the Transvaal correspond to the municipal boundaries of Johannesburg. Do you know, Sir, why the hon. member is so worried? The reason is that the last bastion which the United Party conquered and which they think is still part of their kingdom is rapidly falling. The National Party is even carrying the challenge to the United Party there. I predict now, Sir, that after Wednesday the United Party will be confronted by a grave danger. It is true Johannesburg is a big city&#x2014;the biggest city in the Republic of South Africa. But it must be borne in mind that it is not the only city in the Transvaal. The Transvaal is a big, a powerful and a dynamic province. It is blessed with mineral riches. The Province covers more than 110,000 square miles. It has a total population of more than 6 million souls, in other words, 40 per cent of the population of the country.</p>

<p>The town council is going to become Nationalist again on Wednesday. Hon. members are always clutching at straws. I repeat, Sir, the Transvaal does not consist only of Johannesburg. The Transvaal consists of three major cities, of which Johannesburg is one. That city has a population of 1&#x00BD; million. Then there is Pretoria with a population of 681,000. [Interjections.] Good, I make the hon. member a present of 500,000. Germiston has 214,000 people. Then there are two large towns with more than 140,000 souls each, five towns with between 70,000 and 100,000 people and another six towns with between 34,000 and 74,000 inhabitants. Do you know what it is the hon. members of the Opposition cannot swallow, Sir? It is the fact that when 9th March, 1949, dawned, the National Party began to govern the Transvaal. What did we have at that time, after the United Party had governed the Transvaal for so many years? What was the situation in the sphere of hospital services?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>There was free hospitalization.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, you did introduce that, but it caused the greatest chaos in the Transvaal. The U.P. did introduce free hospital treatment, but did they supply the necessary number of beds? Was the necessary accommodation provided? Not at all. We are still to-day picking the bitter fruits of free hospital treatment which the U.P. introduced. The National Party is rectifying the matter step by step.</p>

<p>Let us take local government. How did the United Party control local authorities in those years? I am not going to enlarge very much on that. What was the result of their maladministration? The National Party had to remove the inhabitants of all the Bantu townships to various other places because the U.P. had mostly placed them within the White areas of our cities.</p>

<p>What chaos prevailed in the sphere of education! Our children and children of hon. members on the opposite side had to attend school under trees and in tents because the necessary facilities were not available. What a backlog were we not faced with in respect of our roads! And the Transvaal buildings, were they not in a most chaotic condition?</p>

<p>But since the National Party took over, we see the most spectacular development in the Transvaal, development which has taken place in the past 16 years. The National Party set the pace and created the climate for unprecedented confidence and an unknown prosperity in the Transvaal. The ever-increasing and tremendous amounts which were invested in buildings, roads, bridges and services, can be regarded as the most striking monument to the sensible way in which the National Party is governing the Transvaal. It has unshakable faith in the future. The National Party spent just as much capital in the Transvaal in 1964-’65 as the United Party had spent there over the ten preceding years. What was the situation in regard to accommodation for staff in Pretoria? Were the various departments not spread over the entire length and breadth of the city? The National Party then erected a beautiful new provincial building. There sits the hon. member for Parktown who opposed us so bitterly when that building was being erected. To-day that building is standing in Pretoria as a monument to us in the Transvaal. It is one of the most beautiful buildings in our country. And it is all thanks to the steps taken by the National Party.</p>

<p>Hon member, Sir.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. members on the opposite side in what condition our schools were in the year 1949. What were conditions on the Witwatersrand and over the length and breadth of the Transvaal? In 1949 there were only 57 high schools in the Transvaal; last year there were 153. What was the situation on the East Rand? We have heard in another debate how the United Party neglected Natal. It is a pity that I could not participate in that debate, because I could also have told him how the United Party neglected the East Rand. Do you know that it was only in 1954 that every town on the East Rand had been given high schools? We did not neglect the English-speaking children, we saw to it that they had adequate accommodation. In that way, for example, we saw to it that hostel facilities were made available for English-speaking children in the Nigel area. Then hon. members of the Opposition come along to-day and launch this attack. Let us look at the state of affairs in regard to lower education. We find that here too adjustments are being made from time to time. We find that the number of pupils in secondary schools has increased from 66,656 in 1953 to 112,000 in 1966&#x2014;in other words, an increase of 68 per cent. As far as the matriculation students are concerned, we find that they have increased from 3,666 in 1953, to 11,858 in 1966. We find that junior high schools and farm schools have been converted to full-fledged high schools and that the subject choice open to pupils has been widened. Secondary education is free to-day and the age limit for compulsory school attendance has been raised, suitable differentiated courses have been introduced to provide in an efficient way for the educational requirements of the pupils.</p>

<p>As far as the training of teachers is concerned we find that tremendous progress has been made. We find that the Transvaal Province is drawing to itself people in order to train them as teachers. The teachers training colleges in Transvaal stand to-day as a monument to us. There are altogether five of them and we are proud of them. The number of enrolments at these colleges in 1966 was 2,146 and for this year, i.e. 1967, it was 2,379. In addition the number of students produced annually by the teachers’ training colleges, increased from 488 in 1953 to 1,500 in 1966. We find that provincial authorities make available the necessary facilities to working teachers in order to enable them to convey knowledge to the child more successfully. We are proud of that. For that hon. member to come forward now and allege that the provincial councils of Transvaal and the Administrator of the Transvaal do not give the teachers their fair share as far as salaries is concerned, is far-reaching. The hon. member knows that there is no teacher, male or female, in the Transvaal who is underpaid. The hon. member ought also to know that it takes from three to four months to make salary adjustments. The moment those adjustments have been made, the teachers will receive their fair share.</p>

<p>When we come to the construction of roads, there is one thing of which the Transvaal as Province can be proud, and that is of its roads, particularly since the National Party came into power there. Hon. members know that before that time nothing happened. Since the National Party came into power there, we have been constructing a network of roads in the Transvaal of which we can be proud. If we look at the same time at the tremendous development in the field of farming, industry and mining then we realize what tremendous progress is taking place in the Transvaal. In the past 16 years 3,600 miles of road have been tarred, consisting of 525 miles of national roads &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Orange Grove will of course not listen to these figures because they hit him hard, right between the eyes. As I have said, 525 miles of national roads, 2,700 miles of provincial roads, and 400 miles of district roads which have been tarred over the past 16 years. As compared with that there were in 1949, when the United Party was still governing the Transvaal, only 1,590 miles of tarred road as against 5,190 miles to-day. In addition a further 380 miles are being tarred each year. Just look at the beautiful mountain route which is taking shape in the Transvaal. Look at the number of passes which have already been constructed and tarred. More will be said about this later. Looking at all these things, we must say that this motion is misplaced. Once more the hon. members of the Opposition have shown that they have no confidence in the United Party members in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal. That is why this motion is a motion of no-confidence in the United Party in the Transvaal Provincial Council.</p>

<p>It may be in spite of their Party, but if there were a régime in the Transvaal which could not meet the increasing needs of the Transvaal, thanks to the development of the Transvaal’s activities by private entrepreuneurs, then they have no right to talk about the matter. We concede that the Transvaal is growing and that the growth of the Transvaal is spectacular. We concede that any administration in the Transvaal has to meet the consequential demands imposed by such spectacular growth. What we want to discuss to-day is the fact that that provision, as made by the Provincial Administration of the Transvaal, is accompanied by maladministration and the outrageous wastage of money. What is the reply to that? The reply given to us by the hon. member&#x2014;I do not have time to discuss it in detail&#x2014;referred, for example, to the wonderful progress made with regard to schools. That is true; that was necessary. The children are there and they have to go to school. But he did not tell us about the inexplicable deterioration. In the largest city, Johannesburg, a city with a population of 1¼ million, there are at present no hostel facilities whatsoever in a high school for English-speaking girls.</p>

Hostels of the Barnato Park High School, the Johannesburg Girls High, were closed last year. That is typical. And then he has the temerity to talk about progress and to say that the needs of the people are met. Sir, he talked about roads. I do not want to detract from the roads that have been built in the Transvaal. Very fine work has been done and I want to say that as far as the needs of the city dwellers in the Transvaal are concerned, particularly those of the two major cities, Pretoria and Johannesburg, the Transvaal is the most backward province in the country.</p>

<p>No, the hon member must keep quiet and listen to what I am saying. He should not reveal his ignorance precipitately. I am talking about the road that links the Johannesburg municipality with the municipality of Pretoria, the road which links South Africa’s capital with South Africa’s largest city. It is still a single carriage-way. It is an inadequate road. Last year they started building the dual carriage-way which is needed. I believe the road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg will be completed this year or next year. That is the difference. Neither Durban nor Pietermaritzburg is a large city or the capital of South Africa. But the Natal Provincial Council meets the needs of the densely populated regions of South Africa, and the Transvaal Provincial Council sleeps.</p>

<p>Let us come back to the subject of the motion. The motion does not relate to the question as to whether the needs are being met. The motion relates to how those needs are met, and to the degree of efficiency and care with which they utilize the public money. What do we find? Anybody who listened to the account of the hon. member for Orange Grove must be shocked. It is unbelievable. He covered the field. I just want to emphasize a point here and there. He said, for example, that he would not even mention Vereeniging Hospital. I just want to read to you from the report of the sessional committee on public accounts of the Transvaal Provincial Council, to illustrate what happened at Vereeniging Hospital. This is the report which was published in February, 1964. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the Provincial Auditor&#x2019;s report and the explanation of the Department of Hospital Services it appears that nearly seven years have expired between the date on which the architects were commissioned for the drawing up of the sketch plan for this service and the date on which the site was handed to the building contractor.</block>

<p>Can you believe that, Sir? Look what happened in those seven years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scarcely a month after building operations had been commenced the work was abandoned and it was resolved to replan the whole project.</block>

<p>They had seven years in which to study the plans. First they start building and then they say the plans are worth nothing. But listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After a commencement had already been made with the work the conclusion arrived at was that the planning did not comply with the requirements of a modern hospital. The division of beds was not realistic. The <span class="col_1975-1976" refersTo="page_1005"/>planning for the out-patients and casualty wards was too luxurious and the accommodation plans excessive. The area of the ground floor of the main block could be planned so as to accommodate the X-ray and outpatients&#x2019; departments to be accommodated in single storey buildings as well, and there were several other instances where excessive accommodation had been planned, some of which could, however, be put to good use.</block>

<p>Can you believe that? Nor is it only Vereeniging. From the hon. member for Orange Grove we heard about similar cases which occurred in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, and Pietersburg. Similar things happened in the Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Johannesburg. It is a pattern. One does not want to be unreasonable. When dealing with a large administration which involves an expenditure of millions and millions of rands, one expects an error now and then. Now and then an irregularity will occur. But when it becomes a pattern, a regular practice, and when one hears about a hospital building in the Transvaal and immediately expects something to go wrong, it is time we took notice of it. Sir, can you believe that the alterations to the Johannesburg General Hospital have been in abeyance for 13 years? For years, whenever one drives down Smith Street, past the Johannesburg General Hospital, one sees a block of three storeys with no windows and no inside walls. There it is, a monument to inefficiency, incompetence, ineptitude and wastage. It is unbelievable. I just want to give you an idea of what is happening in that department. They were building the Children&#x2019;s Hospital. One of the excellent jobs in that hospital was the Röntgen Ray Department. It was built excellently and beautifully. Everything was right. Thousands of rands were spent quite justifiably. All that had to be done was to bring in the Röntgen Ray equipment. Then they found that they could not get it in. The doors and the windows were too small. They had to break them down to get the equipment into the hospital. One cannot help laughing. That is the money of the taxpayers. This is neither an exceptional nor an isolated instance. It is part of a programme. It is the rule. It happens in the case of virtually every hospital planned and built in the Transvaal. Nor is that all. I want to draw attention to something else which is happening as far as our hospitals are concerned. The hon. member for Brakpan referred to the fact that the United Party introduced free hospital services. Perhaps there were not enough beds. Perhaps there was a great deal wrong. But the middleclass family man knew that if there was grave illness in his family he could get the best treatment and that he would not be financially worried and troubled. But now free hospital services have been abolished. I doubt whether it is cut and dried: I wonder whether it will not be cheaper in the Transvaal nowadays to provide free hospital services rather than to continue with the hopeless, hamfisted, aimless and inefficient system obtaining, there. Here I have a stack of reports of the sessional committee on public accounts of the Transvaal, and I want to tell you a story from these reports. These are not wild statements. Every fact comes from the reports of the sessional committees and from the reports of the debates in the Provincial Council. The report states that in 1959-&#x2019;60 outstanding fees payable by hospital patients up to 31st March, 1960, increased by R428,995 to R1,800,000. Bear in mind that that was seven or eight years ago. The committee requested unanimously that the matter receive serious consideration. Every United Party and Nationalist Party member on that committee asked that the matter should please receive attention. The following year the arrears increased not by R500,000 but by R1,094,000, and once again the committee requested that the matter receive attention, and said that it could not continue along those lines. In 1961-&#x2019;62 the arrears increased by R1,258,292. In one year the arrears, increased by a third, and the committee said that it understood steps were being taken and that it hoped for the best. The next year there was a new phenomenon. Now the amounts are becoming much smaller because tremendous amounts are being written off all of a sudden. Large amounts among those that had&#x2019; to be written off, had to be written off because the claims had become prescribed. If the debtor can succeed for several years in not being placed in a position where he has to admit his debt by way of payment or by way of an application for an extension, the claim against him becomes prescribed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In 1962-&#x2019;63 they wrote off the colossal amount of R1,107,000, and yet the arrears balance increased by R67,000 and the committee said: &#x201C;It is really time now for an improvement.&#x201D; In 1963-&#x2019;64 they wrote off R1,181,000, and yet the total rose and the committee said there must be a. staff shortage somewhere. In 1964-&#x2019;65 approximately R600,000 more was written off. The total debt is not mentioned, but if one looks at the report of the Auditor-General for 1965-&#x2019;66, one finds that the amount outstanding at 31st March, 1966, was still more than R2 million. Although far more than R2 million had been written off, the amount was still higher than in 1951. The only deduction one can make from that is that there is something wrong somewhere, and if one wants to know what is wrong, one should look at the replies, the sessional committee received from the departments concerned. It appears that the difficulty arose because in 1946, during the period of free hospitalization, the accounts of the hospital in the Transvaal were centralized, but the results of that centralization were never put into effect when services had to be paid for once again, when the free hospital services were abolished. In 1966&#x2014;you must, bear in mind, Mr. Speaker, that this is 1966; <span class="col_1977-1978" refersTo="page_1006"/>this is no longer 1946; this is 20 years later, of which the Nationalist Party has been in powers for 17 years&#x2014;in 1966 high officials said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What should be emphasized is that the present system is a hybrid between a centralized system and a decentralized one, with the result that the proposed control is falling between two stools.</block>

<p>The measures taken with a view to centralization were taken in 1946; in 1966 the control, the primary requirement of good government of the finance of an administration, is still falling between two stools. Surely that proves that one is dealing with poor management. One cannot blame the officials. The administration has a great responsibility to see to it that the officials can do their work properly and thoroughly, and if they allow a situation like this to continue for 20 years, or most certainly for 17/18 years after free hospital services were abolished, surely one is entitled to ask whether the flaw is not at the top, and if one finds that the same things which are happening in the hospital services are happening in the roads services and in the education department, particularly in the case of school hostels, one must assume that there is something wrong with the management. One must assume that it is bad management, that it is a regime which is prejudicing the Transvaal. Mr. Speaker, for the next three or four years we cannot have a new provincial government in the Transvaal because there will not be an election, but what we can in fact demand from the Nationalist Party, in this House as well, is that this matter be set right in the Transvaal and that the Government accept the proposal of the hon. member for Orange Grove and appoint a commission in order that some light may be thrown on these matters and in order that the people who are responsible for this state of affairs, the leaders of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal, may be called to order. Mr. Speaker, I support this motion emphatically and in the interests of the people of the Transvaal.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that the hon. members for Orange Grove and Yeoville put up such a performance this afternoon with regard to this matter. I want to deal at once with the last few points raised by the hon. member for Yeoville. Firstly, he insinuated that as far as hospital planning in the Transvaal is concerned, there is something amiss under the National Party regime and that as far as free hospitalization is concerned, it is something terrible that we abolished it. I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville a very simple question on which I want an unequivocal reply from him this afternoon. Is it true that until very recently the Executive Committee of the Transvaal was constituted of members of both of the political parties represented on the Provincial Council? Is that true, yes or no? If the hon. Member for Yeoville will not reply, then the hon. member for Orange Grove may answer me. Is it true that at that time, when the Executive Committee was constituted of members of both political parties, we had a certain Dr. Eben Woolf there, who was charged with hospitalization in the province of Transvaal? Is that true?</p>

<p>The United Party is indulging once again in the type of underhand politicizing we have had from them all these years. They raise a tremendous duststorm here to bring the people outside and this House in particular under the impression that there is something sinister afoot in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal. The man who abolished free hospitalization in the Transvaal was no less a person than the United Party Executive Committee member, Dr. Eben Woolf, and he did so because he arrived at the sincere conviction that the way the United Party wanted to implement free hospitalization in the Transvaal was abominable. I served on the Transvaal Provincial Council from 1949. I attended those council sessions and I knew what was going on. The hon. member for Yeoville and t-he hon. member for Orange Grove, who have heard something but do not know the rights of it, should not come here this afternoon and try to be clever as far as the internal activities of the Province are concerned. If they want to cast any blame on us to the effect that we abolished free hospitalization, they should lay the blame at the door of the man whom they appointed there and who was a member of their party. But I want to say that he did so with the whole-hearted co-operation and support of the National Party. He was convinced that it was the right thing to do in the Transvaal. I have challenged the United Party repeatedly, from one Transvaal platform after another, and in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal, to show me one patient in the middle-income group who could not get treatment in a hospital in the Transvaal since we abolished free hospitalization. I challenge him now, and I am prepared to move that the time limit of this debate be extended in order to afford the hon. member an opportunity to reply to that. Free hospitalization was abolished, but there is bed accommodation for the inhabitants of the Transvaal, for every one who needs it.</p>

<p>Now as far as planning is concerned, I am not prepared to discuss the same old story that we have been chewing the cud on for the past three or four years. I cannot understand what is wrong with the United Party. Instead of looking for new fields, they come here once again and discuss all those old matters which have been discussed time and again. Sir, I would appreciate it if the hon. member for Orange Grove, who introduced this motion, <span class="col_1979-1980" refersTo="page_1007"/>could show somewhat more courtesy in this House and not be so rude as to talk while someone is dealing with him. If he cannot understand that, he should not be here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville will have a great deal more to do with this little bantam-cock in future.</p>

<p>As far as hospital planning is concerned, and particularly that in respect of the J. G. Strijdom Hospital, the old Auckland Park Hospital, we make no apology for that. There is a whole set of Blue Books behind the hon. member for Yeoville, and in them you will find the answer to all the allegations made here to-day by him and by the hon. member for Orange Grove. I myself have set out the circumstances repeatedly. I said before in this House that the mind of the United Party was in a corset, and that it is simply impossible to budge it from a certain line of thought once it has been taken hold of by that corset. That also applies to this matter. I do not know why the time of this House should be wasted to-day by talking about what happened at the J. G. Strijdom Hospital. There was a concurrence of circumstances, and I want to say that the people of the Transvaal would have resented it very much if we had proceeded with the original plans and had established that 338-bed hospital, at the present stage of development. Let me say that that 338-bed hospital was planned as long ago as the early 1950&#x2019;s, when Dr. Woolf was charged with it, and at the time he approved it. But in order to build a hospital one cannot simply press a button and appoint an architect and quantity surveyors and say that one wants to start with the hospital to-morrow. Hospital planning is something that takes a long time. One begins the planning long before one reaches the stage where tenders can be called for. Now you can appreciate what happened in the meantime. During those years there were times when we had shortages of capital. Many of the services planned in the 1950&#x2019;s had to be put on ice, and as the capital became available, those things were taken off the ice and put out to tender and their building was commenced with. It frequently happens, and not only up in the Transvaal but also with the Central Government, that when one takes something off the ice one finds that that plan has become obsolete and that one has to replan. Hospitalization in particular is one of the most scientific things, and circumstances change from day to day. Some years ago I attended an international congress on hospital planning in Stockholm, and the people then told us that we should simply forget about thinking that a hospital can be planned without adaptation, and that when one reaches the stage where building is commenced with, one should not think that those plans are still scientifically correct. In view of the scientific developments in the field of hospitalization and medicine, adjustments have to be made from time to time in the hospital planning. For that reason the Director of Hospital Services said in the letter quoted here that that hospital was obsolete and had to be changed. This was caused by new developments, not by the whims of the National Party, and that is the reason why we did that. I think it would have been silly and political folly if we had not done that. The United Party would have carried out an obsolete plan there. But we felt that in the provision we were making we could enlarge that hospital at a low cost to a 750-bed hospital, and that is what is taking place now. It would be stupid of us, particularly with a view to the development of the new university there, if we did not provide for a training hospital at the J. G. Strijdom hospital, pending the decision of the Government. Let us not be short-sighted, as the United Party was in planning the General Hospital. Let us look over the rise and into the future and let us lay the right foundation now, in order that we may be ready if we are called upon to do that kind of thing.</p>

<p>As for the Johannesburg Hospital, I want to say that not a penny was wasted on that site and on the big skeleton standing there, to which the hon. member for Yeoville also referred.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. I am quite prepared to grant that, and in view of the fact that we erected that structure in 1961, surely it is much cheaper than it would have been to build it now. It is not to be demolished. I think the National Party should be praised for erecting that structure in 1961. It is now being filled in and we are now deriving the benefit from the cheaper erection of the structure in 1961. But that is how I know the hon. member for Yeoville. The moment one touches him to the quick, he reacts like an hysterical cat and then he gives that cynical little laugh of his. These are the facts off the matter, and now I want to say this: With regard to the Johannesburg Hospital which is to be erected, I would be the first to admit that it is wrong to erect that structure on that site, but this is due to a concurrence of circumstances beyond any control. The Ronald McKenzie block, as it is standing there, is a fairly good structure and it would be a waste of money to demolish it. But it is not something which simply happened overnight. It took place after consultation between the Provincial Administration and the Johannesburg Medical School. It was done after very thorough consideration. Dr. Woolf took part in it while he was still a member of the executive committee. A portion of those negotiations rested on his shoulders. Here I have a lengthy account of the report which appeared at the time. It was sent to him and it was then decided, after the university had <span class="col_1981-1982" refersTo="page_1008"/>said that it was simply not feasible to erect the hospital&#x2019; on any other site, that they could not afford to spend a further R4 million&#x2014;that was the cost at the time&#x2014;on a new medical school. We decided that the medical school should stay where it was. If the medical school were to be moved to-day, it would cost perhaps R15 million. It was therefore decided, after consultation between the university and the Province, that this enlarged medical teaching hospital would be built in Johannesburg. We are not responsible for the fact that it was subsequently stated that the medical school had to be expanded. That was due to a concurrence of circumstances. When those circumstances became known, it was decided to increase the number of hospital beds. These delays were the result of that. All these things are recorded in the Provincial Council&#x2019;s Hansard. I simply cannot understand why those hon. members should waste the time of the House by raising these matters here.</p>

<p>Yes, that seems to be the case. The hon. member for Brakpan dealt with that and therefore I do not want to come back to that. But now I want to know why there is an auditor and why a sessional committee is appointed to keep an eye on the finance of a province? The reason is of course to point out this kind of thing, things to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred. Let me say that we are grateful that such things are exposed. We are grateful that such things can be considered. But surely it is outrageous of the hon. member to point a finger and allege that the executive committee turned a deaf ear to those findings, that they did nothing about them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>But there are reasons for that. Will the hon. member permit me to give him those reasons? If he will permit me, I will give chapter and verse to demonstrate for what sound reasons those outstanding debts of patients were not collected. Some cases were covered by industrial legislation, and the Industrial Conciliation Act had to be amended. In other cases it was motor vehicle insurance money which could not be collected. There were cases of free patients who were in arrears with their fees and from whom those fees could not be collected. Now I want to ask the hon. member whether he wants us to sue those people and take them to court. There were medical aid scheme cases whom we admitted to our hospitals and who could not pay. There were patients who were initially admitted as fully-paid patients, but who incurred such high accounts as a result of their long stay in hospital that they simply could not pay. From purely humane considerations we did not try to collect those debts forcibly. We did in fact try to get the money, but in due course the amounts were written off. But when such amounts are written off, it is said that the money of the province is wasted. I should like the hon. member for Orange Grove to give one example of an account written off without a well-founded and well-considered reason. That should be his charge against the Provincial Council of the Transvaal to-day. Surely reasons were given in public, in the council, in order that the public might know what was going on, why this money had been written off.</p>

<p>Of course, there were quite a few dodgers, people who evaded payment. Initially one tries to prosecute them, but if they cannot be prosecuted, well, there is no point in forcing up the cost until it becomes more than the principal debt. There are also insolvent estates. It is a lengthy account and I have it here, and I am prepared to give it to the hon. member for Yeoville for his inspection as soon as I have finished my speech. I hope he will then gain peace of mind and realize that the provincial council is not really as bad as he thinks it is.</p>

<p>The hon. member made such a fuss about inventory losses. In 1964-&#x2019;65 the working costs of the Transvaal hospital services amounted to R12,023.200. The hon. member knows that. The inventory losses which are giving the hon. <b>member the heebie-jeebies</b> to-day amounted to only R85,300. So that is the loss which gave rise to all his fussing. Sir, it is only .7 per cent of the working costs of hospital services in the Transvaal. A business undertaking with such a tremendous turnover would thank its stars if it incurred only .7 per cent losses.</p>

<p>What happened in the Transvaal? In the 1964-&#x2019;65 financial year the number of patients increased from 500,000 to 600,000. In the same period the number of hospital beds increased from 16,787 to <b>16,939. Our patient-days</b> increased from 5,340,000 to 5,450,000. Outpatients and casualty treatments increased from 3,600,000 to 4,400,000. The hon. member for Orange Grove knows nothing about these things. [Interjections.] If the hon. member had read that and then made the allegations which he did in fact make here, then I say the hon. <b>member was politicizing here, Mr. Speaker,</b> in order to throw dust in the public&#x2019;s eyes. But that is what hon. members on the opposite side are always doing. That is how we have always known the hon. member for Orange Grove. We. too, employed him to try to do this kind of thing when he was still in the National Party. When he did not do it well, we told him, &#x201C;Off you go.&#x201D; In due course the United Party will also do that with him. I really think the hon. member for Yeoville is most unfortunate as far as the hon. member is concerned. Mr. Speaker, I mention these things to give an indication of what is happening in the Transvaal. <b>I could have elaborated even</b> further if I had the time.</p>

<p>Let us consider the question of the linen banks. Let us admit it is wrong. I would be <span class="col_1983-1984" refersTo="page_1009"/>the first to admit that everything was not in order as far as the linen-bank control was concerned. But can it be said by any hon. member to-day, now that these things have become public and particularly in view of the fact that we handle millions and millions of linen articles of all kinds&#x2014;from nappies to sheets&#x2014;that there is something seriously wrong? But if matters are not right and one ignores them or fails to set them right, then hon. members may complain that there is something wrong. But those things were set right. Sir. I want to tell the hon. members for Orange Grove and Yeoville to go and talk to Mr. Harry Schwarz and to ask him, seeing that he serves on the sessional committee, whether he is not happy now with the new arrangement made with regard to the establishment of a linen bank. They may ask Major Opperman the same question. In my day I was responsible for it, Sir, and permit me to say that I think the new system is working very well indeed.</p>

<p>I want to come to another aspect with regard to which such a tremendous fuss was made here, and that is the so-called free dams which were built in the Transvaal by the roads department. Hon. members alleged that large-scale thefts were being committed, that the taxpayer&#x2019;s money was being stolen. If hon. members knew the topography and the soil composition in the areas where those dams were built, they would realize that in those areas there is a very dry and loose surface layer which has to be removed to reach the actual gravel layer. Is there anything wrong if the farmer who supplies the gravel free of charge for the construction of roads is told that the surface layer has to be removed in any event and that the work will be carried out in such a way&#x2014;without any extra cost&#x2014;that the surface layer of the soil will be bulldozed to farm a natural dam? Because, Sir, this will also benefit the farmer who provides these things free of charge on his land, in that it will be possible to conserve the water on his land. For heaven&#x2019;s sake, what is sinister or wrong about that? [Interjection.] I believe that matter has been referred to the Attorney-General. There is only one small exception. That is the one exception of an offence which was committed, and now the hon. member is making a tremendous fuss about that and is inflating that into a major issue. I want to say that as far as this matter is concerned they are doing the farming community in that region a great favour.</p>

<p>What has the Province done? In view of the tremendous growth-rate of the Transvaal we have to accept, and the hon. member for Yeoville granted that, that there may be flaws in the administration, but the province did not turn a deaf ear as far as these matters were concerned. A proper organization and a work-study section have now been established in the Transvaal with officials in all departments of the administration to help to make proper work studies from time to time and to get matters into operation. I am convinced, as far as the sessional committee is concerned, that after they have brought these matters to the notice of the province they will also be satisfied that these things will be done properly in future. I want to say that high tribute is also paid to the good administration. Anyone who visits the Provincial Council year after year and who listens to the budget debates conducted there will hear the panegyrics for things done in the Province. I just want to give a final example. I wondered why the hon. member did not get around to that. From my own constituency, Benoni, great praise was recently received from no less a person than that illustrious provincial councillor, Mr. Morrie Nestadt of Benoni. Here I have it in his own handwriting. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have read your report on local government for the year ending 31st December, 1965. I found this most interesting and informative. Your report certainly indicates that you have done a great job of work and I would like to congratulate you on the most efficient and able manner in which local government affairs have been handled. Of course it is what one expects from you. Wishing you continued success, etc.</block>

<p>This is only one example of this kind of thing. Here are other letters written to the hospitals department in which international figures have much to say in praise of what is done in the hospitals. But then one finds people who always go about like chameleons and lurk unseen with a long tongue for catching political flies. That is the kind of person we have. I support the amendment introduced by the hon. member for Brakpan and I hope this kind of thing will not take place here again. The provincial administrations are very jealous of their sovereignty. The political parties were put there by the electorate, who sent you and me here&#x2014;because they are exactly the same voters&#x2014;to do their work. Do not try to take the wind out of the sails of your own people who serve on that council. You are merely harming them. They can do their job very well. I think Harry Schwarz as leader of the Opposition in the provincial council, is doing a much better job of work than this Opposition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want first of all to congratulate my two old friends from the provincial council, namely the hon. member for Brakpan and the hon. member for Benoni, for their really first-class display this afternoon of righteous indignation. You know, Mr. Speaker, when you have no case the best way of reply is by means of a display of righteous indignation. I must say that they fulfilled their tasks very admirably this afternoon. The hon. member for Brakpan told us of the developments that have taken place in the Transvaal over the past 17 years. He said these were monuments to Nationalist Government rule. It is true that there has been a great deal of development in the Transvaal over the past 17 years but surely over a <span class="col_1985-1986" refersTo="page_1010"/>period of 17 years you expect even the Nationalist Government to be able to achieve something. It would have been ridiculous if after 17 years there had been no development.</p>

<p>Let us look at a few of the items the hon. member mentioned. He used the provincial building as an example. The provincial building is a very beautiful building but the hon. member for Brakpan knows as well as I do that for a year that beautiful building was just a hole in the ground, not even three storeys high as is the case with the hospital in Johannesburg. It lay there for over 12 months with no development whatever. The original cost of the building of £2 million finally amounted to £6 million. The hon. member told us about the development in schools. Of course there has been development in the schools, but did he tell us about the over-development of schools in certain parts of the platteland where they cannot fill these schools and where they have had to advertise for pupils to attend them? Did he tell us about prefabricated schools in the urban areas which remained as prefabricated schools for 8 to 10 years? When I went to see the Administrator about this, he said: &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t hope to get a proper school for 14 years&#x201D;. Fortunately we managed to persuade him to do something earlier. Does he know of schools where the prefabricated classrooms were removed and two years later brought back again? Did the hon. member tell us about the schools that were built for 750 pupils and which to-day are housing 1,000, 1,200 and as many as 1,400 pupils? This is what is happening. Did the hon. member tell us what went on in regard to minor repairs where, when you had a matter reported which might cost £5 or £10 to repair, such as a gutter at a school, it was left for up to four years? I calculated, as the hon. member knows, that in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal there was wasted expenditure in one year of £100,000, at that time, in this regard alone, because if you do not repair a gutter to-day, in three years time you must put on a new roof. These are some of the things which happened in the course of this development. He said that we had free hospitalization and there were no beds. That may be true, but what did we get from the provincial councils since the Nationalists came to power? Now we have beds put no nurses. How many wards were closed up in provincial hospitals because there was nobody to look after those wards? The hon. member must therefore not talk to us about having no beds because to-day there are certainly no nurses.</p>

<p>To say that this motion is a vote of no confidence in the United Party members of the Provincial Council of the Transvaal, is utter rubbish. The reason why this motion was submitted is that despite the fact that United Party members have brought these matters to the attention of Nationalist Party majority time after time, they get nothing done. Therefore we as the senior body in this country have had to bring it to the notice of this House.</p>

<p>Do not let it be misunderstood. This does not mean interfering with the rights of the provinces. There is nobody more jealous of the rights of the provinces than the United Party but the position has gone too far in the Transvaal as I shall explain in a moment.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. member for Benoni who seems to have disappeared. The hon. member mentioned Dr. T. B. Woolf as having been the Exco member of the provincial council responsible for hospitalization at the time we changed from free hospitalization to paid hospitalization. I think that it would only have been fair if the hon. member had also told this House that every single member of the United Party in the provincial&#x2019; council voted against the motion to change from free to paid hospitalization. We debated morning, noon and night to try to prevent free hospitalization being terminated. The hon. member made a fairly good point in regard to hospital buildings. He said that when you plan and put the plans into cold storage because there is no money available to build, you must expect changes. We agree but with this difference. When you have plans and you put them into cold storage, you must not take them out and then start building and when you are half way with the building operations, then start changing the plans. What normal people do is to take the plans out of cold storage, re-examine them to see if there are any changes to be made and then start building. But that is not what the Nationalists in the Transvaal do. They take the plans out of cold storage, start building and then stop building and continue this process, just like their pull-push method dealing with inflation. The hon. member said that we got the benefits of the building in I think 1963. Yes, we did. We got the difference in cost of what it would have cost then and what it cost to-day, but let the hon. member deduct from that the additional costs incurred as a result of putting up this building and now having to design them again, and they will not show a profit. Then the hon. member for Benoni told us that we really should not have raised this matter in this House because after all there is a Provincial Auditor and there is a sessional committee. We know that. I had the privilege of serving for six years on that sessional committee. I do not know who the Provincial Auditor is to-day, but in my day the reports of the Provincial Auditor were exemplary. And the work of the Sessional Committee was excellent. And as the hon. member for Benoni has said&#x2014;and I hope this tradition will never be changed&#x2014;in the Sessional Committee there is no politics. The Sessional Committee represents the entire House and it is there to do a job for the House. The Sessional Committee in my time did a good job and I am sure it is doing a first class job at present. But, where do you go when you find that the auditor is reporting year after year about things that are going wrong. Where do you go when you find that the Sessional Committee is saying that this or that has to be put right or done, <span class="col_1987-1988" refersTo="page_1011"/>recommending one thing after the other without anything happening. Where do you go? And I am going to prove to the hon. member for Benoni just now that assurance after assurance was given by the Executive Committee of the Provincial Council to the Sessional Committee and to the House, and that a year or two years thereafter the Sessional Committee and the Provincial Auditor had to come back and say that you told us this and that you gave us this assurance, but that nothing has happened and that the position is worse. And the hon. member knows this. The hon. member for Benoni knows this. The Sessional Committee reports are full of such cases. I will point to a few things just now. The hon. member for Benoni also said, if I understood him correctly, that there was a reason for every debt that was written off in hospital accounts. This I think goes without saying. No auditor will ever allow a debt to be written off just &#x201C;somaarso&#x201D;. There has to be a basic reason for writing off a debt. But what were the basic reasons? They could be that they have gone bad, become prescribed, that the bookkeeping was wrong or that the whole position could not be sorted out because of wrong entries. So obviously somebody had to get authority to write-off these amounts. Otherwise they would have cluttered up the provincial books for years. It is no use to come and tell us that every amount that was written off was written off for a reason. I am surprised at my hon. friend for Benoni to come and tell us that story. I always thought he was much cleverer than that. I now come to the question namely the reason for us raising this matter in this House. The hon. member for Orange Grove told us that R140 million on Revenue Account was voted by this House for the provinces each year. In the case of the Transvaal. more or less 47 per cent of their total revenue expenditure is provided by this House. They get these funds from the Central Government. We have no objection to the principle. No objection at all. But. if these funds are not being properly administered. then surely it is not only our right but also our duty to bring these matters to the attention of the House. These things have been going on for a very long time. I left the Sessional Committee in the Transvaal province in 1961. That is six years ago. I served on it for six years. And already it was quite apparent during the period that I served, that over wide fields of provincial expenditure there was a great deal to be desired in the control of the finances of the province. And as I said just now. if you will go through the reports of the Sessional Committee on Public Accounts you will find reference after reference to identical items where things continuously went wrong and where recommendation after recommendation to have them put right were made with very little action being taken. What perturbs us is this. While it was reasonably bad. if one can call a thing reasonably bad. up to 1961, it seemed to have got cumulatively worse until we reached a stage in 1967 where you have the facts as presented to you by the hon. members for Orange Grove and Yeoville. And, if the Executive Committee of the Transvaal is unable as it well may be, or, unwilling. to put these matters right, then surely this issue becomes a matter for us.</p>

<p>When you find lack of control in any organization to-day and over the last 7 to 10 years, you have always had one reason for it, namely shortage of staff. &#x201C;We cannot get the staff.&#x201D; That is correct. Staff has been a very vexed problem and we have talked about it in this House in different contexts many times. But one does not simply sit down and say that one cannot get staff and leave it at that. This is not the way people in private enterprise operate. It is not the way people in many spheres of Government operate. You decide to do something about it. I want to be fair Mr. Speaker. The Province did do something about it. When this continuous complaint that there was no staff was being raised they decided to mechanize their salaries. They purchased a modern machine at the time, which is probably out of date by now with the new computers coming onto the market. They introduced a punch card system of mechanized accounting. And this was to deal with salaries. What has happened? Since the introduction of that mechanized equipment the position has got worse and not better. That is what has happened. [Interjections.] I now want to quote from the Sessional Committee&#x2019;s report of July 1966. Some of it has already been referred to but I want to bring it to the notice of the hon. member for Brakpan particularly because he was very critical. Now, these are not the words of the hon. member for Orange Grove nor is it repeated from the Hansard of any member of the Provincial Council. This is the official Sessional Committee&#x2019;s report. And I am sure the hon. member for Brakpan will accept it as such. This is what the report says under the heading, &#x201C;Lack of Internal Control and Supervision&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In its report for the 1963-&#x2019;64 financial year the Sessional Committee drew attention to the large number of erroneous payments and adjustments in the salaries of teachers.</block>

<p>I presume that the hon. member now agrees that there were &#x201C;erroneous payments and adjustments&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During that year a considerable shortage of staff was experienced in the section. In respect of the present financial year the department reports that special attention is being given to the staff of this section, that the staffing position of this section is a fairly sound one, that salary adjustments are calculated by one officer and checked by another&#x2014;usually one of the most senior officers or the head of the section&#x2014;but not-withstanding <span class="col_1989-1990" refersTo="page_1012"/>this explanation the position is still considered unsatisfactory by the Provincial Auditor. Up to March, 1965, overpayments of R16,596.40 were brought to light and underpayments of R1,168.87.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and overpayments. I am not concerned whether they are under or overpayments. What I am concerned with is that when I was in the province nearly 10 to 12 years ago, a mechanical system was installed and even now this system is not functioning.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<p>That does not matter. Very often with mechanical equipment the old saying, &#x201C;the more the merrier&#x201D;, really helps the mechanical equipment a lot. But the report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 10 per cent of the cases were tested by the Auditor and 14,000 discrepancies were found in respect of salary data of 17,000 teachers.</block>

<p>And this is what the Sessional Committee says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</block>

<p>Now let us accept these things. I know that the hon. members for Brakpan and Benoni have a difficult job, but let us try and put the thing in its right perspective. Fact is fact, and all the righteous indignation cannot change fact. Now, surely this is a case, namely this case here, where a responsible member of the Executive Committee should have done something about it. Now, in the Transvaal&#x2014;I am not sure of the position in the rest of the Republic but I understand in most cases it is now the same&#x2014;there are full time&#x2014;I do not like to use the word employees&#x2014;officers. But they seem to be a law unto themselves.</p>

<p>I am referring to the members of the Executive Council. They are full time officers of the Transvaal. This is their sole job, namely to look after the affairs of the Transvaal. And you would have thought that the member of the Executive Council responsible for this particular portfolio would have done something about it. But the position seems to be that in the Transvaal you have reached the stage where the members of the Executive Committee are a law unto themselves. And they do not take much notice of criticism. And that is borne out by the replies to the Sessional Committee over the last 10 years which is there for anybody to read. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, we have two answers to every question when a job has been badly done in this country. The first one is the one that I have referred to, namely that you cannot get staff. That is the first one, and now it is the drought. Everything that happens in this country is put down to the drought. Thank goodness that not only has the drought been broken for the sake of every inhabitant of this country but thank goodness it is being broken so that it could literally wash out this reason that is advanced for everything that is going wrong. I am only waiting on some hon. member on the other side to tell us that the Vaal Dam is overflowing because of the drought. [Interjections.] That would be the ultimate result. Because we have had it as a reason on every other single thing, except when we lost the cricket match. [Interjections.] I now want to go back and try and contrast and to point out for how long this has been going on. I want to quote a little story from the Auditor&#x2019;s Report way back in 1957. Now, this is a story that I remember very well, namely the one of the 60 Morris trucks. And it is no good my telling it because nobody will believe me, Mr. Speaker, except yourself I am sure. But I will read from the Sessional Committee&#x2019;s report and then there can be no room for argument. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before dropping this subject finally your committee desires to report full details to the Council. These 60 Morris trucks were purchased by the Administration in about 1948 at a cost of approximately £54,000 &#x2026;</block>

<p>Well, they sat on the roadside for seven years, and only at the insistence of the sessional committee did they do anything about it. What did they do? They sold them for £8.000 after an initial payment of £54,000. As it says in the report, &#x201C;No further comment is necessary&#x201D;. For seven years they left those trucks standing in the garage. If they had disposed of them earlier, they would at least have got somewhere.</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraph 17 of its reply to the previous report of your Committee, the Executive Committee stated that the position had improved considerably as a result of certain positive measures taken.</block>

<p>What does the auditor say and what does the sessional committee say?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraphs 162 and 163 of his report the auditor states that the position has deteriorated considerably.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is what has been going on in the province of the Transvaal for year after year. The sessional committee has had assurances that positive measures have been taken and then the auditor says that the position has deteriorated considerably. That is why we are raising these matters to-day.</p>

<p>There is another item, namely Stoves. I refer to page 3 of the report for 1957. This is what the sessional committee says&#x2014;</p>

We do not like to see stores not reconciled for year after year, and reports having to be brought to the sessional Committee that stock has not been taken in department after department for year after year. We do not like such expressions as: &#x201C;The Sessional Committee notes with alarm&#x201D;, &#x201C;It is inconceivable that there is such lack of proper control&#x201D;, &#x201C;Your Committee notes with concern&#x201D;, etc. It all boils down to the fact that, in the light of what has been said here this afternoon, there is little doubt that there is not adequate control in the province. It is quite certain that it is time that these matters were brought to the notice of the public at large. It is time that the taxpayer of the Transvaal, who pays direct taxation. and the taxpayer of the Republic of South Africa, who pays indirect taxation to the Transvaal. became aware of these things. If the Executive Committee of the Transvaal will not put these matters right, then somebody else will have to be found to put them right. Hence our motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Parktown quoted facts about Morris vehicles which were allegedly there when the United Party was in power and <span class="col_1993-1994" refersTo="page_1014"/>that it took the Nationalists seven years to put the matter right. Sir, I am surprised that they were able to put the matter right within seven years, because the chaotic conditions we inherited from the United Party when we took over the province were such that I am surprised that we succeeded in putting matters right within ten years.</p>

<p>I should like to come to the motion as such. As far as I am concerned, the motion introduced by the hon. member for Orange Grove is nothing but an election cry for the municipal elections in Johannesburg. In all seriousness, I regard it as an insult to the Transvaal Provincial Council and to myself, who had the privilege of serving on that Council under the National Party regime for eight years.</p>

<p>The Opposition introduced a motion of no-confidence a little while ago. This motion has the same object, but in disguise. In the case of the first motion they were sent way with a flea in the ear. They now think they will first try to make some political capital. The hon. member asks for a judicial commission to be appointed, which I really think is going very far. If we consider the record of the Transvaal Administration under the Nationalist Party regime I think the National Party and the Transvaal Provincial Council have reason to feel deeply insulted. We cannot but view it in that light. Hon. members have quoted many things and they have tried to create the impression that the Transvaal Provincial Council have made many mistakes. Those accusations were repudiated very effectively by the hon. members for Brakpan and Benoni. They also quoted some facts, but there are a few matters I want to take further. It has been said, <i>inter alia</i>, that dams were built for the farmers. The hon. member for Benoni has already said something about that. A spirit of goodwill existed between the Administration and the farming community. When the United Party was in power roads were made over people&#x2019;s farms. They took gravel wherever they wanted to. To-day those places are terrible dongas causing soil erosion. The National Party Government is much more considerate. They co-operate with the farmers and landowners. They take gravel only after they have come to an agreement with the farmer as to where they may take it. And why cannot the large quarries from which the gravel is taken after the farmer has given his consent, quarries which will not cause any soil erosion, not be used as dams? We went even further. I can quote you an example. When the road had to be built up near Ohrigstad in order to build a bridge across the railway-line, gravel had to be conveyed there for that purpose. It was impossible to obtain that gravel at any other place than at the site of the Ohrigstad school. At the same time we bulldozed sports fields for the school. We got the gravel where we wanted it and at the same time the school, which is also a provincial institution, got its sports fields. If the Opposition wants to complain about that and say that it is illegal, they have, to my mind, really sunk to a level which is below me. I want to go further. Do you know that when the United Party was in power they built roads for &#x201C;pals&#x201D;? I am prepared to prove that to you to-day. There are still roads in my constituency to-day which were built for a friend of the M.P.C., roads leading to his winter grazing for his sheep, during those years when the United Party was in office. There is another road which was built for a certain official who wanted to go hunting. There was no road and the then Provincial Administration sent a cart with a few road-workers to make a road for him. Those are the people who want to attack us to-day. I think the Opposition should be a little more careful in what they say about the administration of the National Party.</p>

<p>Much has been said about free hospital services. The hon. member for Parktown also referred to it. Why have those free hospital services been abolished? They are still blaming us to-day that we prejudiced the poor man by doing that. May I quote you a few examples, Sir? With those free hospital services in the Transvaal it happened that many of the rich gentlemen of Johannesburg visited Europe on business for a month or two. and made arrangements with their doctors for their wives to spend a holiday in hospital at the expense of the State. That is what happened. [Interjections.] The Opposition has the peculiar habit that when they are being given a rap over the knuckles they pretend that it is something of which they take no notice. That is a fact, Mr. Speaker. I go further and I say that the Transvaal would have been bankrupt to-day if we had continued with our free hospital services the way the United Party wanted us to. Then we would not have been in a position to build the hospital for them in Johannesburg, the hospital about which they are complaining so much. The Opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council is only concerned about Johannesburg. An hon. member on that side has already mentioned that. But the Opposition has never cared for ensuring that justice is done to the rural areas. They have never said anything about hospital services for the poor people in the rural areas. They have never said anything about hospital services for our pioneers, those people who have to open up our country. Everything has to be concentrated in Johannesburg. We still find that more money is allocated to the hospital in Johannesburg in the Estimates than to the Dr. H. F. Verwoerd Hospital in Pretoria. Nevertheless they are always full of complaints. It will be interesting to go further and to draw a comparison, although there is really nothing to compare. The Opposition is very much afraid that we shall tell the world about the development and the progress which have been made during the term of office of the National Party. They try to conceal those things as far as possible and then they come forward with frivolous complaints which they allege are based on the report of the auditor and the session committee, I also have a report here dealing with roads, and it refers specifically <span class="col_1995-1996" refersTo="page_1015"/>to the case of the Heidelberg unit. The report reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Except for the criticism in the case of one departmental construction unit, in respect of which the case still has to be heard by a criminal court and the charges still have to be proved, there has been no criticism worth mentioning.</block>

<p>Nevertheless the Opposition make a big fuss here about this particular case. It is. however, my privilege to defend the Transvaal Provincial Council. I have here two Estimates. The one is in respect of the year 1948-&#x2019;49 and the other is for 1966. We shall now see what amounts were spent on the various services in the Transvaal. In 1966 a total amount of R171 million was spent, which represented a net increase of R21 million over the amount for the previous year. The net amount spent in the last year of United Party rule&#x2014;the last year they were in the synagogue&#x2014;amounted to only R39,073,000.</p>

<p>That was long before that time. I am going to draw another comparison. The hospital services the Opposition is so concerned about also show a very interesting picture. In these Estimates the National Party Government of the Transvaal voted an amount of R41,400,000 in respect of hospital and health services. The total Estimates for the financial year 1948-&#x2019;49 did not even amount to R40 million. How then is it possible that hon. members can make a fuss here about the National Party&#x2019;s administration in the Transvaal?</p>

<from>*Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. P. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. That does not matter. The same picture can be presented in respect of road and other services.</p>

<p>If the hon. members really think that they can impress the voters by stirring up suspicion against the National Party, they should come to light with something else and not make the kind of accusation that has been made here. I really think I shall be able to speak for probably another 40 minutes if we want to cover the entire field, for example education in all its ramifications, hospital services, roads, public works and so forth, and everything that has been done about these things by the Transvaal Provincial Administration under National Party rule. Then the facts would be brought to light. Unfortunately time does not permit me to do so.</p>

<p>I should like, however, to refer to hospital services under National Party rule. In the old days when the United Party was in office English was the only medium used for the training of nurses. Now we have a fine training college for nurses, and the National Party, the party which is being criticized so much by the Opposition, has given equal rights to both language groups. The Opposition is so much inclined to evade this&#x2014;they do not want to talk about it. Do they realize, however, what they have done by always trampling upon the Afrikaans language? Now they are the people who want to accuse us! We are showing them how a right-minded nation and party should act. Mr. Speaker, we say both language groups should have equal rights. I therefore want to appeal to the Opposition to take note of these things in future.</p>

<p>What is the position as regards nurses&#x2019; salaries? The following leading report appeared in the <i>Star</i> of 19th November, 1964: &#x201C;Nurses get big pay increases.&#x201D; That happened under National Party rule. The salary scales which applied previously were laid down by the United Party. But the National Party introduced new scales. We have the position to-day that the nursing profession in the Transvaal are very satisfied with their conditions of service. They are rendering good service. As science progresses in the field of medicine we have to train our nurses to assist the doctors carrying out those delicate operations. We are now in a position to train specialized nurses at our new training college in Pretoria. They can also follow a degree course. That will&#x2019; enable us to render better specialized service to humanity.</p>

<p>Can hon. members opposite really come here and introduce such a motion with a clear conscience? I believe the hon. member for Orange Grove should withdraw this motion. I can say many more things.</p>

They should consider the damage they did to our country, both economically and politically. When they have done that and when they have ascertained for themselves whether they really served South Africa, they will not introduce a motion such as this.</p>

<heading>NATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>After last week&#x2019;s bloodless three-day battle, one may now take stock of what is left on the battlefield, and one comes to the conclusion that a cartridge and perhaps also a cannon-shell may be picked up here and there, but that there are also many remnants of ordinary crackers. Now that the dust has settled and we can take stock, one comes to the conclusion that for three days a debate was conducted here which was in actual fact not justified. The only justification for a three-day debate and all the time of the House occupied by it is its many trivialities and some axioms which have long been accepted in the educational field but which were fought tooth and nail. In the first place I must say that I want to pay high tribute to my supporters on this side of the House and to thank them very sincerely, because they have made my task of replying to this debate much lighter. It is beyond doubt that when arguments were advanced here and there by hon. members on the opposite side, they were wiped off the face of the earth by such hard blows that it was pathetic to see what remained of the Opposition&#x2019;s struggle to keep this debate going. I want to thank them in particular for continuing to be positive in their arguments. They kept the debate directed towards the child and centred on the child, and that is everything in education. What is at issue here is not a group of grown-ups who want to quarrel about the interests of the child, and I hope to advance the necessary proof in the course of my speech that with very minor exceptions here and there the interests of the child, and concomitantly the interests of the country, were in no way served by the Opposition. The speakers on the Government side who took part in this debate provided the necessary arguments, founded on merits, to dispose of the negative arguments of the Opposition, and if this Hansard is one day read by educationists the poor Opposition will derive meagre credit from it.</p>

<p>The Opposition employed two means. The first was to sow suspicion and the second was an attempt to arouse suspicion in the Republic of South Africa. Those were the main features of the Opposition&#x2019;s contribution to this debate. Their attempt at suspicion-mongering amounted to perhaps the cheapest politicizing ever on a matter which affects the interests and the future of the nation. I do not want to go into that now, but I just want to give a few examples of that. The hon. member for Orange Grove even went so far in his suspicion-mongering as to warn the nation that education would be given a Potchefstroom character by a Minister who derives from Potchefstroom. The hon. member went so far in his suspicion-mongering as to try to create the impression that an attempt is being made here to draw a dividing line between the various groups in the community. He and other hon. members on that side tried to drive a wedge between the Protestant and the Catholic sections of the population. He asked all kinds of nonsensical questions, for example: What is to become of the girls in English-language convents? The hon. member and others tried to drive a wedge between the Afrikaans and the English-speaking people. The hon. member who excelled at trying to drive in this wedge was the hon. member for South Coast, of course. This time the hon. member for South Coast did not merely march, but beat the drums in an attempt to revive an old spirit in order to regain the lost territory of Natal. Mr. Speaker, it was indeed spectacular. Hon. members of the Opposition even went as far as seeing whether a wedge could not also be driven between the Calvinists and the Anglicans, and between the D.R. Church and the Doppers. What a pathetic show; what scandalous behaviour, to use such arguments! At this stage I am not going to reply to points which were raised by hon. members of the Opposition and which relate to the particulars of the Bill. Most of the arguments advanced on the opposite side related to particulars which belong in the Committee Stage. The possible disputes with regard to the particulars can be dealt with at the Committee Stage, but there is one point on which there is obviously some misunderstanding, and that is the question of the application of this Bill to private, to State-aided and to State schools. This relates in particular to the question of providing free books and stationery. I want to make it clear that this Bill does not affect private schools. Private schools which enjoy no State aid, which are completely independent, are not affected in any way whatsoever. Private schools, whether under the provincial administration or under my Department, are not at all affected by this Bill. With regard to State schools clause 2 (1) (a)&#x2014;i.e. the Christian character&#x2014;is of application, and clause 2 (1) (b), i.e. free education, free books and stationery, applies to State-aided schools. The question was asked, even by hon. members on this side, why schools which are paying certain fees, &#x201C;fee-paying schools,&#x201D; should be abolished? This Bill does not abolish them. In terms of this Bill they retain the right to charge school fees for the purposes of sport, for the provision of extra library books over and above those prescribed, for film projectors, for films, for wall charts, for models and other audio-visual apparatus and aids, etc. Education fees and fees for stationery and prescribed books may not be charged, but in other respects they have a free hand. They are quite at liberty to charge fees for any additional purpose if the parents are willing to pay those fees.</p>

<p>Yes, they may compel them to pay. There is nothing that prevents that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to go into the details any further; the details may be dealt with at the Committee Stage. I should now like to deal <i>seriatim</i> with the main objections raised by hon. members of the Opposition to this Bill. The first strong objection was the way in which this Bill originated, the way in which it was submitted to the House and the form in which it is before the House at present. The first accusation was that there was some secrecy, that we did not take the public into our confidence and that there was something sinister lurking behind this Bill. Now, I had only one instruction in this task I had to carry out; I have an instruction in terms of Act 86 of 1962, and the instruction is formulated in section 7. I just want to read the relevant portions of section 7 (1). Section 7 (1) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council (i.e. the Education council), is established to advise the Minister generally in regard to the policy to be applied in connection with education &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not to draw up Bills for me, but to advise me. The second part provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall endeavour to determine in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science, the provincial education departments, education bodies and organizations and persons who are concerned with education matters, the broad fundamental principles of sound education for the country as a whole &#x2026;</block>

<p>The third part reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall also endeavour to uphold and promote the prestige of the teaching profession and of persons engaged therein.</block>

<p>I acted in accordance with the instructions of an Act by calling for advice and receiving advice. In the course of my speech I shall explain the hitches and problems that arose, and why it was not possible to lay this Bill upon the Table of the House any sooner. But on 31st August, 1966, the hon. member for Kensington defended the actions of the council. Let me read to the House what he said after he had read the annual report of the council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, the report goes on to say this&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">Since in terms of its Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;they may not say too much because they are an advisory council only&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the council has advisory functions only, information on its activities is not usually released by the council itself.</block>

<p>The council itself may not release any information. The Minister receives the advice. It may not speak. The hon. member for Kensington said (Hansard, vol. 17, col. 1827)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They may not say too much&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; The draft Bill indicates only the broad lines of a national education policy and the principles on which it is based, and that it embodies a plan for ending divided control in education and for the re-allocation of education up to and including Std. X to the various education authorities.</block>

<p>That was the hon. member for Kensington. He then said:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Chairman, this is something that we have been striving for for the last 40 years.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington says: &#x201C;We have been striving for it for 40 years, and now you are introducing it.&#x201D; I, as Minister of Education, who have been occupying the post for five years, introduce it after five years. None of the many commissions made any progress, because the matter ended with commissions. How can the hon. member for Kensington adopt that attitude now&#x2014;that patronizing attitude in respect of precisely what should have happened and how he had wanted it? If I let hon. members in on the problems of getting as far as this, they would perhaps understand the matter. Then they would perhaps understand that this matter could not be dealt with helter-skelter. In my Second Reading Speech I mentioned that it was the primary function of the education advisory council to pay visits to the four Administrators and executive committees. On those visits they found at once that the most urgent problems that called for attention were divided control and the lack of an education policy. Quite soon it was also determined that to negotiate with those cumbersome bodies from province to province would not get them much further. It was then agreed by all four of the executive committees of the Republic that they would form their educational heads into a contact body. That contact body of those five members, together with the five members of the executive committee of the Education Advisory Council, with South-West Africa&#x2019;s Director of Education as an observer, would receive their terms of reference from their principals and would report to them. The principals, in the case of the provinces, were the Administrator-in-execu&#x2019;ive-committee, and myself in the case of the Central Government. These people got together and even at their first meeting on 23rd March, 1964, this contact body&#x2014;I think it is one of the greatest achievements ever gained in South Africa&#x2014;came to unanimous agreement on the following important matters. I am going to mention them <i>seriatim.</i> The first is that all education up to and including Std. X should be entrusted to the provinces on condition that the Central Government receive certain guarantees in respect <span class="col_2001-2002" refersTo="page_1018"/>of the continued development of all education, but particularly in respect of technical education, which should be embodied in an act of Parliament.</p>

<p>In other words, as long ago as 23rd March, 1964, almost three years ago, they agreed on this point. This contact body reported to their principals&#x2014;I am now giving the second point&#x2014;that a national education pattern should be developed. As proof of these points extracted from the minutes, those minutes are at the disposal of the truly interested, studious and intelligent person who does not want to politicize about this matter. Even then they agreed that a national education pattern should be developed. Thirdly, they agreed that the provinces would have an equal say in the development of the national pattern. In the fourth place they agreed that the Central Government would be drawn into the determination of policy through the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. Fifthly, they agreed that the provinces should be prepared to relinquish some of their presently limited autonomy in the development of a national policy in the interests of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for South Coast got into his stride and became more and more angry with himself, he told us: That Minister over there, he forced them into it. I am telling the hon. member now: Three years ago, give and take a few days, his Natal Director of Education or his representative accepted that. Not once was a vote taken in that contact body.</p>

<p>This hon. member has a great deal of medicine coming to him. He will still get some castor-oil. These are only sugared pills. [Interjections.] Hon. members must listen to me. I am now going to state my case. Here are some points in respect of which agreement was reached by a contact body established with the approval of the executive committees and the Minister. Those people had to report to their principals. They met on various occasions through the years. I am just giving the first points in respect of which they reached agreement, even three years ago. For the sake of interest I may just say that a well-known provincial educationist&#x2014;not from Natal&#x2014;expressed the following opinion on the occasion of that meeting, when agreement was reached on those points. I just want to mention this to show how far the extra-political people have advanced towards great unity in the Republic of South Africa, and how sadly that shows up some of the party-politicians with their provincialism, which they display in season and out of season. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want us to avoid the notion that the provinces are foreign institutions. They are part and parcel of our public administration as a whole. The provincial system is an inseparable part of the State. If the State entrusts a task to a province, it is as though it entrusts it to a Government Department. If the State entrusts a task, it has the power to see to it that it is carried out.</block>

<p>These hon. members, or rather a small group of them, have such an obsession with the idea that if we touch the tradition of the past we are breaking it down, and that we want to destroy it.</p>

<p>I mentioned the meeting of 23rd March, 1964. At a subsequent meeting, on 25th November, 1964, this contact body achieved further clarity and provided that (a) education should have a Christian character with guarantees of non-prejudicing of dissentients, and (b) that it should have a national character in the sense that pupils should be prepared for being able to assume their rightful place in the community, not in the world but more specifically in our own country. After protracted negotiations and deliberations this contact body eventually reached the stage, at its meeting on 25th june, 1965&#x2014;I cannot deal with the entire history, of course&#x2014;where it could recommend the principles on which the National Education Policy Bill could be based. They recommended it. Those education men recommended it without interference for one moment by anyone from the outside. They said that these principles could now be accepted. One of the principles provided that the mother tongue, English or Afrikaans, should be the medium of instruction. To comply with a request from Natal at that time, that formulation was substituted by the following: That the mother tongue, English or Afrikaans, shall be the medium of instruction <span class="col_2003-2004" refersTo="page_1019"/>with gradual equitable adjustment to the existing practice. That was Natal&#x2019;s request. Natal did not say that they condemned everything. They said that they admitted that the principle of mother-tongue education was correct, but that it should be borne in mind that they had a long history behind them. There is parental choice, and we cannot simply sweep that away at once and say that it must now be mother-tongue education. There are many arguments against that. Additional school facilities will be needed, and an additional system is coming. For that reason we included it in this legislation with gradual equitable adjustment to any existing practice. That applies only to Natal. I am not talking about mother-tongue education now, because I am coming to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is now calling me a public liar. In that case I have no other defence than to submit to the House the minutes in which the decision was recorded. The hon. member may see these minutes, but he will not have the decency then to apologize to me for the fact that he called me a liar. The very last moment he is trying to get political advantage from this for his sinking party. The principles I have mentioned were adopted by the full council on 19th August, 1965, and recommendations were then submitted to me. [Interjection.] The hon. member will hear something else. For the sake of the record I want to say that it was said here so many times that the members of this council were not the right people or that they did not have the qualifications to judge in this regard. The previous member for Hillbrow, Dr. Steenkamp, asked me a question with a lengthy reply. I cannot give the reply in this short debate, of course, but I am going to give the names of those people for the sake, perhaps, of some of the younger members who have not had an opportunity to become acquainted with them. The chairman of this council is Dr. C. H. Rautenbach, principal of the University of Pretoria. The body is constituted as follows: Two deputy chairmen, Professor H. J. Bingle. who used to be a professor of education and has since became principal of the Potchefstroom University. Professor Jordaan is the second deputy chairman. He was the principal of the Teachers&#x2019; College in Pretoria. Miss E. C. Steyn, member of the executive committee, is the principal of the Afrikaans Girls&#x2019; High School. Mr. S. G. Osler was the principal of a private school in Natal and is the other member of the executive committee; Mr. D. F. Abernethy, who is the principal of the Boys&#x2019; High School in Pretoria; Mr. L. C. Bruwer, who is the principal of a training college in the Cape Province; Mrs. De la Bat, who is an authority on the education of the blind and the deaf at the Worcester school; Dr. W. K. H. du Plessis, who is the chief inspector of the Department of Education, Arts and Science; Professor T. S. du Toit, professor of education at the University of Stellenbosch; Professor J. J. Fourie, professor of education at the Free State University; Mr. N. C. Gracie, who is the president of the correspondence colleges and who is also a man who takes a strong interest in swimming galas; Professor R. E. Lighton, who is professor of education at the University of Cape Town; Mr. H. Lundie, chief inspector of Natal; Mr. A. G. S. Meiring, at present director of education, and at that time deputy director, of the Free State; Mr. D. Miller, who is now retired, but who is an absolute authority in the field of mathematics; Professor J. D. Mulder, deputy director of education in the Transvaal; Miss G. C. Paver, principal of a girls&#x2019; school in Durban; Professor C. J. Potgieter, principal of the Teachers&#x2019; College in Pretoria; Professor S. J. Preller, professor of education; Dr. P. M. Robertse, director of the Bureau for Social and Educational Research; Dr. E. L. G. Schnell, chief inspector of the Cape Province; Mr. J. T. Slater, principal of one of the Eastern Cape schools; Miss M. L. Spies, principal of the Oranje Girls&#x2019; School in Bleomfontein; Mr. J. A. Stander, formerly deputy director of education in Natal; Mr. S. Theron, deputy director of education in the Cape Province; Dr. J. T. van Wyk, director of education in South-West Africa, and Mr. H. A. Whitecross, chief inspector of schools in the Transvaal. Mr. Speaker, I gave these names for the purposes of the record. Now I challenge any member on the opposite side to tell me that this is not an fair cross-section of the educationists in South Africa. I challenge them to say, so that the people may hear it, that these people are not qualified to give the country an education policy. Hon. members should now tell the world that these people are a bunch of educationists at universities, training colleges, secondary and primary schools of various kinds, both Afrikaans-and English-speaking, who are interested in education. I want them to come and tell me that these 26 persons whose names I have read are not qualified, because these hon. members think that they are qualified to judge.</p>

<p>As a result of that I then received this advice. Now I want to tell the hon. members what the advice was. If they will be so kind as to open their Bills before them and to make notes, they will find that there is not one provision in this Bill which is not included in the advice given to me. That is my first challenge. Hon. members on the opposite side must make notes to see to it that I do not tell a He The draft Bill which the hon. member for Kensington mentioned is, as he quoted it. drawn up in lay language. Hon. members will notice, for example, that the Bill on Educational Services, which we are still to deal with, is represented by only two lines in the advice which was given. This is no Bill in the sense that I shall introduce it. The draft reads as follows. The first section is the customary definitions clause.</p>

<p>Hon. members should listen, because they have challenged me. The hon. member for South Coast took great pleasure in asking, &#x201C;How many Bills were there? Tell us how many Bills were there?&#x201D; This is the one which has now been tabled, and this is the other one on which this Bill and the one which is still to come were based after I had read about everything the contact body had done. I am now going to read from it. As I have said, the first clause contains definitions. The second clause comprises only two lines, namely, &#x201C;The non-university education of Whites mentioned in the schedule to this Act shall be entrusted to the provinces.&#x201D; On this advice we had to draw up a separate measure, namely one in respect of educational services. That is the first point of advice that they gave. The next point of advice is as follows: &#x201C;In terms of Act 86 the following shall be the broad, general principles of the national education policy&#x2014;(a) that education in public schools shall have a Christian character, with due respect for the religious convictions of others.&#x201D; This principle was embodied in clause 2 (1) (a) of the Bill before us at present. The next subsection is, &#x201C;The mother tongue, English or Afrikaans, shall be the medium of instruction with equitable adjustment to the existing practice.&#x201D; We find that in clause 2 (1)(c) of the Bill. The third point is, &#x201C;Education shall have a broad national character.&#x201D; That is included in clause 2 (1) (b) of the Bill. The fourth section reads as follows: &#x201C;Compulsory education and the limits relating to school age shall be uniform&#x201D;, and that is clause 2 (1)(d).Then we have, &#x201C;Instruction at public schools shall be free, without prejudice to such exceptions as the Minister may initially approve.&#x201D; That is contained in clause 2 (1)(e). Then, &#x201C;The parents shall be given a place in the education system&#x201D;, and that is clause 2 (1) (h). Clause (g) of the draft reads: &#x201C;The teacher shall be given a share in educational planning&#x201D;, which is clause 2 (1) (i) of the Bill before the House.</p>

<p>We can discuss that at the Committee Stage. I want to show hon. members that I did not grab the principles of the measure before us at the moment from thin air. I found them in this draft.

<p>That is clause 2 (1) (b) of the Bill. We have the same provision in the measure now before us. We merely said that the education policy shall be determined after consultation with the Administrators. We have combined these two clauses. The draft then deals with the question of courses, which may be found in clause 2 (1) (g). It is just the one word, namely &#x201C;courses&#x201D;. Thirdly, &#x201C;The provision of education in accordance with the ability and aptitude of and interest shown by the pupil and the needs of the country, with due regard to the advisability of maintaining any diversity which circumstances may require.&#x201D; That is clause 2 (1) (f) of the Bill before us. Then follows, &#x201C;Equivalent certificates&#x201D;, and that is clause 2 (1) (g). The next is, &#x201C;The initial retention and maintenance of existing schools, which are transferred by the Minister from the Department of Education, Arts and Science to the provinces.&#x201D; We shall find this aspect in the Educational Services Bill. Clause (f) of the draft refers to &#x201C;conditions of service of teachers, particularly with a view to the development of education as a recognized profession&#x201D;, and that is clause 2 (1) (j). Then, &#x201C;Provision for education through the medium of the mother tongue&#x201D;, and that is clause 2 (1) (c). The people who drew up this draft gave us even more power, which we did not even use. They said, &#x201C;Any other matters which may be in the interests of education&#x201D;. The Minister was given a free hand. We did not even include this provision: we did not even mention it. This draft furthermore mentions the committee of educational heads, which we incorporated in clause 6 of the Bill. The last point dealt with in this draft is the definition of higher education, which is now to be amended as a result of the fact that the Central Government is transferring these schools to the provinces, and that is dealt with in clause 44 of the Educational Services Bill. That, Mr. Speaker, is the full advice submitted to us.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member may have it now. He may have it with pleasure and compare it with the Bill. A preamble was attached to the draft, of course, namely &#x201C;whereas &#x2026; and whereas &#x2026;&#x201D;, and our legal advisers rejected it. Once we had got as far as that, I discussed this Bill with the administrators, after it had been drawn up by our legal advisers in more or less the form now before the House. I asked them to discuss the principles of this measure with their executive committees.</p>

<p>No consultations were held with anybody on this original document. The principles contained in this were, as I have said, accepted. I have just read them to hon. members. After the contact body had formulated them, they were accepted by the principals individually, and every principal discussed it with his own people. I do not know who did not do that. They had to discuss it with their people and tell them that these were the principles. After I had heard from them that they agreed on the principles, this measure went to the legal advisers in order that they may draw up a Bill. After they had commenced doing so, they said that it was impossible to formulate it in one act. They proposed that the principles be split and the policy embodied in one Bill and the new educational services in another. After that had been done, I gave every administrator and executive committee a draft of the Bill, as drawn up by the legal advisers on 3rd September. After they had received that legislation, there was some response. Natal also received it, and in that regard I shall now read a letter, from both the Administrator and Mr. Wilks, a senior member of the Executive Committee of Natal. He also wrote a report, known as the Wilks Report, with which I shall deal a bit later. The charge levelled by the hon. member. For South Coast&#x2014;and now the hon. member should listen closely&#x2014;is that the Natal Executive Committee never accepted this Bill. Is that correct?</p>

<p>This one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. It is virtually the same. I shall give the hon. member a copy of that one as well. I shall give the hon. member a copy of the one they received, and then he may tell me the difference. Under the date 6th October, Mr. E. C. Wilks wrote to me as followed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Minister,<br/>When the draft Bill on Education was before the Executive Committee for comment, his Honour the Administrator was requested to express the Administration&#x2019;s views on certain provisions contained in the Bill when he met you and the other Administrators in Cape Town recently. In addition to the verbal representations to be made by His Honour, I was requested to write to you on behalf of the elected members of the Executive Committee and express our objection in the strongest possible terms to the abolition of parental choice in the medium of instruction. This policy of parental choice has since Union been regarded as the cardinal principle in the education system in Natal and its abolition will be strongly resented by the majority of the people in this province. Section2 (8), dealing with the participation of parents in educational matters, is vaguely worded and I assume it is not the intention to depart from the centralized control as at present enforced in Natal. This Administration is strongly opposed to the school board system as conducted in other provinces.</block>

<p>That was on 6th October. You will notice, therefore, that there is one objection, and that relates to parental choice. That is the essential objection and Mr. Wilks made no secret of that; they fight it tooth and nail and they will have none of it, and it is of cardinal importance to them that it remains that way in Natal. I repeat that notwithstanding the fact that the principal received a report from his representative on the contact body, the adjustment would, on his suggestion, be gradual adjustment. But I also received a letter from the Administrator of Natal dated 18th October, 1966, in which he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The amended Bill which you sent me on 27th September, 1966, has been discussed by my Executive Committee and myself. In the first place I want to express my gratitude for your willingness to meet us by eliminating our misgivings to a large extent &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then we find this sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We (i.e., my Executive Committee and myself) accept the Bill in its present form, subject to the following reservations.</block>

<p>They accept it. The hon. member for South Coast said they had never accepted it. He may come and take another look at the two Bills; he says this is a different one. I am now going to read what Natal&#x2019;s reservations were, and this is a letter from the Administrator, and not just from an official. It comes from the Administrator, the person whom the Government holds responsible. He says that in clause 1 their reservation is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should like to request that the restriction that no more than two commercial subjects may be presented at a school other than a vocational school, be revoked or extended to three. That would enable us to offer a greater variety in places where there is no commercial school, and thus implement our system of differentiated education more effectively.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But that has nothing to do with this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know it has nothing to do with the Bill, but if I omit a paragraph they will be saying to-morrow that I did not read the complete letter. Now I want to refer the hon. House to the Next Bill we have to deal with, where in clause 9 (8) it is provided that not merely three but even four subjects may be offered with the approval of the Minister. Here we made a concession. That was the first concession.</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2009-2010" refersTo="page_1022"/>Clause 2 (1) (ii): The four members of my Executive Committee are not prepared to accept this clause.</block>

<p>I have already read that from Mr. Wilks&#x2019; letter and I shall not read the entire paragraph again. Here the Administrator said in parentheses: &#x201C;Personally, I have no objection to the clause,&#x201D; and there are many Natal people, and also many English-speaking people, who have no objection to the clause.</p>

<block name="quote">Clause 2 (1) (iv): Free education: It is not clear how the State-aided schools will be affected by this.</block>

<p>That is another misgiving on the part of the Executive Committee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The schools receive a subsidy from the province, but are independent in other respects. Will they now also have to provide free education, as defined in the clause? It is accepted that private schools are not affected by the Bill.</block>

<p>I have already made it clear in my reply exactly what is meant by that. I therefore think it is clear to them, too. He then elaborated on this matter, and asked about free text-books, etc. I have already mentioned that. We may discuss that at greater length in Committee.</p>

<block name="quote">Clause 2 (1) (x): Uniformity of conditions of service and salary scales: We presume that this clause means that there will be a fixed framework for salaries in all the provinces, but that within this framework certain differences may continue as demanded and justified by local circumstances.</block>

<p>Of course, if sound reasons can be advanced why there should be a difference, that will happen. Surely we are not laying down the laws of the Medes and the Persians here. One has regard to the practice. And we informed them accordingly. [Interjection.] I am telling you what those people&#x2019;s objections were.</p>

<block name="quote">The constitution of a National Education Council: In view of the fact that this council may now consist of 15 members, it is requested once again that at least one member be appointed from each province after consultation with the administrator concerned.</block>

<p>Well, we made it not one but two. They also have an objection to clause 10 (5) and (6)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although we fully appreciate that these clauses were deemed necessary, we trust nevertheless that the complete integration of academic and vocational education will be expedited.</block>

<p>Well, if by that those people mean that they want vocational education and academic education fully integrated under one roof, then I say frankly and openly that I am not in favour of that, because it will simply mean watering down either one or the other, and I am not in favour of this great, sprawling American system of having schools under one roof. The vocational schools must be kept separate from the academic high schools, with the necessary adjustment if there are not enough pupils to take a commercial course. It is expensive education and it has to be handled in this way.</p>

<p>We now come to the actual crux of the matter. I have told you the history of this Bill and I have gone out of my way to demonstrate to hon. members that this Bill is well planned and well conceived, that numerous conferences and consultations were held and concessions made, for if we had not done that, it would have gone the way of all previous commissions since the Jagger Commission. We would have made absolutely no progress. For that reason, if this matter were blown up in public and if it were exploited as the hon. member for South Coast did when he heard the first whisper and tried to make a political case of it&#x2014;where would we have got? What disunity we would have had here in our own ranks! I think the hon. members should be grateful for the patience shown by all concerns involved in the matter. In particular I want to pay tribute to the chairman of that council, Professor Rautenbach, who handled the council with the utmost patience. I had the honour of opening the first council meeting, and I may tell you that the representatives of the provinces and others glared at each other across the table. They mistrusted each other quite as much as hon. members on that side mistrust me to-day. There was quite as much suspicion-mongering as we have had in this debate from hon. members on that side of the House. They thought that one was going to lose and the other gain. Eventually Professor Rautenbach fused that group of educationists into a body which co-operated and produced results. We should therefore pay the highest tribute to those people. If only hon. members of the Opposition had consulted members of that council, they would have found that no decision was ever forced on to one group by the members of another group by means of a majority vote.</p>

<p>The three principles which were actually at issue in this debate and on which most of the speeches were made, are the Christian character of education, the national character of education and mother-tongue instruction. The other points raised here relate to particulars which we should rather discuss at the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about the principle of central control?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may grouse and grumble as much as he likes, but the principle of central control has already been accepted. I have nothing more to say about that. The principle has been accepted, and it has been accepted on ten points. My <span class="col_2011-2012" refersTo="page_1023"/>task is merely to eliminate the present misunderstanding, not to plead that there should be central control. In my Second Reading speech I gave the reasons why there should be central control. My present task is merely to point out the misconceptions attached to these three major principles.</p>

<p>I shall first deal with the question of the Christian character of education. Mr. Speaker, in some cases the approach of hon. members to this matter amounted to veiled blasphemy; in other cases hon. members professed lofty ideals; but it was surprising to see how naïve some people can be, how stupid they can pretend to be and what question they can ask you, questions such as: &#x201C;What do you mean by ‘Christian character&#x2019;?&#x201D; &#x201C;Will it be this or will it be that; will it be this way or will it be that way?&#x201D; In order to have absolute clarity and to leave no doubts whatsoever about the meaning, I formulated my interpretation of the &#x201C;Christian character of education&#x201D;&#x2014;and I do not want to change one word in that. My interpretation of &#x201C;the Christian character of education&#x201D; is that education shall build on the basis of the traditional Western culture and view of life which recognize the validity of the Biblical principles, norms and values. I challenge any hon. member to tell me that that is sectional; that it includes one group of Christians and excludes another. I repeat that what is understood by &#x201C;Christian character&#x201D; is that education shall build on the basis of the traditional Western culture, not the present one in its decadent and watered-down form, but as we knew it since Jan van Riebeeck arrived here more than 300 years ago as the first bearer of the civilization, the culture and the religion and its Christian character, and as these were then carried to the remotest corners of this country of ours. Education shall be built on the basis of the traditional Western culture and view of life. What is the foundation for that traditional Western culture and view of life? The Biblical principles, norms and values. Those are the only ones we recognize as valid.</p>

<p>In the second place hon. members of the Opposition asked me what I meant by &#x201C;national&#x201D;, but before they asked the question they supplied their own definitions; they interpreted &#x201C;national&#x201D; as &#x201C;National Party&#x201D; and as &#x201C;indoctrination&#x201D;. Those definitions are naive, childish, ridiculous, silly and inane. I could add a few more words if you would allow it, Mr. Speaker. We say that education shall have a broad national character. This is my definition. By &#x201C;national&#x201D; it is understood that education shall build on the ideal of the national development of all citizens of South Africa, in order that our own identity and way of life may be preserved and in order that the South African nation may constantly appreciate its task as part of the Western civilization. That is what I understand by &#x201C;national&#x201D; when I am dealing with education, but when I am fighting the United Party my interpretation of &#x201C;national&#x201D; means something quite different; what I mean then is the National Party, and then I am grateful to have such a weapon for fighting the United Party. But here I am dealing with an educational law, and any educationist in the country will tell you that what is meant here by &#x201C;national&#x201D; is national development, as I have already explained. Think of the joy in the hearts of all true South Africans when we could declare the Republic five years ago; then we cleared the way for national unity and said: &#x201C;Let us forget the wars and the disputes of the past.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, it is the hobby-horse of the hon. member for South Coast to keep these things alive. That is the only way he can remain the member for South Coast; he can retain his seat only by making his supporters believe that the National Party Government wants to make Nationalists of their children. It is tragic that a man as experienced as the hon. member for South Coast should propagate that kind of thing here. He knows that what he said here was void of all truth. Mr. Speaker, if America, with its different population groups, could succeed in becoming a unified nation under the Stars and Stripes of America, and if Switzerland, with its three population groups, could succeed in bringing about national unity, our way is also clear. The public outside is building national unity, and hon. members of the Opposition who try to destroy it here will not succeed. Their numbers will merely dwindle more and more in this House. In due course they will disappear, and the small group which is more level-headed than the hon. member for South Coast will then join us in the struggle to bring about the desired national unity and to inculcate a national character in our education.</p>

<p>The last principle I want to discuss is the principle of mother-tongue education. Mother-tongue education is the accepted principle on which all education is built. This principle is accepted so generally that there is no member in this House who would dare to say that instruction should not be given to the child through the medium of its mother tongue. I do not think there is one hon. member on that side who will say: &#x201C;No, it is not necessary.&#x201D; Everybody agrees. I made it my business to see what a Natal person had to say about this matter, particularly in consequence of the strong objections to the Natal system which are entertained by my own supporters on this side.</p>

<p>I consulted the Wilks Report of 1946. It is the same Mr. E. C. Wilks. I just want to read to you some extracts from what Mr. Wilks had to say, but before I do so, I want to tell the hon. member for South Coast, following on what was said by hon. members from Natal with regard to neglect of the Afrikaans child&#x2014;I do not want to go on beating this race drum, as the hon. member for South Coast did&#x2014;but if at this stage he can bring me one English-speaking child in the entire Republic of South Africa who did not receive fair treatment and who was forced by the National Party Provincial Councils of the Transvaal, the Free State and the Cape to take his classes <span class="col_2013-2014" refersTo="page_1024"/>through the medium of Afrikaans, I am prepared to withdraw this Bill immediately.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Will that apply also to Afrikaans-speaking children?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you what Mr. Wilks said in respect of what happened to the Afrikaans child in his schools. In paragraph 74 of his report Mr. Wilks says, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a fundamental principle of educational procedure that a child should on first going to school be taught through the medium of the language he understands best. This will be the language spoken in the home. That is the home language. This principle has not been seriously challenged in any quarter and it is not necessary to reiterate here the arguments in favour of the use of the mother tongue as a medium. These have loomed large in educational literature in South Africa. The Broome Commission was unable to come to agreement on this question, largely on account of its fear of interfering with the rights of parents.</block>

<p>Please note&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It could not come to an agreement largely because of its fear of interfering with the right of parents, but the case for the mother tongue was set out in full in a minority report. While some of the disabilities which existed at that time have since been removed and the two official languages are today on a much greater equality of footing, it is nevertheless still true that many parents deliberately choose the second language as medium of instruction instead of the mother tongue. This wrong choice is almost invariably made by Afrikaans-speaking parents who, in a mistaken zeal for the ultimate economic welfare of their children, thus subject them to the dangers of retardation and frustration.</block>

<p>Here Wilks says unequivocally that he admits that. That is what we said right at the beginning. That is the attitude we adopted at the outset. How dare the Opposition resist mother-tongue education? How dare they tell us that in Natal parental choice has always obtained, that it should stay that way and that the child should therefore suffer as a result? Here is a man who investigated the matter. He continues. In paragraph 75 he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The advocates of parental option have pinned their faith on the democratic rights of every parent to order the welfare of his child.</block>

<p>Just what the hon. member for South Coast said: The parent is master of the child, and it is the democratic right of the parent, and therefore the parent must choose. Wilks continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While this right is not contested, it must be admitted that its existence in practice has had to be restricted and governed by State interference in many directions.</block>

<p>He admits that. That must happen. Although the parent has that right of determination, the State must step in and save the child from the unwise parent. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The parent does not always possess the technical knowledge to act with wisdom in the interests of his child and where matters arise which involve knowledge and understanding which lie outside what can be expected from the ordinary citizen, the State has wisely intervened and compelled parents to act according to its direction.</block>

<p>That is exactly what we are doing now. The skimpy fig leaf held up by the Opposition is the fine slogan: &#x201C;The right of the parents.&#x201D; Of course I have a right to my child, but if it becomes clear that from certain external motives I force certain options in life on to my child, for which the State has to pay, then we say: &#x201C;No. So far and no further.&#x201D; In paragraph 76 he concludes with the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The evidence does not suggest that parents have become sufficiently enlightened on this subject (parental choice) or that the efforts of principals to educate parental opinion are having full effect. More than this is needed and the committee is of the opinion that some form of compulsion will be necessary if the mistakes of to-day are not to be perpetuated. The existing law with regard to language option results in considerable hardships to many children.</block>

<p>What are we doing wrong? There is so much indulgence that we said immediately: Mother-tongue education must come, but with gradual adjustment. That was done with a view to and at the request of Natal, in order not to scare the people by telling them: Tomorrow, immediately, this and that will happen. As long as I am there, I shall make it happen as soon as possible, because it is the child who suffers. The political aspirations of the hon. member for South Coast, as leader in Natal, leave me stone cold as long as the child in South Africa has to suffer; whether an English-speaking or an Afrikaans-speaking child, we need them in our country.</p>

<p>I do not think there is anything left to reply to. The rest of the debate was handled by members of the Government Party and Hansard is there in evidence of what took place. Before sitting down I just want to say that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) produced a bundle of telegrams. I want to tell hon. members this: My private secretary has not had an opportunity to count all the letters and telegrams I received, but they run into thousands. I want to tell the hon. member that many of them came from Pietermaritzburg (District). Particularly after the speech <span class="col_2015-2016" refersTo="page_1025"/>made by the hon. member, I received a whole bunch of them this morning. I just want to tell the hon. member that this may be his last innings here if he performs like that. My conviction has been strengthened, because I have been asked from all quarters, by English and Afrikaans-speaking people, not to budge an inch with regard to this legislation and to have this Bill placed on the Statute Book with the utmost despatch, because it is in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister for not moving the amendment. I want to thank him very sincerely for withdrawing it. It is a gesture which is much appreciated, not only by me as a representative of the Coloured people, but I am sure also by the Coloured people of South Africa. The principle embodied in this Bill has, of course been accepted. Arising out of this Bill, I want to ask the Minister whether he would consider, as part of the honour which is to be paid to the dead, the erection of a cenotaph, something which is, after all, an accepted principle in all the countries of the world where homage is paid to graves and unknown soldiers&#x2019; graves. All the battlefields of all the wars can be commemorated in one place. Although we do not want any apartheid in this. I feel sure that if such a cenotaph was erected in a place predominantly occupied by Coloured people as a symbol of the honour paid to the war dead, it would be acceptable. I want to give that thought to the Minister. I see that the principle in the Bill is the creation of memorials and gardens, and so on. I do feel that if in South Africa there could be established, either in the main cities or else in one city, or wherever the Minister may think fit, something on these lines, an unknown soldier&#x2019;s grave &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the hon. member for Boland, but I think one of the difficulties is that this board which deals with pre-1914-1918 war graves would have to create some cenotaph covering a history from 1700 to 1910. I think that would be a difficulty. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion is rather a matter for the Imperial War Graves Commission.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper, namely the addition of a new paragraph (d) which is to the effect that the board should compile and maintain registers of the situation of graves referred to in paragraph (a), as well as the personal details of persons buried therein. I have discussed this matter with the Minister and, as suggested, with his department, and I am aware that in clause 4 of the Bill, in paragraph (j) for instance, reference is made as follows: &#x201C;to establish and keep a register of all graves repaired or maintained&#x201D;. Similarly paragraph (1) provides for the publication periodically lists of any graves. But I do not feel that those paragraphs cover the point which I wish to have included in the Bill, and that is the duty with which it was originally charged, namely to maintain a register. I hope that the Minister will accept this amendment, as he indicated during the Second Reading of this measure that he would do. I move&#x2014;</p>

However, I shall accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment as a principle, because I think it would be a good thing if we could have a register so that we might know precisely who was buried where.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not moving an amendment to this clause. I have received representations from people in Natal, where, as I pointed out during my Second Reading speech, a great deal of money has been spent. I now have the figures, and it appears that from various sources something like R30,000 per annum is being spent by three separate bodies. I merely rise to ask whether the Minister, when appointing these members of the board, would give consideration to the representations of people from <span class="col_2019-2020" refersTo="page_1027"/>existing organizations. I think it is a reasonable request&#x2014;I think the Minister probably already has it in his mind. I do not want to suggest that there be two from Natal, which is the request I have received. I simply say to the Minister that I think it would be reasonable where these bodies are concerned, having paid money year after year to quite a substantial amount, and being very interested in this matter, for the Minister to receive nominations from these people with the opportunity of giving Natal, say, two representatives. I would be very happy if the Minister would agree to that.</p>

<heading>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES BILL</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my exhaustive second reading speech on the National Education Policy Bill I enlarged, amongst other things, on the importance of education. Because in the Educational Services Bill we are dealing to a considerable extent with vocational education, I should like to supplement the ideas expressed in the aforementioned speech on the importance of education by letting the spotlight fall on a certain more materialistic aspect to make us realize even more fully that we will have to be prepared to spend a larger portion of our national product on education.</p>

<p>Education is an investment for human potential. The industrialist invests capital in buildings, machinery and other equipment and he expects those investments to pay dividends. These kind of capital investments are carefully <span class="col_2021-2022" refersTo="page_1028"/>considered because the future of the industry is directly involved. Investments of this nature were, until quite recently, regarded as the only true investments and amounts which were allocated to education and training were to a large extent regarded as donations towards a deserving cause, which could perhaps in an indirect way benefit the industry.</p>

<p>However, research has revealed that these amounts which industrialists spend on education must not be regarded as donations but are in fact a capital investment, an investment which produces tremendous dividends. This investment may in fact be termed &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital.</p>

<p>Particular attention is to-day being devoted to investments in &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital, particularly after industrial leaders realized that the excessive offering of industrial equipment to countries which do not have this &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital at their disposal definitely did not have the expected results. Economists then came to the conclusion that production could be raised only when justice was done to both kinds of investment, namely investment in &#x201C;nonhuman&#x201D; capital (equipment), as well as in &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital (trained people).</p>

<p>From the aforegoing it is clear that one of the most important factors in economic growth is the result of the amount of training the employee has had; the grade of training received by persons in key positions and the training of all who have to deal with the maximum utilization of human potential.</p>

<p>Money spent on education is therefore not a donation with dubious results and significance, but is, as economists firmly point out, an investment in one of the most profitable production factors, because it provides trained people.</p>

<p>Experience gained with the rendering of assistance to undeveloped states by various world powers, has drawn attention very emphatically to education as the key to economic growth.</p>

<p>A number of research projects in this field overseas has also indicated with certainty that countries have benefited tremendously by the increased education or training of their people. That research has also indicated that a country&#x2019;s industrial progress is directly linked to the investment in &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital of that country.</p>

<p>In our own country we are at present experiencing a remarkable economic growth<sup>*</sup>, and connected with that we notice an ever-increasing demand for highly trained personnel. Although the educational institutions are producing qualified persons to an ever-increasing extent, demand is still exceeding the supply.</p>

<p>Industrial development and economic growth is proceeding apace in South Africa. Tremendous investments are being made in &#x201C;nonhuman&#x201D; capital and large amounts are being spent on education and training, but the development and exploitation of human potential is not keeping pace. Still more intensive attempts must be made to try and take up the backlog. Immigration of trained persons does not offer a permanent solution. The human potential of <i>this</i> country must be developed to the utmost. Progress cannot be allowed to be impeded by the unnecessary loss of human potential. There are too many pupils who do not follow suitable courses. There are still far too many promising pupils who do not obtain admission to a university and there are still far too many first-year students who fall by the wayside in spite of having the necessary abilities. Education is directly linked to economic growth and therefore to the progress of the country and that is why education must now receive attention from the House of Assembly, which is the highest authority.</p>

<p>However, man&#x2019;s potentiality does not consist only of the degree of training he receives, because the quality of the service he renders is closely linked to the degree of training he receives and to his integrity. Investment in &#x201C;human&#x201D; capital has greater value therefore when the education and training of that individual goes hand in hand with his upbringing, that is to say, when the shaping of the individual as a whole is taken into consideration.</p>

<p>A country does not only need a <i>trained</i> population, it also needs an <i>educated</i> population, and both these aspects are furthered by education. Seen in this light, effective educaton is only possible if the people who undertake the task of education are themselves of the highest quality in respect of qualifications and character.</p>

<p>The Republic of South Africa is in the unique position that its white minority has to &#x201C;carry&#x201D; the entire population, that is to say the white population provides employees in those fields requiring higher training and qualifications.</p>

<p>With the increasing emphasis on education, a certain measure of correspondence with industry is discernible, which amounts to this: The raw material of the &#x201C;educational industry&#x201D;, the young child, is the primary school child or the high school child, and the end product is the qualified and trained employee.</p>

<p>Production in this &#x201C;industry&#x201D; has increased tremendously in all countries, including the Republic. The number of schools, colleges, and training institutions which are being completed daily, testify to this. The establishment of new universities and the extension of the existing institutions are all signs of tremendous growth in the &#x201C;educational industry&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Education for all is necessary because it is the means whereby the standard of living of the population is raised, whereby productivity is increased and the life of the individual enriched. Education is essential for those who want to undertake the leadership, in whatever sphere. On a political, economic and technological level, resolutions of the utmost importance are continually being taken. For the sake of the future of the country, those with whom the decisions rest must be capable of farranging <span class="col_2023-2024" refersTo="page_1029"/>thought in order to understand implications and to act with the highest degree of responsibility. It requires a teacher with well developed personality, into which is integrated an exceptional educational background and training, to develop leadership in an effective way from an early age amongst children so that the fruits thereof can be plucked in their maturity.</p>

<p>In a country such as this, with its heterogeneous population where leadership necessarily emanates from the white population with its centuries-old cultural lead, the most important task is to retain and preserve particularly the intellectual and moral qualities. Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in my Second Reading speech on the National Education Policy Bill, the National Advisory Education Council, in close consultation with the Heads of the Educational Departments and their mandators also recommended, amongst other things, that the divided control over education be terminated by the provinces transferring to the Department of Education, Arts and Science the technical, commercial and domestic science high schools, and that I accepted the recommendation.</p>

<p>As recommended by the Education Council this transfer will be accompanied by certain guarantees which may be briefly summarized as follows: (a) the Minister of Education, Arts and Science is invested in terms of the National Education Policy Bill with the authority to determine within the framework of ten main principles the national education policy in respect of all branches of education for full-time school-going youth up to and including Std. X or matriculation, which must then be implemented by the provinces, (b) Clause 9 of the Education Services Bill, which supplements the aforementioned Bill, provides in the first instance for the provinces to hand over the schools which I have already mentioned, but with the proviso that: (i) The vocational school buildings which are already in the course of being constructed, or the construction of which has already been approved by the Minister will, upon transfer, be completed.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, by the Central Government.</p>

<p>Next I come to the second provision: (ii) The nature and objectives of the technical and commercial vocational education as it has been up to now shall remain unchanged; (iii) the fixed rights and privileges of the staff at such schools will remain protected.</p>

<p>(c) Clause 13 provides that the Minister, to the exclusion of any other authority, may conduct examinations at, <i>inter alia</i>, all institutions providing vocational education. The syllabuses and courses, etc., are drawn up in collaboration with commerce and industry. The examinations which have to be written are acknowledged examinations, and we would be creating great confusion in South Africa if we did not see to it that they remained in force. In this way examination standards will be maintained. Clause 9 (2) provides that the Minister may, at the appropriate time, transfer some or all of these examinatory powers to the provinces if he thinks fit.</p>

<p>As a result of the termination of divided control over education, it is of course also necessary for the definition of &#x201C;higher education&#x201D; as contained in section 17 of the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, Act No. 38 of 1945, to be revised. This is done in clause 44 of the Bill. As formulated at present, the Department of Education, Arts and Science will be responsible for the following types of education for Whites&#x2014;(a) education at a university level; (b) education provided in art and maritime training schools and colleges for advanced technical education; (c) special education for the categories of handicapped children mentioned in schedule 1 of the Bill; (d) education intended for persons who are no longer liable to compulsory education, education such as that provided in apprentice schools, part-time classes and schools for the full-time technical training of adults.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 2 (4) (b) industrial and reform schools will still fall under the Department of Education, Arts and Science.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the question may now well be asked why the education provided at art schools, schools for special education and industrial and reform schools are still included under the concept of &#x201C;higher education&#x201D; in spite of the termination of divided control. The reply is simple. As you know, industrial and reform schools are established in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act, Act No. 33 of 1960 to provide committed behavioural deviates with highly specialised education. Three government Departments are concerned in the process of admittance and treatment, namely the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, the Children&#x2019;s Courts of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, Arts and Science. In the interests of these children it is absolutely essential that there should be the closest co-operation among the three bodies concerned. This close co-operation will be impossible if the schools were divided up amongst the four provinces. Such a step would therefore be detrimental to the children, and that cannot be allowed. There is only one art school and a few schools for the various categories of handicapped children, with the result that it would be uneconomic to transfer these schools to the provinces. In addition it would create all kinds of problems for the provinces if the schools were to be transferred to them because children from other provinces must also be admitted to these schools.</p>

<p>The rest of the Bill is merely a consolidation of the Vocational Education Act. Act No. 70 of 1955, and the Special Schools Act, Act No. 9 of 1948, in so far as it will relate to the branches of education which will remain under the care of the Department of Education, Arts <span class="col_2025-2026" refersTo="page_1030"/>and Science. One result which this will have is that the provinces will now have to make their own legislation for those categories of special education which will be their responsibility, and to do this they will have a period of approximately two years.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>When I heard the hon. the Minister make his Second Reading speech, to which I think no one in this House will take any great exception, I thought back to the other two Bills we have had. I think it is an almighty pity that these three Bills were not published together some months ago so that the whole country, the education departments and the people interested in education could have seen what the general plan is. We now see what the general plan is after studying this Bill. We first had the Advanced Technical Education Bill, then the National Education Policy Bill and now finally we have this Bill which is called the Educational Services Bill. It is such a pity that they were not all available so that we could have seen the whole picture. The picture is now revealed and, of course, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech has assisted us. We naturally all agree with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s general observations about the importance of education in a modern state. Those are things which are accepted by all of us. This is a new deal in secondary education, especially vocational education. The hon. the Minister says that it will be introduced gradually. He cannot by a stroke of the pen change the system overnight. There has to be a gradual change-over, especially in regard to staff; that is one of the greatest difficulties; but altogether this is a step forward. Sir, I think the key to this Bill is the three schedules. When you start with the third schedule you see immediately what the importance and the effect of the Bill is. There are many Acts of the past which now have to be repealed because we have a new deal, and this new deal we have is shown very clearly in the other two schedules. The first schedule sets out the categories of children for whom the Minister will be chiefly responsible. The commercial subjects and the trades set out in Schedule II are to a great extent now being handed over to the provinces. If that is the case then there are only one or two things that I want to ask the hon. the Minister. In discussing the conditions of service of teachers, did he consult the teachers&#x2019; associations? How did the teachers&#x2019; associations feel about this handover? Are their positions in the service impaired in any way or are they satisfied with this change-over? This change-over from the Central Government to the Provincial Government could mean that the position of the teachers is not as safe and sound as it was before. That is my first question.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would like the hon. the Minister to explain something which is not quite clear to me from the terms of the Bill. Will the schools under Schedule I be controlled now by councils which will deal directly with the Minister? I understand Schedule II; that is quite simple. I see the definition of &#x201C;vocational education&#x201D; is still the same in this Bill as it has been since 1955. I have said frequently that all education is vocational education. When a doctor goes to a university we say, &#x201C;He is a university man because he has spent several years there&#x201D;. That is, narrowly, vocational education. It is vocational education at short range. When a man receives what we called in the old days a liberal education, we meant by a liberal education study chiefly of the humanities, that is what I would call educational at long range where he is preparing for life as a human being and as a citizen. In this case we have here, I should like to have clarity about this point of vocational education. I think the figure mentioned is eight hours a week. If they have more than eight hours a week devoted to these vocational subjects, then it becomes a vocational school. The ordinary school in a province teaches bookkeeping, shorthand and typing, etc., and it may not go beyond that figure. I do not know how we can overcome that difficulty. We discussed it in 1955 in detail. But we should not emphasize the fact that vocational education is different from any other education. We should rather get people to understand that a boy or girl who goes to a vocational school is not receiving an inferior education. It is just as sound as the other forms. I asked the hon. the Minister whether the conditions of service had been discussed with the teachers&#x2019; associations, especially the disciplinary regulations which are laid down here. If he has done that, and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will tell us in his reply, there is only one point remaining which I should like to discuss. We have dealt now with the technical colleges and the educational policy, and we now come to vocational and academic education up to Std. X. Does the Minister intend introducing legislation for nursery schools? Is it his intention to have a plan from the cradle to the grave? Is there a plan to do so? If so I should like to ask him whether the Bill can be published because I know that in Johannesburg we have nursery schools. The municipality of Johannesburg has done some valuable work in financing the work of the nursery schools. I should like the hon. the Minister to deal with that point in his reply. As far as the Bill is concerned I want to say that we accept the principle. As far as the principle is concerned, he has our wholehearted support.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to reply to the questions put by the hon. member for Kensington. In the first place, he asked whether the teachers&#x2019; associations were satisfied as far as the take-over of these schools by the provinces was concerned. Of course, they were rather taken aback right at the outset because they knew what they had but they were not so certain about what they were going to get. That was the first reaction, and it was, of course, a human one. After the legislation had been submitted to them they understood it fully and also saw unequivocally that all their <span class="col_2027-2028" refersTo="page_1031"/>present privileges, for example, in respect of salaries, conditions of service, leave rights, etc., were being guaranteed in this legislation. The hon. member for Kensington will remember that precisely the same thing happened with the take-over of the technical colleges when we introduced the Vocational Education Act. When the sections of the technical colleges and higher technical and higher trade schools were taken over at that time, the prevailing position and conditions of service of those teachers which we took over from the technical colleges, and who were private teachers, were maintained. We still have many of those old teachers who are to-day perhaps working under completely different conditions of service than those in the present Bill. When they receive better treatment with this new deal, they will accept it. However, they have now been reassured and they are satisfied.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly the same. In regard to the question of vocational education the hon. member wanted more clarity in regard to the eight-hour maximum. That was the problem previously, and it will always remain a problem, which we want to prevent, and I think the hon. member for Kensington as an educationist will agree with what I have just touched upon in my reply, namely that if one has these types of schools, if we have the domestic science high school pupils, the technical high school pupils, the commercial high school pupils and the academic pupils all under one roof then it will for the most part be only the principal who will take the initiative, or a school committee or school council, or a parent committee, to ascertain what should receive most attention. Then one finds that one or another of these sections are neglected. That is why I said that higher technical education is the most expensive form of secondary education in that we must keep these schools separate. In the Vocational Education Act of 1955 one finds that they are not in any way integrated with the normal high schools, but are in fact integrated with the commercial subjects, such as shorthand, typewriting and bookkeeping for example. There was then the tendency in the normal high schools to take more and more of these subjects. If they got weaker pupils then they would simply have to take these subjects. However, commerce was very dissatisfied with the products which were being turned out. They said that they were neither one thing nor the other and that such a person was not a trained typist in the full sense of the word. They simply did not have that understanding of commerce which one finds in the higher commercial schools. With all these problems they then restricted it to two subjects, or eight hours per week. That was an agreement between the Central Government and the provinces in the Vocational Education Act of 1955. The hon. member will remember that I said in my reply: &#x201C;At the request of Natal,&#x201D; i.e. that more of these subjects must be given. I am quite willing to do so, because that remains the arrangement. They may not do more than that in the academic schools. If they want to give more then they must, as is now still the case under the old Vocational Education Act of 1955, ask the Minister&#x2019;s permission.</p>

I could then refer it to them and say: &#x201C;Give us a report on this matter, judged on an educational basis.&#x201D; That is something for the future. I do not think we must worry about it. We have tried to maintain as far as possible the <i>status quo</i> as it is at the moment in this legislation. From this point we must see how it develops because if education remains static it will decline. It must always grow, and we do not know what the growth will be in ten or 15 years&#x2019; time. We shall merely leave it to our successors then, Kindergarten education has been allocated to the provinces. The provinces are now going to organize and undertake kindergarten school education. We therefore have nothing to do with them here.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This is a short Bill, and before saying anything at all about it, I already want to recommend that it be passed. Hon. members I will recall that in terms of the University of <span class="col_2029-2030" refersTo="page_1032"/>Port Elizabeth Act, 1964, half the number of members of the senate had to be professors of the University of Stellenbosch and Rhodes University. As hon. members also know, the intention of that was, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure right from the outset that the curricula and examinations would be of the same standard as those of our older universities. As hon. members will also recall we are organizing the Rand University on similar lines&#x2014;in other words, half the number of members of the senate will be professors of the Universities of Pretoria and Potchefstroom until such time as that university is firmly established. As regards Port Elizabeth, as I have said, that was done to ensure right from the outset that the curricula and examinations would be of the same standard as those of our older universities. However, it was also the idea that as the university grew to maturity, it would suggest amending legislation which would enable it to rely less and less on outside aid. Three years ago, at the time of the establishment of the university, it was not possible to say with any degree of certainty exactly when and how that was to be effected. Therefore, I was not prepared at that stage to attempt anticipating future events in the provisions which this House considered at that time, but left it to the council of the university to ascertain in the course of time what developments necessitated adjustments and to suggest the necessary amendments subsequent to having done so.</p>

<p>For conducting examinations, an examiner from another university has been appointed in terms of the Act for the purposes of &#x201C;any such examination or other test that serves as a final test of a student&#x2019;s degree of competence in any subject or course leading to a degree, diploma or certificate&#x201D;&#x2014;once again to guarantee the standard right from the outset. In this form the relative section 17 contains a number of elements which makes its implementation, as I learn from the council of the university, difficult for the senate of the university. At the request of the council of the university I have therefore consented, after consultation with the rectors of the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes, to introduce legislation amending the University of Port Elizabeth Act (No. 1 of 1964) in this and certain other respects.</p>

<p>Clause 1 of the Amendment Bill now before this House empowers the council of the university, as in the case of the University of Cape Town, to issue guarantees, without a cash surety, in order to enable members of its staff to obtain 90 per cent building loans. In terms of clauses 2. 3 (c) and 4 of the Bill the provisions of the remaining section 7 of the Higher Education Amendment Act, 1946. which is to be repealed, are being incorporated in the University of Port Elizabeth Act in order to provide for the appointment of committees. In this regard I may mention that this amendment will be effected in respect of every university as a result of the fact that that other legal provision is to be repealed. Clause 3 (a) and (b) of the Bill provides that representatives of the University of Stellenbosch and of Rhodes University will only serve in the senate of the University of Port Elizabeth when curricula and courses are being considered at, say, one or two meetings per annum, provided that amendments or rather, curricula or courses, suggested between such meetings are forwarded to members of the senate in writing for approval or disapproval. If they are accepted by majority vote, they are deemed to be approved and if they are rejected by majority vote they are deemed to be disapproved, unless they are subsequently approved at a meeting of the senate of the university, at which meeting Stellenbosch and Rhodes are to be represented. Clause 5 of the Bill provides that the faculty of commerce and administration shall now become the faculty of economic sciences. This was reauested by the council of the university. economic sciences. This was requested by the council of the university. Clause 6 makes provision for a wider selection of examiners because in many cases the best examiner, according to the council of the university, is a person in private practice or possibly even a retired professor. Clause 7 deletes an obsolete provision.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that on both sides of the House we are very reluctant to criticize any legislation which is introduced to amend constitutions of universities. We, at any rate, are reluctant to do so, On this side of the House it is a fundamental principle which we have laid down that the autonomy of universities should be recognized&#x2014;in other words, they should conduct their own affairs as far as possible. Our duty is to assist them. The amendment proposed in clause 3 of this Bill is, to my mind, a very necessary and important one. It provides that those persons appointed under subsection 1 (d) of section 10&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">shall not be members of the senate for the purposes of any proceedings of the Senate relating to matters other than matters connected with the curricula, the contents of syllabi, the standard of examinations and the appointment of the external examiners &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is a step forward. Then there is also the appointment of sub-committees to which the hon. the Minister referred. I think every amending Bill he has so far introduced has made provision for that. Such a procedure makes for the smoother running of the affairs of a companv. A university, where we look upon it as being an autonomous body, is similar to a comoany&#x2014;it is for instance a corporate body and as such capable in law of suing and being sued.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances we support the Second Reading of this Bill and wish the Council of this University every success with the progress they are making.</p>

<p>As a member of the council of the University of Port <span class="col_2031-2032" refersTo="page_1033"/>Elizabeth I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to give my support to the amendments proposed here by the Minister. It may be that some members of the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes, who have been serving on the Senate of the University of Port Elizabeth up to now, may regard the amendment contained in clause 3 of the Bill as a measure for pushing them aside. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to those members of the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes who served on the senate of the University of Port Elizabeth, for the way in which they contributed their share towards the development of this young university. Where it is possible for a council of a newly established university to function immediately upon being appointed, that is not so in the case of a senate of a university.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the senate of this University was held by the representatives of the council of the University only, because staff had to be appointed. The senators of the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes subsequently joined their ranks and in the beginning they virtually had to devote all their energies to the development of this young University. In that regard they made a tremendous contribution and had to make many sacrifices. Preparatory work had to be done, staff had to be appointed, and the foundations of the new University had to be laid. For that purpose they often had to journey to Port Elizabeth, something which had to be to the detriment of their own Universities because then their services were not available to their own Universities. For that reason I should like to pay tribute on this occasion to those people for the services rendered by them to this young University during the first years of its existence. One representative, a professor of Rhodes University, was almost entirely responsible for the design of the new University&#x2019;s academic dress. That in itself was a major contribution. But in course of time the University of Port Elizabeth got its own staff and approximately 50 professors have already joined the staff of the University. In terms of the principal Act the number of professors nominated by the Minister from the other two Universities had to be no fewer than the number of professors of the University of Port Elizabeth itself. Consequently they have to attend meetings in equal numbers. We should naturally like to retain the services of those people because they are people who have a great deal of experience. In a growing university, however, it is necessary to hold frequent meetings, some of only a minor nature, with resolutions that are not so comprehensive. For that reason the amendments contained in this Bill have definitely become essential. Those senators of the Universities of Stellenbosch and Rhodes who will in future only be called to Port Elizabeth for certain work, may perhaps now feel that they are being pushed to the side and for that reason I should like to give them the assurance on behalf of the University of Port Elizabeth that we should very much like to make further use of their services even in a full-time capacity. It is felt however, that the University of Port Elizabeth is now able to undertake its own work to a larger extent.</p>

I want to say that we in Port Elizabeth are proud of the fact that this University has made such rapid progress, particularly if one considers that more than 800 students will be enrolled this year.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>During the Second Reading Debate we listened with interest to the remarks made by the hon. the Minister about the object he is seeking to achieve with the amendment of the definition contained in this clause. The Minister referred to two aspects, which are mentioned in the <i>Hansard</i> report. he spoke about the problem of an inferior dwelling which is suitable for purposes of the present occupants thereof, and the <span class="col_2033-2034" refersTo="page_1034"/>market value of which may rapidly deteriorate should the area concerned be changed from one occupied by, say, Coloured people to one occupied by white people and should there be rapid development. The second point which he referred to was the question of a dwelling which deteriorated rapidly after the proclamation of a group area. The new definition of &#x201C;basic value&#x201D; does not, I suggest with respect, meet the situation where the market value of land plus building exceeds the market value of the land determined according to the Act and the building value according to the cost of construction. That may well occur, and I think that I indicated to the Minister during the Second Reading that that difficulty might well arise in a dwelling situated near public transport, near to the centre of the city. One might find that the owner of property of that sort might be adversely affected by the definition which is now included in the Bill. For that reason I placed on the Order Paper an amendment to clause 1 proposing that the basic value determined in this way for the land together with the construction costs of the buildings should not be less than the market value of the whole. That can frequently happen if the market value exceeds those two basic values. It is the converse of the position which the Minister proposes to deal with or which it is attempted to deal with, Accordingly I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in line 30, to the end of paragraph (iii) (b) of the proposed definition of &#x201C;basic value&#x201D; inserted by paragraph (b) and to substitute &#x201C;together with the basic value of the land shall not be less than the market value of the land with buildings thereon as at the basic date&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in support of the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Green Point. It has been said of this clause that, whilst the hon. the Minister has now at last brought the term &#x201C;market value&#x201D; into this Bill and related values to it, he has nevertheless done so in a restrictive sense. I believe that what we want here is to make the use of this term more realistic so that it will redound to the benefit of the person concerned. I believe that the proposed amendment adequately does that because it says that, &#x201C;together with the basic value of the land shall not be less than the market value of the land with buildings thereon as at the basic date&#x201D;. If the valuators believe that it should be more I believe it to be a good thing&#x2014;it is a good thing because a man would then get more for his property. I believe that that can safely be left in the hands of the valuators. But at least the value of the buildings and the land shall not be less than the market value at the time. The Minister in his White Paper explained that the two things were valued at different times. I quite honestly do not understand what he meant by that, This is what the White Paper says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This amendment makes it clear that in determining basic value of the effected property, the market value of the land as well as the joint market value of the land with the buildings thereon where it is determined in terms of the definition of &#x201C;basic value&#x201D;, must be determined at the value it was considered to have had immediately prior to the basic date.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to explain it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Instances have occurred where valuers determined the market value of land as it was immediately prior to the basic date, but evidently determined the value of the joint property as at the date of valuation.</block>

<p>Now, surely, Sir, the valuation under the Act has to be on the basic date anyway.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but he does not have to put this in to make it clear. He refers to the value of the land immediately prior to the basic date, which is correct, but in the case of the joint property, that is valued at some other date. How can that be done under the Act? How can the other part of the property be valued as at some other date, because surely it has to be valued immediately prior to the basic date? If that is so, and according to the White Paper this is the Minister&#x2019;s reason for doing it, then I quite frankly do not understand the Minister&#x2019;s intention. If the Minister wants to achieve what he has stated under paragraph (b) in his White Paper on clause 1, all he has to do is to say that the value of the land and the buildings together immediately prior to the basic date shall not be less than the market value of these two combined. That is all that he has to say. This is what I think the hon. member for Green Point is trying to achieve. There is no other purpose to be served by this, The Minister is quite off-beam, if I may say so, with his explanation of the position. The valuator is not allowed to value at any date other than immediately prior to basic date, whether it be the buildings concerned or whether it be the land. The only circumstances under which he can value at another date is if the board condones alterations or additions which have been done illegally.</p>

<p>The basic values of properties is one of the contentious aspects of any litigation dealing with group areas legislation. It is the basic value which has caused a considerable amount of dissatisfaction and hardship and loss to those people affected by this legislation. The Minister, in his reply to the second reading, told the House that hon. members complained that the basic values are too low. I will quote the hon. the Minister, because I want to show him where he is <span class="col_2035-2036" refersTo="page_1035"/>wrong. I quote from <i>Hansard</i> No. 4, Col. 1445&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hon. members allege that the basic values were determined entirely too low. Let me now tell the hon. members this, Since basic values have been determined and affected properties have been bought and sold, a total amount of R1,700,000 has been received in respect of appreciation contributions. But in respect of depreciation contributions&#x2014;that is the 80 per cent contribution&#x2014;we have paid out R6,200,000. In other words, the vast majority of properties were valued at a higher figure than they could fetch on the open market.</block>

<p>This is a completely fallacious argument and the Minister has strengthened our hands by these facts he has given us. It indicates that there is something radically wrong with basic values and that the racket to which I referred has cost this Government R6 million, because the people know that people have to sell their properties, and they have come with offers, ridiculously low purposely, because they are willing buyers but the others are unwilling sellers. It is the racket to which I have referred that has cost the Government R6 million and it means that the people affected have lost nearly R2 million on the basic valuation, because this R6 million only represents 80 per cent, and 20 per cent is lost by the poor people who had to sell their property. It is in order to prevent to a great extent, firstly, the continuation of this racket, and secondly to get the people who have to sell at a price more real in terms of the value of the property than the basic value suggests, that I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 15 after &#x201C;act&#x201D; to add &#x201C;and in the fixing of such basic value regard should be had to the Municipal value of the land and buildings thereon and also the price which a willing purchaser would be prepared to pay a willing seller.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This really means the market value, but I would like to ask the Minister that in dealing with properties which have to be sold by people, not because they want to but because they have to, to consider that advantage has been taken, and I want to stress the point that over R2 million, as I worked it out, has been lost. If you fix the basic value higher, it will not mean that the Government will have to oay more. I would suggest to the Minister that he go into this matter very seriously. I do not think the Government intentionally wants to cause hardship to these people. I realize that there must be some sort of basis upon which these properties have to be valued. But what I appeal for is a more realistic valuation of the property. I do not want to give examples. I dealt with many of these cases whilst I was still practising as an attorney and I want to say that it was a most unfortunate position. I have not been practising for some time, but the Minister will know whether I am right or wrong. I used to deal, on behalf of some of these people, with their properties on the basis of the basic valuation, given by sworn valuators, but when I appeared on appeal, who do you think the board of appeal was? They were the very valuators who valued the property. I do not know whether the position is still the same, but how could I possibly manage to persuade the person who valued the property that his valuation was wrong?</p>

<p>Some years ago. I therefore ask the Minister to view this question of basic value from a humane point of view. We are trying to help people who have to leave their homes. I also want to tell the Minister that at least it is our duty as legislators to be able to put the man in no worse position than he was at the time he had to leave his home. We should not put the man in a worse position than he was at the time when his property was declared an affected property. After all, if a man occupies a home of R5,000, surely he must be in a position to go to the other area where he has to go to live and be able to buy another home worth R5,000. and he should have sufficient money to be able to do so, But this has never happened, to my knowledge, that a man who has had to sell his property is able to get another one of more or less the same value, because the money he receives for his first house is far below the real value. I hope the Minister will give consideration to my amendment.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment moved by the hon. member for Boland. I regret to say that I do not think that that amendment serves any purpose whatsoever, because what he wants to include, namely the price which a willing purchaser would be prepared to pay a willing seller, is the market value, and the Bill does make provision for the determination of the market value. Therefore I do not think that the amendment serves any purpose. The hon. member wanted to intimate that in general the basic value was determined at too low a figure. He mentioned the example of cases in which he appeared after appeals had been lodged against the basic values, on which occasions he appeared before the same people who had made the valuations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that that has been changed now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is completely wrong. He was referring to an entirely different stage of valuation than the stage of appeal. What happens is that the valuators are appointed to determine a provisional basic value whereupon they notify the owners and inform them: We intend attaching such a value to your property and if you have any objection to that or any arguments to advance <span class="col_2037-2038" refersTo="page_1036"/>as to why you think that such a valuation ought to be different, you have so much time to inform us. In other words, that happens during the first process of determining the value and if the owner is still not satisfied after the valuators have determined the basic value, such an owner may lodge an appeal which is referred to a revision court and the members of that court are not the same persons. In other words, as far as procedure is concerned, there is sufficient opportunity to object firstly to the provisional valuation and then, if such objection is not upheld, to appeal to other persons.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the mere fact that R6 million was paid out in depreciation contributions was an indication that those people had lost R2 million. But that is not so, That is a result of the fact that the basic values in those very cases were determined to the advantage of the owners and that the valuators and the revision courts went out of their way to attach the highest possible value to those properties. The fact that a depreciation contribution is then paid, means that those properties cannot fetch on the open market that figure on which the basic value has been determined. The hon. member is shaking his head, but every owner has the right to sell his property on the open market and if he was able to obtain more than the basic value on the open market, he has up to now been able to retain one half of that appreciation. Now we want to change that so as to give him the full benefit of that appreciation. The fact that he receives less than the basic value is an indication that those properties cannot fetch their basic values on the open market.</p>

<p>No, its is not, because no person is forced to sell immediately or within a certain period. He may perhaps be forced to move within a certain period but he need not sell his property. He may remain the owner until the day he dies. He may await his opportunity to sell. There is no urgency about selling. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument that the sale is forced is quite wrong. The Department assists people who find themselves in this position to dispose of their properties as advantageously as possible.</p>

<p>But to come back to the amendment, it cannot achieve anything at all, because the clause as it reads at present provides that the basic value must be the market value. [Interjections.] The municipal valuation is usually lower than the market value. There may be exceptional cases where the municipal valuation of a property may be higher than its market value.

<p>As regards the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point, I think the hon. member will come to realize if he examines his own amendment very closely, that there is a risk that many persons may be adversely affected if his amendment were to be accepted, because he does not want the basic value to be determined on the day prior to the proclamation of the group area or on the basis of the value at that time; he wants it to be determined as on or after the date of proclamation. If one has a heterogeneous area in which Whites as well as non-Whites are living and the houses of the non-Whites are of an inferior quality, the value of those houses immediately drops to a figure lower than the face value of the houses when the area is declared a white area, because the houses may in actual fact be an encumbrance on the property. In other words, determining the basic value on or after proclamation may affect those people adversely, and it is for that very reason that we are effecting the amendment which we are effecting now, because as the clause read before it could happen that the valuator, in determining the basic value, took the market value of the land and the value of the building as it was on the date of valuation and that date usually was later than the basic date. The value of that building may then be less than it was prior to proclamation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point wants one to determine the market value of the land plus the market value of the building. The market value of the building, particularly in the case of non-Whites living in heterogeneous areas, is going to be less after proclamation, and that is the very thing we want to avoid here. The building can often be a limiting factor in the determination of the market value, and by means of this very amendment we want to give the owners the benefit of the building not being regarded as a limiting factor in the determination of the market value.</p>

<p>I think if the hon. member considered the matter carefully he will come to realize that his proposal will effect the very thing we are trying to avoid here. I think if the hon. member studied the proposed addition carefully, he will come to realize that this amendment will meet the position entirely. We say that the basic <span class="col_2039-2040" refersTo="page_1037"/>value may not exceed the market value and hon. members of the Opposition want us to provide that it will not be less than the market value. One could perhaps argue that point, but if one provides that it may not be less than the market value, one may be faced with the problem that people will neglect their properties altogether immediately after proclamation; it may create all sorts of problems and it is for the very reason to prevent that from happening that we prefer to phrase the clause in this way. I may tell hon. members that the Community Development Board and my Department feel after many years of experience that any possibility of doing anyone an injustice can be eliminated entirely by the amendment we are now proposing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the reply which the hon. the Minister has given me but I think we are arguing at cross purposes. The clause before us at the moment first of all says that the basic value of the land shall be the market value of that land immediately prior to the basic date. I should like the hon. the Minister to assume that we have two plots of the same size, one in District Six and one in Athlone. Obviously there will be a difference in the market value of the land. It is conceded that property in District Six is obviously more valuable than property in Athlone. Now we come to the second aspect of the basic valuation and that is that &#x201C;any building which is an affected property means the estimated cost of erection thereof&#x201D;. According to the definition as contained in this clause the value of a five-roomed building in District Six will be exactly the same as a five-roomed building in Athlone, if there has been the same depreciation. In other words, the difference in the value of the composite whole, that is to say, of the land and the building, in so far as District Six compared with Athlone is concerned, will merely be the difference in the land values, with no difference in the basic value of the buildings. Although the cost of erection of the two houses may be the same, their market value is affected by the location of those buildings. That is why paragraph (b) provides that the basic value of the building shall not in any case exceed the difference between the market value of the land immediately prior to the basic date and the market value which that land would have had immediately prior to the basic date if such building had not existed. I say that it should not be less than the market value of the whole. Under the clause as now drafted a property in Distrct Six will be valued at the value of the site and the cost of erection of the building only, and that cannot exceed the market value. I say that it should not be less than the market value in order to do justice to the person who is being moved out of an area such as District Six, which is near transport, which is in the middle of the City and which has a tremendous value for persons, particularly the poorer people, who want to live near their place of employment. I say with great respect that those people will not be covered by this clause as drafted at present. That is why I wish to have a minimum ceiling in the nature of the market value.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to take up a point raised by the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister said that the basic value might be adversely affected if it were taken the day after the basic date. Sir, we are spending a little bit of time on this clause because we have seen this Act in operation and I think the hon. the Minister will accept the fact that generally speaking the basic values have resulted in quite a big profit in the case of many property transactions. There are cases where losses are shown but I think in each of those cases there is a special reason. Sir, let us make our position quite clear to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister says that a disqualified person is not forced during his lifetime to sell; we accept that, but when once an area has been proclaimed for another group, the disqualified person has to get out some time or another. His object is to try to re-establish himself as soon as he can, The hon. the Minister says that a disqualified person is better off if the basic value is the value on the day before the basic date, but that does not always happen. You have examples of that here in Cape Town. I think Newlands, for example, is a fair example of the point I want to make. The basic value of Newlands&#x2019; properties which were previously occupied by Coloureds, was comparatively small on the day before the basic date because the houses were of no value; most of them had no bathrooms and no toilets or any of the facilities required by the White group that was going to move into the area, but when once a lot of these properties had become affected properties, they attained a value far in excess of the value that they had on the day before the basic date, and the proof of that is to-day&#x2019;s value of some of those properties. Properties which were sold for something like R2,000 are to-day being sold at R8,000 or more. The reason for that is that the value appreciated after the basic date. I believe that there are other areas in Cape Town where the same thing has happened. What we are trying to do is to ensure that the disqualified person has a share of the appreciation in the market value of the property. This appreciation must obviously take place in any area where you have a mixed community and where the area is proclaimed for occupation by the more well-to-do community. I think Newlands is the perfect example. You have other areas like Claremont and many other suburbs of Cape Town where the same thing is bound to happen. If the disqualified person could be given a value not less than the market value after the basic date he would get far more for his property and he would be far better able to re-establish himself in another area. That is why we are trying to ensure that he will get not less than the market value of his property. We realize that the full benefit of the appreciation will <span class="col_2041-2042" refersTo="page_1038"/>not accrue to him; we accept that you cannot give him the full appreciation but we want to try to get as near to it as possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I think hon. members still do not fully understand the problems. In point of fact, they envisage problems which will in future no longer exist as a result of this amendment. The hon. member for Umlazi argued here that they were motivated by the desire to give an unqualified person who has to be resettled the full benefit of the appreciation of his property, even after proclamation. In terms of other amendments effected by other clauses he will get that for a period of five years. Therefore his position is entirely met for the period of five years after the basic date or after proclamation. In other words, if the basic value of a property is R2,000 and an appreciation takes place the affected person may get R10,000 for that property if that is the market value of the property when he wants to sell at any stage within five years. In such a case he retains the full benefit of the appreciation. Provision is being made for a period of five years so as to encourage the person to dispose of his property at some time or other and to re-settle himself. Hon. members will agree with me that this is a major concession which did not exist in the past. Hon. members of the Opposition now want us to provide that the valuation may not be less than the market value, but if we do so, hon. members must remember that an area is proclaimed on a certain date and that it is quite impossible in practice to have valuators there the very next day to make valuations. Practical experience has taught us that it takes from six months to one year before valuators can get there&#x2014;at some places even a bit longer. What happens in the meantime is that the owner neglects his property altogether and virtually lets it go to ruin. If one still has to pay him not less than the basic value prior to that date, it means that we are actually placing a premium on the neglect of properties; that one simply allows owners to neglect their properties and to let those properties deteriorate. The result of that will be that the State will suffer losses. That is why we are inserting the provision that the valuation may not exceed the market value, i.e. to encourage those owners to maintain their buildings. If they do so, they have nothing to fear. If the market value increases over the period of five years they will receive the full benefit of that. After serious consideration I have therefore decided that it is in the interests of affected persons as well as the State to leave the clause unchanged.</p>

<p>For the sake of the record I should like to say that when the Minister says that people can keep their properties for five years, it should be remembered that it is only those people who are strong financially who can do so. Furthermore, has the hon. the Minister or his Department given consideration to deceased estates, particularly of Coloured people, where properties have to be sold in order for the estate to be closed off? If I may, I should like to give the hon. the Minister a little bit of advice. He should see that the racket that is going on is stopped and that the Government does not lose so much money. I want to give the hon. the Minister an example of what can happen in this respect. I had to do with an estate which had to be closed off. The property was sold by public auction. Well, people did turn up at that auction and formed a ring there. They realized that this property&#x2014;which belonged to a Coloured widow&#x2014;had to be sold. If I am not mistaken, the value of the property concerned was somewhere in the vicinity of R3,000 and yet the best offer that was made was for about R400&#x2014;for a property valued at R3,000! So they sold it for a couple of hundred rand and then went to the Government and got 80 per cent of the difference. Who benefited from that? The Government lost, the widow concerned lost but the people who bought the property made a fortune. I think the time has arrived where the Government should ask every purchaser of an affected property when he resells to declare the price of resale and to give good reasons why there was such a big profit and to give some of those profits back to the poor people who had to sell.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This clause deals, amongst other things, with urban renewals schemes. It provides that in certain events or eventualities subdivision and other such things may take place in these areas if the written consent of the board is first had and obtained. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an indication of what he is actually getting at here and how he is going to apply it. I want to refer to a classic example, namely Riverside in my own constituency. The hon. the Minister has cause to know a lot about this as I also raised it in this House last year. This scheme has been set out, but how long it is going to take before it can be put into operation is anybody&#x2019;s guess. How long it is going to be before the hon. the Minister can get sewerage, <i>inter alia</i>, there is anyone&#x2019;s guess. What I should like to ask the Minister is this:

</p>

<p><span class="col_2043-2044" refersTo="page_1039"/>What he obviously has in mind is certain property owners being allowed to buy back the property which they now own if that property can be fitted into the new urban renewal scheme. This is precisely what has happened in Riverside, as the hon. the Minister well knows. There are many people within my constituency who have been promised&#x2014;or as near to being promised as one can come&#x2014;that if their properties can be fitted into the scheme they will be allowed to buy it back. Of course, this is pure generosity and kindheartedness on the part of the persons concerned. It is appreciated, of course, that the Minister has to give his consent. However, there seems to be no plan yet of the Riverside area. In areas like this, areas which have been declared urban renewal scheme areas, such as Riverside for example, are the powers which the board is in future going to exercise (in other words, whether or not to allow subdivisions or alterations) to be exercised in conjunction with or in consultation with the other persons concerned? In the case of Riverside the adjoining area is the township Durban North. Consequently Durban North Estates are vitally affected because this is an area going up right next to it. So, if this board is going to exercise these powers of subdivision and alteration the owners of properties in Durban North are vitally affected by it. But let me say that they have never been consulted. I should like the hon. the Minister, therefore, to indicate (a) what he is getting at (b) whether he does not concede that this does affect any adjoining townships or landowners and (c) whether when these powers are exercised adjoining landowners will be consulted? I admit that Durban North is a special case&#x2014;it is a township with a special constitution, a model constitution and everything else. But regardless of this I should like to know whether the board does consult with organizations of ratepayers, the municipalities or with whatever body there might be&#x2014;for instance, a health committee or what have you&#x2014;before the board exercises these powers. Would the hon. the Minister give us some indication of what the position will be with regard to these aspects?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must look closely at the amendment we are effecting here. It only makes one addition to the existing provisions. The existing provisions are that no new buildings may be erected and that no alterations may be effected to buildings within a slum clearance scheme or an urban renewal scheme without the approval of the Board. The only thing which is now being added is that no subdivisions may be made without the approval of the Board either. The only object we want to achieve with this, is that the Board, which is engaged in the re-planning scheme, should at least know what is happening in that area, and that people will not unnecessarily start with a subdivision in that area which may not at all fit in with the Board&#x2019;s plans or scheme. It is merely to enable them to keep an eye on that and to bring it into line. It is merely an attempt to place matters on an equal footing.</p>

It is only in relation to subdivision and I agree that, if one is in charge of the planning of one big urban renewal area, one has to know what is going on. But the second part of my question the hon. the Minister has not answered. That is that he must concede that, in doing so. the Bill obviously provides here for the situation where the board will approve of alterations or subdivisions within that area, which will affect the adjoining property. Will the hon. the Minister give this Committee some assurance that the board, in exercising its powers, in allowing a subdivision or whatever else it can do under this particular section, will consult with either the town council, the ratepayers&#x2019; association or whatever board it is that represents the adjoining land owners, before permission is given for or withheld from an application under the powers which the board has applied.</p>

In the previous clause we have just passed we have accepted a re-definition of the term &#x201C;owner&#x201D; which brings the board itself into the category of an owner. The board itself, I take it, can own property in the area defined.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Oh! Well, that is all right. Then I accept that. But the board, of course, can own property in any case in an area that is going to be re-established or replanned. So the board obviously can give itself permission to subdivide. This was a danger we discussed in respect of the original Act. The hon. the Minister will remember that it was during the time of his predecessor. I want to raise this now, because it is important. I want the reassurance of this hon. Minister that in certain areas, such as those mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (North), it is not his intention to increase the density, because this is what he can do to a considerable degree in an area where people have bought and paid high prices for property on the understanding that the size of a stand shall not be reduced. There is a minimum size stand. Now, if the board itself under circumstances, perhaps having nothing whatsoever to do with clause 1, because of the exercising of its pre-emptive <span class="col_2045-2046" refersTo="page_1040"/>right in certain cases, for example the taking over or certain land for slum, clearance, which is dealt with in this paragraph, is going to give itself permission to subdivide, of course, the same effect will come about.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the fears of hon. members in this regard are entirely unfounded. It is obviously so that if a subdivision is allowed by the Community Development Board such a subdivision may affect persons on adjoining properties. But now hon. members must remember that the urban renewal scheme, or the slum clearance scheme, the resultant re-planning and along with that the subdivisions which fit into that scheme of replanning, are not drawn up by the Community Development Board. The Board is merely an instrument which negotiates with the local authority, the city council. The scheme is drawn up in consultation with the city council and subsequently goes to the townships board in Natal. It goes to the Township and Town Planning Commission. This is the body falling under the province. The scheme goes to them and they have to approve of the eventual planning and subdivision. Anybody who wishes to object to that may object to that body. If there are persons who object, and the Commission or the townships board nevertheless wants to proceed with their plans, an appeal may be made to the Administrator.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 3 provides three procedures to be followed in connection with defaults in respect of loans granted by the Community Development Board. The first procedure which is provided for under the section, is a short-circuiting or an avoiding of court proceedings by regaining possession of a property, without necessarily having obtained the judgment or an order of court. As the position stands, that is in conformity with a provision which already exists in the Housing Act. Although it may be criticized I do not wish to go any further than merely to mention the aspect of it. If one then proceeds to subsection (2), that provides that the board, having taken possession, can then, as the owner, arrange for the sale of the property by public auction or public tender without any further reference to the registered owner of that property. Under subsection (7), we see that when a property is sold under this procedure, the purchaser can be substituted as the mortgagor under the existing bond. The two procedures contained in subsections (2) and (7) run contrary to normal procedures of registration in the Deeds office. For that reason I have suggested in my amendment that the words should be inserted in both subsections in the appropriate place indicated, &#x201C;notwithstanding the provisions of the Deeds Registries Act, 1937&#x201D;. In other words, it is notwithstanding the provisions of the Deeds Registries Act, that this procedure is provided for in the Bill. Now we come to the final subsection, namely subsection (8). I want to make an urgent appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment which stands in my name, that is to say that this subsection (8) should be omitted from the Bill. It is clear that this subsection (8) will lead to another inroad into the Deeds Registries procedure as it exists in the Republic at the present time. If this happens that can well lead to a collapsing of a system which is, I think, without parallel in any part of the world. The hon. the Minister perhaps frivolously referred to avarice of the legal fraternity who would like to do the conveyancing but I think the matter is a little more serious than that. I think the hon. the Minister will appreciate that the position is a little more serious. If you have a system, the system should be adhered to, because when once there are exceptions, then there is the danger of that system collapsing completely.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister is well aware, the Minister of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure has appointed a committee to go into the whole question of deeds registry procedure to see whether or not it can be shortened, and I am sure that that report will not be so delayed that this subsection could not in the interim be deleted from the Bill under discussion. I also wish to inform the Minister that the amendment which I move has the support of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope, and I am sure it will also have the support of other societies if they are consulted in regard to this particular matter. I do move the amendment in all seriousness, Sir. I do believe that there is a possible danger to our system of deed registries, and for that reason I would appeal to him to delete this clause 8 until the committee appointed by the Minister of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure has reported on the procedure. I accordingly move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before dealing with the amendments moved by the hon. member, I myself should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2047-2048" refersTo="page_1041"/>In line 73, page 6, after &#x201C;Registrar&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;of Deeds&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is a mere formality because there is no definition of &#x201C;registrar&#x201D; in this measure and therefore the full designation must be used.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point, I want to point out to him that he is entirely wrong in saying that this is a new principle which is now being introduced into our procedure of registering deeds in this country. This procedure has been in existence since 1920. It was written into the Housing Act in 1920. Section 9 (4) of that Act reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The registrar of deeds concerned is hereby authorized to make the necessary entries in his register and sign any documents necessary to give effect to this section.</block>

<p>This regulation has been on our Statute Book since 1920, and since that time there has been general satisfaction in that regard. Apart from the fact that this does not introduce any new principle and apart from the fact that this does not encroach on existing practice, I want to point out to the hon. member the effect of his amendment in practice. In the first place there are not many cases of this type. Over the past three years under the Housing Act, under which many more cases are dealt with than will be dealt with under this legislation, there were only five cases in 1964, five cases in 1965, and only two cases in 1966. Therefore it is evident that very few cases fall under these categories&#x2014;merely a small handful. Now the hon. member wants this work to be done in the usual way by attorneys, etc., by people who normally do conveyancing. If that were to be allowed, it would mean that the very people who fall under the sub-economic groups under the lower income groups of our population, will have to pay more for that service. That will be the position if the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is accepted and if it has the effect which the hon. member has in mind. However, the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment will not even have that effect, because normally the State Attorney does the work of the State, in other words, the work will normally be done by a Government official in any event. Therefore the legal profession will really not gain anything by it. I really do not think that we, for the sake of prestige, should introduce these problems and the cumbersome procedure, because that is all this amendment means. Because this type of case has been dealt with satisfactorily since 1920, it is my opinion that we may continue to follow the same policy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister has the wrong approach altogether. The objection from this side of the House is not to the fact that attorneys will not be doing the conveyancing and thus be losing money. The objection is based on the fact that the hon. the Minister is departing from our recognized system of registration of deeds. That is what our objection is. We know that the principle was adopted as long ago as 1920. That aspect has been dealt with before. What we are concerned about is that it is spreading more and more. During the last two years this Government has extended that principle and it is adopting this system of registration by means of endorsement more and more. When we on this side of the House, and also hon. members on that side, especially the Deputy Minister of Finance, objected last year, we were then told by the Deputy Minister who handled that Bill that it would only be done in cases where the Government bought up huge tracts of land which could never be transferred again because they would become useless for private occupation. He referred to the Orange River scheme. He told us that that was why that system was being adopted at that time, and he assured us that that principle would not be extended any further.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I did, Sir, because the Minister had talked about the principle of registration by endorsement which had been accepted since 1920. It is a different system of registration. I want also to point out <span class="col_2049-2050" refersTo="page_1042"/>to the Minister that we were given the assurance last year that this system of registration would not spread any further. When the matter was raised again, the Minister of Lands asked us not to discuss the matter any further because he was appointing a committee, to which the hon. member for Green Point has now referred. All we ask the Minister is that in view of the fact that the whole question of the system of registration is being investigated by the committee, we ask him to accept the proposal that this subsection be deleted in the meantime until that committee has reported. Again I wish to stress that it is not merely because attorneys will be losing revenue, because, as the Minister himself has pointed out, the Government Attorney does the registration. It is the system of registration against which we wish to protect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say that I am disappointed at the reaction of the Minister and his attempt to suggest that the Law Society of the Cape was looking at this as a revenue-producing source for the members of the society. The Minister himself indicated that there was a total of 11 cases under the Housing Act over a period of some three years&#x2014;and I do not think any conveyancer will get very fat on that work, even were it to come to him. But the work is being done by the State Attorney. Our complaint is that we have a system which is well-nigh foolproof. Our system of deeds registry in this country is, I suggest, equal to any similar system in any other country in the world. As the hon. member for South Coast said, it has stood the test of time. The fact that in the Housing Act it was thought desirable to short-circuit, for a few cases, the system, does not make it good law to do so now. The hon. the Minister has not offered one single reason as to why subclause (8) should be here, other than that some draughtsman thought fit to put it in. There is no principle involved in subclause (8). It is a procedural matter on which we are legislating. I appeal to the Minister not to treat in the way he has the suggestion that it should be deleted, and that he should take cognizance of the fact that the legal profession and the country generally is jealous of its deeds registry and does not want to see something done which can break it down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members opposite should not get so excited about this matter. Let us consider this in a matter-of-fact way. They speak of a departure from an existing principle as regards the registration of deeds, but as far back as 1920 we already accepted the principle that when registrations of this nature have to be made, namely where the State provides housing, such registrations may be effected by way of an entry by the Registrar of Deeds. The only thing which is happening now, seeing that it has been decided that housing may be financed not only from the National Housing Fund but also from the Development Fund, is that the existing principle is being made applicable to another fund which is controlled by the same Department. Otherwise the same Department, seeing that it finances housing from two different funds, must use one method in one case and another method in the other case, and this can only lead to confusion. This really does not involve a new principle. It is merely as a result of the new provision in terms of which we now also provide housing for the lower income groups from the Development Fund, that we want to apply the same principle which has been laid down in respect of the Housing Fund. I repeat that this it not a new principle. In respect of housing, it is merely the application of one and the same principle by one and the same Department where it utilizes two funds for one and the same purpose.</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to explain what he hopes to achieve through this clause. It obviously refers to Asiatic land.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The original provisions which are now being deleted here do make provision for a complete list of all the Indian properties in all the various Transvaal cities and towns, while the new provision which we are now inserting here will make provision for a complete list of all the properties. Consequently this will only serve to eliminate confusion and a large quantity of additional work as well. It only makes provision for a more complete and better list to work with.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Can the Minister tell me whether the word &#x201C;repair&#x201D; has been deliberately left out, so that a man can repair his property but cannot alter or extend it? I ask this because of a case I had recently, where a man&#x2019;s affected property was destroyed by vandals. He then put it into what he thought was good repair, as any landlord would do, and when it came to the question of valuing the property he was told that he had to get the Department&#x2019;s consent before he could repair the property. Does it now mean that this man will not be prejudiced because the word <span class="col_2051-2052" refersTo="page_1043"/>&#x201C;repair&#x201D; is left out? Is it the Minister&#x2019;s intention that in those cases the man shall have the right to do it without reference to the board?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am not in favour of this clause because it removes subsection (4) and I think for your information, Sir, I should read it so that it will be clear exactly what this clause does. Section 32 (4) of the Act says that if the building referred to in subsections (1) or (2) has been erected, altered or extended, or improvements referred to in subsection (3) have been made without the approval of the board, the board may in its discretion direct that the basic value of the building or of the land in question, as the case may be, may be determined or redetermined, as the case may be, and recorded on the list as the basic value of that building or that land. In other words, as the Act is at the moment, if a man puts up any additions or alters the property or does anything that he really should not do, then the board has a discretion, if they are satisfied with his explanation, to have the property revalued, and the increased value added to the basic value. By the removal of subsection (4), this discretion is taken away from the board and the board can no longer use its discretion in having the basic valuation altered in deserving cases. This clause goes even further. It now makes it an offence to make these alterations without the written approval of the board. I do not know what explanation the Minister is going to give us for making this clause as harsh as it is now. He has now taken away the discretion of the board, so that the board cannot even meet hard&#x2014;luck cases where they have not in fact applied for permission beforehand. It also imposes a penalty of R 1,000 or two years or both. This, of course, is retrospective as from the 1st February. I think this is something for which the hon. the Minister will have to give us quite a good explanation before we are prepared to accept it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to say that the hon. member is not correct in saying that this clause will come into operation with retrospective effect from 1st February; this clause is not retrospective, but what is correct, however, is that if the owner of an affected property effects an improvement on the property or erects some other construction on it without the permission of the board, then the discretion of the board is taken away as far as the adjustment of the basic value of the property is concerned. But the hon. member must remember that a prohibition is being placed here on any alteration or extension of or addition to any building as it was at the time of the proclamation. This prohibition is necessary in order to combat the abuses which have begun to occur under the system. Cases occur&#x2014;and quite a number of cases have occurred since I have taken over this portfolio&#x2014;where the owners of affected properties deliberately and knowingly effected fairly large alterations and then came to the board pleading for an adjustment of the basic values. We are now prohibiting that; it cannot be done without the permission of the board, and in addition to that we are making provision for a penalty clause. If one does that, one cannot in addition leave a discretion to the board of adjusting the basic value where a person has committed an offence. The hon. member must realize that our problem is not the small man who effects a minor alteration; the problem arises where persons effect major alterations and erect large new constructions. That is what we want to prevent, but hardship cases may occur, as mentioned by the hon. member. Should such cases occur, the Act makes provision elsewhere for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to be made to such a person. <i>Ex gratia</i> payments may be made. In such difficult cases where a person has effected a small alteration and has satisfied the board that he did it unknowingly, we make use of the right which we have under the Act to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to him in order to compensate him for the alterations effected by him. But one cannot close a loophole and keep it open at the same time. As far as the hon. member for Boland is concerned, I just want to tell him that ordinary maintenance or repairs will not fall under this provision, but if a person effects a constructional alteration while making repairs, it will fall under this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>There is one aspect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation about which I am not very happy. The Board used to have the discretionary power to allow this to be added to the basic value or not. That discretionary power vested in the Board in terms of subsection (4). The hon. the Minister says that it is the big people who are giving him trouble in this regard. Let us assume that a big company added buildings to the value of R 10.000. If the Board refuse to allow this to be added to the basic value, the basic value would remain the same. If they sold this land and the building and recovered the whole of the additional R 10,000, they would have to pay the Board half of the appreciation, that is to say R5,000.</p>

<p>Yes, I accept all that. As the law stands at the moment, however, they would have to pay the Board half of the appreciated value of R 10.000, i.e. R5.000. so the penalty would be R5.000. I accept that the introduction of the five year period of grace might have some affect, but I am not so sure whether that justifies this change, and I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me what difference he believes it is going to make to the income of the Board in the case of companies. What are people going to gain by doing it? I do not think that they are going to gain much at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite right, but then subsection (4) of section 22, which is here being deleted, provides for the situation where in fact the alterations have been made without the Board&#x2019;s consent, and having regard to the hard&#x2014;luck circumstances under which this happens, they can have the property re&#x2014;valued. Why exlude that? Why not give the Board full power to negotiate an agreement with a big man or a small man, whether the improvements were made before or after? Sir, is this not really the only way in which you really satisfy anybody in terms of a provision such as this where property is virtually expropriated, where the ownership is taken away? If you can reach agreement then surely the affected person would be so much happier than he would be if the value of the property is determined according to some formula and the man does not get the price that he thinks he should get. Surely he would be much happier if you could go and talk to him and agree on the price. I hope that the hon. the Minister will reconsider whether this is really necessary and whether the same end cannot be achieved, whether agreement is reached or not, as would be achieved under subsection (4) of section 22.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>What hon. members apparently fail to understand, is that in terms of the Act as it reads at present, any affected person has to obtain the approval of the board to effect alterations. The Board can grant such approval and, if it does so, it has to adjust the basic value so as to make provision for those alterations. That is the position in the existing Act. All that subsection (4) really signified, was that if an affected person effected alterations without the approval of the board, such board could subsequently adjust the basic value or could refuse to do so. It may even refuse to adjust it. Unfortunately cases have occurred where affected persons knew that they would have to be resettled sooner or later and that removals would have to take place, and in spite of that they still effected alterations to their properties without the approval of the board. Then they plead hardship when a removal notice is served upon them. They plead hardship because hardship is the circumstance under which they may obtain a permit to remain where they are. They plead hardship because they supposedly did not know and consequently effected alterations which entailed greater losses to them. It is for that reason that we would rather incorporate this provision here in order that it may fit in with the whole trend so that it places these people under the obligation to obtain prior approval if they wish to effect alterations. Then they know that they may eventaully be compensated for them, and then they cannot subsequently cry over hardships and over expenses and submit other snags to the board. This provision is very necessary for the implementation of the Act. As I have been saying, if cases occur where there really is a case of hardship, where there really is a case where a person did not know about that, such people can be helped. But there is no reason for them not to know in future, because in all places where properties are affected, the owners are notified at the time of the valuation of such properties, and on that occasion they are told: &#x201C;Look, you may not effect alterations here.&#x201D; They know all these things. However, should there be a case where <i>bona fide</i> hardship was suffered, it can be rectified by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. Hon. members must take my word for it that real abuses did occur under this clause as it read before. We must try to rectify that. I do not want to menttion examples in the House&#x2014;hon. members will understand that.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to make one point. The hon. the Minister indicated to me when I was speaking that the fact that there is now a five&#x2014;year free period, is going to make a difference. I do not believe that it is going to make any difference at all because if there is no difference payable to the board during that five&#x2014;year period does it in fact matter to the board at all? If a man builds alterations and additions, he will have to have the approval of the local authority or the persons who control building in the area. Does it matter if he builds alterations and additions and sells the property for another R10,000 or not in the five&#x2014;year free period? Of course it does not make any difference at all to the board or the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>He might make an alteration to the building which would be entirely unsuitable for the race which must occupy that building.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has control of that in terms of other measures. If it is a slums clearance, he has control in terms of the Slums Clearance Act. The hon. the Minister is trying to make out that you can just erect a building anywhere without the permission of anybody. Of course <span class="col_2055-2056" refersTo="page_1045"/>that is not in fact true because if you erect a building in the area of a local authority, you must have the approval of the local authority. If a building is erected in the areas such as the hon. the Minister envisages here, you must have the approval of the hon. the Minister through his housing section, his slum section or his community development section so that the building cannot go up without the approval of somebody. That is obvious. I cannot erect a workshop on my property without the prior approval of the local authority. The chances of erecting a building therefore without approval are so slender that it is almost unbelievable. But let me return to this figure of R 10,000. If you put up a building for R 10,000 and it is sold during the first five years, the free years, it does not matter one iota to the hon. the Minister or the Department of Community Development whether that man gets his R 10,000 back or not because he is not going to pay anything anyway. It does not even matter if there is no basic value on the property for the first five years. It does not alter the position at all but when it does come into the picture is after the free period of five years when he has to pay an appreciation contribution. Here, in terms of the Act as it stands, the Minister has the final say because the board can allow a revaluation or refuse it in its discretion under subsection (4) which the hon. the Minister is omitting. This is my point. He has the discretion to allow that additional valuation to be included in the basic value or not. What happens if he allows it? If he allows it, it means that he adds a fair amount of the cost of erecting the building less depreciation to the basic value. That is final.</p>

<p>No, does it matter in legislation of this kind? It is the board which is given a discretion; it is not giving the discretion to the affected or disqualified person. He does not get the discretion; the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own board is getting the discretion. If this person does it in a manner of which the Minister of his department does not approve, obviously they do not condone the action. I am trying to work out why the hon. the Minister wants this alteration. I can see no reason for it. Let us assume that the board does not allow the extra amount to be included in the basic value. What happens then? It means that when it is resold, when the disqualified person disposes of the property, whether the board uses its pre-emptive right, or whether it is sold to a private individual, whatever extra amount he obtains because of that illegal building which has been erected on that property, the bulk of the extra price returns to the board, namely at least 50 per cent of it. The Minister therefore has complete control as the Act stands now. Why does he all of a sudden want to disturb that position, a position which favours him and over which he has complete control? Now he wants to disturb that and bring a penalty of R 1,000 or two years&#x2019; imprisonment into this Bill. I cannot see his reason for wanting to do this when he has, as I think I have proved quite conclusively to this House, complete control over the valuation of that property.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, whilst we are discussing this particular matter I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister the position, of which he is probably aware, in Cape Town particularly where the affected Coloured persons in certain areas of the city, for instance Newlands, are not getting the real benefit of the resale value of their properties. What is happening is that these affected persons are selling out at the amount they can get, and selling the properties as they are. Then the next owner effects repairs and alterations and sells the property at a very high profit. I wonder whether that procedure which adversely affects the Coloured people, either through ignorance or lack of finance, cannot be looked into in terms of the proposals of this particular provision. I should like to know whether this clause will cover for instance the Coloured Development Corporation in assisting to undertake what is necessary in the way of improvements and renovations and whether the board will give permission for these Coloured people to do that.</p>

<p>If it is possible it can be done in terms of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the clause as it stands simply by getting permission from the board. The only thing is that I do not want them to do anything without the permission of the board.</p>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that it seems that some of these affected persons are really losing out on their properties which are doubling in value with a very small amount being spent by the next owner.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to plead for the retention of the clause as it reads at present. In the first place, I want to agree with the Opposition where they are holding a brief for the occupiers and the owners of these properties. It is a fact, and it was mentioned in passing by one of the hon. members, that at times there is confusion among owners as to what they may do exactly. For reasons of health the local authority may order them to effect improvements. They effect those improvements, and once they have done so, they find that it is in conflict with another <span class="col_2057-2058" refersTo="page_1046"/>Act. Such things are being done in terms of health laws. It was evident that clarity had to be obtained in this respect. I am glad that we are now obtaining such clarity. The owner will not only know this, but will also have protection in that he will know that he cannot be forced by a local authority to effect improvements which will have to be effected illegally. This clause affords an owner protection against illegal action being taken by himself.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to bring this to the notice of the Opposition, and I also want to ask them to consider this, namely, that there are people in other population groups as well who know how to find loopholes in an Act. Unfortunately it is the bigger owners in particular who find those loopholes very easily. We have a process according to which we determine the value of properties. I can say that, because if I do not know about the circumstances in the Cape, I do at any rate know what is happening in the Transvaal. People are told that they will be moved from a particular area. On hearing this, those owners, or the big owners, as they were called a moment ago, usually take themselves off and, according to receipts, they cause building extensions to be effected at very great expense. When the time arrives for the payment of compensation, there is a long list of receipts showing what improvements have already been effected and what such a building costs at present. There is also a second method according to which one may plead that one should get a high valuation for one&#x2019;s property. I mentioned it during the Second Reading debate the other day. It happened in the Transvaal. I believe that it has also happened in other provinces. Some of the bigger owners wanted to have their valuations based on the net proceeds they derived from rentals. It is easy to add a room to a building without the permission of the board and to accommodate as many people as possible in that building on a temporary basis or for that five-year period, at any rate. When arbitration takes place, they can put forward a sound argument by saying: &#x201C;I have been receiving so much from this building in the form of rentals.&#x201D; If we take all human considerations into account, I want to ask that it should at least be admitted that these things do happen. It happened in the Transvaal that cases of this kind occurred in connection with the determination of valuations. I want to make a serious plea for retaining this clause as it reads at present for the purpose of affording protection to honest individuals and also to the interests of the State.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 50 and 51, to omit &#x201C;twenty-one&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;ninety&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The reason for this amendment is to try to restore to this Minister the discretion which he is taking away from himself. I do not know whether he does not trust himself any longer. Let me read the existing provision which he intends to amend. At the moment it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any notice under paragraph (a) &#x2026;</block>

<p>That has to do with valuations&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall contain an intimation that objections to the determination made by the valuators may be lodged with the Minister in writing within 21 days after the service of the notice, or within such further period as the Minister may, on application in any particular case allow.</block>

<p>In other words, this Minister in his wisdom, or in his predecessor&#x2019;s wisdom, had a discretion, where he could give an extension in cases which he thought were good, sincere and honest cases, to have a further period in which to appeal. Now he is taking away his own discretion, saying that he cannot extend it for more than another 21 days. In other words, the Minister does not allow himself to give more than 21 days. Obviously, and I think the hon. the Minister must agree, there have been cases that have arisen in the past under the existing provisions where he has felt justified, or his predecessor has felt justified to give more than 21 days&#x2019; extension under certain circumstances. I accept that they might be rare; they do not crop up every day. I am prepared to admit that, but is it not better that when such a deserving case does crop up, the hon. the Minister has the right to give an extension after the further 21 days&#x2019; extension or whatever period he decides to grant, than that the hon. the Minister should not have the legal right to give that further extension? To me it is foolish. It just indicates a hardening of approach for the sake of hardening, and not because there are any special demands. Surely the hon. the Minister has the ability to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, if he believes that they should not have a further extension, or is he so weak that his Department must say &#x201C;No, we are not going to allow you to extend this for more than 21 days&#x201D;. Can the Minister not make up his mind? I should like to remove this restriction altogether. I should like to restore it to its present position, but, under the circumstances, seeing that the Minister wants to place a limit on it for some reason that I do not understand, I am moving that, instead of having a limit of 21 days for which the Minister can give an extension, that period should be extended to 90 days. As I have said, I would rather that the hon. the Minister moved an amendment restoring the <i>status quo.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not married to this period of 21 days. All I want to secure is the principle that there should be a time limit in order that finality may be reached some time or other. If people are able to lodge objections and appeals for an unrestricted period, until such time as I have considered whether or not to condone the late objection, all the transactions in respect of which revision courts have been appointed will be static because they will first have to wait for them. The sole reason why I am doing this is not to protect myself, but to protect the other owners in that area in order that they may achieve finality as soon as possible. Those are the people I am thinking of. I am not married to 21 days. Personally I think it is long enough if a man has to lodge his objection within 21 days, but then receives a further 21 days&#x2019; grace. I do not know why the hon. member wants to allow him 90 days. In order to meet the hon. member for Houghton, let us make it 60 days, so that we may get away from 90 or 180 days. If the hon. member is satisfied with that, I am prepared to make it 60 days. That is fair and that is more or less how long it takes us to have the revision courts appointed, etc. I therefore want to move&#x2014;</p>

Therefore, Sir, he should take some notice of what we have learned during our years of experience. The Minister is being very helpful, but he must understand that there are times when even these periods are, through force of circumstances, not sufficient.

<p>Mr. Chairman, with due respect, I am not making a debate out of nothing. I am pleading for those people who cannot comply with this period of 60 days because of circumstances. I want the hon. the Minister to have power to extend that time on good cause shown, with no limit. If a person says to him that he was in hospital, he was ill, he was overseas or somewhere else, that he did not receive his notice and has not been able to comply, surely he should not be prejudiced because the law says that he should act within a certain period. I want the Minister to have power to extend the period. I therefore move the following amendment to the amendment proposed by the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;</p>

<p>That will give the Minister his sixty days, but if a deserving case comes forward the Minister should still have a discretion. If we do not have something of that nature, people will be completely estopped. It does not matter if there is no appeal. The Minister will say that that is the law. The Minister&#x2014;I am not trying to flatter him&#x2014;has indicated that he has some sympathy for people who find themselves in this position.

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the Minister would dilate on the reason he gave to the hon. member for Umlazi and the hon. member for Boland, namely that he needed to restrict the period within which objections to the provisional valuation could be lodged because he wanted to protect&#x2014;&#x201C;beskerm&#x201D;&#x2014;the other owners in the affected area. I do not understand how the hon. the Minister is going to protect other people. If someone receives a notice he knows</p>

<p>39&#x2014;A.H. Vol. 1.</p>

<p>he should object within a certain period. He also knows that the Minister has a discretion to allow him to object thereafter if he can give good reasons why. Each individual property in the affected area fails to have a basic value allotted to it. Some people object in good time, whilst other people, for various reasons, cannot. One assumes that each property is assessed on its merit. The officials do not say that in a whole block each property is worth a certain sum. Each separate property is a different proposition. So each single property has to be determined separately. How does the Minister protect the other owners in that area if he restricts the right of some people who, because of circumstances beyond their control, or for whatever reasons they may have, object later than the other people? The test is the same. The value has to be determined at a certain date, individually, in respect of each property. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to this Committee just how it is that he is actually protecting the other property-owners. I am afraid that I do not quite understand that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, surely the matter is quite clear, if only the hon. member were acquainted with the procedure followed. If objections to the basic valuations are lodged within the period of 21 days, the revision court is appointed and then has to arrange sessions. At its sessions this court must take into consideration how many of the owners were satisfied with the basic valuations and how many were dissatisfied. The court must know that. It goes without saying that the judgment of the court is influenced by the percentage people in an area who indicate that they are dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Why must the court determine how many people are dissatisfied if it applies its mind only to the one valuation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The reason is obvious. It may be that the valuation of a single property was incorrect and has to be carried out again. It may also be that purely because the majority of the owners in an area lodge objections, the court may come to the conclusion that the valuators had initially placed a totally wrong value on the entire area. It is therefore important to know how many people object. It is therefore important that before the court commences its sessions it should know how many object, in order to have the full picture before it. Surely it is clear that it is in the interests of those people to know to what extent the standards applied by the valuators caused general satisfaction or otherwise. Surely that is also important. Of course valuation is always a subjective matter. It is a person who has to judge, and no two persons always correspond fully in their judgments. <span class="col_2063-2064" refersTo="page_1049"/>There are always differences of opinion in that respect. Therefore, Sir, the more comprehensive the picture obtained of people&#x2019;s ideas on values, the better.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I really cannot follow the Minister&#x2019;s reasoning. The position according to the Act, which the Minister took great pains to explain to us earlier this afternoon, is that valuators are appointed and they determine provisional basic values to which an objection can be lodged. This must be lodged by a dissatisfied owner who feels that that provisional basic value does not conform to the Act. Then the 21 days aspect comes up again. If that preliminary objection is over-ruled then he must note an appeal within 21 days. It certainly startles me to hear this afternoon that an independent reviewing court, which is established in terms of the Act, is influenced in any way at all by the number of objections that come in. Where in this Act is there any mention that the court should take into consideration, or that the valuators appointed by the department should take into consideration, the number of objections? Does it mean that there is so much of a hit-and-miss element present when the provisional basic values are determined that they wait for the reaction? Do they wait to see whether it is a &#x201C;raakskoot&#x201D; or whether they have gone wide? Do they wait to see whether people are satisfied or not? I think it is a most extraordinary thing if the hon. the Minister really feels that this 21-day limitation or a 60-day limitation is there so that a general feeling of the public reaction can be obtained. That, Sir, that is not the basis of valuation in terms of this Act, as we are amending it, nor does the provision of 21 days refer to any such reaction.</p>

</speech>

<p>Amendment put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause, as we have already indicated to the hon. the Minister, is an improvement in that it gives certain opportunities to an owner of an affected property to sell within a limited period of time, that is within five years, without having to be penalized as regards a contribution for any excess which he might obtain compared to the basic value. During the Second Reading Debate I did suggest to the Minister that there were two prerequisites for this clause to be effective. The one was that there would be no change in the zoning of the erven of an affected township by the board or under the Act, and the second was that the Community Development Board would not use its pre-emptive right to the detriment of purchases and sales under this Act. The Minister took it upon himself to read me a little homily on what I had raised. He made two statements. He said that I had said that the board rezoned an area. What I said, had the Minister listened to my speech when I spoke, was &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member is now referring to the Second Reading Debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am dealing with the period for sale, and submit that if there is or may be a rezoning, this clause, as it now reads, may need amendment. I indicated to the Minister that I would deal with these matters during the Committee Stage. I told him that I, and the whole country, should like to have an assurance from him. I did not say that rezoning had been done&#x2014;I am aware of the provisions of the Act. If the Minister will give that assurance, the proposed amendment here will fall away because then it is not necessary.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second point, and that is in regard to the exercise of a pre-emptive right which the Community Development Board has, and which, if exercised, will adversely affect what should be a benefit according to the White Paper for the owner of the affected property. The Minister there suggested that this normal sale on the market over the five-year period would only be interfered with where the property is going to be sold for less than the basic value. The property will then be bought for that amount and the depreciation contribution paid to the seller. In other words, the board protects the State against having to pay a depreciation figure to the seller of the property. The Minister said that I had made incorrect statements. I want to say to the Minister that if this pre-emptive right is going to be exercised in the way in which I said it was exercised and which the Minister said was an incorrect statement, then it negatives the whole value of this particular clause. This clause will have to be amended so as to exclude sales, within the five-year period, from the provisions of section 30 of the Act, i.e. that the pre-emptive right should be abandoned or should not apply.</p>

<p>The incorrect statement which, according to the Minister, I made, was based on a case which I quoted to him. I now have the title deeds and documents here. In this case the price by the owner to a coloured person had been fixed between them by agreement at R7,000. No basic value had been fixed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I never said that that was an incorrect statement. I was referring to the other argument you used.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept that the Minister meant that something else I said was incorrect. If he tells me what it is, I will give him the correct facts. But this case does not accord to the policy statement which the Minister gave to the House. The board then exercised the pre-emptive right and <span class="col_2065-2066" refersTo="page_1050"/>it purchased for R7,000. Afterwards the valuators fixed the basic value at R6,900. The result was that the seller to the board made himself an appreciation of R100 and he had to split it 50-50 with the board. The board took R50 and the seller kept R50. And then what did the board do? Having purchased at R7,000 it then offered the property for sale by advertisement in the papers by tender, the property which it had valued at R6,900 and which it had purchased for R7,000 under a pre-emptive right, at an upset price of R7,500. Eventually, according to the transfer documents which I have here, the property was sold by the board to a coloured owner for R8,000. The result was not what the Minister indicated the effect of this clause would be and which was the policy of his department. The result was that the coloured man paid R 1,000 more for the property, the owner received what he was prepared originally to sell for, less R50, whilst the State made a nett profit of something like R800 after payment of transfer costs of the intervening transfers.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister, in order to give effect to this clause as it is now in this Bill, whether he will give an assurance that the board will not excercise its pre-emptive right under section 30 to the detriment of owners and purchasers of the other group who wish to settle their matters and conclude a sale on the basis as it is now. I do not want to give the names across the floor of the House, but I will give the Minister the details of this case. I want to say to the Minister that when I refer to cases I do attempt to have the facts and documents to substantiate what I say&#x2014;I do not take a &#x201C;flyer&#x201D; if I may put it that way. This has in fact happened. If this is but an isolated case and the Minister can tell me that, I think it can put our minds at rest. It is a case that has happened and which has caused some concern over this amendment to the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall go into the particular case raised by the hon. member and we can discuss it again on a subsequent occasion. I do not think it is necessary for us to discuss the matter in connection with this clause, because the pre-emptive right of the Department is normally exercised in cases where properties are sold at less than their basic values. In the case referred to by the hon. member a pre-emptive right had been exercised before a basic value had been determined. The basic value which was subsequently determined could be determined only by way of agreement between the person concerned and the Development Board. It could not be determined in any other way. But in cases where the basic values have already been determined and where a person may benefit by selling his property for more than the basic value the board will not exercise its pre-emptive right unless it needs that area for re-planning purposes. In that case the board exercises its pre-emptive right at the price the seller can get on the open market, if that price exceeds the basic value.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, these cases do happen, and I thank the hon. the Minister for the statement he has made. I thank him for clearing the air. I thank the Minister for his statement as to policy, but under that policy this clause does have the effect which I have detailed.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not against this clause, but I do want it recorded that I feel that the delegation of power in a matter such as this is a very serious matter. We on this side of the House watch these delegations very carefully indeed. We do not like them, because we believe that a Minister is appointed to apply himself as a reponsible person to the tasks allotted to him. We find that this clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided further that the Minister may delegate to the Secretary, to the extent he deems fit, the power conferred on him by this section to approve of the acquisition by the board by expropriation of any immovable property, and anything done by the Secretary under and within the scope of the power so delegated to him, shall be just as valid and effective as if it had been done by the Minister himself.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the Minister does something with which we do not agree, we can criticize him in this House. But in the case of a Secretary, it is not quite so easy for us to do that.</p>

<p>We will go for the Minister. Let there be no doubt about that. But nevertheless we believe it not to be the right thing to delegate these powers. Very often there are circumstances which preclude us possibly from discussing the full facts of the case. I do not know why the hon. the Minister cannot exercise these powers himself, in the same way as the Secretary has functions to perform. I want it placed on record that we on this side do not like these delegated powers and we will always let the Minister know that we do not like them. That is why I stand up now to tell him that we do not like this delegation.</p>

<p>May I ask the Minister, Sir, why it is that he now wants the power to delegate to the Secretary, to the extent he deems fit, the power conferred on him by section 38? This concerns the acquisition of immovable property by the board by agreement or expropriation. The only thing that remains in relation to this Act, the most important thing, surely is the expropriation of land or the acquisition by the board or by his department of land under this Act. What we want to know is why does the Minister want to delegate his powers? These are important powers. The hon. member for Umlazi has told the Minister that we on this side do not like him delegating such important powers, and he told him why. Therefore, Sir, I hope that we are going to have an answer from the Minister to that, an answer which he was not going to give, had I not stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I may just point out that I gave a very clear exposition of this particular matter during the Second Reading Debate. I said then that I would delegate powers only in respect of specific kinds of cases or in respect of a specific place. The clause reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided further that the Minister may delegate to the Secretary, to the extent he deems fit, the power conferred on him by this section to approve of the acquisition by the board by expropriation of any immovable property.</block>

<p>The important words are: &#x201C;to the extent he deems fit&#x201D;. In other words, Sir, I have to define the delegation of powers. Let me quote hon. members an example. Almost every day cases are submitted to me where the owners, the municipality and also the Community Development Board all agree that a certain property has to be expropriated. Sometimes owners are heirs, and then protracted court procedures have to be followed in order to obtain leave from the court to the effect that it will be in everybody&#x2019;s interest that some property or other should be expropriated. Although everybody agrees, the cases still have to be submitted to me for my personal signature. I think that is quite unnecessary. It is purely an administrative matter, and I intend delegating this function to the Secretary in such cases in which all the parties agree. We may also have the case where the Community Development Board submits a recommendation to me to the effect that a particular area should be acquired with a view to slum clearance or for re-planning purposes or something of that nature. Then they negotiate with the owners. Agreement is reached with 90 per cent of the owners, or even with 99 per cent of them. There are only a few with whom agreement cannot be reached. Later I have to approve the individual expropriations again, whereas I have already given my permission for those properties to be acquired, whether through negotiation or expropriation. I shall prefer to delegate such cases to the Secretary.</p>
