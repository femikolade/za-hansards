<p>In terms of Standing Order No. 68, I intimate that the debate on the third reading of the Bill will be extended to three hours, excluding the reply of the hon. the Minister in charge.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>At this final stage of the journey of the Bill through the House it is customary to deal with the historical background of the Bill and its passage through the House. There are two items in the debate I should like to refer to in order to clear up any misunderstandings that may have arisen. The first is a reference that the hon. member for Randfontein made during the second reading. He seemed to be under a wrong impression about what my attitude had been when the Bantu Education Bill passed through this House in 1953. He said that in this debate I had contradicted myself and that my attitude had changed; he said that was because the Party whip had cracked and I was now toeing the line. He did not use the words &#x201C;toeing the line&#x201D;, but that was the meaning of what he said.</p>

<p>I should like to compare the two Bills we have had. In this Bill we have an attempt to create a national policy in education for White children. We did not like the Bill because we thought it was a bad Bill. We thought it conferred upon the hon. the Minister autocratic powers, and therefore we moved that the Bill be read this day six months. In other words, we rejected the Bill. Now, what did we do in 1953 with the Bantu Education Bill? We rejected that Bill as well. We suggested that co-ordination should be the first stage in creating a Bantu policy in education. I had the honour then to speak in that debate and to vote for the rejection of the Bill, because we moved that the Bill be read this day six months. In other words, my attitude then and now is exactly the same. The hon. member for Randfontein has followed the old device of taking two or three sentences from their context. In this case they were sentences taken from the early stages of a 40-minute speech, and then he made deductions which are quite unjustified. Unless one is prepared to say how the rest of the speech developed and how the speaker voted, I think it is a case of <i>suppressio veri.</i> I think that is most unfortunate.</p>

<p>My second point is this. I should like to refer to a statement the Minister made in his reply to the second reading debate. He was referring to my hon. colleague, the hon. member for South Coast and a statement he had made. The hon. the Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As hy vir my op hierdie stadium enige Engelssprekende kind in die hele Republiek van Suid-Afrika kan bring wat nie reg behandel is nie en wat gedwing is deur die Nasionale Provinsiale Rade soos di√© van Transvaal, die Vrystaat en Kaapland om deur medium van Afrikaans sy klasse te neem, is ek gewillig om hierdie wetsontwerp onmiddellik terug te trek.</block>

<p>Now, it is a coincidence that while he was making that speech a statement was being <span class="col_2253-2254" refersTo="page_1144"/>made in the Free State by the Chief Inspector of Free State Education. This is the report It is a SAPA report which appeared in more than one newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Chief Inspector of the Free State Education Department, Mr. M. C. Botha, said in a statement yesterday that the Department regretted that it could not write or have books written for its schools. He was commenting on a report that the parents of more than 30 pupils in the English section of a parallel-medium school in the Std. 6 class in Kroonstad were upset because their children were compelled to learn from Afrikaans textbooks because these books had not yet been translated. &#x201C;The English version of the textbooks,&#x201D; said Mr. Botha, &#x201C;would not be available for at least 18 months and teachers and pupils had to do the translation page by page.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The R50,000 question, of course, is whether the Minister is going to withdraw the Bill. But I should like to add that I do not make hasty deductions from his statement. I think perhaps the hon. the Minister made a hasty declaration, because anyone who is familiar with the organization of an education department, realizes that there will occasionally be incidents of this kind. I cannot think of instances where there has been an 18-months delay but these things can happen, and if hon. members accept what I say, that this can happen in the ordinary organization of an education department, why then do they attack Natal as they do if there is an isolated instance here and there of a child who is perhaps not in the right class?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have an assistant at the back here who is assisting me in my speech. I am very grateful to him but I should like him to come in later.</p>

<p>The next point I wish to make is in regard to the historical background. When in 1962 we established an advisory council for education, the hon. the Minister himself&#x2014;not through the council but he himself&#x2014;fired the first shot in his inaugural address&#x2014;a very important occasion&#x2014;as Chancellor of the Potchefstroom University. According to a Press report he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of the divided control over education in South Africa the youth at school, which was now being controlled by five departments, was not developing a national character.</block>

<p>Sir, in this debate we have heard a great deal about &#x201C;national character&#x201D;. Is it suggested that there is no South African national character? Is it suggested that a young country that has fought in two world wars, with subversive influences at home, has no national character? Any person who has served in the South African forces knows there is a very strong national character, and it is not confined to one section of the population. Make no mistake about that. Afrikaans-and English-speaking young men fought together as South Africans; they have fought in foreign countries as South Africans, and they have given a tone to our national character. Who can say there is no South African national character? It is quite absurd to say you need an Act of Parliament in order to develop and cultivate a national character in South Africa. We have all that. Is there any difference between the national character in the Transvaal and the Free State or between the national character of the Cape and Natal, or the Cape and the Transvaal? Surely we have a national character. In addition to that, our systems of education are coming more and more closely together, even without a Bill of this kind. We do not need a Bill of this kind, because the process is taking place in spite of the policy of the Government of deliberately dividing the children in the schools. I gave the example of the Van der Bijl School. It is a great tragedy that we did that, Sir, because when the Union of South Africa was established, the delegates appointed a committee immediately to advise on how they would handle education seeing they had a provincial system and that education would now come under the provinces. They wanted to have co-ordination. They appointed the Beyers Commission and that commission gave them a basis of co-ordination. Great South Africans have endorsed that basis of co-ordination and they have continued to endorse it. I will give the name of one great South African who endorsed it. He did so in this House. He said in a debate in this House in 1944 exactly what he thought about it. That great South African was Dr. Malan. This is an extract from his speech in that famous 1944 debate on a private motion introduced by Mr. C. R. Swart and seconded by Mr. Strijdom. Talking about the Beyers Commission Dr. Malan said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Met ander woorde, of die ouer sy kind wil laat leer deur medium van sy moedertaal vandat die kind in die skool kom totdat hy die skool verlaat, dit is &#x2019;n saak waaroor die ouer self moet besluit. Dit is wat die Parlement besluit het.</block>

<p>Sir, that is a straightforward statement. Then there is another ex-Minister who distinguished himself in this House, Mr. Serfontein. This is what he had to say when he took part in the <span class="col_2255-2256" refersTo="page_1145"/>same debate; I have the English translation here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And what did that commission recommend? The basis of the commission&#x2019;s recommendations was this: You must recognize the parent&#x2019;s right to choose for himself.</block>

<p>And later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That commission clearly recommended that in order to avoid bitterness we should wherever possible leave the decision to the local bodies and to the parents.</block>

<p>In other words, that was the South African system. Why the hon. the Minister should say at this stage that he wants to develop a national sentiment, a national character in South Africa, I cannot understand. Sir, from 1962 until this Bill was introduced, we have asked for information. We have had two annual reports, one from the Department which, as I have said on earlier occasions, appears early&#x2014;and we are grateful for that&#x2014;and the other from the advisory committee. In the reports of the advisory committee there could be nothing definite because they were not allowed to make a report in their advice. I understand that they make confidential reports. It is difficult to see why they made any general report if all their reports to the Minister were confidential. However, they have submitted their reports and we have read them. Right throughout there has been what I have called this veil of secrecy, and then the time came for the hon. the Minister to introduce his bill into this House. Well, Sir, without disclosing the contents, without giving the country an opportunity to study its provisions the bill was introduced and rushed through the House. The hon. the Minister was rather like this play we have been having. Macbeth before the murder:</p>

<block name="quote">If it were done when &#x2019;tis done, then &#x2019;twere well</block>

<block name="quote">It were done quickly;</block>

<p>In that spirit he has rushed the Bill through this House and intends to take it further in the same spirit. I think it is grossly unfair to the people of this country, to the people who are interested in education. I do not want to quote telegrams; I have received many letters and telegrams. I want to quote one statement only from the oldest council of education in the Transvaal, a council established in the nineties of last century, the Council of Education. The hon. the Minister is naturally familiar with it. This is what they said in their report; they sent me this copy of their general Statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Council of Education, Witwatersrand, urges that time be given for quiet study of national education Policy Bill which only received here &#x2026;</block>

<p>This message is dated the 23rd February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; only received here by subscribers to <i>Government Gazette</i> on Monday, 20th February, and still not easily available in Johannesburg. It is wrong that interested parties should be forced to depend on newspaper summaries which inevitably have some bias for news value or politics. Remote areas simply have not had a chance to read Bill let alone prepare any considered comment.</block>

<p>I think that expresses the general feeling.</p>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is scandalous.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I would not go so far as to say it is scandalous but what I will say is that it is a travesty of democratic government. People must see what is happening. Not only must they know what is being debated here, they must know what is to be debated in order that they may follow the reports.</p>

<p>Sir, my next point is this: Throughout this debate we have heard it stated that every country has a national policy in education. Hon. members have spoken about the United States of America. The U.S.A. is a federation. They have State policies in education. You cannot compare them with South Africa. But then hon. members said: &#x201C;What about the United Kingdom; what about their national policy?&#x201D; There is no national policy in education for the United Kingdom. Hon. members do not understand the position. What is the United Kingdom? It is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Scotland has a system of education of its own. Two hundred years ago the two greatest developed countries in Europe as far as education was concerned were Prussia and Scotland. The Scottish system is not the English system; it is something completely different. Northern Ireland does not fall under the English Bill, the Butler Bill of 1944. Butler, who was Minister of Education, introduced a Bill in 1944 for England and Wales. He had two advisory bodies, one for England and one for Wales. If we wish to compare ourselves with the United Kingdom, we shall have independent provinces and two advisory bodies, one for Afrikaans medium schools and one for English medium schools.</p>

<p>And one for Natal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, possibly Natal could develop in the same way as Scotland and have its own system. If the hon. member here suggests it, I will give it very careful consideration. The next point is what we have heard such a great deal about in this debate, namely the importance of the home language as a compulsory medium of instruction. I cannot get emotional about this. I know that emotions are aroused. We taught the children to sing &#x201C;O moedertaal jou het ek lief bo alles&#x201D;. We know that and we all understand it. Naturally a child should be educated through his <span class="col_2257-2258" refersTo="page_1146"/>home language. If he has more than one home language, the parents will say: This is the one I choose. An hon. member said here that there are no people with two home languages.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, there are no people with two mother tongues.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, or mother tongues. The hon. member behind me is a Transvaler. We do not speak of &#x201C;moedertaalonderwys&#x201D; in the Transvaal. We speak of &#x201C;home language instruction&#x201D;. That is what our Act says. In the Transvaal this is how they interpreted it: They said that when a child goes to school, he will be educated through his home language. If there is any doubt as to which is the home language, the parents&#x2019; decision shall be final and will be recorded. That was the law of the Transvaal. Then the Nationalist Government gave us the testing system, to test a bilingual child to see which of the languages he knows better. I think it is quite absurd. Natal interpreted it differently. Instead of asking what the home language was and making them sign and so on, they said to the parents: Choose your home language. Choose what language you want. I see no great difference between that and the old Transvaal system. I cannot see why people can enter into a heated argument about this subject. There is no difference. It is what Dr. Malan said and what Mr. Serfontein said, namely that the parent will decide. That is what the Beyers Commission said. I shall not waste any more time over this matter.</p>

<p>I think the worst feature of this Bill has been, as I have mentioned at another stage of the debate, that through this direction from above, we have destroyed the only system of local government we have in South Africa, the provincial system. There are people who argue that we should not have a provincial system. There is something to be said for that, but then you must substitute another system of local government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>The Bill does not destroy this system.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me explain to the hon. Chief Whip. I see his point. It has often been suggested, for example, that in the Transvaal there should be two sections, namely the Witwatersrand and then the outside section, much the same as they have done in regard to Bantu education. They have divided the country up in that way. That has been suggested as a new system of local government, but we do not have that. All we have now is a provincial system and I say that under this Bill it is being destroyed and nothing is being substituted in its place. I think that is most regrettable.</p>

<p>Now I come to this Bill itself. Why could we not have had a constructive effort to adopt a Bill which would be acceptable to the people of South Africa? If one introduces a national policy Bill for education, it is perfectly obvious that the Bill itself should lay down in its clauses what the policy is and the details of how it is to be carried out. In this Bill which will now become law the whole matter is left to the discretion of the Minister who has told us that there are certain guiding principles. There is confusion about the meaning of the word &#x201C;principle&#x201D;. I am not speaking of the principle of the Bill. I am speaking of the Minister&#x2019;s guiding principles under clause 2. All we have done is to state these vague guiding principles and we have not laid down any details. I have no doubt that other hon. members will go into aspects of the Bill which I have not dealt with. I am very disappointed with this Bill. When we met in select committee in 1962 we worked very hard. We heard evidence from all over the country. We had high hopes of a good Bill which we could all support. I can only at this stage, as this Bill is passing through this House, register my deep disappointment with the Bill the hon. the Minister has forced through and in regard to which he has refused to accept any reasonable amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now that the principle of the Bill has been accepted, it is perhaps desirable to consider what results the introduction of this Bill has had and what its effects will be. In the first place, it is striking that there was a large degree of agreement amongst educationists&#x2014;on an educational level&#x2014;about the principles included in this Bill while negotiations in regard to this Bill were in progress until, round about November last year, a tremendous political campaign was launched against this Bill. There are a few aspects of that phenomenon which I should like to examine. The hon. member for Kensington has just once again spoken of a national character which ostensibly it was not necessary to include in this Bill, because, as he said, the children of South Africa already had a national character. That, indeed, is no reason why it may not be laid down in the Bill that the general policy of education shall have a national character. Is it not a fact that South Africa as a whole also has a Christian character and that, in view of that Christian character which South Africa has as a country, it was once again laid down in 1961 in the Constitution of the Republic that South Africa has a Christian character? If something is already in existence, that surely is no reason why that may not be reconfirmed in legislation. The hon. member for Kensington referred to the attempt being made by this Bill to bring about a division between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking children. That statement simply is not true. In this Bill there is no attempt to bring about a division between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking persons. Educationists throughout the world accept, and there is no need to quote their statements once more, that from an educational point of view it is best for children to be instructed through the medium of their mother tongue. In South Africa we have attempted to maintain schools on the basis of different policies.</p>

<p><span class="col_2259-2260" refersTo="page_1147"/>In the forties there was an attempt to introduce dual medium education. That obviously resulted in a failure. Consequently there remains the system which is at present used in all schools throughout the country, namely either single-medium schools or parallel-medium schools. In the case of parallel-medium schools children of both language groups may attend one school but they are instructed in their mother tongue. The hon. member for Kensington insinuated, however, as other members also did, that this Bill was aimed at dividing the children of the two language groups and was withholding from them the opportunity of coming into contact with each other in the schools. We have the position that we also have a number of parallel-medium schools in Natal just as we have in the other provinces. Indeed, there is not a single province where there are no parallel-medium schools. I may just mention that according to the latest figures at my disposal there are 174 parallel-medium schools in the Transvaal. What is interesting, is an analysis of the figures of the number of children who attend those schools. In the Transvaal 8,407 English-speaking children attend parallel-medium schools whereas there is a total number of 106,607 English-speaking children in the Transvaal schools. Of that number only 8,407 attend parallel-medium schools. Therefore, only 8 per cent of the grand total attend parallel-medium schools. But what is the position as regards Afrikaans-speaking children in the Transvaal? Altogether there are 256,219 children. Of that number 51,780 attend parallel-medium schools, with parallel-medium classes. That gives one 20 per cent, as against 80 per cent, attending single-medium schools whereas 92 per cent of the English-speaking children attend single-medium schools in the Transvaal. Let us examine the position in Natal. I have the figures of the actual number of children in parallel-medium schools and single-medium schools according to official information of the Provincial Secretary who released the figures by order of the Executive Committee in a letter dated 15th January, 1967. Out of a total number of 53,017 English-speaking children, 14,163 attend parallel-medium schools, i.e. 30 per cent as against 70 per cent who attend single-medium English schools. The position in regard to Afrikaans-speaking children in Natal is that out of a total of 20,138&#x2014;this figure only relates to Afrikaans-speaking children in Afrikaans-medium classes and does not include those who are in English-medium classes&#x2014;11,638 are in parallel-medium classes&#x2014;that is, 57&#x00BD; per cent.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall quote further figures which may satisfy the hon. member for Durban (Point). I shall now quote the figures in respect of the schools in Natal. Out of a total number of 48 high schools, 19 are in Durban. There are four single-medium Afrikaans schools, 15 single-medium English schools and not a single parallel-medium high school in Durban. In Pietermaritzburg the position is as follows: Two Afrikaans-medium high schools, five English-medium high schools and not a single parallel-medium high school. In the rest of Natal, in the rural areas, it is impracticable to establish single-medium schools for English-speaking children and Afrikaans-speaking children, respectively, on account of tie numbers of children who attend such schools, but it is desirable as a result of purely practical considerations, and not on the grounds of policy, to establish parallel-medium schools. In the rest of Natal there are one Afrikaans-medium high school, nine English-medium high schools and 12 parallel-medium high schools. The position as regards primary schools is similar. In Durban there are five Afrikaans-medium primary schools, 35 English-medium primary schools and only eight parallel-medium primary schools. In Pietermaritzburg there are three single-medium Afrikaans primary schools, 13 single-medium English primary schools and only one parallel-medium primary school. Therefore it is clear that in Natal it is not a question of policy or principle to establish parallel-medium schools in order to bring children of the different language groups together. On the contrary, it was officially stated in a letter to a parents&#x2019; board in Durban in 1964 that if more than 250 children of one language group attended a certain school, it was the policy to establish a single-medium school for those children. That was the official policy which the United Party followed in Natal in 1964.</p>

<p>I merely mention these figures in order to denounce one aspect and that is the statement which the United Party makes from time to time, namely that it is its policy to have parallel-medium schools. It is not their policy. It is for the sake of convenience that they have such schools. I accept that certain circumstances make it desirable to have parallel-medium schools where the numbers do not justify single-medium schools. There is another aspect. That is the question of what the object is of having parallel-medium schools. It is to effect a better understanding between English and Afrikaans-speaking persons? I then ask <span class="col_2261-2262" refersTo="page_1148"/>myself whether that is the best way of doing so, or even whether that is the only way of doing so? To me it is clear that while it may perhaps be a contributing factor to bringing about a better understanding between English-and Afrikaans-speaking children, it is by far not the most effective way of doing so. The way to bring about a better understanding between English and Afrikaans-speaking persons is par excellence the improvement of the attitude which the child acquires in its home environment, because no amount of mixing children in schools can bring about a better understanding if the attitude which the child has acquired at home is not suitable for building on. I have seen time and time again that the artificial mixing of children who have acquired an attitude of bitterness in their homes merely aggravates that attitude of bitterness. On the other hand I want to contend that as regards children in single-medium schools such as the Port Natal High School and the Glenwood High School&#x2014;a single-medium Afrikaans high school and a single-medium English high school&#x2014;relations are excellent. As a matter of fact, the relations are much better than those which exist, for example, between the children of Glenwood and of D.H.S., to single-medium English schools. I mention this in order to prove one statement and that is that it is not necessarily essential for children to be mixed in schools in order to bring about a better understanding. That better understanding depends entirely on the nature of domestic circumstances as well as the attitude adopted by the parents and transferred to their children for bringing about a better understanding.</p>

<p>We know that a better understanding has come about between English-and Afrikaans-speaking persons, particularly in recent years. There may perhaps have been various reasons for that. One very important contributing factor is the threat from abroad. Another contributing factor is that the constitutional struggle as to whether we should be a republic or a monarchy is something of the past and therefore no longer is a contributing factor to division. Now the question is whether it is desirable to give expression once more to that division which bedevilled our political history as well as our social history in the past&#x2014;because that is precisely what it did. I say that it is very undesirable to do something like that. In this regard I want to level a charge against the United Party, particularly against the leader of the United Party in Natal, and by implication against the Leader of the United Party in this House who allowed the leader of Natal to guide him in this respect, for having turned this debate into a debate of bitterness, of aversion, practically of hatred. I think that it is scandalous that the United Party wants to use this debate, a debate which is purely and simply concerned with sound educational principles which meet with the approval of prominent educationists, to try and drive in a wedge between English-and Afrikaans-speaking persons, particularly in Natal, for the sake of scoring a short-term political advantage. I level the charge against the United Party that it is trying to spoil that understanding which has been built up over years and which is so absolutely essential for our entire future. It is a very short-sighted policy and they will feel its detrimental effects at the next election. About one thing I am very grateful, and that is that this legislation was introduced this year and will not only be introduced in three years&#x2019; time. We now have three years before the next provincial election &#x2026;</p>

<p>Children who are at school now will not be able to vote at that time. Therefore that is not a factor. We now have three years in which to prove to the voters, and particularly to the mature English voters in Natal who are also now learning to think for themselves, that these bogy stories which have been told here by the United Party, in conjunction with the Press, are absolutely groundless. We have heard that type of bogy story throughout history. I just want to quote in brief from bogy stories which appeared in the policy of statement of the United Party in 1960. The following is taken from the introductory paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let it be said at the outset clearly and emphatically that the United Party is a Commonwealth party without reservation and without qualification.</block>

<p>Even on that occasion they used various tactics of intimidation. They said that if we became a Republic the following things would happen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We would forgo the economic advantages of preferential treatment. We would lose advantages of agricultural research. We might be outside the sterling block. We might be without the cultural advantages of association with the Commonwealth. We would lose immigrants and our white civilization would suffer.</block>

<p>This is the type of bogy story they have told throughout their political history. But not on one single occasion has any one of their bogy stories ever come true. Now again they have come with a collection of bogy stories about our education, about the indoctrination of children, about interference with the rights of parents, and various other stories. Not one of them is true. I have here a few cuttings. The hon. member for South Coast said, &#x201C;It is wicked&#x201D;. A M.P.C. of Natal said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the beginning of the end. The aim was clearly towards a one-party state starting with indoctrination of the children.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2263-2264" refersTo="page_1149"/>The whole issue is bedevilled by ideological rubbish. We are being returned to the days of the Boer War.</block>

<p>Surely it is scandalous on the part of so-called responsible politicians to come to light with suer statements, to make insinuations against a policy which has been accepted by educationists since 1910 as a direction in which we must move. In framing the Constitution of the Union of South Africa in 1910, provision was made to make it possible for education to be taken over and be handled by the Central Government within five years. In 1917 the Jagger Commission suggested that education should be controlled by the Central Government. There were commissions throughout the years that always made the same recommendations. Now that we in South Africa have reached the stage where we have a large degree of unity and where the old casting of suspicion is something of the past, the United Party comes along and tries with everything at its disposal to re-open the old wounds of the past for the sake of a few constituencies in Natal which it may possibly lose at the next election, particularly the constituency of Port Natal. The hon. member for Port Natal made the most embittered speech I have ever heard from him and saw to it that his speech would receive publicity in the constituency of Port Natal, something which will be to his own detriment.

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was high time for us to pay attention to the division of the past, particularly where that hampered us in the sphere of education. I am grateful for the good and positive work which was done by many leading educationists to lay down and suggest a sound education policy. I now want to make an appeal to all hon. members of the House of Assembly, and to the Press in particular, to stop sowing suspicion against this legislation. There is nothing suspicious about it. This is an educational measure which is being placed on the Statute Book for the sake of the future of our country, a country with tremendous potential. A great future awaits us. The other day I saw certain films which were released by the Information Service. Many hon. members opposite also saw them. Now I want to ask whether they did not feel proud to be South Africans, to be members of one South African people; and whether they did not feel a pulsating feeling of unity? Why is it necessary, in spite of that inner feeling which is the embodiment of our growth as a nation, and while we have that pulsating feeling of unity as South Africans, to try and drive in a wedge between the two language groups? I want to emphasize it that we must now go forward and look at the future. We are a united South Africa and we cannot afford to stand divided. Let us not try to make of this Bill a wedge which divides us.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House consider that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s handling of this Bill, the so-called milestone in South African education, has been thoroughly hamhanded, and if I may say so&#x2014;I hope it is not unparliamentary&#x2014;it has been a little unscrupulous. [Interjections.] It has also been incompetent. The reports in the Press make that quite clear. I am afraid I am going to talk on rather different lines from those of the hon. member who has just sat down. It seems to us on this side of the House that there was absolutely no need to have three separate Bills dealing with education this Session. We are only dealing with one at the moment, but we have had the Advanced Technical Education Bill, now we have the National Education Policy Bill, and then we have the other one dealing with the delegation of administrative powers to the provinces. The correct way, surely, to have dealt with this whole matter would have been, as the hon. member for Kensington quite correctly said, to have one composite national education Bill which could have been quite concise, brief and specific and which could have laid down policy on a broad basis, and could have been acceptable under certain conditions, but not this Bill. Sir, what was needed in this Bill and what is missing in this whole debate is a lack of the presentation of an imaginative, vigorous reform of the whole education system in South Africa. If we had a Bill of that kind, a broad, vigorous reform of education, geared to the developments which are taking place in this country, and particularly the industrial development in our changing society, we would have given our people in South Africa what might rightly be called a new deal. If the plan had embodied any sort of intention, as I think it should have done, to co-ordinate&#x2014;and it could have done so quite concisely&#x2014;the professional, technical, executive and agricultural training requirements of the country into one composite Bill, making provision at the same time, as they have done overseas in a large number of countries, for the greatest possible diversity in both curricula and administrative control within the framework of one composite Bill, it would, without question, have been acceptable to this side of the House. But the Government has failed miserably in this matter. We are not legislating for 1910, as some hon. members seem to think; we are legislating for the realities of the 1970s. As the Prime Minister said, surely we should be trying to lead South Africa, in the educational field or any other field, into a wider international context so as to be in a position to cope with our industrial and labour requirements and problems on a proper basis. Once again, I repeat, that I think the Government has completely missed the bus. The hon. member for Kensington made a point about dealing with the positive side. I want to spend what time I have at my disposal dealing entirely with what I think should be some of the positive aspects&#x2014;aspects of education which should have been provided for in this Bill and about which we have heard absolutely nothing. They may be sitting in some dark corner of the Minister&#x2019;s mind, but nobody knows anything about them.</p>

<p><span class="col_2265-2266" refersTo="page_1150"/>What are some of these positive things that we consider to be absolutely vital and which should be incorporated in our legislation? Where is the plan for our industrial and economic future in this Bill? It is only a woolly ideological hotch-potch, and that is all. I now want to list very briefly some of the positive things. The hon. the Minister, in terms of the legislation he has, no doubt, seen from overseas, from Canada and the United States and the United Kingdom, could have included a number of similar provisions in this Bill, with its ten principles, which have almost become the ten commandments. These are some of the things I think we should incorporate.</p>

<p>First of all, there should have been specifically laid down plans for State assistance on a large scale to be given to boys and girls in the secondary, the vocational and the technical high schools to enable them to continue their studies as long as possible within their competence to carry on. This should have been one of the main principles. Together with that should have gone a system of State bursaries and grants for this particular purpose. I think that in this Bill also the State should have established a bursary fund, not merely for children who leave school after Matriculation or Senior Certificate&#x2014;technically that has already been done, I believe&#x2014;but there is no money in it. What there should be is a fund established by the State to assist children who leave school after Std. VIII. That is what we need most, but there is no mention of anything like that at all, not even in the Bill which grants certain powers to the Provincial Councils. I think the State should also consider, and it could have been incorporated in this Bill as a principle, financial assistance to selected and approved university students whose parents cannot afford to send them to a university, but who are able to study and who should be there. That is the kind of practical thing for which the people in this country are looking, and not a lot of woolly stuff which nobody can diagnose or understand. Then, what about in-service training with a view to our industrial situation? Why is no provision made in this Bill, as one of those ten principles, for this? It can be done on the initiative of the Education Department, if the Minister cares to deal with these matters. There should be an extension of the system of in-service training in the form of part-time classes for adults to encourage them to improve their qualifications and to give them a greater incentive to earn more money and to improve their positions, so that they can make way for the youngsters who are coming on. This is a practical suggestion. The Minister laughs, but this is being done in the United Kingdom. Why can it not be done here?</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Such a Bill could have laid down a very good foundation for education. Then I think special mention should have been made by the Minister about the establishment of technical colleges in the large rural centres to encourage our children in the platteland not to leave the platteland, to discourage the drift from the platteland and at the same time to encourage the decentralization of industry on which this Government is so keen. Those technical colleges could then issue the necessary diplomas and certificates to these children from the rural areas whose parents do not want them to go to the big cities, but who particularly want them to become well qualified in agricultural matters. But we have had nothing practical like that. Not a word is said about that. I think the Minister could have had as one of his principles the basis on which our teachers should be trained, that all primary school teachers, for instance, should have three years&#x2019; training throughout the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister seems to have taken draconian powers in practically every direction. I fail to see why he could not take powers in this instance to do something about teacher-training which is absolutely vital. Then there is another thing which he does not seem to have thought about and which would give the European population the best deal of all in terms of education, and that is if we begin to think in terms of what they call overseas the ancillary services in education. We have medical inspection in certain places but only under certain circumstances. It is not a proper, full medical inspection. There is the provision of milk and meals at schools. In some cases this has proved not to work adequately but properly controlled it could. This could give enormous assistance to people living on fixed salaries, who have no margin whatsoever. Then there is the question of board and lodging for semi-indigent pupils. Believe me, Sir, there are thousands of semi-indigent pupils to-day even amongst the European population, with the cost of living as high as it is. May I say that we could very well have taken a leaf out of the book of some of the countries overseas, where the authorities provide school uniforms if it can be proved that the family&#x2019;s income does not allow for the initial lay-out for expensive uniforms. I wonder if the hon. the Minister realizes how grateful some of our people in South Africa would be if they were to derive this type of practical benefit? But we hear absolutely nothing in this Bill about this type of proposition. We get nothing but a series of dreary ideological considerations with a few practicalities thrown in, for good measure, here and there. Sir, I consider, as the hon. member for Kensington stated earlier on, that the State should take some responsibility for pre-school education as well because this in itself would fit in with the economic pattern of things in terms of working <span class="col_2267-2268" refersTo="page_1151"/>mothers as well as of the initial training of the children, Then, Sir, why is there no mention of the principle, throughout the Republic, of a post-senior certificate or a post-matriculation year before going to university? This is something in regard to which the hon. the Minister must not say that he has not had time to consult everybody. He has had four years in which to consult everybody.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>What I say will go down on record and it makes no difference whether he has the courtesy to listen to me or not. We feel very strongly too that the curricula in all schools should be broadly conceived to suit the needs of different areas. Pretoria cannot possibly conceive what is needed by the Cape, by Natal, by the Free State and by other parts of the country. The only people who can do that adequately are the local leaders of commerce and industry, labour and the educationists themselves; they are the people in whose hands this should be left. We disagree fundamentally with this rigidity with regard to curricula that the hon. the Minister is now introducing.</p>

<p>Sir, I have just mentioned some of the practical things which I think should have been incorporated in this Bill. Another one is something that we never hear anything about: Why cannot the State, as a matter of principle, assist with the provision of adequate laboratory and workshop equipment and instructors for the technical schools and the vocational high schools? This could have been part of a new deal. It could be of enormous assistance to these institutions, and it could have been laid down as a principle that the Government will assist actively in providing equipment for these laboratories and workshops and that the Government will assist in training the instructors as well, but there is no mention in this Bill of anything as practical as that. Sir, what about the conversion of farm schools? I am not going to labour that point, because I have already talked about technical colleges in the rural areas. I must say that I personally refuse point-blank to participate in what I consider to be an unprofitable and thoroughly sterile discussion on the question of language medium. I do not think it gets us anywhere in South Africa to-day. I am sorry to say it but that is my view. I think it is the positive and constructive things that we need to consider in this country at this stage, going into the 1970s as we are. Sir, if only this Government would give education priority and not politics all the time&#x2014;politics are inherent in every line of this Bill&#x2014;then, I think possibly we would make the grade in regard to education. Since World War II we have undergone an industrial revolution in South Africa and the thing about it that we have to remember, from an educational point of view, is that no sooner is one industrial technique mastered than it is out of date and superseded by another and the youngsters have to learn another. Provision has to be made for this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have read all the principles and they can be interpreted in a thousand different ways; that is the point. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that future generations in South Africa are going to say of this hon. Minister: &#x201C;We asked for bread and he gave us a stone,&#x201D; as far as this Bill is concerned. I would agree with the hon. the Minister and with hon. members opposite if they tell me that science and technology are not enough. That is quite true. Much has been made in this debate of the need to produce balanced personalities in South Africa. May I say that we need balanced personalities just as urgently as we need specialists. Heaven knows, we need them more urgently in South Africa than almost anything else. But it is a pity that the Bill does not make provision for unity in a positive sense as opposed to division, which it very definitely does. It is a pity that it does not make more room for diversity, for decentralization of control, not merely administrative control but policy control.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, Sir, there are two other positive aspects that I want to deal with. I think one of the principles that should have been written into this Bill is the question of the employment of married women as teachers. They should no longer be forced to resign on marriage. The Government should be far-seeing enough to accept this proposition. Furthermore, they should have the right of permanent appointments; they should have the right to pension benefits, as they accrue on a sliding scale, like anybody else, because make no mistake about it, Sir, never, as long as we live, are we going to be able to run the educational system in this country without the assistance of married women teachers. Finally our teachers should be given a proper professional status. They should be given a teachers&#x2019; board or council like the Bar Council, the Medical Council or the Nursing Council. This should be a statutory body with statutory protection and statutory backing, a body representative of all sections, a body that would be able to negotiate with the Department and that would give the teaching profession a status which it does not have in South Africa as things are to-day, with the result that we lose hundreds of teachers almost every year to commerce and industry.</p>

<p>My last point is this: The hon. the Minister may smile but he introduced a new principle himself as far as the Public Service is concerned; there should have been written into this Bill the principle of equal pay for men and women teachers for equal work. The question of dependants is an entirely different matter; these can be assessed on the basis of <span class="col_2269-2270" refersTo="page_1152"/>merit for men and women. If the qualifications and the experience are the same, the basic salary for men and women teachers should be identical. A woman principal looking after a big girls&#x2019; school has just as much responsibility as a male principal looking after a big boys&#x2019; school.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that if any attempt is made in South Africa to condition the thinking of our children in our schools either to the left or to the right&#x2014;the one is as bad as the other&#x2014;it can only be disastrous in a country like South Africa where the real need is for objective, balanced thinking and adaptability to change, particularly in a country which is moving forward as rapidly as we are in South Africa to-day. Sir, we condemn this Bill out of hand as being a negative measure which produces nothing remotely like a new deal for education in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with the contents of the hon. member for Wynberg&#x2019;s speech I feel that it would not be out of place on this occasion, where we have before us the prospects of the new dispensation which this legislation is going to create, to see in it the possibilities of in future being able to discuss education on a sound basis. The hon. member gave us an example of that to-day. In that respect I want to congratulate the hon. member for Wynberg for having succeeded in getting away from her usual pattern. She made a few practical suggestions here which, in my opinion, have no place in today&#x2019;s discussion but for which there will be ample opportunity for discussion under the dispensation which this Bill will create. However she could not help returning to her old ways towards the end of her speech and referred to regimentation and to how negative this legislation supposedly was. She simply could not forget about those days in 1954 when she fought a provincial election on this matter. I shall not refer now to all the things she said at that time. I want to congratulate her for having, generally speaking, outgrown that state of mind. She has outgrown it politically and also as far as her views on education are concerned. I want to congratulate her on that.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. member made a few practical suggestions which, in my opinion, are out of place in the discussion of this legislation, but which may be discussed in future whenever the opportunity presents itself. It will be possible not only to discuss these practical suggestions, but even those spectres which other hon. members chased up in this House. If there are going to be such spectres as they imagine they see in this legislation, they would surely have the opportunity of bringing those spectres to the House. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I am aware that that hon. member does not know how to catch spectres, but he certainly knows how to see them. The hon. member for Wynberg saw a similar spectre when she said that the hon. the Minister was in this legislation giving us a stone while the people were asking for bread. I wonder whether the hon. member has ever heard of the saying that man cannot live by bread alone. It is true that they cannot live on stones, to which the hon. member referred, but I know of people who should not throw stones because they live in glass houses. The saying goes that man cannot live by bread alone, and we can learn that in this legislation. We can see that the day has arrived where there are more things at stake for the youth of South Africa than merely the material things and the bread he eats. This legislation is ushering in a new era in which we will have discussion of education on a much higher level, removed from politics, than has been the case up to now.</p>

<p>Thanks to this legislation education will now be in the hands of people who have the most knowledge of education, namely the educationists themselves. The profession itself will deal with the stipulating of what is practical and what is useful and what is necessary. That is why I want to say to-day that there is great rejoicing in the ranks of our educationists and of our teaching profession at the coming of this legislation. I do not want to tire myself with quotations. There have been quotations from all sides, even of our friends there in Natal&#x2014;those of them who do have a little knowledge of education&#x2014;have said in regard to the need for a national view of and a national approach to our education. When I speak of a national view of and a national approach to education, I cannot help referring to the suspicion which was sown in regard to the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; contained in this legislation. The hon. member for Kensington did so again this afternoon. If hon. members still have any doubts in this enlightened year, 1967, they must ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout what it means. The hon. member is laughing now; he knows how he fought this same United Party, approximately 20 years ago, when he pleaded that the party to which he belonged should try and make the youth more nationally conscious and should try to inspire them more with a love for South Africa. That is why he was at loggerheads with the leaders of that party. It astounds me now, in spite of all the growth and change which has taken place, that there can still be such an attitude in that party. I am not blaming the hon. member, but they cannot understand what we mean by a national outlook for a matter such as education as well. The hon. member for Kensington said here this afternoon that he could not become excited over the question of mother-tongue instruction. He said that it was not of great importance to him. I think the hon. member for Wynberg said the same thing. This dispute over the question of mother-tongue education was over years ago. I regard it as closed.</p>

<p>Yes, there is nothing wrong with the Cape system and neither is there anything wrong with the Transvaal system. <span class="col_2271-2272" refersTo="page_1153"/>That is also based on mother-tongue education. [Interjections.] I understand very well what mother-tongue education implies. The problem is that hon. mmbers of the Opposition do not always understand what it means. It strikes one that hon. members who made those remarks to the effect that the mother tongue is not of so much importance, consistently choose mother-tongue instruction when it comes to their own neighbourhood and their own children. Now it is being stated at great length that the mother tongue is not of such great importance. People who know something about education, the educationists themselves, all prescribe mother-tongue education as a pedagogically sound principle.</p>

<p>Hon. members have once again used that old parrot cry in respect of parental option which they used 15 years ago at a provincial election. They have said that parental option should now go further and be of more importance than mother-tongue instruction. I want to ask hon. members whether parental option&#x2014;the option which parents have of having their children taught as they choose&#x2014;carried enough weight with them in the days when they controlled certain provinces and were experimenting with dual-medium education&#x2014;that absurdity in the world of education. They compelled each parent to have his children instructed through the medium of dual-medium education. In other words, no parents had an option in respect of the medium of instruction. I also want to ask hon. members this: Is parental option not as important to-day in respect of the type of school which the child has to attend? The parent has the option of sending his child to whatever school he chooses. There are parallel medium schools and there are mother-tongue schools&#x2014;single-medium schools for English-and Afrikaans-speaking people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg&#x2019;s Afrikaans is not yet as good as she thought. She misunderstood me. After all, the parent has the right to send his child to a parallel-medium school, even if it is in another neighbourhood, or to a mother-tongue school. Is it not that which is really the important thing for the parent? The question of the medium of instruction does not affect the parent. If it affects the parent, it only affects him if he has preconceived prejudices. The medium of instruction affects the child, his future and the country which he must serve. Hon. members set an entire dispute in motion in this debate in regard to the small group of parents who, one can almost say, have a distorted view of the requirements of their children in respect of mother-tongue instruction. However, they did not plead in the interests of the child and for what was the best means of conducting the child from the stage at which he attended school to the stage where he should mean something for his country.</p>

<p>The emphasis for them fell on a small group of parents who have a distorted view of things.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) asked a question the other day in regard to what the position in respect of Afrikaans speaking parents would be. It appeared from the Wilkes Report that it was Afrikaans-speaking parents in particular who sometimes had such a distorted view. I know parents like that who believe that it would be better for their children if they are taught through the medium of a language other than their mother tongue.</p>

<p>Sir, this hon. member was a member of the Executive Committee. It is a very good thing that he is no longer one, because what would have happened to our children here in the Cape, seeing that we have heard what his approach is now? I make it my duty to talk to English-speaking parents as well. I have argued about this matter on many occasions. I came to the conclusion that English-speaking parents who differ from us on this point, and sometimes even those English-speaking parents who support the National Party, do not understand the situation correctly and do not realize that the background to this so-called parental option is something quite different from what we are actually dealing with, i.e. the education of the child. The background to that is hidden in an unexpressed fear, a fear which was not expressed here either, for the English language in South Africa. It is the fear that the English language in South Africa is going to deteriorate. That fear is being cunningly encouraged by the suspicion-mongering, as we have also experienced in these debates, of hon. members of the Opposition. It is a fear which need not exist.</p>

<p>We will not protect you if you do not want to protect yourselves. The problem of English-speaking people in South Africa in respect of their language and the role which their language can play in the schools arises from the dearth of English-speaking teachers in those schools. I now want to tell the hon. member for Wynberg that I feel as concerned about that as she does. I also want to tell her that if she really wants to do cultural upliftment work for her language<span class="col_2273-2274" refersTo="page_1154"/> group, the English-speaking community which is the group which speaks one of our two national languages which are our dual heritage, then she should try and allay this suspicion-mongering which she herself was not guilty of here this afternoon but which was certainly perpetrated by her colleagues here. She must go out and tell the English-speaking South African: &#x201C;There is nothing to fear in this Bill. If there is a task awaiting us then it is to see to it that a <i>pro rata</i> share of English-speaking people in South Africa play a part in the education of the country.&#x201D; The shortage of English-speaking teachers is the problem for English-speaking South Africans if they do have a problem in respect of their language and do not have the good faith such as that displayed by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) who believed that a group of Afrikaans parents who thought that by having their children taught through the medium of English they could make better people of them, could strengthen the English-language group.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington repeated the story here again this afternoon that this legislation and our approach to education is dividing the children of the country. I have made it my task in regard to this point as well to talk to many English-speaking people. At a meeting an English-speaking person asked me: &#x201C;Why do you divide the children of the country?&#x201D; I tried to tell him as best I could that it was not true. I told him that is what members of the United Party were telling him. After the meeting I had a conversation with that person at which an Afrikaans-speaking parent of that child was also present. I then told him that I would try and make it easy. I asked my Afrikaans friend: &#x201C;Where do your children attend school?&#x201D; He then replied: &#x201C;Here in town at a parallel-medium school.&#x201D; I then asked the person who had levelled the reproach at me that the National Party were dividing the children of the country to tell me where his children attended school. He lowered his head and said: &#x201C;It is rather a personal matter; they are at Michaelhouse.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No, there is nothing wrong with that. It is a very good school. The hon. member must understand me because that is not the point I am trying to make. It is a very good school. My point is that the people who accuse us of dividing the children of the country send their children away to a one-language school while the Afrikaans children are waiting on the playgrounds to mingle with them and build up unity. They have every right to do so, but then they must not level the reproach here at this side of the House that we are dividing the children of the country. I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana who stated here this afternoon that real unity, not the unity of the United Party, but real thorough-going unity and not political unity, is not developed by forcing people into certain schools. I believe in a parallel-medium school. I am myself a product of a parallel-medium school. I have nothing against them. I believe that in a certain neighbourhood it is a very good thing. But now the English-speaking South Africans must concede that I am right, because it was they who first began to work for English medium schools in certain urban areas. They must not reproach the Afrikaner for doing the same thing. The belief which is sometimes raised here, but which is not a valid one, that unity can be built by herding people together in the same school is not correct. Unity, and I want to support the point of view of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, can only be built if it is cultivated in the heart and in the homes of the parents of those children. If there is an attitude in the heart of a parent or in the homes of parents which does not promote unity and if there are parents who tell their children, &#x201C;you must not associate with the other section&#x201D;, then unity cannot be built up. That is why I say that our attitude in regard to this legislation, which is laying down a pattern for the future for us, is that which is supported by educationists, i.e. that the interests of the children must receive pride of place and not those of parents who have distorted ideas, nor those of a certain Party which also has distorted ideas and which wants to exploit prejudices. The interests of the child and how the child can be of service to South Africa, is of primary importance. If we implement in this way the golden rule which is being laid down in this legislation, I believe that South Africa will be grateful for the day we received this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I really did not think that at this stage we would hear any hon. member from that side of the House talk about unity in relation to this Bill. The hon. member for Stellenbosch wanted not political unity but real unity. If there was ever a Bill which killed unity in this country, it is this Bill. Surely one must at least give our children a chance to live together and to work together. Surely it is better that they play rugby together in the same team rather than that they play against each other in different teams. Is this not what it is here, a regimentation of Afrikaans-speaking children from kindergarten to Std. X on one side and a regimentation of English-speaking children into another camp from nursery school to Std. X.</p>

<p>If the hon. members will look at the Bill they will see a clause relating to mother-tongue instruction:</p>

<block name="quote">The mother tongue, if it is English or Afrikaans, shall be the medium of instruction.</block>

<p><span class="col_2275-2276" refersTo="page_1155"/>[Interjection.] If the hon. member for Maitland would look at the Bill, he would know what it means. Here is an hon. member who is from the Cape. I thought that it had been made very clear by the hon. member for Green Point what the Cape Ordinance provided. The hon. member for Stellenbosch said, &#x201C;Daar is niks verkeerd met die Kaaplandse stelsel&#x201D;. But what is the &#x201C;Kaaplandse stelsel&#x201D;? [Interjections.] The hon. member must listen and tell me whether I heard the hon. member for Green Point wrongly. The Cape system passed by a Nationalist administration in 1956 provides that the language which the child knows best, he shall be instructed in up to Std. VIII. If he knows both languages then the parent decides. Between Std. VI and Std. VIII there may be a change if there is a good report that the child is in fact able to do so. In Stds. IX and X there is complete parental choice. That cannot happen in terms of this Bill. How can this hon. member now say, &#x201C;Daar is niks verkeerd met die Kaaplandse stelsel nie&#x201D;.</p>

<p>How can it? If the hon. member for Randfontein can tell us, we will be delighted to hear. He is the chief spokesman on educational matters for the other side. Will he tell us how, if the hon. the Minister is to be guided by the following principles, one of which is that the mother tongue shall be the medium of instruction, he can frame regulations different from that, because they would be <i>ultra vires</i> of this measure, and the hon. member knows very well they would be. That is not what the Minister wants any way. The hon. gentleman was the architect of the education system in the Transvaal. He was the architect of many things up there, but particularly this was his baby. The Transvaal system is what is in this Bill, and that is what the Minister is going to apply under this Bill in relation to the whole of the country. That is his object.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we do not need the hon. member for Stellenbosch to read us, the English-speaking people, a lecture as to what we should do for our language and what we should do for the cultural well-being of our people. We do not need a lecture from him. What he said in effect we should do, if we wanted to do that, was to accept this Bill. Well, can he tell us how doing that is going to help? Can he tell us? The hon. member must just leave us alone. We are quite able to develop our community and our cultural values. We are quite able to do it, and we have done it all along. We certainly do not need this Bill. We certainly do not need the guidance of this hon. Minister. We certainly do not need his principles, his thoughts, in all our homes, through our children. We do not need that. We do not want it. I want to tell the Minister a secret: We are not going to have it any way. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>When hon. members on that side talk about &#x201C;national&#x201D;, when this hon. Minister talks about &#x201C;national&#x201D;, they mean something a little different from &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. I am very surprised to see anything in a Bill relating to education about Christianity. The Bill talks about Christian. Samuel Taylor Coleridge said something about Christianity which I think is very apposite of the attitude some hon. members of this House have exhibited during the last few days in these debates on this Bill. He said that: &#x201C;He who begins by loving Christianity better than truth will proceed by loving his own sect or church better than Christianity, and end by loving himself better than all&#x201D;. Do you know, Sir, that there is an awful lot of truth in that. When one starts trying to apply Christian principles deliberately to inculcate or imbue them in a system of education, then one is going to get into trouble, simply because of the diversity which is Christianity. The unity and the diversity within the unity, is that not exactly what South Africa is to-day? This Government, and this Minister particularly, have wanted to control South Africans, every aspect of every individual&#x2019;s life right from the cradle to the grave. This is their obejct and this is their intention.</p>

Because we are not Nationalists? Because we are not &#x201C;ver-kramptes&#x201D;? Because we do not have the attitude of the Minister, never mind the attitude of the hon. gentleman over there? No, Sir. Let him get up and say why, and, better still, let the Minister get up and tell us why. Someone else asked me why I wanted divided control. You know, Sir, the South Africa in which we live, whether hon. members like it or not, is, and will always be, a diversified South Africa. It is no use pretending that there are no differences between us&#x2014;of course there are. There are cultural differences between the English-speaking and the Afrikaans-speaking peoples. It is the richness of that diversity which makes this country what it is. Surely that is why we have become the country we are, that is why we have unity as we have it. If divided control reflects our diversity, which it does &#x2026; [Interjections.] Of course it does. You have a different system in Natal, supported by the overwhelming majority of people in Natal. You have a system in the Cape quite different from that of the Free State and the Transvaal, because the people here are different. Are they unnational here? Does the Cape system produce something which is not national? But the Minister does not like those things because they are not national. Surely one is driven to this conclusion. What does he regard as national, except the thing that he himself is the architect of, and that is the Transvaal system which will give us a narrow concept?</p>

<p><span class="col_2279-2280" refersTo="page_1157"/>Of course that is exactly what he wants to impose on the whole country. If we are only to get one of those diversified outlooks, which one is it going to be? I will give the hon. members from the Cape one guess. It will be the Minister&#x2019;s Transvaal system, and his image and his outlook. The Minister is the man who is going to decide, according to this Bill. He will have every power that there is in relation to policy. The Minister alone can decide. It is no good saying that he must consult with his Committees. He may consult with them, but if he does not agree with them it makes no difference whatever, and he is going to appoint every single one of them. Now, what does the Minister feel about Christian National Education? We want to know.</p>

<p>No, we are not seeing bogies, but we want to know what the Minister thinks about it. I believe he believes in it. Will he get up and deny it in this House? I am talking about the C.N.O. principles. [Interjections.] Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he thinks about C.N.O. when he replies. Will he tell us whether he believes in those principles or not? You see, Sir, there are some things you cannot run away from. Tell me, Sir, whether the Transvaal language ordinance was not part of the programme and principles of C.N.O.? Then we had the Bantu Education Act in 1953, in terms of Articles 14 and 15 of that programme of principles. The Government Chief Whip shakes his head in agreement. The technical colleges were taken over. Was that not also part of that programme? Then we had the Extension of University Education Act, as it was called, when the open universities were virtually abolished. [Interjections.] That is part of that programme of principles. The principle was that you shall not have Whites and non-Whites learning the same things at one university. That is also part of the C.N.O. programme of principles. The last one was the Advisory Council Bill. The idea of that was to freeze the position until the Minister could come here to-day and administer the <i>coup de grace.</i> Nothing more is left now to legislate upon. It is all accomplished. Every single step has systematically been pursued and every item of that policy has been applied until we now have the application of this to the whole country.</p>

<p>I want to say that I believe that the sort of uniformity which is aimed at here, the uniformity of thought which the Minister seeks to achieve here, produces and has always produced in this country intolerance, intolerance such as we see every day from the persons who have come out of the machine of the system of education which that Minister created and nurtured and enforced in the Transvaal, intolerance such as one sees nowhere else in this country. You do not see such intolerance as this system produced in the Cape or in Natal, or even in the Free State. [Interjection.] If you are going to have uniformity of approach, you will have intolerance of everything that is not in accordance with that uniformity which you have imbued in people&#x2019;s minds. If this intolerance of everything which is not Nationalist&#x2014;that is what this is going to be&#x2014;is allowed to grow, there will be no hope for unity in this country. There will be no hope for us to resolve any i the problems we have, and because of the very diversity which exists we will no longer understand, and instead of appreciating it we will hate it and fight it. That is what the Minister is doing. It is no use the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development laughing like that. I-must ask himself whether there is not a difference between Transvalers and Free Staters and &#x201C;Kapenaars&#x201D; and Natalians. Of course there is, and one hopes that there will always be. But we hope, if we are all to be cast in one image, then it will not be the image of the Transvaal. There are many differences of legitimate thought and attitudes. This Bill is intended deliberately to destroy it. I do not know whether the Minister thinks he will produce anything from this system of his. I think the hon. member for Hillbrow put it magnificently when he said that the aim of education must be to produce children who have judgment without bias, who can think independently. The Government Chief Whip shakes his head because he does not normally encourage independent thought, but I appreciate that because of his position. [Interjections.] I think that all one wanted to say about the contents of this Bill has been said in the Committee Stage, but I want to say that if hon. members think that when the division bells go at the end of this debate and they go and sit in their seats and dutifully vote this Bill through its third reading, they have achieved anything, they are wrong. They will have achieved nothing. The Minister has a Bill and it will be passed and it will go to the Other Place and it will become law and eventually it will be proclaimed and then the Minister will have his powers to dictate what children should think or should not think and what places they should go to or not go to. But that is just the beginning of the matter. Then the real battle will start, because then he will have to fight every person who wants his child to have judgment without bias, who wants his child to be an independent thinker.</p>

<p>No, I did understand the hon. member. It is typical of the United Party. They have always been against the concept of &#x201C;nationalism&#x201D;. Their clarion call in 1948 was: &#x201C;Wipe out nationalism.&#x201D; What I am objecting to is that when we come to the education system and use the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, hon. members of the Oppositon then oppose us. The hon. member said that he was going to fight and that we was going to fight and win. It will this time not be his clarion call as it was in 1948; it will not be his slogan; it will be his death cry. It is not, as the Opposition is saying, that the public do not welcome this Bill. All lovers of education will welcome this Bill. All the children and the teachers will welcome it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Naturally. But what keeps them pure? Just in order to get them together the hon. member is willing to violate a sound, acknowledged educational principle, the principle of mother-tongue education. Is the hon. member not aware that mother-tongue education is the perfect instrument for imbuing the child with knowledge? If a child is behind in a subject and he is behind because he is studying that subject through the wrong medium, then he is not only behind in that subject, he is also behind <span class="col_2283-2284" refersTo="page_1159"/>as far as character formation and personality development are concerned. I want to prove that to the hon. member by quoting from a book by Dr. Meyer entitled <i>Moedertaal en Tweetaligheid.</i> Dr. Meyer emphasizes the need for mother-tongue education. We are making provision for mother-tongue education for both English-speaking and Afrkaans-speaking children. We are not setting them apart as far as the educational method is concerned; we are treating them all alike. What does this learned man ss (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Education in the mother tongue is the only way to mould the spirit and shape the character. The purpose of mother-tongue education is therefore language control as the fundamental method for achieving spritual and character formation.</block>

<p>I say that the child must receive instruction through the medium of his mother tongue. The hon. member for Kensington was a popular school inspector in the Transvaal. He was also an inspector in my school, and now we are both sitting here, but the difference is this: I am still an educationist but he is developing political lockjaw. I do not know that hon. member any more. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is one to talk about being &#x201C;unprejudiced in your approach&#x201D; now. That is not what the hon. member for Kensington does. Look at him sitting there laughing at himself. He knows that he made a great fool of himself in this House. He is unfaithful to the educational profession because he has been taken in tow. I want to state the position very clearly to-day, also to the hon. member for Pinetown who is now interrupting me. What does the hon. member know about education?</p>

<p>What have hon. members of the Opposition been doing the last few days? They have created an atmosphere of hate and venom around one of the best and most meritorious Bills ever to be introduced into this House. Why did they do so? They did not merely do so with ulterior political motives; they cannot help themselves; it is attributable to the typically unnational spirit of the United Party. What do they have against the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;? Why are they so allergic to the word? &#x201C;National&#x201D; to them is like a red rag to a storming bull. Sir, when is one&#x2019;s education system an efficient one? The education system is the ideal one when it is such that the child can develop intellectually, morally, physically, etc., so that when he leaves school one day he will not only lead his own life but lead the life of his nation. But that is not what the Opposition wants, because they know that if that is the end result, then those people will pronounce a damning judgment on the spiritual attitude which is typical of that side of the House. That is what lurks behind their opposition to this measure. Sir, I do not want to elaborate on mother-tongue education. It is an acknowledged educational principle and I shall let the matter rest there. The hon. member for Kensington said that this Bill will practically destroy the provincial system. Is the hon. member not aware that the Provincial Administrations are classified as Government Departments in the Public Service Act; is he not aware that the Education Departments are merely sub-departments of the Provincial Administrations? They are therefore also sub-government departments. In other words, they are part and parcel of one&#x2019;s state machine, and what is wrong with that? We are not violating it in this Bill. The hon. member wants to imply here that there will now be a deadly uniformity and that there will be no opportunity for diversity. Do they really think the country will allow itself to be threatened in such a way? Do they really think the country will allow itself to be treatened in this way? Are they not aware that we are retaining in this system the four points of growth, the education administrations, in the country? There is, for example, the point of growth in Pietermaritzburg&#x2014;a beautiful one. The other points of growth are in Bloemfontein, Cape Town and in Pretoria. With this national education policy plus decentralized administration we are retaining four points of growth in education, points where initiative takes place, where new things are experienced. Things which can be correlated and consolidated by the Education Advisory Council. The system allows considerable leeway. The separate educational departments are still there. All that we are now doing is to have one direction, one purpose, because there will now be a formulated national policy. But within that set-up there is still room for diversity, not so? Why do they not tell that to the country and outside? Why do they come here and throw dust in the people&#x2019;s eyes? Surely that is not honest or fair. No educational system can be national if it moves in two, three or four different directions. Then that educational system is dividing the country, no so? Such an educational system will surely fall apart. To have the same direction, the same course, one must give one&#x2019;s educational system a fundamental educational basis. That is what we are giving it here. How? We are giving it that basis by means of a formulated national policy, but by leaving the implementaiton hereof to the experienced provincial administrations we have growth points and there will be development and progress in South Africa. Why do hon. members opposite not tell the people of this meritorious aspect of the legislation? They do not do so because they are engaged in playing politics. The hon. member for Kensington knows something about educational heads, i.e. the Director of Education in each province. Here we are now getting a committee of educational heads who will be invested with a very important function. This committee of educational heads I regard as being one of the most meritorious aspects of this measure. It is the statutory and official body which will to a large extent have to help <span class="col_2285-2286" refersTo="page_1160"/>to implement this formulated national education policy. What is wrong with that? It is the first time in the history of our education that we are creating the machinery &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Kensington must not kick up such a fuss now. He must display some courtesy to me too while I am busy making my speech. Why does he not ask a question, if that is what he wants to do?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member heard me incorrectly. I made a distinction between the advisory council and the committee of educational heads. I am dealing with clause 6, while the hon. member is dealing with another clause. The hon. member is not as keen as he was in his young days when he could concentrate on a thing. His thoughts are undisciplined, particularly now that he has been caught up in politics.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but take a man like Mr. Koen, who was an educational head, and who is to-day director of education precisely because he was such a good educationist. We can say the same of Cape Town, of the Orange Free State and also of Natal, not so? There we have, as it were, the flower of our education in South Africa. They form this body and they must co-ordinate and bring this educational policy to fruition through their experiences of the diversity within that framework. But now the hon. member comes along and, for the sake of political lockjaw, as one possessed by politics, he no longer speaks as an educationist, but asks me such stupid questions, he who was formerly an inspector and the principal of a school. Surely that does not make sense.</p>

<p>I did not intend participating in this debate. [Interjections.] I shall tell you what that hon. member cannot recognize. He cannot recognize what is valuable and what is good in this educational measure. He is totally blind to that. The hon. member for Wynberg said: &#x201C;We asked for bread and you gave us a stone.&#x201D; Can you imagine: Where is this stated in this Bill? I admit that there must be bread&#x2014;&#x201C;An educational system should reflect the needs of the people.&#x201D; I put this question to the hon. member for Kensington. He also taught it to us&#x2014;&#x201C;An educational system should reflect the needs of the people.&#x201D; But is it not also stated in clause 2 that education must be provided in accordance with the ability, the aptitude and the interest of the pupil and the requirements of the country? But hon. members cannot realize that. They do not dwell on that, but make all kinds of accusations and allegations. That is precisely the difficulty. I say, Sir, that we should not merely give bread. An education system asks for something else as well. I think three of the world&#x2019;s greatest education systems can be summarized as follows: The one asks, &#x201C;Who are you?&#x201D;&#x2014;here we therefore have the emphasis on the character; another asks, &#x201C;What do you know?&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, an emphasis of the intellectual; and the third asks &#x201C;What can you do?&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, for what have you been trained, what was your vocational training. I think the best is to have a combination of all three. But to come here and say that a request was made for bread and that a stone was offered&#x2014;just imagine! Do you mean that education must merely give the child bread? Education is something entirely different&#x2014;it is character development, personality development: Those fine aims which are inherent in any sound education system. But this is how I have known the United Party all these years. Time and again they give a new objective to an education policy. At one time they idolized bilingualism. They elevated bilingualism to an aim in education. However, they did no more than pay lip-service. I challenge hon. members to tell me where in this Bill there is a violation of sound educational principles? They cannot do so; they cannot produce one piece of evidence to prove that. I challenge the hon. member for Kensington to state where in this Bill there is a violation of a sound pedagogical principle.</p>

The question is not who controls it from above&#x2014;the question is what is the policy which is being controlled. The question is whether it is a national policy and whether it is the right policy. [Interjections.] That hon. member who is interrupting me is the hon. member for Quisling, not so? I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word. Unfortunately it made a lasting impression on me the other day when the hon. member spoke about a Quisling. The hon. member is saying that the people in this House are yes-men.

<p><span class="col_2287-2288" refersTo="page_1161"/>I want to state very clearly here to&#x2014;day that we have, for the first time in the history of education, an educational measure which is an honour to the teaching profession and to Afrikaans&#x2014;speaking and English&#x2014;speaking children in the country. I want to say that if a parent in his love for his child wants to smother that child by means of the wrong medium of instruction, then the State must protect that child against that parent. Thank God we still have a number of good parents in South Africa. The majority of the parents in South Africa have good intentions for their children, and will see to it that their children are provided with the right medium of instruction, namely the mother tongue.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>You are the pathological phenomenon in your Party. I want to make it very clear that there is no discrimination in this Bill. This Bill is giving both sections a medium of instruction which is pedagogically sound, one is through the medium of mother&#x2014;tongue English and the other through the medium of Afrikaans as the mother tongue. What is wrong with that? It is the perfect instrument for gaining knowledge. What right have hon. members to launch an attack here and say that there are a few parents&#x2014;exceptional cases&#x2014;who are not in agreement with this. I say that the vast majority of parents in South Africa would see to it that their children receive instruction through the right medium. If there are a few who take educationally criminal steps against those children, then we must have an Education Act to curb those parents so that we may obtain the best results. Capital investment in the education of children is the best capital investment in our mother country. It is the most productive capital investment.</p>

<p>What right do we have to spend money on education if that education is defective and if the education system does not rest on sound pedagogical principles? Now hon. members are making this a political matter. The hon. member who was so fond of marching is not here, and it is now the hon. member for Durban (Point&#x2019;s) turn to march. They bring confusion to the country. He says that national unity will not be achieved. What is nationalism in this country other than a communal sentiment for good English&#x2014; and Afrikaans&#x2014;speaking South Africans both? If that is so, why may we not have the word &#x201C;nationalism&#x201D; in this Education Bill? Why do they want to eliminate this word &#x201C;national&#x201D;? What fault do they find with it? If we educate a child so that that child&#x2019;s mind is developed to such an extent that he is morally strong and that he can have successful social intercourse, whether he is English or Afrikaans speaking, after he has left school, if he is a balanced person, then we will have friendship between English&#x2014; and Afrikaans&#x2014;speaking people. But do you know what they are doing now? They are using this wonderful Bill to try and arouse antagonisms amognst English&#x2014; and Afrikaans&#x2014;speaking people. I say that it will be one of the nails in the coffin of the United Party. &#x201C;From the cradle to the grave&#x201D;, the hon. member for Durban (Point) said. I think we will still play the undertaker for that party. It is a dying party. Education must not only be from the cradle to the grave. It must be so Christian that also in the Hereafter if the hon. member should arrive in the wrong place, my children will arrive in the right place. Derogatively and sneeringly, that is not the way to talk about education policies such as this one. I say that it is a piece of politicizing from beginning to end. The hon. member spoke about bigoted people, but when I listened to the hollow laugh of the minority, then they are the narrow&#x2014;minded people, because they have been narrowing down to nothing since 1948. They are narrowing down because they cannot support a piece of educational legislation which is an embodiment of acknowledged sound pedagogical principles. That is why the nation will reject them and why this Bill which they are fighting against in this way to&#x2014;day, will, just like the dual medium of 1944 which they championed, be just another nail in their coffin. Mother&#x2014;tongue education educates a child. But the United Party is ruining the child with dual medium. It is high time the nation of South Africa gave the United Party a drubbing and chased them from Dan to Beersheba for waging such a ridiculous campaign against this beautiful and ideal Bill which we are considering here.</p>

<p>I do not care if there is one or 100 or 3 million. The hon. the Chief Whip has stated that this is a Bill to protect some children in South Africa from their own parents. [Interjections.] I warn the hon. The <span class="col_2289-2290" refersTo="page_1162"/>Chief Whip that we will tell the parents of South Africa what the opinion of this Government is about them, namely that the parents of South Africa cannot be trusted with their own children and that this Minister and this Government must bring in a law to protect the children. The hon. the Chief Whip spoke of four directions in education. He is of course quite wrong. There is one direction in education. There was provincial control, and that is what is being taken away. I notice that the Chief Whip is not listening now. I am not surprised. He said he did not intend to speak. It was quite clear that he did not intend to speak and it is quite clear now that he did not know what he spoke about. The Chief Whip, a responsible official of the Nationalist Party in this House, stands up and says that this Bill does not attack provincial control. What an incredible statement. Has the Chief Whip not read the Bill? Has he not listened to his own Minister, who said that there was no question but that control was now being taken over by himself. Yet the hon. the Chief Whip says that this does not bring about central control. He attacked the hon. member for Wynberg for saying that when we asked for bread we got a stone. I shall tell him where the stone is. The stone is in paragraphs 2 (2) (b), (c) and (d)&#x2014;the stone which hits on the head the provincial control of education throughout South Africa. Provisions were put into this Bill without reference to the provinces. The Administrator of the Cape said yesterday in the provincial council that he had never seen the final draft of this Bill. That is the stone in this Bill. I want to come to an earlier speech made in this debate by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Yesterday I did the hon. member an injustice when I alleged that he had said that education would not be centralized as Bantu education was.

<block name="quote">Mr. Volker continued, explaining that, in terms of the Bill, the system under which schools paid fees could be maintained.</block>

<p>Not only the original statement but also the denial is untrue. The Bill states that schools cannot charge fees. The hon. member for Berea moved an amendment, using the words of this statement, namely the &#x201C;nature and character of the schools&#x201D;. He wanted those words included, the words which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana repeated in his alleged denial. But the amendment was rejected and those words are not in this Bill as it is before us at this Third Reading Debate.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It was rejected by the Chairman as being destructive of the principle. In other words, had that amendment been passed it would have destroyed the principle of this Bill. The amendment was designed to preserve the character of fee&#x2014;paying schools. But it was ruled that by preserving the character of fee&#x2014;paying schools, the principle of the Bill would be destroyed. Therefore, the principle of the Bill destroys fee&#x2014;paying schools. Even my amendment, asking for the retention only of their rights and privileges, not of their fees, but their other rights and privileges, and the amendment of the hon. member for Berea asking for the retention of their character and status, were destructive of the principle of the Bill which destroys these schools. And this is the hon. member who appeals to the Press not to mislead the people! Let me go further. On Wednesday, 1st March, yesterday, there is an article in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> by &#x201C;Mr. V. A. Volker, National Party M.P. for Umhlatuzana&#x201D;. This is the Press that is misleading the people. This is the Press that is giving a false impression of this Bill, that is trying to stir up incorrect emotions over it, this is the Press that is not giving the true picture! And this is the gratitude of an hon. member who yesterday had a seven&#x2014;column article published. I assume that the hon. member gets paid for writing this article, yet the gratitude which he expresses is to attack the Press for giving one side of the picture only. He starts off the article as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is with sincere appreciation that I would like to thank the editor of <i>The Natal Mercury</i> for acceding to my request to print three articles on the National Education Bill at present being debated in Parliament.</block>

<p>We are going to have three articles. This is the first one. This is what is going to put the Bill before the people of South Africa and before the people of Natal. This is going to give them the true facts on the Bill. Let me quote what he wrote. He said the following in the first article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus for 18 months the Natal Director of Education acting as agent on behalf of the Natal executive committee and with their approval agreed on certain points and proposed certain amendments and finally reached agreement on the points to be embodied in the draft legislation.</block>

<p>I challenge the hon. member to prove that. I say that it is untrue&#x2014;it is utterly untrue. There was no agreement by the Natal executive to all the points contained in this draft legislation. I repeat the words, &#x201C;and finally reached agreement&#x201D;, and I say that there was no agreement. The article goes on to deal with free education and books. This was after his statement which the hon. the Minister correctly repudiated. Dealing with fee&#x2014;paying schools, the hon. member wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This clause does not seek to alter the status or character of fee&#x2014;paying schools.</block>

<p>This was on the same day that our amendment simply stating that the status and character of the fee&#x2014;paying schools be retained was found to be out of order. On the same day that the Chair rules that we cannot move that amendment, that hon. member tells the people of Natal that the character and status will not be changed. He goes on in the same column&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Participation by the parent community in parent&#x2014;teacher associations, etc.</block>

But this is the hon. member who accuses the Press and the United Party of misleading the people of Natal. It is just as well that the Minister flatly repudiated him. Then the hon. member got up in the House and quoted a mass of figures to try to prove what? To prove the obvious, that parallel&#x2014;medium schools depend on where the children are to be found, and where you have a concentration of children, by parental option, by the choice of the parents, those children attend the schools which the parents wish them to attend within the area. But what the hon. member did not tell the House was that he himself and his provincial councillor have organized among parents to split existing parallel&#x2014;medium schools into separate schools for English and Afrikaans.

<p>The hon. member himself edited a newspaper during the election where he published a letter dealing with the splitting up of schools, following requests by groups of parents to split them into separate English and Afrikaans schools&#x2014;not to establish another parallel&#x2014;medium school but to split them up into separate schools. I say that the machinery is there to have parallel&#x2014;medium education in every school in Natal, and it is the political agitation of the Nationalist Party and its organizers which drives the parents to split the existing schools when they get too big, not into a boys&#x2019; school and a girls&#x2019; school, both parallel medium, but into separate schools, English and Afrikaans. Because we believe in parental option in Natal, we acceded to those requests. This Bill takes away the right to do that. It is no wonder that when that hon. member left the Chamber, the first person to congratulate him with enthusiasm and endearment was a former leader of the Grey Shirt movement. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, we are dealing with education. That hon. member has attacked us for being unnational. I am stating a fact. It is true that as he walked out of the Chamber he was congratulated in German by a former Grey Shirt. I am not prepared to have my patriotism questioned. I have fought for my country and I will not have any hon. member, least of all that hon. member, question my integrity as a South African. I challenge anyone on that side of the House to match me in patriotism when it comes to service to South Africa.</p>

<p>What this Bill has done is to demonstrate the fundamental difference and philosophy between <span class="col_2295-2296" refersTo="page_1165"/>the Nationalist Patry and the United Party. Forget the details for a moment. It indicates the fundamental difference between a party which is determined to have everything rigid and bound and tied within narrow limits, a party which is determined to destroy flexibility which is determined in everything it does to concentrate more and more power and which, having succeeded in the Transvaal where one of its own M.P.C.&#x2019;s, Mr. Gelden-huys, admitted that in the Transvaal education is used to politically indoctrinate people &#x2026; [Interjections.] Did any one of those hon. members repudiate Mr. Geldenhuys?

<p>This is what the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was every indication that eventually Afrikaans would become the national language of South Africa, the Chairman of the Genootskap vir die Handhawing van Afrikaans, Dr. H. J. Terblanche, said yesterday.</block>

<p>Not one of them repudiated it. They talk about stirring up racialism. This is the gentleman who sent a memorandum to the Cabinet. [Interjections.] The Minister is a member of the Cabinet. I ask him whether they received a memorandum from Dr. Terblanche and whether he has repudiated that memorandum. I ask him whether he will repudiate now publicly this statement that Afrikaans will become the national language of South Africa? While these statements are being made, let that side of the House point their finger at us and say that we are raking up racialism. Let them first repudiate the racialists in their own ranks. Let them first repudiate the narrow section in their own ranks who want to see only one thing in South Africa, and that is language domination by one section of the population. Let them get up and openly and publicly say to these people: There is no place for you in the political thinking of South Africa. Throughout the history of our party we have fought for equality and for mutual respect between the two language groups, and we practise it within our own ranks because we have English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking members sitting together on these benches and working together, not like two showpieces, two pieces wrapped in cottonwool and put in a glass window because they are so rare among the 126 Government members.</p>

<p>We are part of one party, living and thinking together as South Africans. That is what we stand for and that is why we are so bitterly opposed to this attempt to take over the education of our children, to indoctrinate them and to impose upon them a system of education which is alien to South Africa. [Interjection.] That is why I say that what this Bill has done, apart from the detail, is to point out this fundamental difference in the approach to nationhood and to true South Africanism, the approach to our future as a people which has been so highlighted by this determined attempt to destroy the local control by the provinces&#x2014;control by people not so involved in the controversial politics of Central Government, people who live in a calmer atmosphere, in the calmer atmosphere of these provincial councils. They can deal with education without passion and without bitterness and without getting involved in the sort of partisanship in which one gets involved when politicians at parliamentary level deal with it. That is being taken away by this Bill. Even the right to determine administration is placed in the hands of the Minister and then the Minister says he challenges us to name one child who has ever suffered in the field of language because of a Nationalist-controlled administration. The hon. member for Kensington quoted an example. He quoted an example where children suffered because they could not get their education in English.</p>

<p>The Minister ought now to stand up and withdraw this Bill, because that is the undertaking that he gave. The Minister said that if one English-speaking child suffered, he would withdraw the Bill. Was that not suffering, which the hon. member for Kensington read out? He mentioned 30 children in a school who were English-speaking and they could not be taught in their own Language because there were no books. I say that is the answer to the Minister&#x2019;s challenge, and be should drop this clause. It is also clear from the way the hon. the Minister is steamrolling this measure through the House that he did not dare to allow it to see the light of day so that public opinion could form around it in the proper way. This is a Bill which was rejected outright by Natal, a Bill which I am prepared to bet that the other three provinces will reject as far as the provisions in Clause 2 (2) (b) (c) and (d). I would like to see the reaction of the other provinces to that. It is a Bill which was rejected by the South African Teachers&#x2019; Association, a Bill which has never been before the thousands of parent associations, a Bill pushed in quietly and secretly, seen only by persons appointed by the Minister, and the people who are appointed by and are responsible to him. It was seen by the Provincial Administrations who were bound to secrecy. It is no wonder that the Minister does not dare to let this Bill see the light of day, because he knows that if it had seen the light of day, if the people of South Africa had had time to study this Bill, it would have aroused a storm which that Minister himself would not have dared fight against. The Minister may force it through this House, but I warn him that he cannot force it into the hearts of people&#x2014;the narrowness which this Bill gives him the right to try to force upon us. We will continue to fight for freedom for our children and for the control of children by their own parents.</p>

<p>Just as there is no need for me to call in the assistance of an engineer to help me distinguish between a wheelbarrow and a motor car, so easy it is for me to determine that the hon. member for Durban (Point) is no educationist and that he knows absolutely nothing about education. I shall tell the hon. member what he is. He is not an educationist and he knows nothing about teaching&#x2014;he is a political opportunist. Hon. members of the Opposition severed the words of hon. members on this side from their context and branded this Bill a Bill to protect children against their parents. That is untrue, of course. What the Bill seeks to do is to protect the children against the political wolves sitting over there. There is nothing left for them to scavenge nowadays and now they go about like a pack of wolves; they scavenge on the rubbish heaps and they want to see where they can snatch our children away from what is dear to them. Surely it is a fact that even while a child is still in the cradle the parents have already decided what that child&#x2019;s mother tongue will be, even before it has said its first word. Why would the Opposition change the parental choice when the child has to go to school at the age of five or six? Surely the parent decided, even while the child was still in the cradle, what the child&#x2019;s mother tongue was going to be, and through what medium the child would one day receive its education. I can understand that the hon. member tried to join battle with the hon. member for Umblatuzana. To me all that merely points to fears for the future, because the hon. member knows that this small band of United Party members representing Natal here are now living on borrowed time, and that their days here are numbered. The hon. member referred to things which Dr. Terblanche was supposed to have said outside, and he said that no-one on this side had repudiated him. But I want to ask the hon. member why he did not repudiate an hon. member on his side the other day, one who called an hon. member on this side, who is a good South African and who is sitting on this side from inner convictions, a quisling?</p>

<p>To-day the hon. member emerged as a racialist. He spoke about disunity. Mr. Sepaker, surely election upon election has been fought on mother-tongue education, and the hon. member knows as well as I do what the results of each of those elections were. Are not the result of those elections the fact that they are as shrivelled as they are to-day? I wonder whether the hon. member knows what the results of the municipal election in Johannesburg were? Does he know that the National Party increased its majority by 50 per cent? Where previously the National Party had ten representatives in the council, it now has 15 representatives, and I predict that within five years the National Party will take over Johannesburg. The hon. member talked about disunity, but hon. members of the Opposition are the people who want disunity. Let us consider what is happening in the Transvaal. During the past week-end I saw a fine sports meeting there at which Afrikaans-and English-speaking children competed on the track. The children taking part in the competition were not only the children from Afrikaans-and English-medium schools; there were also children from private English-medium schools.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Advisory Education Council was established in 1962, and surely hon. members of the Opposition knew even then that we were aiming for a national education policy. Surely the general election last year was also fought on that platform, and what was the result of the election? The National Party gained a tremendous victory, and now hon. members on that side want to come along afterwards and say that this policy will be rejected. But I am grateful for one thing, and that is that there is none of our teachers&#x2019; corps and children present on the gallery to hear on what level hon. members of the Opposition are conducting this debate on a matter which is so dear to us, teaching and education, to us matters of national interest. One may not say the word &#x201C;national&#x201D; to hon. members of the Opposition, but I wish the hon. member for Durban (Point) would listen to these definitions of the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;. I went to the trouble of consulting some dictionaries on the word &#x201C;nasionaal&#x201D;. In the first dictionary &#x201C;nasionaal&#x201D; is defined as follows: &#x201C;Wat die nasie betref.&#x201D; Another dictionary says: &#x201C;Wat kenmerkend van &#x2019;n nasie is, byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n nasionale vlag, &#x2019;n nasionale volkslied.&#x201D; Everything which is true to South Africa and characteristic of South Africa is national. I wonder whether the hon. member for Durban (Point) who makes such a fuss about &#x201C;national&#x201D; still drives on our national roads? Are &#x201C;national&#x201D; roads also something evil? Here the Opposition makes a fuss about the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;, but last year during the election they hawked the word about. Then they were not the &#x201C;United Party&#x201D;; they told the people that their party was called the &#x201C;United National Party&#x201D;. It is because they will not accept this word &#x201C;national&#x201D; that the youth of South Africa has rejected them completely, for what does the United Party offer the youth of South Africa? Even after the establishment of the Republic they are not contented. In Natal the portrait of a foreign queen must still be hanging next to the portrait of our State President. They are not satisfied with our national flag. On certain occasions the flag of a foreign country must still be flown next to our flag. Is that what they are offering the youth of South Africa?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to raise the debate to a somewhat higher level than the level on which hon. members of the Opposition conducted it. The education of future citizens is one of the most important tasks of the modern state. Apart from the increasing needs <span class="col_2299-2300" refersTo="page_1167"/>and the shortage of scientists, technicians and other leaders in every sphere of a nation&#x2019;s existence, it is also essential, with a view to the adaption and assimilation of future citizens, that the training and education offered by schools shall be of the utmost efficiency, and for that reason it is also an accepted fact that education is the most important longterm investment for a state and its government because it forms the basis of every state and every nation in the world. For that reason it is also imperative that education, from kindergarten education to the most advanced studies at a university, should form a unit. Such a unit may best be formed if all education is regarded, organized and controlled as an entity. Fortunately we now find, in 1967, that as far as education is concerned we shall also have a national education policy; for what we used to have was divided education on both the horizontal and vertical planes. On the horizontal plane we have that division between primary, secondary and university education, and on the vertical plane between our various provinces. That division merely caused all kinds of problems of which the child was the foremost victim and the greatest sufferer. We are now getting a policy which will not vary if one crosses a river or an 8" barbed-wire fence separating one province from another.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the parents apply certain criteria to this legislation. The greatest test for any legislation is whether it meets the requirements of the people outside, and I think this legislation has indeed passed that test, because it gives our parents and our children that which they have been asking for so long. One of the demands made by the parents is that divided control shall be abolished, because their parents were the victims of that and suffered most under it. The United Party complains day after day that expenditure is too high and that the Government is not curbing expenditure. Is divided control not also a cause of more expensive education, because it has the result that educational facilities in the provinces are duplicated? Divided control hampers the planning of educational programmes, the erection of buildings, the provision of equipment, the training of teachers, etc. A third demand made by parents to this legislation is the following: In view of the fact that the teacher has to act as the child&#x2019;s guardian for the major part of the day, the parent demands that the teacher shall interpret and convey the parent&#x2019;s view of life and the world in education, and that view is a Christian view. I believe that teaching and the education of children should take place on the basis of the parents&#x2019; view of life and the world, and to us that means that they should be educated on the basis of our nation&#x2019;s Christian view of life. The Christian basis for this view of life and the world is founded on Holy Scripture, and by Christian teaching and education for the child we mean teaching and education presented in the light of the Revelation of God in the Bible, and in order that the light of the Revelation of God contained in the Bible may shine in schools, I believe that religious instruction in accordance with the Bible should be the key subject at school. It must direct the spirit and tenor of all other subjects at school, in order that all instruction presented at school may be founded on the Christian basis of our people&#x2019;s view of life and the world. It must not be a mere subject of knowledge; it must also direct the spirit and tenor of the other subjects. Mr. Speaker, is not the school the only place where many of our pupils get to know religion? Therefore provision must also be made for those children, in view of the fact that parents sometimes neglect their duty so badly at home.</p>

<p>A considerable deal has been said about the mother tongue. I do not want to elaborate on that any further. It has been determined by educationists themselves what is best for the child, and not by political opportunists or political wolves like the ones we have here. What is more, what is in the interests of the child is also in the interests of the State, because so much money is spent on education. We must not retard the child&#x2019;s progress and prevent him from deriving the fullest benefit from the facilities offered at such great expense. Surely it is axiomatic that the best use should always be made of all human material. The child will now derive the greatest possible benefit from school training, and in view of the fact that through his mother tongue the child will derive the greatest benefit, the State will also derive the greatest benefit from that.</p>

<p>A third demand made of our education by the people outside is that it shall be national. By national education in teaching we mean teaching and education in which the national principle of love of one&#x2019;s own on the basis and within the framework of the Christian principle is realized effectively, and, in general, the tenor of teaching and all the activities of the school, in order that the child may thoroughly and proudly develop the spiritual and cultural heritage of the South African nation and become a worthy bearer of that cultural property. Teaching cannot divorce itself from this, but should derive from it its power and inspiration in all its aspects, inside and outside the classroom. On behalf of the teachers&#x2019; corps, the parents and the children of the Republic of South Africa I want to thank the hon. the Minister for clause 2 (1) (g), which provides for the co-ordination of syllabuses on a national basis. A uniform syllabus must be one of the most important demands made by the teachers, parents and children. Until now the provinces have been separated by the width of a river or the thickness of a bar-bedwire fence, as far as education was concerned, and we are therefore particularly grateful that the drafting of uniform basic syllabuses for certain subjects has already been commenced with. When parents are transferred from one province to another or from one town to another, it has always been their greatest fear that their children will become the victims of <span class="col_2301-2302" refersTo="page_1168"/>divided control in education and of its concomitant problems. Until now one of the greatest problems has been the very fact that syllabuses differ from one province to the next. I know of three reasonably intelligent boys whose parents moved from the Transvaal to the Cape. Each of those three boys failed the year they studied in the Cape&#x2014;which is not attributable to less competent teachers, but to adjustment problems. But in this way problems were created not only for the parents and the children, but also for the teachers who had to teach arrivals from another province. And yet the teacher and his school frequently have to take the blame for the education system. But not only that&#x2014;not even the same subjects are presented from one province to the next. In the Transvaal we even have the position that if a child has to move from one school to another, he may experience difficulties as a result of the different order in which the work is dealt with at the various schools. I now hope that in the implementation of this Act the hon. the Minister will also see to it that apart from uniform syllabuses the order in which the work is offered in terms of those syllabuses will also be uniform. We should not like to smother the initiative or individualism of the teacher, because they may cause stagnation, but I do not believe that uniform syllabuses and a uniform order in the presentation of subjects should deprive the teacher of his own initiative and individualism.</p>

<p>It is clear that the differences between this side of the House and that side of the House will not be smoothed out simply by dealing with this measure. This is very clear to me after the debate which we have had on this measure and which has lasted for days. It is also very clear to me why this is so. All of the speakers on the Government side confined themselves to the educational principles which are at stake, the principle that this legislation is directed at and is centred upon the child. On the one hand, these questions were asked: What are the interests of the child and therefore of the nation, and by what methods can they be attained? On the other hand, the trouble with hon. members on the other side of the House is that they used this opportunity for politicking, for trying to rouse a great deal of suspicion about petty methods which were applied, or rather, which from the nature of the case could not be handled differently, and for trying to bring this legislation into discredit with the public. Unfortunately for them they did not succeed in this. The future will bear tesitmony to this&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I make so bold as to say that the Opposition will yet become strong supporters of this legislation in the future. Unfortunately the time at my disposal for replying to this debate is also limited, and consequently I shall not be able to reply to all the questions which were asked. However, I should like to try once again to clarify a matter which has been raised repeatedly, namely the position in respect of the fee-paying schools. It struck me that confusion existed, and that is why I want to make a last attempt now to clarify this matter as much as possible. In clause 2 (1) (e) of the Bill, the principle of providing free instruction, training, books and stationery in public Government schools, is being laid down. We all agree on this&#x2014;this is the point at issue in that clause. This provision does not apply to private schools, irrespective of whether they receive a subsidy from the State&#x2014;a subsidy from the provinces is also to be included here, because the provinces form part of the State. In other words, this provision does not apply to private schools at all. In every province there are a few schools in which a well-established practice has developed over the years, namely that parents pay a considerable amount of money in respect of school fees. The provinces keep back part of these fees as partial repayment for the usual services provided in Government schools, while the rest is paid into school funds for the purpose of defraying the cost of extra services and facilities, such as the maintenance and provision of sports fields, additional library facilities, teaching aids, film projectors, films, wall maps, models, etc. The basic principle in this clause is to grant to the children of all citizens of this country the right to free education, books and stationery, just as is the case in a Government school. But this does not mean that parents who insist on paying for the education of their children, in spite of the fact that they are taxpayers, are to be forbidden to continue doing so. Now I want to put it this way: If the provinces and the National Advisory Education Council, when I consult them in regard to the determination of the policy in respect of this matter, were to recommend that schools in which the levying of fees is compulsory, should continue with that practice. I shall consider it sympathetically. I hope this satisfies hon. members.</p>

<p>That is irrelevant. All that is relevant here, is that these fee-paying schools should be granted the right to charge fees. In the event of that being recommended to me, I shall consider it sympathetically.</p>

<p>First of all there is another problem I have to eliminate immediately. I cannot confine myself to arguing about one matter only. We have quite a number of them here. The hon. member for Kensington said that I had failed in my challenge; that there was an English-speaking child to whom justice was not being done. I do not think so, Mr. Speaker. It is a question of providing the <span class="col_2303-2304" refersTo="page_1169"/>English-speaking child with the education he wants in his mother tongue, and also of text books which are temporarily unobtainable at the moment. It will take 18 months to translate them. It was short-sightedness on the part of the Department concerned to prescribe text books which were not available in the language in which the children could use them. But this may in fact afford me a very good argument to the effect that such cases do crop up and that it is high time a national education policy was determined in terms of which the children &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about your challenge?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My challenge stands. Those children are not being wronged by their having to use those Afrikaans text books; the teacher concerned has been charged with the task of immediately translating that book page for page and with teaching them that subject in their own mother tongue. In my time I had to translate many English books of which Afrikaans versions were unavailable. That was not the point. The point was the injustice which was being done to the child, namely that he wanted to receive his training in his mother tongue, but was unable to receive such training. The hon. member is measuring my corn by his own bushel, but I think his own bushel is suspect.</p>

<p>The hon. member, continually called attention to these teachers&#x2019; associations and the way they felt about this Bill. Fortunately there was only one member who did that. I suppose I shall be permitted to read a letter I received from one of these teachers&#x2019; associations on 1st March. It was from the Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie. The executive of the S.A.O.U. wrote to me as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At a meeting this afternoon it was with great satisfaction and gratitude that the &#x2026; unanimously took cognizance of the contents of the Bill on the national education policy and the Bill on educational services.</block>

<p>In this morning&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> there was a statement of which they sent me a copy and which I shall not read again here.</p>

<p>When the hon. member refers to the School and Home Council which said that it was wrong and which stated that they could not get hold of the legislation, I just want to furnish the following information: 1,300 copies of this Bill were printed, and they can be obtained from the Government Printer at 5 cents each. If the School and Home Council is such an old institution, they ought to have known long ago that copies are obtainable from that source, if they were as curious as that. I am furnishing this information because the hon. member complained that they could not get hold of a copy at all.</p>

<p>I want to help the hon. the Minister. On a point of explanation, may I say to the hon. the Minister that it was not the Home and School Council. It was the Council of Education.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, only the name is wrong. It is the Council of Education. However, they were also unable to get hold of the Bill. The hon. member said that they dated back to the previous century. They are one of the oldest bodies and they could not obtain it. Then we should merely tell them that if they are curious in future, the Bill is quite easily obtainable from the Government Printer.</p>

<p>About the hon. member for Wynberg I cannot say anything but that her whole argument was founded on totally wrong principles. This is her trouble; nowhere in this legislation a fixed policy is set out in detail. Principles are being laid down here on which a policy is to be developed. Let me mention to you just one example of her ways&#x2014;I can mention many. The hon. member wanted to know what we were going to do in regard to technical and other types of education. It stands to reason that this is a point of policy with us, namely that every child will receive his education according to his aptitude. The child&#x2019;s aptitude in various spheres will now be developed by means of the various types of schools. That is something to build on for the future. I am sorry that the hon. member rendered herself guilty of that.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban (North) that I think that Natal should be glad that the Mitchells are so few in number, because it is in fact a good thing for us that these people are so few in number. The speech he made here, really reminded me of the story of the mice which drank the brandy in the saucers and then said: &#x201C;Let the cats come now!&#x201D; I say that because he struck a defiant pose here and said: &#x201C;You can make these laws, but my children will never do those things. I shall watch whether you indoctrinate them. I shall do this and I shall do that.&#x201D; He displayed open rebellion and resistance. These people do us a lot of good, because if one is a responsible member of this House&#x2014;because he accuses me of not being a responsible member; he says that I am not even a member here at all and that I have nothing to say here&#x2014;one does not talk that way. Then one has to shoulder one&#x2019;s responsibilities. Soon, when this Act is passed, it will be in the Statute Book. The hon. member does, of course, always have the right to criticize, and, Mr. Speaker, as far as I am concerned, I want to say of this Act that it is a good one. I need not furnish any reason for saying that this is good legislation. But this is also a defective law. It lacks something.</p>

<p>The basic defect in this Bill is the fact that it does not contain a provision in which the matter of teacher training is also brought to finality. This matter was mentioned here, and it is a fact that in the Republic of South Africa no fewer than 117 different teachers&#x2019; certificates are being issued by the various provinces and my own Department. What I advocate, and I hope that hon. Opposition also <span class="col_2305-2306" refersTo="page_1170"/>does so, is that, if we want to make a success of any system under this Act or anywhere else, we should raise the teaching profession to the level of a true profession. One cannot merely do so by adjusting salaries. There are opportunities for doing so in this legislation, but we were unable to cut the Gordian knot. In my Second Reading speech I said that if one wanted to do that, they would also have to comply with professional standards and write examinations with equivalent certificates. What is happening at the moment, is that each province claims that its teacher training is the best. They are stealing a march on one another. The members of the legal profession, the medical profession and so many other professions who unite themselves into one large professional association, are the people who succeed in having their legal, medical and other certificates recognized by one central body. I want to express the hope once again&#x2014;and not only the hope, but also the expectation&#x2014;that we shall be able to introduce amending legislation next year and that this advice which has to be given to me in regard to the training of teachers, will be given in time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is being expected of me&#x2014;not only in this House, but also in the country as a whole&#x2014;to state how I intend to carry this measure into effect. Now I should like to request the Opposition to stop being prejudiced and to listen to me. I want to make a very serious statement here. I accept the fact that this legislation confers very wide powers upon me in my capacity as the relevant Minister of Education, Arts and Science. I realize that by using those powers wrongly and by applying them unwisely, I may render myself guilty of offences, because that would amount to betraying a profession. I want to state&#x2014;and I should also like to commit my successors to this&#x2014;that in applying this legislation and carrying it into effect, care, a great amount of fairness and caution will have to be exercised, because we shall always have to bear in mind that certain practices have been in existence for as long as 57 years, and that such practices cannot, as it were, simply be stamped out, demolished and destroyed by a sledge-hammer. I hope that hon. members of this House will accept that from me.</p>

<p>We run into many difficulties in drafting legislation such as this, and every now and then we have to go to the trouble of finding out whether the legislation is still good. One person obejcts to this and another to that. Drawn-out procedures will not be necessary in the future, but everything will take place after proper consultation with the Administrators, the Education Council and/or the Committee of Educational Heads, because now we are concerned with the interests of the child, the interests of the country, and we may not simply set about this matter in a topsy-turvy fashion&#x2014;advice has to be obtained. I shall see to it, when this measure is enacted, that all white pupils belonging to the two language groups, as well as white immigrant children, receive the best educational training. With the assistance I am being given by this legislation in the form of the advisory bodies, I shall do everything in my power to see to it that the child receives his training and his education in his mother tongue and that there is equal treatment in respect of the two language groups.</p>

<p>I am taking note, and I have taken note, of the current educational practices which are being applied in various parts of our country. I have taken note of specific practices in certain provinces which have been recommended to me. I have also taken note of specific educational practices in other provinces which have been condemned by some people and defended by others. I understand and I realize only too well, seeing that I myself was a member of the teaching profession, that each province has, over a period of 57 years, become particularly jealous of its own system, that each province has also been rather narrow in its outlook and blind to the merits of other systems and that it has been imagining its own system to be the best. We should therefore take that into account and realize that we cannot simply sweep them away all at once. That will most definitely not happen. That is why consultation and the task of convincing them will have to take place all the time, not on political grounds, but on educational principles. Those educational principles will be laid down and determined by educationists or competent people who are sufficiently informed about education. Now I want to give hon. members a small piece of advice. Let this legislation be a lesson to us&#x2014;we may not, we dare not, nor should we ever again make education a political matter in future. We have enough other spheres in which we can fight. Let us approach this matter with pure principles, even though we may differ from one another. The only pure principles we discussed here, are really such that I am unable to mention them, because we succumbed to the temptation of making them the subject of politicking.</p>

<p>I want to conclude, Sir, by saying that I am inviting all educationists, irrespective of the language groups they belong to, all educational bodies, everybody who has a direct or indirect interest in education, to co-operate cordially in serving the interests of this most precious and greatest national possession, namely the unshaped child, with the greatest sense of responsibility with which we should handle such a matter. Let us think of the interests of that child with our hearts first and then with our minds to see whether his interests will not perhaps be prejudiced by this or that system. Because it is the responsibility of the present generation to mould the future generation in the various spheres, in order that they may not only be an asset to their country and their people, but, as the hon. member for Boksburg said a moment ago, that there may also be assets which will count towards life hereafter. As a Christian nation it is our obligation <span class="col_2307-2308" refersTo="page_1171"/>to uphold the Christian character of this nation which is interwoven with the Western culture and the Western Christian idea which is our heritage. It is our duty to instil in them as South African citizens, next to their loyalty to God, the greatest loyalty to this country, so that they may be prepared to make every sacrifice for this country. Hon. members say that all these things are unnecessary. They say I simply want to indoctrinate. I fling that aside with the contempt it deserves, because, Sir, that was something which was ugly in this debate, that was the ugliness which cropped up in this debate. I fling that aside with contempt, because hon. members only want to discuss the national character. Just think of the progress which has already been made in the field of national unity, so much so that since we became a Republic we as political parties have already begun to show a marked degree of similarity in respect of many matters. The differences which existed between us&#x2014;whether we should be bound to another country&#x2014;we have already succeeded in eliminating. We no longer sought help overseas when we started having difficulties in this country. We knew that we had to stand on our own feet and use our own resources. We in this House were prepared, without any hon. member dissenting, to vote millions of rand for the defence of our country. That is why the need is as great now as it has ever been before for us to promote unity, and we should do more to foster in our young children a national character, and we should help to mould them so that they may recognize the finest attributes in every little thing in South Africa&#x2014;the finest country, the finest flora, the finest rivers&#x2014;and so that they may appreciate them. If we are able to do that, the next generation will not have so many differences. Therefore, once we have disposed of this legislation, let us join hands and proceed on the road of doing our best for the children of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Last night when the House adjourned I was dealing with the question of the hardening of attitude, as exhibited by the severe penalties imposed in this clause. My question to the hon. the Minister was why there was this hardening of attitude when in fact these penalties are being applied to people in respect of their own homes which are being taken away as the result of the proclamation of a group area or by expropriation. <span class="col_2309-2310" refersTo="page_1172"/>for the purpose of slum clearance and so on. We on this side of the House believe that this hardening of attitude in relation to the expropriation or the taking over of people&#x2019;s homes was quite unnecessary. I believe that our attitude towards people who have to be moved should be one of kindness and consideration and that every effort should be made to help these people to re-establish themselves in the areas to which they have to go. It does not matter what attitude the hon. the Minister adopts towards this process of moving people, the person who is moved is always the loser, because although on paper he may in fact show a profit on the deal, it costs him a great deal more to re-establish himself, and now in addition to that the hon. the Minister is providing here for penalties which are out of all proportion to the so-called crime which these people commit if they do not comply with the requirements laid down by him. If a disqualified person, in other words, a person who can no longer stay in a particular group area, commits an offence by making unauthorized alterations, he is subject to a penalty which is different from the penalty imposed on a person who does this in regard to land which is to be set aside for slum clearance or renewal schemes. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us why he wants these particular penalties and why the difference. I should like him to go into some detail in this regard because we on this side of the House are not at all satisfied with the stringency of the penalties and with this hardening of attitude towards people who do not fall in with his every whim and wish in applying the Community Development Act.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Let me begin by saying that the hon. member is quite wrong in suggesting that the provisions of this clause are indicative of a hardening of attitude on our part as far as these people are concerned. That is not the case at all. The existing Act provides that a person who is guilty of certain specified offences shall be liable to a fine not exceeding R1,000 or to imprisonment for two years, or to both. Those specified offences are the following: If such a person gives an answer to any question by, or makes any relevant statement to, an inspector or a valuator which is false in any particular material, knowing such answer or statement to be false, in other words, if he deliberately makes a false statement. The same penalty applied if a person hindered or resisted any inspector or valuator in the exercise of his powers or in the performance of his functions. Under the existing Act any person who hinders or resists any inspector in the performance of his functions is liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding R1,000 or to imprisonment for two years. If an owner refuses to say within 30 days how much he wants for his land, he is, upon conviction, liable to a fine not exceeding R1,000 or to imprisonment for two years, and all that is now being done in regard to this last example that I have mentioned is that the section is being better worded and that a new offence is being added, namely if he effects alterations to his property, makes additions, erects new structures, and so forth, without the approval of the board. I shall come to that in a moment. I maintain that such an offence in connection with the entire resettlement of people is a more serious one than merely obstructing an official in the performance of his functions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>But not for five years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is quite another argument altogether. That is the reason why provision has to be made for these penalties. Formerly that person could apply to the board if he wanted to effect alterations to his property or if he wanted to make structural improvements or erect a new structure, and if the board granted the application, the value of such alterations, improvements or new structures could be added to the basic value. If it had been done without the approval of the board, the board could in its discretion add it or not. In this Bill we are granting these persons the right to retain for themselves the full appreciation on their property for a period of five years; there is no longer any appreciation contribution, and that can easily give rise to large-scale improvements or changes to property, especially if the owner can increase the value thereby, and that will not assist in getting the removal carried out as soon as possible. Because the concession that he does not have to pay the appreciation contribution for five years has been made, we now have to place a prohibition on alterations without the approval of the board, and if one imposes a prohibition one must also have a penalty clause in case the owner does not observe the prohibition. Hon. members should remember that this has merely been inserted in the existing penalty clause, in which the exiting fine or period of imprisonment or both is prescribed. But it is only the maximum that is prescribed. What the actual fine or penalty will be is and remains at the discretion of the court of trial. If it is a person who has acted <i>bona fide</i> or who has made a small alteration to a house for maintenance purposes, no presiding officer of any court will impose a severe penalty on that person. Surely hon. members know that we can have absolute faith in our judiciary in matters of this kind. Such a presiding officer may perhaps issue a warning and dismiss the person if he appears before the court at all. It is important to remember that this penalty provision is not more severe than the one already standing in the Act in respect of other lesser offences than this.</p>

<p>As far as the second penalty provision is concerned, namely that in connection with areas which have to be renewed or slum areas which have to be cleared, etc., the fines are not the same. The hon. member said yesterday <span class="col_2311-2312" refersTo="page_1173"/>that the penalty in the first case was much more severe than that in the second case. In actual fact the penalty in the second case, in connection with slum clearance or urban renewal, is much more severe, because over and above the fine of R500 or imprisonment for one year the person may be ordered by the court to demolish the alteration effected or the structure erected by him. In other words, he can in fact be penalized more severely, and taken as a whole it is in fact a much more severe penalty than the first one. Here too it is completely at the discretion of the Court. I really think that hon. members should allow this matter to remain as it stands and to go through like this.</p>

<p>I may just point out that most of these areas are situated within local authority areas. I think that is an important point. The local authorities must give permission and approve of the plans. In considering such plans local authorities may only take into account their own bye-laws. They are not allowed to approve or reject a plan on account of other considerations such as the provisions of the Group Areas Act and so forth. They must consider the plan purely on its own merits within the framework of their town planning scheme. It may therefore happen that they grant permission to erect a building or effect alterations to an unsuitable person, while this Act prohibits it. It is my intention to point out to all local authorities that this provision has now been inserted in the Act, and that in considering those plans and prior to granting their approval they should warn the people concerned that they are not allowed to effect these structural or other alterations without the approval of the board, so that every person within a local authority area who wants to effect such an alteration may know before doing so that he is liable to a penalty if he does so. It is easy for us to do that with the assistance we receive from local authorities. If any person then knowingly and deliberately proceeds with such alterations, he should, in my opinion, be severely punished.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I might have misunderstood the hon. the Minister. Do I understand that a contravention of section 32 (10), which is incorporated in clause 5 of this Bill, carries a penalty of R1,000? For exactly the same thing, that is, making alterations without the permission of the relevant authority, whether it be slum clearance or urban renewals, it is to be less, namely R500. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, in the one case there is to be publication in the <i>Gazette</i> in terms of section 32 (10) but in terms of clause 5 there will be no publication.</p>

<p>I have not said that there will be a higher penalty. I said that it is in fact a lower penalty than in the second instance because it provides for a fine or imprisonment only whereas in the other case there can be a penalty of a fine or imprisonment and the demolition of the structure, which might cost him a few thousand rand.</p>

<p>That makes all the difference. He then gets, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, an appreciation contribution for whatever improvements he might have made over a period of five years. That sounds much more reasonable if that is so. Even if a person does make the alteration and sells the house in five years he may be fined for doing that without permission but he can recover the value of the property over five years and no order for demolition can be delivered.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister is not quite correct because in the first instance if a person makes alterations or erects buildings in terms of section 32 (10), the Minister is removing the power of the board to add it to his basic value. He is removing that discretion. The position is that the Minister still has not told us why in the case of a person who has five years to dispose of his property without having to make an appreciation contribution, it is nceessary to do this at all. It should not be necessary to penalize him at all because the board has no financial interest in the matter at all. Why then impose the penalty? It is only after a period of five years that the board becomes interested. Then of course the board can impose a penalty if he has erected structures. They then impose a penalty by refusing to include the value of those structures in the basic value of the property. Then the person has to pay a higher appreciation contribution to the board, which in itself is a penalty. Those are the two aspects which I do not understand. It would help us considerably if the Minister would deal with those aspects.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to make it clear that a disqualified person is prohibited from enlarging his building or erecting a new building. If he does that he is subject to <span class="col_2313-2314" refersTo="page_1174"/>the penalty clause. If he has done that, he can still dispose of that building within a period of five years and recover the full costs which he incurred in connection with it by placing it on the open market or selling it in some other way. I have been asked why it is necessary to include a penalty clause here at all. I have already said that while one allows that, one must prevent undesirable development by disqualified persons from taking place. We have had cases where white owners erected buildings in a declared coloured area, buildings which were far too luxurious, too expensive, for members of the coloured community. That made those buildings difficult to sell. Consequently the board was under a sort of moral obligation to compensate them. It is this type of unheard-of thing that we want to prevent. Similar things have happened among other race groups as well. So, for example it happened in a certain rural town that an Indian had a business stand on fairly large premises. The premises were situated in a white area. He then erected a large block of flats behind the shop and placed Indians in those flats because occupation rights by Indians attached to those premises. It is this type of thing that we want to try and prevent.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This is a very short Bill, but nevertheless a most important one. Past experience in the implementation of the Seeds Act revealed certain shortcomings in the present provisions. In this regard it became apparent in particular that the prescriptions in respect of taking samples, releasing and keeping in custody seed, and of certain powers to be exercised by the Minister, gave rise to certain problems. I want to give a brief summary of the objects of the amendments before the House. In terms of clause 1 a considerable deal of time and labour will be saved in taking samples, and it will also mean that smaller quantities of seed may be taken for sampling purposes than at present. It frequently happens that very small quantities of valuable seed are imported, and by the old methods a good deal of such seed was lost, at the cost of the importer. This measure is consequently also a protective measure for the benefit of the importer.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 2 the powers of the Minister are expanded to authorize him to decide in certain specific cases on what conditions seed may be imported for experimental or reproduction purposes and to exempt it from the provision that it shall first be placed on the varietal list before being released. The reason for this is that some seed varieties cultivated overseas are imported for production purposes only, and the reproduced product is then exported in turn. That is the case with green peas, for example. Green pea seed is cultivated overseas to adapt it specifically to certain tastes which may develop from time to time, almost the way feminine fashions change. Not only do skirts become shorter, but they also prefer longer green pea pods. The seed is imported and planted here, and then the product is exported in its preserved form&#x2014;in other words, we are actually becoming a factory with regard to seed. We get the raw materials which are planted here, and the entire crop is harvested here and exported. This processed product earns our country foreign exchange, of course. If the imported seed has to be tested first and placed on the varietal list later, a process which sometimes takes a few years, the variety concerned will be of very little value for the purpose for which it was imported, because by that time new varieties will have appeared to suit the latest tastes of the consumers. It remains a matter of changing taste. I may just add that this arrangement is contemplated only in respect of exceptional cases, and that the control of seed to be introduced on these terms will be strictly applied. That means that such seed which is not placed on the varietal list cannot be put on the market as seed&#x2014;everything must be preserved.</p>

<p>As for clauses 3 and 4, I want to say that although most of the importers and their agents are of great assistance to our officers in the execution of their duties, there are nevertheless persons who hamper the work of the officers, in that seed from which samples are to be taken is not always placed in a position readily accessible to the officers. In future officers will be able to demand all the necessary assistance from importers and from their agents, and it will constitute a contravention of the Act if officers are not allowed to perform their duty speedily and efficiently. Thus, <span class="col_2315-2316" refersTo="page_1175"/>for example, we have had cases where inspectors arrived to take samples of seed and were informed that the seed was in stores. As a result they had to go to the store and hunt for that seed in among scores of other bags. We cannot tolerate that. Furthermore, it is a waste of man-power.</p>

<p>This Bill has been submitted to all interested organized concerns, and the measures contained in it are welcomed in all quarters.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>When the Seeds Act was introduced in this House in 1961, it met with general agreement. Originally the principal object of the 1961 Act was to provide for the registration of cleaners and sellers of seed. In addition it provided that the Minister could establish a seed certification scheme and a seed export scheme. In other words, the object of the 1961 Act was to make efficient control possible, whether the seed was sold locally or offered for export. In view of the fact that there was agreement when the principal Act was dealt with here in 1961, and since the Bill the Minister has now introduced does not affect the principles of that Act, we consent to this Bill. Fantastic amounts are spent annually by farmers and others on seed. Therefore the quality of seed is of the utmost importance, because it may have a major influence on the chances of success. In terms of section 16 of the principal Act, which relates to analysts and inspectors who take samples of seed, three samples had to be taken by them, i.e. one for the analyst, one for the farmer and one to be kept by the inspector himself. We agree with the Minister that that was quite unnecessary, particularly if it is borne in mind that the seed is so expensive and that three samples are therefore not necessary and that only one should be taken.</p>

<p>We are also in agreement with the Minister as far as clause 2 is concerned. Clause 3, through which we want to prevent people from hampering the inspection of seed, seed, for example, which is imported through a harbour or other port of entry, in that there may be agents who do not provide the necessary facilities to inspectors, is in our opinion also essential.</p>

<p>Because no material amendments are effected through this measure, and because these are merely administrative arrangements to improve the implementation of the Seeds Act of 1961, this House consents to the amendments introduced here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill merely provides for the repeal of the Adulterated Leather Act of 1923. The only thing hon. members can want to know from me is why this Act is now being repealed. I shall explain briefly. There are two reasons for the decision that this Act is no longer necessary and should be repealed. In the first place, the Adulterated Leather Act was put on the Statute Book in 1923. The object of the Act was to protect the public and to enable the Government to afford such protection in respect of leather which was placed on the market. In those days leather was tanned by means of mineral and vegetable agents. The object was to prevent these agents from containing more than a certain percentage of other ingredients. The techniques and chemicals used for tanning leather in those days were not very reliable, and it was essential to protect the public. Since then tanning techniques have improved a great deal, and one can also rely upon the chemicals used at present. Consequently it is not so necessary any more to exercise control over the standard of these products, and as a result this Act has to some extent fallen into disuse.</p>

<p>The second and important reason is the fact that the Standards Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1945. This Act provides that the South African Bureau of Standards may lay down compulsory and voluntary standard specifications in respect of certain commodities, which may then be published with the permission of the Minister. Since then certain standards have thus been laid down and published in respect of certain kinds of leather. The present position is that the Standards Act contains all the authority that is needed to exercise the necessary control over leather, and consequently it is felt that the Adulterated Leather Act of 1923 is no longer necessary for the purpose of exercising control over the quality of leather, as provision for that is made in the Standards Act. It has therefore been decided to repeal that Act.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned last week I was pointing out that one of the major advantages of this measure was that it did not interfere either with the studies of coloured students or with the work of those who are employed. In other words, the Bill is actually aimed at those people who constitute the greatest problem to the coloured community and the State, namely those who neither want to work nor want to study. This legislation offers opportunities to those young coloured men who attend training camps in terms of this measure and who come from homes where the parents not only show no sense of responsibility towards their children but also do not know how to discipline their children. Not only that, but I believe that in those camps these young men can regain some self-confidence if they are able to spend a year in an atmosphere where they know that somebody and the Government are interested in them and in their future. I also believe this measure is something which we as Whites can envy them, because we have very similar problems to cope with, for example boys who are simply waiting for the day when they reach the age of 16 so that they may leave school, and who do not want to work or to study any further. Those boys in our white community enter life without any training and they will have to do unskilled work for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Something which makes this Bill even more attractive is the fact that this training will be given with due regard to the cadets&#x2019; aptitudes, educational qualifications, physical condition, capabilities, and so forth. In other words, not only those young men who are sufficiently intelligent and physically fit will be trained there, but everybody will be trained there, even those who are physically unfit or who do not have the capacity to do any other work. I think the hon. the Minister may be congratulated with the training which is being planned and which will consist mainly of training for some occupation or other, to which will be added the necessary provision for recreation and sport. What I think is also very important is that the spiritual needs and welfare of those young men looked after, in that this measure also provides for the appointment of ministers of religion.</p>

<p>I want to plead with the Minister that Coloureds from anywhere in the Republic be included in this measure. There are thousands of Coloureds in the Transvaal. I want to refer to Boksburg in particular, the constituency which I represent and where we have a Coloured community of approximately 10,000 people. I feel that the young men of that Coloured community should also be afforded the opportunity of being admitted to these camps. According to a survey carried out in August last year, approximately 90 per cent of the Coloured males who are working are employed in industries. I wonder whether it will not even be possible to have a training camp in the Transvaal. Under the policy of parallel development many Coloureds will be needed to supply their own services and needs. We need only think of the police services, commerce, and even the public service, where provision is being made for Coloureds to play a more important part and where they will also have to do their share.</p>

<p>Apart from all these things, Sir, I believe that we can increase the standard of living of the Coloureds through these training camps. They will be enabled to be self-supporting to a large extent. What is more, this is a positive step towards developing national pride amongst the Coloureds. I am particularly pleased about clause 22 of the measure, which provides that the hon. the Minister grant approval for medals or certificates to be awarded to cadets on certain conditions. If I may make a prediction here to-day I want to say that those medals and certificates which are going to be awarded to cadets will be something of which every cadet will be proud. They will be much sought-after medals and certificates.</p>

<p>I may just mention that the Coloured community itself welcomes this legislation, and that those of them who have a sense of responsibility support it wholeheartedly. I want to read a letter to you which I have received from a Coloured person, a certain Mr. September. He is a member of the Coloured Education Council in the Republic, chairman of the Transvaal Coloured Teachers&#x2019; Association, chairman of the consultative committee of Reiger Park&#x2014;the Coloured area in Boksburg&#x2014;and chairman of the &#x201C;Witwatersrandse Ko√∂rdinerende Kultuurraad&#x201D;. He also serves on quite a number of management bodies. This is what Mr. September writes (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As I have done in the past in the case of other Bills, I herewith want to express my heart-felt thanks for the sincere and honest way in which the National Party Government is looking after the interests of the Coloured population. The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, Mr. Marais Viljoen, is also congratulated on having at so early a stage in the present Parliamentary session <span class="col_2319-2320" refersTo="page_1177"/>once again provided concrete proof of the fact that he has the upliftment of our people at heart by introducing the above mentioned Bill, which provides for the establishment and maintenance of training centres for Coloured cadets and for their compulsory training for some kind of employment or other. I am convinced that this will assist many Coloured youths not only to be better citizens of our beloved country but also to be an asset to our own community. In this connection one has in mind particularly the skolly type and the won&#x2019;t-works who are a blot on the name of our population group and who are harmful to our community and our country. All the matters connected with this Bill testify to the fact that the Government has given serious consideration to promoting vigorously by this means the upliftment of our Coloured population within the framework of itssocio-economic development programme. To my mind all the various aspects of the Bill have been worked out thoroughly and for that reason I regard it as perfectly acceptable. I am concerned about the future of every one of our young people, and I am sure that juvenile delinquency will be eliminated either to a large extent or totally by this measure as a result of the fact that self-discipline and a sense of responsibility will be developed through the training our cadets are going to receive. For this very reason the Coloured population is greatly indebted to the Minister and the Government.</block>

<p>It may seem a little ungrateful of me to say that perhaps this Bill should have been introduced long ago, but by this very statement I want to show the necessity and my personal gratitude for this measure. It is true that the so-called &#x201C;well-intentioned&#x201D; will object to the fact that the training is compulsory, but because I have the fullest confidence in the Government I am sure that all sensible Coloured people will welcome this Bill with open arms.</p>

<p>I recall that a Railway Service Battalion (R.S.B.) was established at Kimberley more than 30 years ago, and although that limited and voluntary service training was intended only for Railway workers, there was a feeling of regret amongst the Coloured population when that training centre was closed down after a short period of approximately five years. I once again want to convey my sincere thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs and to the Government for the fact that matters relating to the upliftment of our people are being expedited, and I also want to express my best wishes and gratitude to you for promoting our interests so vigorously.</p>

<p>May the Lord bestow his richest blessings upon you.</p>

<p>I therefore say that we can congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation, legislation which shows once again that this Government has the interests of the Coloured population at heart.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House will always regard with a critical eye any legislation which we feel might open the door to forced or even directed labour in South Africa. I want to be perfectly frank and say that my first reaction after reading this Bill was one of extreme suspicion and distrust, because I felt that there were many very unsatisfactory features contained in the Bill. I felt too that I could not support the Bill in its present form. But I must say that after having listened very carefully to the Second Reading Speech by the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. I am now fairly satisfied in my own mind that the Minister has brought the Bill forward because he believes quite sincerely that its effect will be to uplift and give direction to a certain section of the Coloured community in South Africa. Obviously we on this side of the House are always prepared to support any measure which we think might have the effect of improving the lot of the Coloured people in South Africa.</p>

<p>Having said that, I think that in all fairness I should warn the Minister that he should not be complacent about this measure. Because it is a fact that there are many people in South Africa to-day who feel very unhappy about this legislation, and in fact would like to see the Opposition reject the Bill entirely. I think, too, that the Minister must carry his full share for this feeling of distrust which certain people have against the Bill. Because, Sir, when the Bill was first published the Minister failed to explain clearly to the people what the true objects of the Bill were. I want to say that quite obviously, the very unfortunate statement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, had the immediate effect of coupling this Bill to the whole question of a restricted Bantu labour force in the Western Cape. I feel that the hon. Minister will agree that his words also lent a certain amount of stigma to the whole cadet scheme. I want to say that I find it quite deplorable that there is not a better system of liaison amongst our Cabinet Ministers. I certainly do not question the right of any Minister to make a statement when he feels a statement should be made. But one would think that when Ministers are going to make statements on controversial matters, at least they will come together and iron out their thoughts before making these particular statements.</p>

<p>I mentioned before that many people still feel very unhappy about this Bill. They suspect it. I want to suggest to the Minister that when the Opposition comes forward with certain amendments and suggestions during the Committee Stage, he should consider these very favourably. Because I feel that if this is done, many people who want to reject the Bill now, will in fact favour it then.</p>

<p>I feel, too, that possibly the Minister is being rather over-optimistic in regard to the results which this Bill will bring about. There is <span class="col_2321-2322" refersTo="page_1178"/>no doubt in my mind that possibly the Minister will find out in the fullness of time that by adopting more conventional means and by tackling the roots of the troubles which face our Coloured people to-day, he would have made much more progress. I know that he is optimistic about the Bill and that he expects much good to flow from it. I want to say that we on this side honestly hope that this will come about in the interests of the Coloured people. But I feel that the Minister himself is going to be rather disappointed at the results of this measure.</p>

<p>Let us look in the first place at the question of the Coloured male delinquent. I think that the Minister will find that figures show that 60 per cent of Coloured male delinquents are in the age group 18-24 years. Of these about two-thirds are employed. I think that we can assume quite safely that of the unemployed sector, at least half will seek employment to avoid being detained under this Bill. It would appear then that the net effect of this Bill will be to drive possibly one in ten delinquents into a job whilst possibly one in ten will be confined to an institution for a year or two.</p>

<p>I think that it is also accepted&#x2014;and I think figures will prove me right&#x2014;that the majority of offences committed are committed during the evening and over week-ends, in other words, during leisure time. One wonders what the effect will be of detaining one in ten delinquents on the crime rate in South Africa. Then, too, one wonders whether the legislation will have any effect on the truly work-shy Coloured. Because we know that unless there is a continuous threat of re-detention hanging over their heads, these people will seek to avoid employment again. One wonders then whether this Bill is really going to have the effect which the Minister envisages.</p>

<p>I want to say, too, that another aspect that worries me is that the Bill as it stands does not guarantee that recruits who go to this particular training centre will leave it with any added skills. Because the definition says that he may be trained for any type of employment. I also feel that the Minister should tell us in his reply whether he does not feel that this Bill will reduce the bargaining power of the ordinary Coloured male. We know that because of the threat hanging over their heads many Coloured males who are not ordinary delinquents will grab at any type of employment to avoid being detained. Obviously this will benefit the unscrupulous employer, and I think the Minister should give very careful attention to this aspect of the Bill.</p>

<p>I feel, too, that the Minister should not let this particular Bill cloud his vision. I said earlier that I do not think that the Minister has attacked the basic cause of the problems which beset the Coloured people to-day. I hope that he will give very careful attention to the whole question of doing something more constructive for the Coloured people. By this I mean that he should give very serious attention to the question of compulsory education for all Coloured children. I believe that he should see to it that proper technical training centres are provided to train Coloured youths. It is also very important&#x2014;I should say imperative&#x2014;to provide adequate cultural and sporting facilities for the Coloured youth of South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel that the Minister should see to it that added opportunities are made available in different spheres of work for the Coloured youth of South Africa. By this I mean that the whole sphere of employment should be broadened for the Coloured people of South Africa. I feel that the Minister must not think that because we have supported the principle of the Bill we are happy about it. I want to make a plea again that when we submit certain amendments and suggestions at the Committee stage he will regard them seriously and treat them accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned last night I was saying that I was surprised, while listening to the speeches of hon. members of the United Party, because every single speech made attacked the Bill we are considering to-day. Hardly any hon. member had anything good to say for this Bill. The most they would say was that they hoped this would deal with some aspects of this skolly problem. That is the only good thing they had to say about the Bill. It is significant that the hon. member for Peninsula, the Coloured Representative who is also supporting this Bill, as did the United Party, who, as I say, spoke strongly against practically every clause in the Bill, also mentioned that this Bill went far beyond the objectives which had originally been stated. Even members on the Government side who have spoken on the Bill seemed to be under a complete misapprehension as to its meaning and certainly as to its far-reaching nature. For instance, the hon. member for Boksburg, who spoke yesterday, quoted a letter which he had received from a Coloured man, Mr. September, who wrote in favour of this Bill, but he also dealt only with the aspect of solving the skolly problem. The hon. the Minister himself, when he introduced the Second Reading, read out a quotation from the Council for Coloured Education supporting this Bill. He read a paragraph which stated that legislation should be introduced &#x201C;to conquer this skolly menace by the institution of labour camps for all Coloureds who are not in paid employment&#x201D;. In other words, even this Council which the Minister quoted as being in favour of the Bill (a) considered it as dealing with the skolly menace and (b) were careful to say that it should apply only to those persons not in paid employment. So as far as I can see, absolutely no good reason has been made out for supporting this Bill, except in so far as people hope that it will deal with the skolly menace. The interesting thing, of course, is that this is exactly what the hon. the Minister denied. When he introduced the Bill he denied that this was a Bill to deal only with skollies. In fact, he vehemently expressed the opinion that this Bill should not be called the Skolly Bill. He said that would immediately cast a blight on the whole proceedings, and he made it clear that as far as he was concerned he considered this to be a Bill for the uplift of the Coloured people. That is the attitude he adopted. I quite agree with the hon. the Minister when he says that this is not a Bill to deal with the skolly menace, because it deals with thousands upon thousands of Coloured youths between the ages of 18 and 24 who by no stretch of the imagination can be considered to be skollies. It deals with Coloured boys, whether they are respectable boys or delinquents, <span class="col_2331-2332" refersTo="page_1183"/>whether they are at school or not at school, and whether they are in employment or. not. So I agree with the Minister when he says that this is not a Bill to deal with the skolly menace. That is why I cannot understand hon. members on this side of the House supporting this Bill. Somebody mentioned the principle of the Bill. I am not sure what the principle is. The long title of this Bill is certainly no guide to it. We have had titles in this House, on many occasions, which have had nothing to do with the contents of the Bill, such as for instance the Extension of Higher Education Bill, which closed the open universities. Nobody supported that Bill because it was &#x201C;to extend education&#x201D; and, Sir, the title of the Bill has nothing to do with it. Until we know from the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to accept material amendments at the Committee Stage both in regard to the numbers of people to whom this is to apply, the groups of people to whom it is to apply and how it is to be applied, I cannot see how anybody can support the Second Reading of this Bill. It is not for me to teach the official Opposition parliamentary procedure, but since we are voting on the Bill as it is before us now, with all its objectionable aspects, surely the right thing for the Opposition to do would have been to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill and then, if they succeeded in persuading the hon. the Minister to accept material amendments to the Bill and to remove the various objectionable clauses from the Bill, they would have been entitled to support the Bill at the Third Reading. That is how I have always understood parliamentary procedure and I believe that is how any member who has any experience in this House understands parliamentary procedure. We are now voting on this Bill as it has been presented to the House at the Second Reading and unless material amendments are accepted at the Committee Stage and the Opposition has previous knowledge that this is to be so&#x2014;and I do not know how they could have had previous knowledge unless there has been more of this getting together business that I know nothing about&#x2014;their obvious course of action was to vote against the Bill at the Second Reading, to try to get their amendments accepted and then to reconsider their attitude at the Third Reading of the Bill. That, is of course, precisely what I intend to do. Because I disagree entirely with the hon. the Minister when he says that this Bill is designed to uplift the Coloured people. I have had a long, hard look at the Bill and I see nothing in it that is designed to uplift the Coloured people as a whole. I see it as a hopeless confession of abysmal failure to understand and tackle any of the root causes of Coloured delinquency and of unemployment among young Coloured people. Sir, as to the so-called solution proposed to this problem, I have the strongest objection to the far-reaching nature of the Bill that we are considering, and I must also say in all honesty that I have the gravest suspicion as to the actual motives behind this Bill, and therefore for all these reasons I shall vote against the Second Reading of this Bill. I wish to move the following amendment at this stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Training Centres for Coloured Cadets Bill because, <i>inter alia</i>, it vests in the Minister of Coloured Affairs complete control, enforceable by penal sanctions, over the daily lives, the pursuits and the employment of all Coloured males between the ages of 18 and 24 years.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to deal firstly with the contention, with which I agree, which has been put forward by other members, that this Bill fails to tackle the root causes of unemployment and delinquency amongst the Coloured youths. Sir, other members have referred to the lack of education for Coloured youths and to the lack of training. I do not wish to be repetitious so I am not going to repeat all those arguments with which I am in full agreement. I only want to emphasize one or two aspects of this particular side of the problem. I want to remind members of a few salient facts which in fact I brought to the notice of this House a few weeks ago. I want to remind the House that almost half of the Coloured children who go to school do not get beyond Std. I. They drop out barely literate and certainly in no condition to enter the labour market. Only 4.4 per cent of Coloured pupils enrolled in the Cape Province in 1966 were enrolled in Stds. VII to X, and I wish to point out that for most apprenticeships, Std. VII is the educational standard that has to be achieved. Only 32 per cent of Coloured schoolchildren were over 12 years of age and only 7.6 per cent of Coloured children going to school are over 15 years of age. That is to say, 92.4 per cent of the Coloured children in the Cape leave school before they are 15 years of age. They are already set in ways of idleness and delinquency by the time they have reached the age at which this Minister is prepared to take them under his benevolent wing, i.e. the age of 18 years; they have had years and years of idleness; they have had very little parental control and they have had no training, and this is the fundamental problem. For these people, this Bill does not offer any solution whatsoever. It does not touch this vast number of Coloured youths who leave school before they are 15 years old. Sir, Prof. Cilliers of Stellenbosch University had a lot to say about this subject when he addressed a symposium last year on the utilization of Coloured labour. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because there is no compulsory education for Coloured children, many leave school at an early age. They are therefore still too young for the labour market and this period of idleness leads to a negative attitude towards labour and an unwillingness to work.</block>

<p><span class="col_2333-2334" refersTo="page_1184"/>Generally alleviation of this condition can only be obtained when it has become possible to institute compulsory schooling for the Coloured population on a broad basis.</p>

<p>Sir. there is no sign of this in this Bill. There is no sign even that <i>pari passu</i> with this far-reaching measure to control the lives of all these people, the hon. the Minister is even contemplating the question of extending the areas of compulsory schooling for Coloured children. There is no sign, for instance, that he is going to raise Coloured teachers&#x2019; salaries so as to prevent the emigration of the many Coloured teachers who feel that they have no hope for their future in this country. In so far as the hon. the Minister tackles this problem of delinquency amongst Coloured youths at all, he tackles the results and he does not pay any attention to the causes of the problem.</p>

<p>My second objection to this Bill, of course, is that it is based on mass compulsion on a most far-reaching scale. Sir, I would emphasize again that all Coloured males between the ages of 18 and 24 have to register as recruits and that failure to do so is an offence which is punishable by heavy penalties, either a fine up to R200 or imprisonment up to six months. What is more, the certificates of recruitment must be produced on demand by any registering officer who can be anybody delegated by the hon. the Minister. Failure to produce on demand is an offence which is also subject to severe penalties. Sir. the point which the hon. the Minister should not underrate is the dismay of the entire Coloured population at the thought that a modified pass system is now going to be applied to Coloured youths, because that is what it is. It is not a pass law, of course, as we understand it in the case of the African and which, of course, completely hinders his freedom of movement and his ability to sell his labour in the market, but this does have the same effect on the Coloured youth who cannot produce his registration certificate or his exemption certificate or whatever it is to be called, on demand to anybody to whom the hon. the Minister delegates his authority. This is a modified pass system, and as I say the Minister should not underestimate the dismay that has been caused amongst Coloured people at the extension of this modified pass system to the Coloured people. Sir, so far all I can see is that the hon. the Minister has achieved the registration of every Coloured male youth between the ages of 18 and 24 years; he has not created a single job for them but he has created eight new crimes for which they can go to gaol. In dealing with the cost of this Bill the hon. the Minister mentioned that it was going to cost something like R1&#x00BD; million to set up these training camps and something like R380.000 per annum to administer. He said that that expenditure would be off-set by the fact that so many Coloured youths were falling into crime and had to go to gaol and that the cost of keeping them in gaol was very high. But the Minister is creating new crimes which are going to land Coloured youths in gaol who otherwise might never have seen the inside of a gaol. I wish to point that out to him, and in passing I want to point out that a far better investment for the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs would be to spend the estimated R2,000,000 per annum that it would cost this country, to introduce compulsory schooling for all Coloured children, to introduce school feeding schemes which would help to keep Coloured children at school for longer periods and to increase the pay of Coloured teachers which would provide the necessary additional teachers in order to implement a scheme of compulsory education.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I want to turn for a moment to the selection of recruits. The Bill lays down that the Minister shall from time to time determine the number of recruits to be selected for training but it gives no indication of the factors which the hon. the Minister has to take into consideration when he does that. I presume that this will include the facilities available for training, i.e. the number of camps to be set up, the accommodation provided for these young men, employment opportunities and labour requirements, and I have the strongest suspicion that it is the latter, the labour requirements, which will be the determining factor in the Minister&#x2019;s decision as to how many recruits he is going to call up. I want to mention again that to my mind the worst feature of this Bill is that a recruit can be called up for any kind of employment even though he is a full-time student, or an apprentice or a person already in full-time employment. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) was quite wrong last night when he said that so many people would rush off and get themselves employed just to escape this Bill. Getting employment will not help them to escape the Bill. It will not help them at all. Whether they are in a full-time job or at a university or at school there is nothing at all in this Bill that will necessarily exempt those people from recruitment and being put into training camps. Everybody here accepts the assurances of the hon. the Minister; the hon. member for Peninsula made a stirring speech about how he was accepting the assurances of the Minister of Coloured Affairs. Why should everybody accept his assurances? There is nothing of that kind in the Bill. Unless the Minister is prepared in the Committee Stage materially to amend the Bill, I have no faith in assurances. I noticed that yesterday and the day before and last week nobody on this side was prepared to accept the assurances of the hon. the Minister of Education. Arts and Science with regard to the education of White children. Oh no. where White children are concerned, they want the provisions laid down in the Bill; where Coloured children are concerned. they are prepared to accept the assurances given to them by the hon. the Minister. [Interjections.] That is exactly the point. There is nothing in this Bill at all which <i>per se</i> exempts Coloured youths in <span class="col_2335-2336" refersTo="page_1185"/>employment and Coloured youths at school from being called up and recruited for any kind of work that the hon. the Minister wishes to put them into, and hon. members of the Opposition know that perfectly well. If they do not know it then they have not read the Bill and then they should not be debating here.</p>

<p>Why so aggressive?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am fighting the Opposition on this score as hard as I am fighting the Government for the simple reason that hon. members of the Opposition are all in the same camp; they are all in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s training camp, and every time the United Party supports a Bill proposed by this Government and with which I profoundly disagree, I shall fight the Opposition just as hard as I fight the Government; make no mistake about that.</p>

<p>Sir, I might say that the type of training which is offered is also open to strong criticism as far as I am concerned. There is absolutely nothing in this Bill to tell us what kind of work these people are to be trained for and indeed it seems to me that most of these people many of whom have left school in Std. I&#x2014;because over half of them leave in Std. I&#x2014;and many more before they have reached the age of 15 will only be capable of being trained to be &#x201C;disciplined labourers&#x201D;, the phrase that has been used in connection with other pieces of legislation passed in this House. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has given us some hint about the disciplined labour for which these people are to be trained. As you know, Sir, he is reducing the number of Africans who may be employed as contract labourers. He goes further, but that is another matter, but certainly as far as contract labourers are concerned he is barring the additional employment of Africans, in the Cape at any rate, as vehicle drivers, room sweepers and cleaners, gardeners, newspaper sellers, icecream sellers, stable boys and grooms, delivery men, milkmen and so on. These are the sort of jobs out of which the Africans are going to be chased. And. of course, there is a considerable shortage of unskilled farm labour and there too, Africans are no longer allowed to be recruited in those areas in increased numbers. And there is the strongest suspicion that it is in these categories of labour that these young coloured men are going to be put. I do not only go by the Press statement of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration which he has denied. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that he was scandalously misouoted by, I think, <i>The Cape Times.</i> But. he cannot deny Hansard. After all, he can deny what he said to the Press because they have no come-back. But he cannot deny what he said in this House. And here Hansard has it. In a debate earlier this session I raised this whole question of the hon. the Minister endorsing Africans out of the Western Cape and I mentioned to him that there was a considerable shortage of labour in the Cape and particularly in those fields out of which African workers were being endorsed. And I asked at that stage&#x2014;Hansard Column 892 of 8th February, 1967&#x2014;whether the Deputy Minister had taken into consideration the availability of non-Bantu labour for these jobs. And what did he say? He said yes he had. I then asked whether he knew what the figures were for unemployment among Coloured people in the Western Cape, and whether he had the slightest idea of how impossible it was for employers to fill vacancies in the categories that he has determined should now be forbidden areas. To this the reply of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education was: &#x201C;Did you read about the new legislation in <i>The Cape Times</i> this morning? And what was that new legislation? It is the very Bill that we are considering to-day in this House. And I said that I had read that Bill with horror because I knew exactly what it meant. It meant that the whole idea behind this Bill was to see to it that Coloured youths were taken out of those training camps and put into the categories of labour where there was now going to be a shortage since Africans were being thrown out. And the hon. the Minister for Coloured Affairs carried on much the same way. He denied that this was the specific purpose of this Bill and said this: The primary object is to discipline and train these coloured youths. And then the hon. the Minister went on to say this: &#x201C;It is logical that those trained in such a way will become available among other things for any work now being done by Bantu.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If the hon. member will get up and tell me why I am wrong, I might have a little respect for his interjection. What I say is that with the background of Ministerial statements and back-bench pronouncements such as the one I have just listened to the connection between this Bill and the African removal scheme from the Cape is absolutely inescapable. The conclusion is inescapable. The Bill is not aimed at the uplift of the Coloured people. That, Sir, is just a <span class="col_2337-2338" refersTo="page_1186"/>sweetmeat to soften the Opposition. It is aimed at the provision of Coloured manual labour to replace Black manual labour. How the hon. the Minister can say that it does not mean compulsory labour is quite beyond me. Let me emphasize again. Every single Coloured youth between the ages of 18 and 24, whether in employment or not in employment, whether he has lawful means of support, whether he is at school or at an institution is, as the Bill is before this House now at Second Reading, liable to register as a recruit. Once he has been selected he becomes a cadet. And then even when he has served one year in a training centre, he is liable to be called up again at any time, for one year or an additional year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>And that is forced labour?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this is forced labour as far as I am concerned, because it directs people into avenues of employment which they do not voluntarily take. That is why it is forced labour and they are at the Minister&#x2019;s beck and call for six solid years. At any time, between the ages of 18 and 24, if hon. members would look at clause 16, and even after a young man has served his so-called term of training, he is still liable to be a cadet until he is 24 years of age. And, he would still be liable to be directed into any form of labour to which the hon. the Minister wishes to direct him. Now, how anybody could compare this with army training is beyond me. Where is the resemblance? Army training has honour and glory attached to it. When a young man has served his nine months or a year in the Army apart from the two weeks that he has to go to camp, for a series of years, he is free. He can choose to be employed where he wants to be employed. There is no similarity at all. Furthermore there is no similarity with the S.S.B. I think it was the hon. member for Malmesbury who said that this was similar to the S.S.B. that saved the poor-whites of this country. My goodness, Sir, if we were still waiting for the S.S.B. to save the poor-white problem of this country, we would still, I can assure you, be employing about 2,000 youths a year. That is all the S.S.B. managed at the time. That is all. And joining the S.S.B. was voluntary unless a youth was committed by a court as an alternative to go to gaol. But not even every young man who was unemployed had to be recruited for the S.S.B. And to join the Battalion, a young man had to have a minimum qualification of Std. VI. There is nothing in this Bill about minimum schooling to see that the Coloured youths will at least have eight years of schooling. The S.S.B. did not solve the poor-white problem. Not even the hon. member for Malmesbury can be so stupid as to think that. What solved the poor-white problem was industrialization, the drawing in of all our youths from rural areas and elsewhere into employment in industry, secondary industry. For heaven&#x2019;s sake! I do not wish to go into that. The thing I want to point out is that there is no relationship between army training for white youths and the S.S.B. which we had in previous years, and this Bill which we are considering before the House. And now I wish to sum up my objections. The Bill deals with effects and not causes, and it does nothing, as far as I can see, to uplift those coloured people who badly are in need of it, and that is the vast bulk of young Coloured people who leave school before they are 15 years of age and have fallen into ways of idleness. There is no sign as I have said of an extension of compulsory areas of schooling for Coloureds. It is not even <i>pari passu</i> tackling the root problem on a long-term basis together with some sort of short-term emergency basis. I might point out that there are Children&#x2019;s Acts in this country. There are probation officers and there are industrial schools. All these methods of corrective treatment are available for Coloured as well as White youths.</p>

<p>We need more probation officers as well as more schools for the short term. We want more probation officers, more proper industrial schools if we want to tackle the youths below the age of 19 who have fallen foul of the law. And over the age of 19 the ordinary laws of the land, I would say, are quite good enough, or should be, to tackle problems of crime. Why does the hon. the Minister not do something about better policing in the Coloured areas, about Bonteheuwel, for instance, with its miserable lack of police, and so on? I do not mind if criminals go to gaol; and that is where the hon. The Deputy Minister does not understand my philosophy at all. I have no objection to people going to gaol if they are criminals after they have been tried in a court of law and found guilty and convicted. I have no objection to that at all. That is the normal system of punishment for crime and I am obviously all in favour of it. But I object to people being scooped up from the streets, from the schools and from their jobs at the Minister&#x2019;s behest and sent to jobs that they do not want to do. That is what I am objecting to in this Bill. There is plenty that we can do to put down this skolly menace if we wish to. I have voiced my main objections as far as the production of these certificates is concerned, the non-production of which will be an offence involving heavy penalties and the fact that this is an extension of a modified pass system to the Coloureds. My final contention is that this is typical of a Bill dealing with people who have been deprived of political rights. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton has, as usual, looked at this Bill through her traditionally liberalistic spectacles and the image she sees through those spectacles is so distorted that few people can agree with her that what she sees can be the true picture. The hon. member and her <span class="col_2339-2340" refersTo="page_1187"/>party boast that they are the friends of the Coloureds. The hon. member tried this morning to put up the defence that they wanted to protect the interests of the Coloureds. I wish to contend that a person and a party who oppose to such an extent and see so many evils in this positive, constructive legislation, which is aimed at trying to rectify a chronic disease in the social life of the Coloureds, are in fact and quite definitely no friend of the Coloureds. Apparently it suits the hon. member and her party very well that that element of lack of discipline amongst the Coloured community should continue to exist so that they may exploit it, because they know that as soon as that community also becomes an orderly and disciplined one they will not be able to get anywhere with their slogans and political wiles. The hon. member was up in arms here about the education system of the Coloureds and could find nothing good in it, but surely that is not the case. Surely the hon. member knows that this party has done a very great deal for the Coloureds in the field of education during the past few years. The hon. member has probably paid a visit to the Coloured University here in the Western Cape? The hon. member has probably paid visits to all the Coloured schools throughout the country, schools which need not in any way play second fiddle to White schools and White facilities? It is a pity that this kind of thing is always seized upon by the hon. member and other members in order to break down what this Government is gradually building up. But, one cannot shut one&#x2019;s eyes to reality. There are at the moment between 80,000 and 90,000 young Coloured men who are largely unaffected by this measure. Now the hon. member is saying that &#x201C;whether they are respectable or delinquents&#x201D;, they are all being affected by this measure, whether they are at school or not. The hon. member probably did not read the Bill very carefully. Clause 14 provides quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board may at any time of its own accord or on application by any recruit or on his behalf on the prescribed form, exempt any recruit permanently or for such period and on such conditions as the board may determine, from his liability to report for training or to undergo training or to complete his training &#x2026;</block>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, this board which is to be appointed will surely not consist of fanatics or people without any sense of responsibility. Where they will at the moment have a choice of between 80,000 and 90,000 people, from which a 1,000 per year will have to be selected, will this board now go and select from this number of people 1,000 recruits who are attending school or are in full-time employ? Surely that is not so? Surely they will go and look for people who will be in need of this training and this disciplined life. When this hon. member is distrustful towards the attitude of the party with whom she so readily sides when it comes to voting, I can quite understand her distrust. Personally I still do not know at this stage precisely where the hon. members of the Opposition stand with regard to this Bill. Apparently they are divided into two groups. The one group would like to support this legislation, whereas the other group apparently does not want to accept it. That is why their standpoint is such an uncertain one. In the <i>Evening Post</i> of 18th February, we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s new Bill to set up training centres for Coloured youths in the age group between 18 and 24 contains certain unacceptable provisions. This is the opinion of some United Party M.P.&#x2019;s who are resisting the attempts of their colleagues to persuade them to support the Bill. The measure is, in fact, being heatedly discussed in the United Party caucus where the official attitude appears to be that the Bill is acceptable in principle but that certain changes should be made. Some United Party M.P.&#x2019;s say they are prepared to take the Bill at its face value, which is that it purports to deal with the skolly and hooligan section amongst the Coloured youth. They say that if the Government is planning to establish the equivalent of the S.S.B. which existed for White youths before World War II. this is a move which should be welcomed. Other M.P.&#x2019;s however, say the provisions of the Bill are too sweeping. They declare that if their constituents asked them to prove that the Bill is not a totalitarian measure designed to introduce forced Coloured labour, they cannot give the assurance. Therefore they say that, before the United Party can support the Bill, the Government must make certain important changes.</block>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that there is a serious division in the ranks of the Opposition in regard to this Bill. At the same time it is encouraging to see that there are people who are not prepared to allow themselves to be taken in tow by the Progressive Party or by the Black Sash&#x2014;because the Black Sash has also issued circulars which more or less adhere to the standpoint of the hon. member for Houghton. However, it is also a pity that the official Opposition should adopt such an irresolute and undecided attitude in regard to such a cardinally important Bill with the result that nobody knows precisely where they stand. &#x201C;He who hesitates is lost&#x201D;, as the saying goes. That this is true of the Opposition has been proved once again by the setbacks they <span class="col_2341-2342" refersTo="page_1188"/>have suffered in the Johannesburg City Council.</p>

<p>I should like to point out how pressing the need for this legislation is. Anybody who has the interests and the survival of the Coloured population at heart, will welcome this Bill&#x2014;it is, in fact, being welcomed by eminent Coloured leaders throughout the country. The saying, &#x201C;The devil finds work for idle hands&#x201D;, is a true one. The result is the development of a skolly and hooligan element amongst the Coloureds. A few years ago I had to appoint a number of cleaners for the school with which I was associated. The work did not require much exertion. With the help of a Coloured leader I interviewed approximately 20 young Coloured men. Before any one of them could be appointed it was necessary for them to furnish a testimonial stating that they had worked for one employer for at least three consecutive months. Most of those whom I interviewed had had a schooling, some even up to Std. VI. In the most cases a period of six to eight years had elapsed since they had been at school and yet they were, without exception, unable to prove to me that they had worked for three consecutive months for one employer. The immediate impression I got was that these people were undisciplined and work-shy. In any case I ultimately appointed four of them&#x2014;two of them worked for only four days and then disappeared; the remaining two stayed a bit longer before they too disappeared. It is clear that these people are work-shy and undisciplined. It is also clear that it is necessary for them to be taught discipline over a long period of time. In order to support the need for this. I want to quote from a letter which appeared in the <i>Everting Post</i>, Port Elizabeth, of 18th February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Please tell us residents of Durban Road, Korsten, what steps to take now. as our lives are in danger with these &#x201C;skollies&#x201D; (gangsters) roaming the streets after sunset.</block>

<block name="quote">On Friday and Saturday nights they go into action, determined to get a week&#x2019;s salary or more by robbing people of their pay packets and clothing, parcels and groceries.</block>

<block name="quote">When I say clothing I don&#x2019;t only mean clothing that you carry in a parcel&#x2014;often they strip your clothes off in the street and give you a good beating-up before they leave you. On some occasions the victims have had to be rushed to hospital with internal and external injuries. Some had to be laid off work for some time.</block>

<block name="quote">These skollies smash motorists&#x2019; windscreens passing by in Durban Road. The poor motorist has no option but to carry on&#x2014;if he stops to ask questions about the damage done to his car he is in for big trouble&#x2026;.</block>

<block name="quote">We are afraid to go to a cinema or a dance because we are not sure whether we shall be able to reach home safely afterwards.</block>

<block name="quote">If any reader doubts these facts, let him come on a Saturday afternoon and witness the scenes outside one of the restaurants, it is disgraceful and cruel to see how some respectable people are attacked by the skollies when passing.</block>

<p>Surely it is quite clear from this that there is an element which cannot be cured by school training. That is why it is essential for this legislation to be passed so that this element can be properly disciplined and regulated.</p>

<p>I am by no means trying to maintain that the vast majority of Coloured youths display this degree of lack of discipline. Amongst many of them one finds a high degree of idealism, discipline and dedication, and I have respect for that. A while ago I had the privilege of addressing a number of high-school pupils attending Coloured schools. What struck me was the dedication, the rapt attention with which those pupils listened to me&#x2014;as if they wanted to absorb every word. It gave me reason to return to my own school and tell my own pupils that it had been a unique experience for me to talk to those Coloured children. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the existence of an undisciplined element.</p>

<p>What precisely does this legislation provide? It provides that all Coloured boys between the ages of 18 and 24 must register. That will be compulsory. It is essential for it to be compulsory, otherwise all kinds of ways and means would be found of evading this measure. Is it not compulsory for all 16-year-old White boys to have themselves registered? Why is it being said that we are doing an injustice to the Coloured boy by compelling him to register? No, Mr. Speaker, I foresee that these training centres which are going to be established for Coloured youths will have to be expanded considerably within a few years. I am saying that because 1,000 Coloured boys amount to only about 5 per cent of the approximate 20,000 who reach the age of 18 years each year. I should like to see that, just as the White boy has the privilege of receiving military training, so the Coloured <span class="col_2343-2344" refersTo="page_1189"/>boy will also have the advantage of receiving training as a cadet. The hon. the Minister of Defence indicated here last year how grateful the parents of children receiving military training were. One parent even went so far as to write, &#x201C;I sent you a sissy; you returned to me a man.&#x201D; If we want to be a friend to the Coloureds, why should we begrudge them this disciplined life? It is of course not the Government&#x2019;s policy to provide Coloureds with military training because we are not even able to give all our White boys military training. Military training was to a large extent a cure for the ducktail element amongst our White youth. Such training brings physical fitness, punctuality, keenness, alert-mindedness, enterprise, and it builds self-confidence. I foresee that these training centres will create these qualities in the Coloured youths. This measure will afford the Coloured youth the opportunity of developing these characteristics. Why should we then be so shortsighted as to deny them that opportunity? This Bill is nothing more than the equal of similar legislation which the Whites have had for some time now. There has been a reprehensible attempt by some newspapers to view this legislation as the establishment of labour camps. That view must be rejected. There is no &#x201C;forced labour&#x201D; here. They will undergo a period of training of one year and will then return as respected members of their separate communities. It is obvious that they will then be able to help supply the labour deficiency, particularly in view of the fact that practically all of them are now loafers. Surely that is logical. That is why I cannot see what justification there exists for the criticism levelled by the hon. member for Houghton. I believe that after these people have received their training, after they have been disciplined and regulated, they will be in demand amongst employers, whereas that is not the case at present. In reality the objective of this legislation is the training of half-adult juveniles, juveniles who, owing to a variety of causes, are already maladjusted at the age of 18 years. Initially these cadets will undergo a three-monthly clearance course in a youth centre. During these three months the course will concentrate mainly on basic principles, such as discipline, the obeying of orders, a healthy routine and way of life, hygienic habits and discipline in an ordered community. During these three months experts will diagnose the physical and mental abilities of these youths and then recommend them for a variety of differentiated training institutions. Some may be transferred to vocational schools&#x2014;of which there are already quite a number in existence, <i>inter alia</i> in Port Elizabeth, Durban, Kimberley and Johannesburg. In these vocational schools the Coloureds will then be able to undergo, as apprentices, a useful course of apprenticeship and will be able to qualify as useful citizens when they come out. Some of them may even return to the ordinary high schools if they have the intellectual capacity. Some may be placed in constructive work. Juveniles who are placed out after three months nevertheless remain under the care and supervision of school principals or employers for the remaining nine months. They remain answerable to the youth training centre where they underwent their course. I foresee that the vast majority of the cadets will be transferred after the three-monthly course to youth camps where they will be kept busy with constructive physical labour for the following nine months in a way which will be of great benefit to them and for the country as a whole. In reality it will be possible to lay great emphasis on a general form of land service. For the country juveniles a youth camp on the banks of the Orange River, for example, where the development points of the Orange River Scheme are being established, could be very useful. In the evenings constructive programmes could be arranged and lectures could be held so as to facilitate the adaptation of the cadet to a working community. Here the cadets will receive daily wages and will be fitted with their uniforms, as well as with working clothes. I can foresee that these young men will return to their homes as neat, disciplined young men after a year&#x2019;s training and that they will in reality be very worthwhile citizens there and will inculcate this disciplined life which they learnt in the camps into their homes and their communities, and will in this way be of great benefit to the Coloured community as such.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell for long on what the hon. member for Algoa had to say, except merely to warn him that he should not take too much notice of the so-called difference of opinion in the United Party and the hesitation he has been reading about in the newspapers. That will not get him very far. He ought to know by this time what the purpose of those articles and opinions in the Press is in regard to this legislation.</p>

<p>But I should like to return now to the hon. member for Houghton. She made a long speech and it would appear to me that she is against this legislation. She also tried to teach us a lesson here, in regard to how we should discuss legislation and what procedure we should follow. We are very grateful for the tips, but I can give her the assurance that we shall conduct this debate and oppose and discuss this legislation as we see fit. We shall not allow her or even the Government to prescribe to us how we should tackle this matter.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, I want to agree with her that this legislation does not go to the root of the difficulty prevailing to-day in the Coloured community. We also criticize the Government for deficiencies in the education and welfare work, etc., but I want to say to the hon. member for Houghton that if her party were to come into power and were to implement all their ideas which they have in regard to the Coloured community, we would in ten years&#x2019; time still have skollies and loafers. That is the problem which the Minister is now trying to <span class="col_2345-2346" refersTo="page_1190"/>deal with. The hon. member says that she is going to oppose both the Government and ourselves on this legislation. I do not think the Government is very afraid of her, but we are used to her opposing us. That is nothing new. As far as I can remember, the hon. member never raised her voice when we were discussing in this House legislation to have all the young white men registered for military service, but now that registration of Coloureds has to take place she has many objections to it. I just want to ask her this. If compulsory military service were to be introduced for the Coloureds, would she oppose it?</p>

<p>She is in favour of military service, but not in favour of the upliftment of these people who are not undergoing military training. The hon. member made this speech for her Press and for the publicity, and she could not care a rap about the consequences as long as she gets the publicity which she is so fond of. The hon. member tells us that most of the Coloureds support her views. I want to ask her this. Would she, after dark on any night of the week, walk down the streets of Bonteheuwel alone or in the company of a few of them? Those Coloureds who supposedly support her in her views, would they allow their wives and daughters to walk about unaccompanied at night? But the hon. member for Houghton wants to let this state of affairs continue.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have made it very clear that we think there are many deficiencies in the legislation, but that we agree with it in principle. In the Committee Stage we will attempt to move the necessary amendments where we think the legislation can be improved, and we hope that the Minister will help us to make of it a better piece of legislation than it is at present.</p>

<p>I should just like to tell the House that this attempt of the Minister is not the first attempt which has been made to uplift people in South Africa. You will remember the days of the Special Service Battalion. The results of that are known to us all. But what is not so well known to us is that another institution was also established. In 1935 the Pioneer Battalion was established, which had the same aims as the legislation now before us. In the Special Service Battalion the minimum qualification which the young men had to have was Std. VI, but that was during the depression years and there were many young men who did not even have Std. VI. who could not be taken up into the Special Service Battalion and who became a problem. The then Minister of Defence, Mr. Pirow, then established the Pioneer Battalion in order to try and rehabilitate those young men. That Pioneer Battalion, as I have said, was for the underprivileged, the young men who had found themselves in difficulties, who could not adapt themselves and who were a social problem. Many of them came willingly. Others were sent there by welfare organizations, by church bodies, and even by magistrates. Some of them found themselves in difficulties and the magistrates told them that they should enlist with that battalion and issued them with a warning. I was attached to that unit for almost two years and I can testify from experience to the good work which was done there. Many of the young men who arrived there presented a poor show. Most of them were scurvy, with long hair, and some of them arrived without any shoes.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I did not worry the hon. member, and my time is limited. Within the first two or three weeks after those young men had arrived there we had begun to realize their difficulties. There was at that time a group of people in Monument Avenue in Bloemfontein who called themselves the &#x201C;Sherry Gang&#x201D;. A few of those people were admitted, and I can give you the assurance, Sir, that one visit to Monument Avenue was enough.</p>

<p>The object of that unit was the rehabilitation of those unfortunate people. At that time we did not try to train them for a specific purpose. I want to level this criticism here. If the hon. the Minister thinks that he will be able to teach people a trade in one year&#x2019;s time, he will find that he cannot do so. However, there are other more important things which he will be able to do. We had them under military discipline, of course, and I can assure you, Sir, that we did not play around with them; we stood no nonsense from them. You know, Sir, that when one has a unit like that under military discipline one finds it possible to instil discipline in him in many ways.</p>

<p>The work we did was more in the nature of rehabilitation. It was work on the parade ground, athletics, boxing, wrestling, physical training and many lectures&#x2014;not lectures by clever people like psychologists, but by ordinary people such as you and I who laid down the law to them in a homely way. That they could understand, and it did them the world of good. We spent a lot of time teaching those people to sing. You know, if one can get a person to sing, he is already a person with a better disposition and one who has a better outlook on life. I have felt so often that if we could only teach the hon. member for Somerset East to sing, he would be a far better man! We did not try and make soldiers of those people; what we did succeed in doing in six months&#x2019; time&#x2014;it was only a six months&#x2019; course&#x2014;was to restore to those young men who arrived there in such a poor condition their self-respect and their pride in themselves. They went away with a new outlook on life. They developed a sense of responsibility, and in many cases we also succeeded in building them up physically.</p>

<p>There was, however, a small proportion who did not benefit very much. One will always find a few who fail to make the grade, but the <span class="col_2347-2348" refersTo="page_1191"/>vast majority of them left much better people than they were when they had arrived there. Although we did not try to teach them a trade or anything special like that, we did not have difficulty in posting them with employers. The employers came to us and stood waiting to get those young men on the completion of their course. They entered all walks of life, such as farming, the Railways, everywhere, and very few of them failed us.</p>

<p>I should like to hear from the Minister in his reply in what way these people are going to be dealt with. It appears to me&#x2014;and here I agree with the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;that it should be a military unit. I do not know whether there may perhaps be a stigma&#x2014;such as that of a reform school&#x2014;attached to that unit. If it were to be a purely military unit, it would have my wholehearted support. You know, Sir, when one has a person under military discipline there are a hundred and one ways of persuading and convincing him to do things which he would not like to do, and nobody is hurt in the process, not even that person himself. I see that there are certain penal provisions in the legislation. In military discipline there is not one drastic provision such as the one the Minister is proposing, i.e. to deprive a man of one meal per day. We do not do so in the military life, and yet we succeed in doing all these things in a very proper way.</p>

<p>It is no problem at all to place such people under military discipline. I definitely think that this is a step in the right direction and I am convinced that these young people who will have the privilege&#x2014;I am calling it a privilege because not all of them will be able to be admitted&#x2014;of serving in this unit for six months will be grateful for that and will never be sorry that they had the chance of doing so. I am sorry that there is no similar institution for many of our White boys. I readily concede that as far as White boys are concerned it is not as great a problem as it is in the case of Coloured boys. Fewer White boys would end up in gaols and at welfare organizations if similar training facilities existed for them. I say again that it is a pity that it is not possible to establish similar units for White boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are certain aspects of this Bill with which we do not agree. We shall propose amendments in the Committee Stage. We shall try and rectify those aspects and we want to express the hope at this stage that the Minister will accept our amendments, and if he does so we will have a better measure than the one we now have before us.</p>

<p>What I found particularly remarkable therefore&#x2014;and I want to express my thanks to the hon. member for North Rand, who has just resumed his seat, for having done so&#x2014;was the fact that he could venture to make a positive and constructive contribution to this debate. We concede that he has the right to have certain misgivings about this Bill, but in contrast to certain colleagues of his he did try to be positive as well as constructive. It so happens that in the course of this debate so far, various speakers on the Opposition side attacked one principle after the other in this Bill until we now eventually find that there is in reality not one principle remaining in this Bill which the Opposition as such supports collectively and unanimously. Of course, the Opposition finds itself on the horns of a particular dilemma. Even before the Bill came up for discussion, its English-language Press prescribed to it what attitude it should adopt, but because it feels that it also has the interests of the Coloureds at heart it had to be ambivalent in this regard, it has had to try and pacify its own Press and, to a certain extent, the Coloureds as well. The United Party&#x2019;s policy-maker, Stanley Uys of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, had the following to say about this Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If he does not attempt it, however, at least the United Party will be entitled to draw the conclusion that the Bill is primarily an ideological one intended to provide what in effect will be forced labour for the essentially ideological plan to remove all Africans from the Western Cape.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what a disgraceful allegation to make after the Minister in his Second Reading speech stated very clearly that these camps for the training of cadets could not be regarded as forced labour camps. What this newspaper had to say also found echo in certain speeches made by hon. members of the Opposition. But I shall proceed; this newspaper, in its edition of 26th February, alleges further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s motives in compelling all youths between 18 and 24 to register is apparent. It is to enable the police to approach any such youth and demand to see his exemption or registration certificate. It is to facilitate the work of the police therefore that all Coloured youths are to be forced to carry what in effect will be passes.</block>

<p>And that in spite of the fact that the hon. the Minister in his Second Reading speech made it very clear that police raids were not going to form part of the implementation of this measure. It is these kinds of allegations with <span class="col_2349-2350" refersTo="page_1192"/>which some members of the Opposition allow themselves to be taken in tow. I hope that the people outside and the Coloured community in particular will take note of this misrepresentation and these misplaced allegations which have been made by some Opposition members. Particularly interesting is the following remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mrs. Ballinger commented: &#x201C;South Africans of all colours should be under no illusions about the effect of this Bill. It can only immensely increase the sense of insecurity of the Coloured people, of the tens of thousands of parents whose children will now for the first time be forced into contact with the police, of the tens of thousands of exempted youths who will nevertheless be compelled to carry a piece of paper and of the thousands of displaced youths whose welfare the Bill purports to have at heart.</block>

<p>Since when is it a disgrace to come into contact with our police? Each year tens of thousands of White boys of the age of 16 have to register at police stations as citizens of this country. Quite suddenly now when this provision is also being made applicable to the Coloured yourths, it is a disgrace; quite suddenly now the position could arise that the police may infect those poor juveniles with some or other contagious evil. What a nonsensical allegation, an allegation which is purely aimed at placing this Bill and its good, idealistic objectives under suspicion as far as the Coloured population is concerned. Mr. Speaker. let us face the fact squarely that this entire Bill is merely aimed at benefiting the Coloured population; but according to the hon. the Opposition that idea may not be allowed to take root either amongst the Coloureds or amongst the Whites outside this House.</p>

<p>Much has been made in this debate already of the fact that the state of affairs which this measure is trying to combat is attributable to the fact that compulsory education has not yet been introduced for the Coloureds. It is very interesting to note that the United Party had, as far back as 1946, when it was still in power in the Cape Provincial Administration, placed an Ordinance on the Statute Book which gave it the right to introduce compulsory Coloured education in certain school board districts in the Cape. That Party was in power in the Cane Provincial Administration right up to 1954 but nothing came of that compulsory school attendance.</p>

<p>The attitude is being adopted here that because there is a symptom which is attributable to a pathological condition, the so-called lack of education amongst our Coloureds, we may not treat that svmptom: that canker in the national life of the Coloureds may not be removed because there is no compulsory school attendance for them. Is the fact that there is no compulsory school attendance for the Coloureds not the only cause of the abuses amongst and decadence of the Coloured youth? We have stated repeatedly on this side of the House that compulsory school attendance would probably be the ideal state of affairs but that there are many practical reasons which make it impossible at this stage; but because that is so should we now simply close our eyes to the consequences thereof, simply allow the <i>status quo</i> to continue and do nothing to combat it? It is interesting to note what was said in the Report of the Chairman of the Education Council for Coloureds in regard to the question of Coloured education. He was referring here to the reasons for the poor results in the Senior Certificate Examination in 1964. He gave other reasons as well, but I just want to read out a few specific reasons to this House&#x2014;</p>

<p>We must get away from the idea that the Whites and the Whites alone, that the Government and the Government alone, must be held responsible for the upliftment of the Coloured community. I hasten to say at once that I have great appreciation for the scores and scores of Coloureds in our country towns and in our cities who realize this defect in their own people and who are making purposeful attempts to create a national consciousness amongst their people and to raise them up out of the misery and difficulties in which they find themselves. We appreciate that, but there are still far too many people who leave this task of upliftment and education on the doorstep of the Government and on the doorstep of the Whites only. It must also be realized elsewhere that these things must be done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for that reason I extend my cordial welcome to this measure. Here the Government is once again displaying its awareness of its calling as the guardian of the <span class="col_2351-2352" refersTo="page_1193"/>Coloured people and is exercising in a very positive way its function of establishing separate development, with the emphasis on development. We have a situation in the rural areas which I have intimate knowledge of, it is particularly rife in the rural areas of the Cape, where we are saddled with a certain number of Coloureds who are totally workshy. We have reached the stage, particularly in the Eastern Cape, where White employers and particularly our farmers on the farms have begun to develop a certain resistence to the employment of Coloured labourers and give preference to Bantu labourers. There is a very sound reason for this. They found that the Coloured, owing to various circumstances&#x2014;I have mentioned them already and I do not want to make an issue of it&#x2014;are work-shy. When they have made a little money they are quite satisfied to live on it until there is no more left. Because there is no influx control in respect of Coloureds the position is very difficult. You must understand me very well, Sir. I am not pleading now for influx control of the Coloureds. I am just mentioning the fact that it does not exist in the locations in the White areas. We find that the Coloureds are making their way in ever-increasing numbers to the locations situated around the towns and are seeking to make a living there without working. Then the Coloured youth fall into immoral ways and take up dagga-smoking and other misdemeanours. It is for those kind of people that this legislation is being introduced in the first instance.</p>

<p>We would nevertheless be making a major error if we regarded this measure as being introduced only&#x2014;as the hon. member for Houghton expressed it&#x2014;in order to deal with the skolly type. I have already mentioned that the responsibility for the upliftment of the Coloureds&#x2019; social standards is something which the Coloureds themselves also have to undertake. That is why I am particularly pleased that this legislation is being made applicable to every Coloured juvenile who has reached the age of 16 years. Every such juvenile, once he has received education and training, and has had the privilege of undergoing parental discipline and training has an obligation to be of assistance to his weaker brethren and raise them up to his standard. I take it that use will be made of youth leaders in these centres, just as is the case in the army.</p>

<p>Where must those youth leaders come from? Where must we find those young men who have to help guide their weaker brethren if they are not admitted to the centres? Seen from that point of view I appreciate the fact that every Coloured who has reached the age of 16 years will be afforded the opportunity of being admitted to those camps. Those camps afford the ideal opportunity of creating amongst those Coloured youths an awareness of their responsibility towards their developing nation. It affords them the opportunity of boradening their cultural outlook and their cultural background. I believe that the people in question will avail themselves of this opportunity to the full. Just as in the case of the Coloureds, we Whites also entrust our future to our youth. We would very much like our youth to be activated in the cultural sphere. I advocate the same for the Coloured youth. We must avail ourselves of that opportunity. I know that they will only be in those centres for a very short period of time. But even if we just plant a little seed we may still succeed in developing cultured people. It is a well-known fact that the Colourrds have a particular liking for music, for the stage and for the arts. I think we must afford them the opportunity of letting that love which they have developed in those camps so that it may come into its own there, even if it is only the seed which is sown there. Those Coloured youths will leave those camps with a love for what they have been taught there, and it will work like a leavening agent amongst the rest of their community.</p>

<p>I hope that the Coloured community will avail itself of this opportunity to the full, that attention will be given to the way in which the Coloureds spend their free time, and that an appreciation of specific norms will be developed in them. I hope we shall avail ourselves of this opportunity to make of those Coloured boys full-fledged citizens of their community.</p>

<p>Tn conclusion I should like to raise a plea to the effect that we should in those camps for the Coloured boys design a uniform which will be both imaginative and colourful. The Coloureds are fond of that: they like dressing well. I feel that if we give them a neat, attractive, and colourful uniform we will develop in them a pride, in the first place in the centre and in the second place in their own person. By doing so we also develop in them a measure of self-respect and a love for what is their own. I hope that this plea will not fall on deaf ears.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that the points I wish to make in my speech will reply to the points that the hon. member for Cradock has made. I live in Cape Town, and although the hon. member also lives in the Cape Province, he is probably not aware of the extent of the problems which we have to put up with here. At the present time we in the Cape are faced with an immdediate problem. I listened to the hon. member for Houghton and her objections which she put forward. She is, of course, entitled to object to this particular measure if she does not like it. I noticed when the hon. member for Cradock was speaking he now and again used the word &#x201C;camps&#x201D; and then he went back to &#x201C;centres&#x201D;. The last thing that we want to do is to allow these centres to be known as labour camps.</p>

<p>In my oninion the introduction of this measure is really a reflection on our guardianship over the Coloured people of this country. I think that this is something which we White people have to accept. We have heard the former Minister of Coloured Affairs telling us about the socio-economic upliftment of the Coloured people. Now, the whole basis and <span class="col_2353-2354" refersTo="page_1194"/>the very core of that upliftment is, naturally, education. We have failed to keep pace in providing that education for them.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the hon. member for Cradock. I want to tell him that in 1945 when the U.P. was in power in the Cape Provincial Council it introduced an ordinance applying compulsory education to the Coloureds, and it was applied to six areas. In 1948 a change of government took place, and the then Administrator set up an educational commission which reported in 1956. Nothing was done. If the hon. member for Cradock had been in the Provincial Council and had seen, heard and studied what went on there over the years, he would have known how the Council fought over the years for more money for Coloured education. The Provincial Council in the Cape, which controls most of the Coloured education, fought over the years, as <b>I</b> say, to obtain more moeny for Coloured education. They operated on a very limited budget. Continuous representations were made by the Provincial Council by way of motions and resolutions, and with the whole-hearted support of the the Administrator the Government set up various commissions. We have had the Borckenhagen commission and the Schumann commission. The Borckenhagen commission has not reported yet. The Schumann commission has only made one report and that dealt with Coloured education in relation to its transfer to the Central Government. We have not seen the proposals regarding the financial relations between the provinces and the Central Government and we do not know what is happening. Then we had motions from the Government side of the provincial council asking for the take-over of Coloured education by the Central Government. To-day the Central Government controls Coloured education. I think there can be no argument about it, if one looks at the Estimates of Expenditure over the years one realizes that considerable sums of money have been spent on Coloured education since the take-over. On the Additional Estimates here we see that there is a crash programme as regards the building of schools.</p>

<p>I feel, Mr. Speaker, that this Bill is really a stop-gap. I hope, too, that it will only be a stop-gap. This is a crash programme to take over where we have failed. It is designed to take control of and discipline a certain section of our Coloured population, the &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-works&#x201D;. I do not like calling them skollies because the major portion of the Coloured population are well-respected persons, persons of standing, who do everything in their power to uplift their own people. They have their scouts, their church lads brigades, they do everything possible to raise their people above the level of the circumstances in which they have to live. So they are not all bad, Sir. But if one speaks to the Coloured people who live in the large townships one finds without exception that they want something done about these lay-abouts. I have been asked by these people, &#x201C;Why do you not put them into a camp? Do something with them&#x2014;clear them out&#x201D;. Well, one is reluctant to put anybody in a camp. We have had that experience all over the world. But if we look back, if we had given them better education and, with better education, better living conditions, we would not have been faced with our present-day problems. They live under some of the most terrible conditions, even though slums are being cleared up. But, Mr. Speaker, what we really do&#x2014;and I know that a former Minister of Coloured Affairs was annoyed with me for saying it&#x2014;is to move them to a new slum. I know that the Government is probably doing its best, but that is in fact the position. One has only to see the conditions under which our Coloureds live. If one goes to a general hospital one finds that the vast majority of out-patients are Coloured people or Bantu. At the Children&#x2019;s Hospital here in the Cape I think that about 80 per cent of the occupants of that hospital are Coloured children. One can see what is really happening. I say, that we have failed these people, although we have had plenty of time in which to act. When I say that &#x201C;we&#x201D; have failed, I mean the white people of this country. We then have to resort to measures such as this one now before the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has given this Bill a bad name. He referred to these centres as &#x201C;labour camps&#x201D;. The hon. member for Houghton has linked them to the possible removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. Nevertheless, as was said by hon. members from this side of the House, we must give this measure a chance to prove itself. Even the hon. member for Malmesbury allied these centres with labour camps. It is now up to the hon. the Minister and his department to remove the slur that has been cast on these centres.</p>

<p>I now want to talk about the registration of these Coloured youths between the ages of 18 and 24. The Bill provides for the estimating of ages. I think that we all know there are very few Coloured people who can produce their birth certificate or who really know what their exact age is. I can see great difficulty there, and I foresee Coloured men being stopped in the streets and being asked for their registration certificates, to which they might answer that they are only 17 or already 25 years.</p>

<p>But that is the position. As far as registration is concerned an ordinary policeman can be a registering officer. I presume for the sake of convenience it is necessary to have police stations as registration depots. However, this Bill is very closely connected with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s other department, the Department of Labour. Therefore one wonders whether the Department of Labour should not have controlled this registration, instead of having it done at police stations.</p>

<from><span class="col_2355-2356" refersTo="page_1195"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily. Apparently that hon. member does not know that every young person in the country, no matter to which race he belongs, is by law required to register with the Department of Labour for employment. Then there is the question of the documents these Coloured youths will have to carry. We have come to a stage where all of us have to carry certain documents but I was wondering whether it would not be possible to streamline these documents and to connect them somehow with labour registration certificates so that it would not be necessary for them to carry an unemployment card and an identity card in addition to a registration card for these centres. As I said, all of us have to carry certain documents but this is no reason why these could not be streamlined. I suggest to the Minister that he gives this some thought.</p>

<p>Then we have the selection board to be set up under this Bill, a board consisting of three people. As this measure mainly affects the Coloured population I think the Minister should give consideration to appointing at least one Coloured person to that board. There are, after all, responsible people amongst the Coloureds. I think there should be a Coloured person on that selection board in view of the fact that it is the Coloured youth that is being dealt with. If the Minister does this, it will allay a lot of suspicion as far as selection is concerned. The Minister told us that at the beginning it might be possible only to train about 1,000 youths in these centres. From that one must assume that this is more in the nature of a pilot scheme. I think the Minister is going to find that he will have to do a considerable amount of research work in order to get this whole scheme to work satisfactorily. There is, for instance, the question of training methods and of what these youths are going to do. Therefore I think it is wise to go first for a pilot scheme instead of going into it holus-bolus. As far as selection and intake are concerned it is interesting to note what the experiences were in the Cape Coloured Corps. In this connection Commandant Bredenkamp said that since the corps was established in April, 1963, there have been more than 2,000 inquiries, of whom only 414 were eventually accepted. So far 17 squadrons have received their basic training at the camp. Therefore, out of 2,000 applicants only 414 qualified. Admittedly the standards for the Cape Corps are higher than the standards expected for these training centres. However. I wonder whether the Minister has already decided on a standard of selection for these training camps. In the Cape Corps you will not find people who have served terms of imprisonment. I think the position is that out of 998 applications to join the Cape Corps, 112 were found to be medically unfit, 54 had criminal records, 68 were turned down by the selection board for other reasons, 98 did not have the necessary educational qualifications, 18 were under 18 years of age or above 35, 105 withdrew their applications whilst 22 were waiting for reference documents. Naturally the method of selection for these training centres will have to be undertaken on a different basis. There shall probably have to be different training centres&#x2014;a training centre for one type of recruit and another centre for another type of recruit. I submit that it will be wrong to recruit these boys and put them in the same camp with hardened criminals. I think it will be wrong to mix the two up. This is an indication of the type of research the Minister will have to do. Perhaps he could learn from the experience gained from the recruitment of members for the Cape Corps during the last war. There everyone who passed the health test was taken on, no matter whether he had a criminal record. The training in the Cape Corps&#x2014;and I had a lot to do with it&#x2014;was of such a nature that some very fine types were turned out. Many of those recruits came from the gutters of Cape Town but I do know that quite a number of them are to-day holding responsible positions in the Coloured community. When they originally joined up they were just nothing. But the Cape Corps made men of them. I should like to commend to the Minister that those recruits for these training centres who do not qualify medically should not just be discarded, but should be directed for treatment. When their physical condition precludes them from being taken into these training centres they should not be discarded but should be directed to a centre for treatment. Some of them may be found to have tuberculosis whilst others may stand in need of treatment for other diseases. My point is that they should not just be discarded. After all, it is our responsibility. A lot of them have to live under poor living conditions. So it won&#x2019;t be surprising if many of these recruits will be found to be medically unfit.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of changing over to the metric system of weights and measures <i>as soon as possible.</i></block>

<p>On 26th March, 1964, I moved a similar motion here, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2357-2358" refersTo="page_1196"/>That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of introducing the metric system for weights and measures.</block>

<p>In the course of the ensuing debate I pointed out the different systems of weights and measures which we have in South Africa and I mentioned their advantages and disadvantages. Consequently it will not be necessary for me to cover the same grounds on this occasion. Since that time there have been various investigations into this matter and in consequence of those investigations the Government decided to accept the metric system of weights and measures in principle. Here I should like to refer to what the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said in this regard in this House last year in pursuance of an argument advanced by the hon. member for Kensington. Incidentally, the hon. member for Kensington is an even greater champion of this system than I am. That also gives me reason to believe that to-day&#x2019;s discussion will not be of a contentious nature. According to Col. 2307 of the 1966 Hansard the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this regard I want to announce that the Government has in principle decided in favour of the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures. However, before we go any further, I want to have further discussions with organized industry. In fact, I have been informed that organized industry has certain difficulties. Before we take any further steps, I want to have those discussions with organized industry as soon as possible and only after that further steps will be decided upon. But in principle the Government has already accepted that we should change over to the metric system of weights and measures as soon as possible.</block>

<p>We are anxious to learn whether discussions have been held with commerce and industry. We realize that such a change-over will involve problems for industry. It is the only facet of our economic structure for which this change-over will involve problems, problems which will exist for a number of years before being solved. For that reason we shall be very pleased if the hon. the Minister can tell us whether discussions have already been held with industry.</p>

<p>Now I come to the question of how soon we have to and will be able to change over. There are several factors which can either delay or expedite the change-over. For that reason I should first like to discuss those factors in brief. We have a report by the South African Bureau of Standards on the metric system of weights and measures. The investigation was conducted under the chairmanship of professor T. H. Louw. That report appeared as long ago as 24th April, 1965. That committee conducted a very wide investigation. The committee did an outstanding job of work. We, as a House, owe it a debt of gratitude for that task which it performed for South Africa. The Bureau of Standards proved once more that it does pioneer work in South Africa. According to the report of that committee there are 93 countries in the world, with a joint population of 2,519,150,000, in which the metric system is already in use. As against that there are 50 countries, with a joint population of 527,496,000, where that is not the case. Calculated as a percentage, that means that 82.7 per cent of the population of the world already use the metric system at present as against 17.3 per cent which do not. Since that time, however, Japan and India have also changed over to the metric system. In addition to that we learned in the course of this week that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were also going to change over to the metric system. Furthermore, it is also the intention of Australia and New Zealand to depart from the ¬£.s.d. system. Also in the case of the United Kingdom we find that a Parliamentary commission has recommended the change-over to a system of decimal coinage. That shows you that the whole world trend is towards this one centralized system, the metric system, which is controlled internationally and which is uniform, and that the entire world is moving in that direction. If we look at our own international trade, we find that there has been a phenomenal growth in our foreign trade with the metric countries. In 1956 our exports to the metric countries were only 32.2 per cent, whereas they were 42.9 per cent in 1963. They increased by more than 10 per cent over a period of seven years, and at present they are even higher, but unfortunately I cannot give you the percentages. In 1956 our imports from the metric countries were 31.9 per cent and in 1963 they were 42.2 per cent, also more than a 10 per cent increase. However, it is very interesting to take cognizance of the value of our exports to those metric countries. Our exports to the metric countries amounted to R236 million in 1956, whereas they amounted to R355 million in 1963, an increase of R119 million during those seven years. The value of our imports from the metric countries amounted to R315 million in 1956, as against R506 million in 1963. Therefore you can see what a tremendous increase there has been.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we take the nonmetric countries&#x2014;and the following are the figures according to the report of the Bureau of Standards&#x2014;we find that exports to the nonmetric countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States. Canada, Australia, etc., decreased from R497 million in 1956 to R472 million in 1962. Thus we find that our trade is showing a decrease on the non-metric side whereas it is showing an increase on the metric side. However, our imports from the non-metric countries increased from R673 million to R694 million during that period. This committee conducted a very wide investigation for us. On the basis of the 2,330 questionnaires which it sent out, I want to give you the percentages of the different sectors that are in favour of this change-over. I shall take the respondents to the questionnaire from the various ramifications. <span class="col_2359-2360" refersTo="page_1197"/>Of the members of the Federated Chamber of Industries 67.3 per cent were in favour of the metric system. In respect of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of S.A. that figure was 65.8 per cent, in respect of the Association of Chambers of Commerce it was 57 per cent, in respect of the Afrikaanse Han-delsinstituut it was 67.8 per cent, in respect of agricultural bodies it was 69.2 per cent, in respect of the building industry it was 69.5 per cent, and in respect of the professional bodies it was 68.9 per cent. You can see that an average of nearly 70 per cent of all these various ramifications are in favour of, ask for and want this system, and want it really desperately. The following percentages of these various sectors said they saw no major difficulty in the change-over. In the case of industry the figure was 77 per cent, in the case of commerce 83 per cent, in the case of agriculture&#x2014;the people who might have complained&#x2014;91 per cent said that there would be no problem; in the case of the building industry the figure was 77 per cent and in the case of the professional bodies the figure was 80 per cent. These figures prove that those various sectors of our economy and of society are all in favour of the change-over, and we have nothing to fear as regards the introduction of this system, as a matter of fact, as regards its early introduction.</p>

<p>There is one factor which can delay this entire matter, and that is the cost of this change-over. That, from the nature of the case, is the important thing, of course, and we cannot proceed with the matter if the cost is too high or if it is not economic for South <b>Africa to do so. However, Sir, these people</b> made a very thorough study of the cost. This committee gave us an estimate of the cost and I want to quote from page 22 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Committee considers that no comparison between expenditure and gain is possible because the cost of conversion to the metric system is a definite amount incurred within a comparatively short period whereas the savings and gains resulting from greater efficiency continue for ever.</block>

<p>The estimated cost of conversion is as follows: The cost of converting 2,800 weighbridges would have been R 1,560,000 in 1965; the cost of converting 24,019 platform scales would have been R3,603,000; 10,751 counter platform scales, R570,000; 50,836 counter scales (including weights), R1,220,000; 35,317 self indicating scales, R2,684,000; 19 grain elevator scales, R8,000; 21 belt weighers, R9,000; 34,500 petrol pumps, R1,167,000; 6,670 length and area instruments (trade), R734.000; 47,787 capacity measures, R335,000; 10,500 oil metres, R242,000; 2,200 oil tanker metres, R97,000; 2,200 oil depot metres, R97,000, and to replace all the road signs in South Africa would have amounted to a total figure of R500,000, and the conversion of pressure gauges would have amounted to R100,000. These figures give one a cost of conversion, as estimated in 1965, of R 12,926,000 and to that we have to add administrative costs of R700,000 which gives one a total estimated cost of R13,626,000 if the conversion had been started in 1965. The committee went further than that and ascertained that if we kept postponing the matter and were only to start the conversion in 1966, it would cost R 14,688,000; if the conversion were to be started in 1967, it would cost R 15,834,000, and if it were only to start in 1968, it would cost R17,070,000. That proves that the matter is very urgent and at a later stage I shall say something more about this aspect of costs.</p>

<p>This committee of the South African Bureau of Standards, under the chairmanship of Professor Louw, very clearly set out to us the sequence in which action was to be taken. I think that in this case I should once more quote from the report of the committee in order to do the committee justice. Here I want to refer to page 19&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Committee&#x2019;s view, the Government should decide whether a change is to be made, and if a change is decided upon enunciate the principles which would govern the change. It is suggested that these principles should be:</block>

<ol>

<li>1. That the sale of Controllable Goods by foot-pound-gallon units be changed to sale by metric units within three years, with compensation payable to those compelled thereby to convert or replace their instruments of weighing or measuring.</li>

<li>2. That Functional Goods be gradually and increasingly specified and sold in terms of metric units.</li>

<li>3. That a Controlling Body with statutory powers be set up to control the change.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then the Committee continued by informing us as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should the Government decide that the metric system of weights and measures is to become the primary system, it is suggested that the change would best be effected by&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) Announcement by the Government of intention to regard the metric system as the primary system of trade and of a date by which all transactions in Controllable Goods must be carried out in the new system.</li>

<li>(b) The passing of legislation authorizing the setting up of a Metric System Board on lines similar to the Decimal Coinage Act (Act No 61 of 1959), except that the constitution of the Board should be wider than that of the Decimalization Board.</li>

<li>(c) The introduction of wide educational and intensive publicity campaigns.</li>

<li>(d) The issue of instructions to Commodity Control Boards and to Government Departments <span class="col_2361-2362" refersTo="page_1198"/>that all Controllable Goods under their jurisdiction are to be bought and sold by the new system within the period allowed under (a) above and requesting them to submit within a stipulated time (nine months is suggested) to the metric system board a suggested timetable applicable to their respective commodities.</li>

<li>(e) The issue of instructions to Government Departments and associated organizations (e.g. Post Office, Railways, Customs and Excise, SABS, SASOL, ISCOR, ESCOM. etc.,) that their transactions in functional goods should take place in metric units and that public services (e.g. Post Office, Railways, Customs and Excise) should draw up new tariffs with a view to introductions within three years.</li>

</ol>

<p>That is what this committee suggests and it is practical and possible for us to implement their suggestions. I do not want to go into this report in any greater detail. The report makes it quite clear to us that this committee unanimously and strongly recommended the change-over. The Government decided in favour of it. Now, in conclusion I should like to state why I think the Government should take action very soon.</p>

<p>The principal motive is the cost factor, as I said before. We see that for every year for which this matter is postponed, it will cost the country about R1 million extra. This is not money which we can recover in some way or other. That R1 million per annum is a real waste of money which results from the fact that we are postponing the change-over and are not going ahead with it immediately. In introducing the decimal system of coinage things went very smoothly, and because there was no delay in taking action there were large savings on the estimated costs. In the final report of the decimal coinage commission, dated 21st September, 1963, which was submitted to this House, we find that the total cost of the commission was R13,207,743 as against the original estimate of R 18,342,000. On that account, if we are able to take action soon, we shall most probably be able to effect a saving on the committee&#x2019;s estimate of R14 million of R15 million. I want to refer to something which happened on 27th February last week. Professor E. H. Louw addressed a meeting in Port Elizabeth which our newspapers featured prominently; it was front page news and it was prominently featured on the radio that people felt that they wanted this change-over. I want to tell the Minister that as children await the return of their parents from the village with sweets, the public of South Africa awaits the Government to bring it this system of weights and measures because that will be sweet.</p>

<p>However, there is another important aspect, and that is standardization. We know with what an impossible situation we are faced in this country at present. There are so many things of the same type which never fit. Take for example what happened to me last month. Just to succeed in finding a valve for a water tap, I had to take three valves home before one fitted, as the different threads of the various makes do not fit into one another. In grocery shops one finds dozens of makes of canned products, and one gets fish in tins of 12, 13, 14, 15 and 15<sup>2</sup> ounces, with different prices. The public does not know what it is buying, what the weight of the article is, and how prices compare with one another. There is a difference in quality. If we are able to standardize, the consumer will know that he is buying 15 ounces at such a price and that the price of the other make is so much; it will be possible to decide what is the best buy, and standardization will reduce the cost of living and the public will receive value for its money. The time of effecting this change-over, when all weights and measures will be changed, will be the proper time for establishing a uniform standard for various things. I just want to mention one example to you as far as medicine is concerned. When a doctor prescribes medicine and wants one to take so many grammes he simply writes on the prescription &#x201C;so many Gr.&#x201D; where as &#x201C;grains&#x201D; are indicated by &#x201C;gr.&#x201D;. If a person only takes so many grains of a certain type of medicine it will do him no harm, but if he takes the same quantity in grammes he will be in serious trouble. One person&#x2019;s small letter looks like another person&#x2019;s capital letter, and that leads to confusion. This type of confusion can be eliminated through standardization.</p>

<p>The third point I should like to mention is the combating of inflation. Hon. members may find it strange when I say that we shall be able to combat inflation by introducing the metric system, because the popular view is that we must reduce the amount of money in circulation in order to combat inflation. The best solution to the problem of inflation is productivity. We can combat inflation if every man, every woman, every worker in every factory and in every office in this country of ours, can be more productive. We shall, if we introduce the metric system, save labour as a result of easy conversion. We shall save labour as regards export products in that we will indicate the correct measure and the correct weight according to the metric system. It would effect a tremendous saving if it were no longer necessary to convert weights and measures. The labour which is being wasted in this way may then be employed productively in other directions. There are many clerks who spend many hours simply on the conversion of weights and measures. Just think how much we shall be able to save in that regard only. We shall possibly have to spend R13 or R14 million over a matter of ten years, but we shall be able to save much more than that within a single year as a result of greater productivity. Therefore the introduction of the metric system is an indirect method of combating inflation and I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister to introduce this system as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="col_2363-2364" refersTo="page_1199"/>Then I want to raise another matter which carries a great deal of weight as far as I am concerned, and that is the struggle to take the lead in the world. We at the southernmost point of Africa are, and must remain, the leading country in Africa; we must also give the lead as far as the rest of the world is concerned. I mentioned before that three states in Africa&#x2014;Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda&#x2014;had already changed over to the metric system. If they have been able to do so, this advanced country of ours can most certainly do so much more readily. We have the technicians, we have the manpower, we have the knowledge, we have the experience of the decimal system of coinage which we introduced, and we know how smoothly that went. We can and we must take the lead. In this regard I also want to refer to the speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister at Parow where he said that at this juncture it was our primary task to lead South Africa to where it may hold its own in the international sphere. For taking the lead in this struggle and for making the influence of South Africa felt in the international sphere, there is to my mind no better instrument than the metric system. We must remember that 82 per cent of the world&#x2019;s population use the metric system; that our export trade to countries abroad is increasing tremendously and that England is at present trying to be admitted to the European Common Market and one of the obstacles in its way is the fact that it does not have the metric system. A British Parliamentary Committee already recommended the introduction of the metric system, and if England changes over to the metric system and becomes a member of the European Common Market, then I join Professor Louw in saying that South Africa will, to a certain extent, be doomed and that we shall have a struggle to make up the leeway. We simply cannot afford to be caught on the wrong foot; we must be quick off the mark. Even the 17.3 per cent of the world&#x2019;s population in countries where they do not have the metric system, are not opposed to the metric system; they too want to change over. The metric system is one which is recognized, used and applied throughout the world. With this system, which I advocate, we shall be able to promote South Africa&#x2019;s export trade. At present we are trying in various ways to promote and to propagate South Africa&#x2019;s good name abroad. Here I am not advocating a system by means of which we want to propagate a certain ideology abroad. What we want to propagate abroad is not the view of a political party; what we want to do is to promote South Africa&#x2019;s export trade. We know that money is power and that money talks. We are living in a world in which dire famine is being experienced in certain areas at present. We shall export food to those countries. We know that the shortest way to a man&#x2019;s heart is through his stomach. Let us therefore send small messengers from South Africa in the form of canned fruits, fish and groceries, weighed and measured according to the metric system, to appear on the tables of every family throughout the world. We shall then speak to those people in a language which they understand and which we all have in common. Let them use South African soap, packed according to our weights and measures, in their bathrooms. If a person wants to enjoy a drink after work, let him be able to order South African wines and sherries in measures which he understands. If he wants to buy cigarettes, let him be able to buy South African manufactured cigarettes weighed and measured according to the metric system. Therefore I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to introduce this system as soon as possible so that we may send these messengers throughout the world, into their stores, into their trains, on to their roads, into their houses, into all spheres. Let us make South Africa known in all spheres, and I think that this instrument, the metric system, is the method by which we shall be able to do so.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I think if we compare this private member&#x2019;s motion with many we have had in this House, we recognize that this is a motion on which we can all cooperate. The hon. mover of the motion has not thanked the Government; he has not come along with praises; he does not wish to express his appreciation. He wishes to use a spur; he wants the Government to move a bit faster than they have been moving.</p>

<p>I was also very much impressed by this report of the Bureau of Standards. I was surprised at some of the facts they disclosed in their statistics, especially in regard to engineering, because one of the great difficulties has always been that engineering has not fallen into line. One realizes their difficulties when it comes to measurements for machinery, etc. Most of them have adopted the British and American systems and it is difficult to change, although they are changing, but the fact that they support this movement really made me feel we have moved a step forward. Civil engineering and mechanical engineering are not quite as important as electrical engineering. Electrical engineers have always had the metric system. All their units are based on the metric system, and for that reason they have made more rapid progress than civil and mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made a comparison with coinage. One cannot take that comparison very far because in the case of coinage the essential difference is that one has to have a D-day; one has to decide that on a certain day the country will go over to a new coinage system. The metric system, however, can be introduced gradually. It can be introduced in one trade or in one department of a trade and not in the other. The other point which the hon. member mentioned was that it would help us to fight inflation. I would not go too far there either, because the Bureau warns us that there might be inflation as a result of the introduction. The Bureau does not suggest it would cause serious inflation but it would be a factor and one should guard against that. Then finally the hon. member referred to what England <span class="col_2365-2366" refersTo="page_1200"/>was doing and he said that the United Kingdom had decided to go over to the metric system. I would not place too much reliance on that because we have had experience of them right throughout history. Hon. members will know that we discussed this when we introduced the decimal system of coinage. The history of the metric system and decimal coinage is most interesting. The United States of America was the first country to deal with this question of decimalization. In 1787 they broke away from the old British coinage system, but they were not an industrialized community; they did not think about any metric system; there was no such thing as a metric system then. Every country had its own system. The United States of those days was the old dominion&#x2014;chiefly a rural community. But then in the following decade, after the French Revolution in about 1789, the French decided they would not only decimalize their coinage but that they would introduce a metric system of weights and measures. They gave us the metre, a metre which they thought was accurate and which we have discovered since was not accurate, but that does not matter because the standards of measurements are kept in Paris as the British standards are kept in London and as our standards are kept in the Mint. The next country to tackle the whole question of coinage and the metric system was Britain because the United Kingdom was the most industrialized country in Europe. They said they were going to decimalize their coinage and introduce the metric system, and in 1864 they made the use of the metric system optional. Over a 100 years ago therefore the metric system was made optional; and then in 1871 a Bill was introduced in the House of Commons. The Second Reading of that Bill was lost by five votes. Had it gone the other way they would have been on their way to using the metric system. But the other countries in Europe had been watching Britain and were prepared to follow her. They did so. Britain was considering this metric system and had made up her mind not to be discouraged by this vote on the Second Reading of the Bill in the House of Commons. They said they would get on with it and at that time they introduced compulsory education on a system of grants. I do not know whether hon. members will remember that at school they always had a school ruler, a &#x201C;liniaal&#x201D;; on that school ruler you will see ruled on one side inches, quarters and eighths and sometimes tenths and on the other side, centimetres and millimetres. The reason for this was that if a school taught the metric system they got an extra grant. This is going back about 100 years. Children were therefore taught at school what the metric system was although it was never used in their ordinary lives. We shall have to think of something rather like that when we come to a later stage of the introduction of the metric system. Well, so much for the system there. We were dependent upon the United Kingdom at that time. We were also a rural community, but as we developed ourselves the Government during World War II took a great step forward. The Becklake Committee, the anti-waste committee, was asked by Mr. Hofmeyr to make a recommendation on the metric system of weights and measures and decimal coinage, and that committee did some very valuable work. Subsequently we had a report from the Bureau, and they recommended that we could proceed with coinage first and then after that consider the metric system of weights and measures. Well, we are now considering the metric system of weights and measures and I feel the question now is how we can help. The authorities have been trying to accustom people in South Africa to the new system. Very valuable work has been done by the meteorological department. They give us a daily report of rainfall and temperature. Temperature is one of the most difficult conversions&#x2014;from centigrades to Fahrenheit. The ordinary person still thinks in terms of Fahrenheit, not in terms of centigrade. But they have not instructed the public. There have not been newspaper articles explaining what they want to do. They are men of science and, being men of science, they assume the ordinary person has had an elementary scientific education. Well, I am afraid the ordinary person has not had this education. You see, Sir, these men of science realize that if you attended a university you never used the British system. I never saw the British system at university; I never saw a Fahrenheit thermometer. It is only the doctors who have those in the hospitals, because they are still old-fashioned. The doctor still heals his patient with his hand-writing. He uses the apothecaries&#x2019; measures. I remember quoting it here on one occasion during the decimal coinage debate. The usual thing is 20 grains equal one scruple, three scruples equal one drachm, eight drachms equal one ounce. But it is not the drachm and the ounce that I knew as a boy&#x2014;it is something quite different. Then an hon. Minister on the other side when he heard this, asked, &#x201C;How many scruples in a member of Parliament?&#x201D;. I think that to-day there are no scruples in any member of Parliament about this introduction of the metric system. It is only a question of how it is going to be done.</p>

<p>I think the meteorological department, in giving its daily report, could have instructed the farmer. It could have said that it is not difficult to relate it to the present system, that it was going to ge given in centimetres and that it must just be remembered that there are <i>2<sup>2</sup></i> centimetres in an inch. They would get used to it very quickly. It is not exactly 21, of course, but 2.54. That is near enough. Bearing in mind that there are 2<sup>2</sup> centimetres in an inch, they can work out their rainfall, which would be given in centimetres. But to begin with, the present figures in inches could also be furnished in brackets, as I suggested to the Minister of Finance in regard to decimal coinage, when he said he wanted prices to be quoted in rands only and not in pounds. Of course, I agree with him; we all agree with him. I suggested he should insist on rands and that there could be in brackets, if the persons <span class="col_2367-2368" refersTo="page_1201"/>concerned so wished it, the equivalent amount in pounds. I have no objection to that. In the same way that could have been done in the beginning in respect of the metric system. They could have given the rainfall figures in centimetres and the conversion behind that. The public should have been educated by means of newspaper articles and broadcasts over the S.A.B.C. Sir, they teach much worse things over the S.A.B.C.! They could have taught people how to convert.</p>

<p>Now we come to the difficult question, namely temperature. Temperature is a difficult conversion, but they could have taught the public that as well. After all, centigrade has a freezing point of nil degrees and a boiling point of 100 degrees, but when one comes to Fahrenheit with a freezing point of 32 and a boiling point of 212 degrees, one can see that it is not easy to convert. But there is one point at which they are both the same, and that is at minus 40 degrees. There they are both the same. I think the meteorological department could have given them the old method of changing over. They do not have to convert 21 degrees and 27 degrees, for instance. If a man knows what 20 degrees centigrade is in Fahrenheit, he can convert anything roughly. He wants only a rough conversion. The old system I have always recommended is this. Let us take for instance 20 degrees centigrade. Add 40 to that, which gives one 60, divided by five gives one 12, multiply by nine, which gives one 108, take away 40, leaving 68. That is the old method; it is the easy, simple system. Having done one, a person need not do any more. Because 20 degrees centigrade gives one 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The next one to be taken is 25. One should not trouble about those in between. This morning&#x2019;s newspaper gave the temperature for to-day at D. F. Malan airport as between 24 and 26 degrees. If one takes 25, one has just about got it right. If one has 68 then all one has to do is to add nine for every five naturally, because nine and five is the relationship between Fahrenheit and centigrade. That will be 77. So the temperature to-day is going to be about 77 degrees. Now one may well ask. &#x201C;What about 30 degrees?&#x201D; Well, add another nine, which gives one 86. That gives one all one requires for conversions, and I am sure they could have taught that in the <i>Landbouweekblad</i> quite simply. That would have given them the temperature conversion.</p>

<p>When one has that, one might well ask what other temperatures should a man have. What should a man know? Well, one we all know is the temperature of the human blood, to know whether a man is ill or not. What is the temperature of the blood in centigrade? That is the system used in France/Germany, and all other countries except our countries. It is 37 degrees. A degree of centigrade is rather bigger (the relation being nine to five), than a degree of Fahrenheit. So that all they have to remember is 37 and three degrees more to 40: 37-38-39-40. If a man has a temperature of 37 he is normal. If it is 38 he is running a temperature. We are sometimes in doubt whether a man is running a temperature if he is 99. But under the metric system one is in no doubt. If a man is 38 degrees then he is running a fair temperature. If he is 39 then he is running a very high temperature. And what is the position if he is 40? Remember our convertion? When a man has a temperature of 40, it is a dangerously high temperature, as we would say, about 104. And if he is 41, well, then a doctor is not needed at all! That is the position regarding the metric system. One can convert in the same way as I converted to 20. It is just as easy, it is the usual thing. Add 40, divide by five, multiply by nine, take away 40&#x2014;it is the old, old way.</p>

<p>The question I want to ask is, what else can we do to help? Well, we have had several Bills on education recently. As is usual in South Africa, whatever one wishes to do, whether it be life-saving, thrift, or anything else, people will tell us that the schools should teach it, the schools should do it. They are supposedly the hand-maidens of every movement in the country. Now this time I am serious. The schools have always over the last 100 years taught something of the metric system, but there has been no life in it. They have taught it because the children have had to learn it. They know the relationship. Of course, Sir, the metric system has this great appeal, that when one deals with a unit of length it is very easy to obtain a unit of capacity, it is easy to obtain a unit of weight. One can relate the one to the other, something that cannot be done under the other systems The C.G.S. system, the metric system, is easy as regards the relationship between the units. I think that in our schools it is not a question of giving more work. Here we discussed on a Bill recently with the hon. the Minister of Education the fact that we are now working on the syllabi of these schools. Every standard had a special syllabus for every year&#x2019;s work, and so on. I think they should give emphasis to teaching the metric system. They should make it a live thing. They should have the measures. It is not going to be difficult if they really take it seriously.</p>

<p>Let us take the kilogram. It is 2.2 lbs. roughly. If one halves a kilogram then one has something just a little heavier than our pound, what the French call a &#x201C;livre&#x201D;. They use it, it is half a kilogram. We could do that. I am glad the hon. Minister of Transport is here. I understand that in England they now quote kilos only in weight for the aircraft. They have introduced that and they do not quote lbs. We quote both, of course. Our luggage weight maximum is 40 lbs. I am not going to press this too far, because the Minister might say he is going to introduce what they have internally overseas. He knows what it is. It is 15 kilos internally and 20 externally. I am not going to press that. I think he might as a generous gesture say that in future with the new metric system the maximum will not be 40 lbs. but 20 kilos.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned I was discussing the manner in which the mover of this motion and the rest of us can assist in the changeover. The most important aspect is one which he mentioned, namely, that it would be a gradual process unlike the introduction of decimal coinage in which one requires a D-day for making the changeover. On the following day the old system will have disappeared. We introduced decimal coinage gradually in South Africa. We considered the public. The Australians did not do that. They said that on the day following the introduction of decimal coinage, the Australian pound was not to be mentioned, but only the Australian dollar. We have succeeded in getting the public with us and I would therefore say that it should be a gradual process. I was referring to the manner in which we could assist in the changeover. When I say gradual, I mean over a period of approximately ten years before everybody and everything is converted. I mentioned that in the changeover we could have propaganda through the Press, the S.A.B.C., etc., and especially in the schools because in five or ten years the children who are now in the schools will be the citizens. They will be able to assist at home, in our stores and in fact throughout the country.</p>

<p>I mentioned one or two matters but the most important is that in the various syllabuses and courses of instruction at our schools we should give special emphasis to the metric system. We need not introduce anything new because provision already exists for teaching the metric system. There should be special emphasis given to it. Then whenever a sports field is planned for a school, its dimensions should be calculated in the metric system. We are doing that now in the case of swimming pools. I was very sorry to hear one of our Deputy Ministers complaining recently that an Olympic swimming pool had been built at Soweto. That is because it must be built according to these new metric measurements. International swimming pools are built that way. Even our football fields should be built according to the metric system. Now hon. members will ask: &#x201C;What about a cricket pitch.&#x201D; There my courage fails me. A cricket pitch must be 22 yds. long; it must be a chain; otherwise a tradition of centuries will be lost. I think it would be sacrilege to attempt to give the length of a cricket pitch in metres. We can give the dimensions of a football field in metres because the French play rugby. But I doubt whether the Australians would play against us again if we spoke about the length of a cricket pitch in terms of metres.</p>

<p>For the rest I think we should introduce this system as rapidly as possible. Mr. Speaker, I can give you the assurance that we shall all combine in this undertaking if we can only have as pleasant an experience as we had in the case of the Decimal Coinage Commission. The hon. the Minister will remember that was indeed a pleasant experience. We had cooperation not only from both sides of the House but from representatives of all sections of the community. We have great pleasure in responding to the spirit of the motion introduced by the hon. member for Sunnyside.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to the most interesting speech by the hon. member for Kensington, and in particular the interesting facts he revealed about the history of the metric system. I never realized that the hon. member for Kensington could be so interesting on history. Years ago he taught me mathematics, and I now see that he also knows a considerable deal about history. Since I came to this House I have had little occasion to agree with the hon. member. I am pleased to be able to say now that I agree fully and wholeheartedly with what he has presented to us. It is also a pleasure to support the motion of the hon. member for Sunnyside. We all know that many difficulties will arise with regard to the conversion. The hon. member mentioned that it would entail very high costs. He said that if it were commenced with in 1967 it would cost the State approximately R16 million There is also the fact that the public as well as the various concerns involved will have to suffer some inconvenience. But there are also some rays of light, which have already been mentioned, namely that virtually all the concerns, the various Departments and leading figures who will be involved in this conversion, have promised their support and have in many cases stated that if the conversion were to take place, it should be done as soon as possible. In this regard I just want to refer to what was recently said by the Secretary for Defence. He said that in view of the fact that the Republic of South Africa would be compelled to change to the metric system of weights and measures if Britain, and later possibly also the U.S.A., changed to it, it would be advantageous if we here in South Africa could introduce it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I said that there was the ray of light that various concerns would support it. The hon. member for Kensington referred to education. I think that is a concern on which the State could lean very heavily in the event of such a conversion. We know by experience that the schools and other educational institutions played an outstanding and most important part in the conversion to our present currency system. In this regard the lead was taken by teachers in arithmetic, mathematics, mechanics, bookkeeping, accounting and related subjects, and they were the ones who prepared pupils for the far-reaching change which would come. From the schools it spread to the parental homes.</p>

<p>It is my personal opinion that the conversion to the metric system in respect of weights, measures of capacity and of lengths should be much easier. Once again the schools may play a special part with regard to the conversion process. When the country changed over to<span class="col_2371-2372" refersTo="page_1203"/> the present currency system education had no specific basis to go by. It was known that the monetary unit in the United States of America was the dollar. It was known that the franc was used in France, the guilder in Holland and the mark in Germany, but as far as the Republic was concerned a new monetary unit had to be devised. There was consequently no monetary unit on which the teacher who had to instruct his pupils could base his thinking. But as far as the conversion to the metric system in respect of weights and measures is concerned, there is such a basis. It will be much easier, for as we know and as the hon. member for Kensington pointed out, the metric system has been taught in our schools for many years. I remember that even in the early twenties when I was in primary school, I learned about the metre, the decimetre, the centimetre and the millimetre on the one hand, and the decametre, the hectometre and the kilometre on the other. Thus we also learned about grams up to the kilogram as measures of weight, and also about the litre as a measure of capacity. At the moment the metric system is in many cases still taught as a parallel to the existing imperial or British system. Although the emphasis is still placed on the British system because it is currently used, the other system is also taught. If the Government decided on conversion to the metric system as far as weights and measures are concerned, the syllabuses and subjects I have just mentioned will have to be amended accordingly. I think the syllabuses should be designed in such a way&#x2014;I am just suggesting this&#x2014;that the system may be taught to pupils at school two years and even longer before it is finally taken into use.</p>

<p>In speaking of schools, I do not mean only the white schools. I also mean the non-white schools, i.e. the Coloured schools, Indian schools and the Bantu schools. Obviously the text-books cannot be changed immediately. That would be very expensive. But we know how resourceful teachers are, and particularly those who teach the subjects I mentioned a moment ago. We know that these teachers will bridge the interim period most advantageously by means of examples they themselves may draw up, duplicate and furnish to the pupils. The same thing happened during the change-over to our present currency system. There were no text-books available, and the teachers had to draw on their ingenuity and devise sums and calculations for the children. When &#x201C;D&#x201D;-day arrived, there were thousands and tens of thousands of children, and through them their parents, who had been prepared to meet it. By its nature instruction in the metric system of weights and measures is much easier, because it does not involve pounds and ounces or their ridiculous fractions, nor does it involve measures of capacity like pints, bottles and gallons. The same applies to measures of lengths, where there are equally difficult systems. Those of us who have been in teaching, know that a table is not a very attractive subject for a child to learn. The metric system will not involve difficult methods of calculating, because all calculations will be done in terms of litres, grams and metres, which will enable the children to calculate in tens and multiples of ten.</p>

<p>We also hope that the international standards and names will be retained, because there would be no sense in changing them. With regard to our present currency system and the conversion to it, it was essential that we should get a monetary unit which would identify the country. We had to get a national monetary unit. Hon. members of the Opposition must please not be alarmed if I use the word &#x201C;national&#x201D;! A national currency system was also essential with regard to the determination of an exchange rate. It was essential that we should have a currency system which would be peculiar to the country. But as far as the existing metric system of weights and measures is concerned, it is no longer linked to a specific country. It has achieved international status. At schools, and particularly at schools on a technical level, it will be essential to continue teaching both systems for a considerable length of time. It will also be essential to do calculations continually which relate to the conversion of one system to the other. That may perhaps be done for three or four years. After that it will be necessary to teach only one, namely the metric system.</p>

<p>We are faced by a cardinal question with regard to this possible change to metric weights and measures: How will the non-Whites, and particularly the Bantu population, adapt themselves to it? We cannot get away from the fact that the Bantu adapted themselves remarkably well and remarkably quickly to the decimal coinage system. That was attributed to the fact that the Bantu is by nature inclined to count and calculate in multiples of five, but particularly in tens. In order to do so he uses his fingers, of course, and if necessary also his toes. The Bantu finds it very hard to understand fractions and even to think in terms of fractions.</p>

<p>I was told, for example, that the Bantu languages have no equivalents for halves, quarters and eighths, not to mention smaller fractions. As for using measures and weights, it is true that the Bantu prefers to think in terms of capacity and in terms of quantity, rather than in terms of weight. If one transacts business with a Bantu or gives him something, he thinks in terms of the jam tins he has to fill or in terms of the bucket in which his maize or his flour will be given to him, or the measure of capacity in which his salt or sugar will be given to him. He is not so much concerned about the correctness of the weight. The misgivings the Bantu may have entertained, namely that the conversion to the decimal currency unit would result in their exploitation, have been disproved completely. We can now accept that the coinage system was grasped well and quickly by the Bantu. I must say that in certain circles the Bantu used the terms rand and cent more regularly than our own people did. As Whites we are often inclined <span class="col_2373-2374" refersTo="page_1204"/>to cling desperately to the old currency system. The Bantu at petrol stations, for example, switched over immediately to the currency unit we are using at present. Just as the Bantu saw that they were not going to be exploited as a result of the conversion to another currency system, I believe they will also realize that no exploitation threatens them in conversion to a metric system of weights and measures. It is true, of course, that educational publicity and campaigns will have to be organized to inform not only children but also adult Bantu, and that visual demonstrations will have to be held to enable them to understand the change. Authorities are of the opinion that in the long run the Bantu will also benefit by the conversion to the metric system with regard to weights and measures.</p>

<p>There is another question one has to ask oneself. This is also a logical question. How will the conversion influence our manpower position? In some quarters it is considered that the present manpower shortage, particularly as regards skilled workers, will hamper the efficient and effective conversion of our existing system to the metric system and that the conversion should be shelved as a result of that. Yet authorities on the other side are of the opinion that skilled manpower is actually wasted in and by the use of the present system. The experts are of the opinion that the present system even eliminates the effective use of modern computing aids, and that more errors are made as a result of that. They also contend that the present system demands a much longer period of training for the staff who have to apply it. I just want to say that in view of that the present shortage of manpower actually makes it essential to make the very best use of our available manpower. It is understandable, of course, that the present personnel will receive their training in the new system, and it is also necessary that industry shall have regard to the problems involved in such training. The rapid growth of the Republic&#x2019;s industry will aggravate the problems, and I believe that it is therefore essential that we should change to the new system as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to refer to the important inquiry which was carried out in England in 1962, and which has also been referred to here in connection with the possible conversion to the metric system in that country. That inquiry was instituted by the British Standards Institution and industry was consulted on a broad spectrum. I just want to read from page 119 of the report, which was referred to several times to-day. It is a report submitted to the Minister of Economic Affairs on the metric system of weights and measures by the South African Bureau of Standards. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of a large number of indefinite and sometimes divided views which the B.S.I. statement &#x2026; has elicited from U.K. industries, there emerges a substantial majority view that changes are inevitable and that they should be directed towards the introduction of the metric system as the primary system of weights and measures in the United Kingdom within the shortest practicable period. The timing of the change must clearly vary from industry to industry and must be left to individual industries to work out. In general, however, it is accepted that the longer a move is delayed the more costly and complicated the operation will be.</block>

<p>That is exactly what will also happen here if we delay any longer. I think the time is ripe. The hon. member for Sunnyside referred to a speech made very recently by Professor Louw, who was chairman of the Metric System Committee. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is the danger that South Africa will lose her privileged position with Britain now that Britain, South Africa&#x2019;s major trade partner, is changing to the metric system because she wants to enter the European Common Market &#x2026; Britain is two years ahead of the Republic and we have lost too much time as it is &#x2026; We must build for future generations and ensure South Africa&#x2019;s survival as a modern, progressive industrial country.</block>

<p>I should like to conclude by associating myself with the two hon. members who spoke before me, in urging that the conversion should take place as soon as possible.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>On several occasions this Session it has been my lot to follow the hon. member for Koedoespoort in debate. Usually we have been at pains to state our fundamental differences, but to-day it seems that we can pool our suggestions in dealing with a very important but not contentious subject, and offer our suggestions to the mover of this very important motion. The hon. member for Koedoespoort has dealt with the subject and has given us the benefit of his experience in education to suggest methods whereby the change-over should be dealt with in the educational sphere. I propose to deal with suggestions on a basis which is nearer my own profession in life, in regard to medicines, their dispensing and manufacture and distribution. Before doing so, I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Sunnyside when he complimented the compilers of this report on the very excellent and comprehensive work they had done. The hon. member for Sunnyside also referred very briefly in passing to the question of medicine. He cited the difficulty which could arise when the two systems, the Imperial and the metric system, were used and the two signs, the gramme sign and the grain sign could be confused. He pointed out that there could be an obvious danger. But I want to assure the hon. member for Sunnyside that our profession is so meticulous in its approach to its work that I have never known of a case where that particular problem has produced fatal results.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Kensington has said, we have no objection to the principle of <span class="col_2375-2376" refersTo="page_1205"/>a metric system of weights and measures, but I believe the advice he gave, which is borne out by the Federated Chambers of Industry, is that South Africa should not take the lead in this matter but should follow on the basis of the progress made both in the United Kingdom and the United States. I think one of the main reasons is that South Africa and the U.S.A, and the U.K. are great trading partners, and so I believe that any transition should be gradual and more or less in conformity with the progress made in those two countries. The report of the Bureau of Standards has indicated that in so far as actual weights and measures are concerned, there should be no delay in this transition process and also that within three years there should be marked progress, and within ten years it should be possible to place legislation on the Statute Book which would make it illegal to use the old terms. I think that is logical and a fair approach to the problem. The hon. member for Sunnyside referred to the cost. I was interested, when I broke down the figures, to see that the estimated cost in regard to the conversion of scales and weights amounted to R10.5 million, just for the scales, and it would involve the conversion of over 100,000 scales, and the discarding of over 406,000 weights. I assume, as the report assumes, that if there is any change-over on that basis, the compensation would be paid by the State. The case of our coinage was mentioned, where compensation was paid by the State. Obviously in such a change-over there are advantages and disadvantages. I believe that we have to be objective and face some of the problems which will confront us. As I see it, a major problem will be the question of labelling, because during the transition period it would be obviously necessary to indicate the dual weights and measures on the labels of the various products, for the protection of the public. That, as I see it, could involve the manufacturers in some expense which would to a certain extent increase production costs. Then there is the question of the disposal of stocks, but I do not believe that any great difficulty would arise there as long as a suitable interim period is allowed. As far as packaging machines are concerned, there would be certain difficulties. There would be certain difficulties in regard to moulds, but I am given to understand that as far as glass containers are concerned moulds do not enjoy a particularly long life, so that there will not be any great difficulty in that direction.</p>

<p>I was interested to read the Commission&#x2019;s optimistic view which it adopted to the estimated increase in the cost of living as the result of the change-over. The commission put the figure down at less than .25 per cent, but in the thorough way in which the report dealt with these matters, substantiation was given in the form of sample figures which were taken out in Pretoria. I think that .25 per cent is an underestimate. I think that there would be non-compensatable factors in container manufacture and in other aspects which would increase the basic cost and which would ultimately result in a consumer cost on a higher basis than the estimated .25 per cent.</p>

<p>The report also dealt with the question of rounding off, and while I realize that that could be reduced to fairly simple methods, I think that there is room for abuse when it comes to rounding off. It would be very difficult if a manufacturer chose to be unscrupulous in his rounding-off process in order to take a little extra profit for himself. I maintain that it would be virtually impossible to deal with the many cases which would occur during the transition period when hundreds of preparations would be marketed and would be marketed in the new form under the metric system. However, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages on the long-term basis. One of the disadvantages of which I feel we would be very well rid, is that at the moment we are dealing with avoirdupois, troy and apothecary weights, all of which are legal in South Africa. Just to complicate the issue we do have in certain instances the use of metric gramme weights as it is now, but when the change-over is complete, we will have the elimination of the avoirdupois, the apothecary and the troy weights.</p>

<p>Sir, then there is the question of education. The hon. member for Koedoespoort referred to this matter. Here again I believe that the change-over to the metric system will result in a simplification because I believe that our forebears used the only accounting system available at that time and that was their toes and fingers, in multiples of fives and ten. I believe that that was the forerunner of the decimal system and that a decimal system will make for ease in the teaching of all students in this country. I believe I am right in saying that it would help considerably in the education of the Bantu. I know that Professor Eiselen at one stage indicated that the Bantu experienced considerable difficulty with arithmetic and that they found it a difficult subject to master. I believe that this change-over will make arithmetic easier for all students. I do not think that we should be misled into believing that the change-over would be completely smooth and without difficulty. I know that the hon. member for Kensington chose a happy example when he said that a kilo was equal to 2.2 lb. but some of the other equivalents are not quite as easy as that. I notice that in <i>Commercial Opinion</i> some months back the opinion was expressed in an article that the Bureau of Standards Report was indulging in a little wishful thinking in believing that the change-over would be smooth. <i>Commercial Opinion</i> quoted examples which I think are quite significant. They point out that one ounce equals 28.3495 grammes, that one yard equals 91.44 centimetres and that one pint equals 0.568245 litres, so that there would be difficulty in those equivalents until we have a complete usage of the metric system.</p>

<p>Sir, I have said that I wanted to refer to the question of medicines and their distribution. I believe that possibly in this particular field <span class="col_2377-2378" refersTo="page_1206"/>South Africa is following the pattern of the United Kingdom and the United States where there has been a gradual but definite change-over to the metric system. Sir, it is interesting to see in the current edition of the United States <i>Pharmacopoeia</i> published in 1965 that the Revision Committee had continued to eliminate the use of the apothecary system of weights which has always been the traditional system used in the past and that all weights and measures are now being expressed in the metric system. The only reference to apothecary weights now is at the back of the book where there is a table of quivalents for the convenience of people who wish to transpose the metric to the apothecary for reasons of convenience. It has always been a case that in identification tests, assays and the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations, the metric system has been used to a very large extent. Then, Sir, we have the same position applying in Great Britain. In 1953-&#x2019;58 there was what was known as the British Pharmacopoeia Commission. This commission as far back as that expressed the view that arrangements should be made so that the Imperial system could be abandoned by 1963, and they hoped that the transition would be complete by 1968. It is interesting too to see that in Martindale&#x2019;s Extra Pharmacopoeia the opinion is also expressed that the Imperial system will gradually become redundant and be discontinued. It is interesting too to notice that this subject was first intended to be brought into the House of Commons in London by means of a private member&#x2019;s motion, indicating that the metric system would gradually replace the Imperial system, but I believe that the Weights and Measures Bill of 1963 put the position beyond doubt when it stated in effect that the apothecary system would become illegal for purposes of trade. Sir, we have an example of the practical effect of that. We find that after July, 1965, manufacturers and wholesalers who made medicines and pharmaceutical preparations were instructed to clear all their stocks labelled on the Imperial basis and that the retail distribution points were given until the 1st January, 1966, to effect the disposal of stocks marked under the Imperial system. A period of grace was given. As far as I know the transition went off without a hitch, but we would have to become used to changes in this respect as we follow suit. When we buy a bottle of aspirin tablets and we read on it &#x201C;aspirin tablets acetyl salicylic acid 5 grains&#x201D;, that is not likely to apply very much longer. We will see instead: &#x201C;aspirin tablets acetyl salicylic acid 300 mgm.&#x201D; I believe that the time is not far off when that position will apply in this country; it will merely be a continuation of a policy being adopted overseas. In South Africa we have a publication which is of great value to the medical and pharmaceutical profession and the hospitals, known as MIMS, a monthly index of medical specialities. The preface says: &#x201C;Weights and measures are shown in metric units as far as possible.&#x201D; Sir, there is nothing particularly new about that, because as far as I can remember injections have always been referred to as milligrammes per cubic centimetre. Sir, already we have in South Africa some pharmaceutical houses which have adopted this practice. Whereas they used to pack a cough mixture normally prescribed by a medical man in a 4-ounce bottle, to-day the capacity is either 120 or 125 cc., so the practice is gradually extending in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Do doctors still write out their prescriptions in the old apothecary&#x2019;s measure or do they now use the metric measure?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>That is an interesting question. I should say that 87 per cent of the prescriptions written to-day do not really need compounding. It is merely an ethical preparation with the directions &#x201C;One three times a day&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But can you read them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, we can read them all right.</p>

<p>Of the remainder one finds that where a preparation has to be dispensed or compounded in the true sense of the word, the quantities are usually given in the apothecary&#x2019;s system and that it is the exception rather than the rule to see a prescription written in the metric system, but the training at the colleges over the last 30 years and more has been such that students are made to accustom themselves to making up medicines in both the metric and the apothecary standard of weights, and there again there will be no difficulty. There might be a difficulty as far as the householder is concerned, but I do not think that it is one to worry about. It has been established that most people when they take medicine use common household teaspoons or tablespoons. We know that they vary, but it has been established that where one teaspoonful was regarded as now, a teaspoonful could still be regarded as the equivalent of five millimetres, which would be equivalent to a medicinal teaspoon.</p>

<p>The difficulty with tablespoons is that they vary and one might have a tablespoon with a capacity of 15 or 20 millimetres. But there again I think that could be overcome by means of formulation whereby the dose could be reduced to say one teaspoonful or a two tea-spoonful dose. They have had this problem in New Zealand; they have overcome it. Way back in 1963 the Social Security Act in New Zealand has already jumped this hurdle. They asked doctors to prescribe exclusively in the metric system. That in fact has taken place in New Zealand. They have overcome the difficulty of the household teaspoon and tablespoon by producing&#x2014;I suppose in bulk&#x2014;a cheap plastic measure which places the issue beyond doubt and gives an accurate measurement for those people who have to take medicine in liquid form.</p>

<p>There would be some general problems, <span class="col_2379-2380" refersTo="page_1207"/>none of which I think would be insurmountable. There is the question of containers. As far as pills, tablets, suppositories, pessaries and powders are concerned there will be no difficulties. That should be quite easy. As far as ointments are concerned, there might be some difficulty, but I believe that to-day many prepacked ointments in tubes are packed on the basis of the metric weight system, for instance in packings of five grammes, fifteen grammes, thirty grammes, and even larger quantities. So there again there might be an adjustment in a small number of cases. When it comes to glass containers, there would be some difficulty. But, as I have said, the moulds are not everlasting, so the change-over could take place in good time.</p>

<p>So far as liquid medicines are concerned, there could be a change in tradition. I think that most people are accustomed to the ordinary six-ounce or eight-ounce bottle of medicine. A six-ounce bottle represents 180 cubic centimetres and an eight-ounce bottle represents 240 cubic centimetres. Neither of these latter two quantities would be convenient to dispense under the metric system. But there again I believe that with the co-operation of the medical profession quantities could be ordered in multiples of 100 cc. and that difficulty, too, would be overcome. Therefore, Sir, I believe that as far as that aspect of it is concerned South Africa has worked, and will continue to a greater extent to work with the metric system to the gradual elimination of the Imperial system. I believe that it will be a good thing when we come to the stage where there will be just one system, namely the metric system, in those particular spheres.</p>

<p>It is interesting to think that France adopted the metric system in 1840 and Germany in 1871, and yet Britain and America are still toying with the idea, one could almost say. I believe that in South Africa the problem will be primarily for the industrialists, for the engineering trade, and for people who have to deal with hardware, where there will be the difficulty of a multiplicity of fittings and measurements, which will take time to solve and overcome. But I do believe that with patience, caution and goodwill this is a problem which will be overcome and a matter which in the end will be to the advantage of our Republic.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had an interesting discussion so far of the metric system, but I bring the House back to the motion which asks for this system &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D;. Does it mean as soon as possible now, or is it within five years, or is it to-morrow? The hon. member for Berea has just referred to the question of aspirins. I see that the hon. the Minister is here to-day. Well, I think that one of the first persons to require an aspirin should this motion become law will be the Minister himself. I say this because, while we recognize that the metric system has many advantages, we nevertheless find ourselves in difficulty on this side of the House. Mr. Speaker, when this Government spends money excessively we are the first to criticize it. I have here before me an excellent report of the Council of the South African Bureau of Standards. This report was tabled in May, 1965. On page 23 we see that had we converted in 1965 it would have cost us R13,626,000. If the matter was delayed until 1966 it would cost R14,688,000, while the cost in 1967 would be R 15,834,000. In 1968 it would cost R17 million. The Minister himself has to deal with the question of priority, and he has to argue the matter with the Treasury. If the Minister does accept the motion of the hon. member for Sunnyside and say that he accepts &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D; to mean this year, he has to adjust matters with the Treasury to give this matter priority above all others. That is our difficulty. I think that all sides of the House agree with the advantages of the metric system. But there are difficulties, as the hon. member for Berea has pointed out. Both in the U.S.A, and Great Britain the metric system does not apply. Difficulties arise because of that fact. Can one imagine the whole of the Ford organization and the whole of the General Motors organization changing over to the metric system just to suit South Africa? In future every model of car would be out of date if the metric system were introduced at once. Obviously that would not happen as far as this country is concerned. The Minister of Economic Affairs is concerned that the content of local goods used in the manufacture of cars in this country be increased. As the hon. the Minister well knows, while we have a high percentage of local content in our cars, the tools, the jigs, and all the manufacturing accessories used for manufacturing this local content are manufactured overseas. Various dies come from overseas. The dies for the latest models come from the U.S.A., either from Ford or from General Motors, and those have to be introduced into the factory for manufacturing local content. So that for a very long time to come we can see that, despite any resolution of this House and despite all the good wishes of the hon. member for Sunnyside who has introduced this motion, the possibility of introducing the metric system as soon as possible will be delayed for some considerable period. That, of course, does not apply as far as continental cars are concerned. As the hon. member knows, the metric system is used in the case of their cars with all their engineering standards being fixed in terms of the metric system.</p>

<p>I now come to another phase, and I propose to deal principally with the difficulties encountered by the packaging industry. There, too, we have problems. We are rapidly changing over in this country to a system of mass production. We are encouraged by the Government, and the whole formula of our taxation encourages us, to introduce more modern manufacturing methods, to cut out manual labour as much as possible. If we cut out hand labour, as we have done in many of our factories by the introduction of machine <span class="col_2381-2382" refersTo="page_1208"/>and mass production methods, we will find that many of the machines which are purchased either from Britain or America do not fit in with the metric system. The change-over has not been taken account of in the recommendations made in this report. The recommendations made in the report have as a prelude the estimated cost of conversion. On page 23, to which I have already referred, the estimated cost of conversion shows amounts in respect of weighbridges, platform scales, counter platform scales, belt weighers, and so on. But in none of the items referred to on page 23 is there any estimate as regards the change-over of factory machinery and the adjustments in factory machinery which will have to be made That, of course, requires manpower. The Minister will know from his experience in visiting factories in various parts of the country that when it comes to adjustment of fast-moving automatic packaging machinery, one requires the highly-qualified technical man on the plant who will be concerned not only with the adjustment of the plant but also with the necessary tuning so that the plant can run efficiently after the adjustment has taken place. The change-over to the metric system would involve not only manpower but it would involve highly-qualified manpower to effect the change-over to the metric system. In some cases it would involve the importation of new parts from overseas. In some cases new parts would have to be specially manufactured by the original manufacturers. Because in many cases it is not practical to scrap the machinery. In many cases this machinery has been brought into the country over the last 10 years. The economic life of those machines has not expired. They probably have another five or ten years of life. All those factors must be taken into consideration. While it is all very well for the commission to have compiled its report&#x2014;and I do not criticize the report in that regard because an excellent job has been done and the Minister&#x2019;s department and the officials concerned with that report are to be commended for the work they have done&#x2014;I think that they will be the first to acknowledge that in the technical field as far as industrial output is concerned much ground still remains to be covered. There was neither the time nor the opportunity to go into that in detail because they were concerned with general principles. Therefore the whole purpose of this discussion to-day is not to criticize the Government or the Minister or the mover of the motion but rather to point out some of the problems with which the Minister concerned will be faced.</p>

<p>In the food packaging industry, we will not only find it necessary to make this adjustment to machinery but we will have to make a further adjustment which I think the hon. the Minister will agree is more difficult, namely to get the housewife to adjust herself to the new Weights and measures. It will be the Minister&#x2019;s headache and not mine to get the housewife to accommodate herself to the new measures and to be satisfied beyond any doubt whatever that she is not paying more for the goods she is buying. If there is any suggestion of an increase in the cost of living, then the Minister will have to deal with the housewives and not me. I want to come to the building industry. To-day we have a national shortage of houses. In addition to this we have hundreds of houses in this country in respect of which people will in due course be requiring alterations and modifications. Wherever bricks have been used for houses, standard bricks have been used, namely 9&#x2033; &#x00D7; 4&#x00BD;&#x2033; &#x00D7; 3&#x2033;. Therefore for some considerable time in the future all brick manufacturers will have to continue supplying bricks of those dimensions and not the metric measurements because unless the metric measurements are adjusted to conform to the measurements 9&#x2033; &#x00D7; 4&#x00BD;&#x2033; &#x00D7; 3&#x2033;, those bricks cannot be used for alterations or additions or they will detract from the aesthetic appearance of the house if different sized bricks are used. That is particularly true in the case of Government buildings. Most of our schools have face-brickwork for an obvious reason. Most of our public works designers and architects have been boys at school. Mr. Speaker, although I am quite sure that you never marked school walls, there are some boys who mark school walls. It has been found easier to build school buildings with the lower portion in face-brickwork because it saves upkeep. The minute you plaster and paint those walls, you will find a little boy with crayons who will mark them. Therefore in many of our schools we find that the lower portion of classrooms are in face-brickwork. So that for many years to come we will have to continue with bricks of the standard size. This is a problem which will have to be faced and taken into account when we talk about changing to the metric system.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with the question of screws. It does not only affect the motoring industry but any part of South Africa where machines are used. To change over to the metric system overnight will involve the keeping of stocks of screws in the other dimensions for as long as those machines are still in operation. Another problem is the beverage industry as regards both hard and soft liquor, the mineral water industry, the milk industry, the milk distribution industry and the beer industry which will all be affected if we change over to the metric system. It would be interesting to find out what the life of a milk bottle is. Is it one, two or ten journeys? It depends on where you live. I doubt whether in District Six the life of a milk bottle is very long. The life of a milk bottle in some parts of a city may be as long as six months. The amounts tied up in bottles for the milk and mineral water industries run into many hundreds of thousands of rands. Until all those stocks are exhausted, you will have to have two machines running, namely the machine which fills the bottle according to the old imperial measure and the machine which fills it according to the metric system. The question then arises whether the manpower or the machine power is available in the country to tackle that <span class="col_2383-2384" refersTo="page_1209"/>changeover. These are technical matters which require very careful consideration. The adjustment required to change a machine from the imperial system to the metric system involves making the adjustments and test running the machines. Thereafter the machine runs automatically. In many of our companies in the beverage industry the hours of operation are limited to an average production. One frequently finds that in peak periods of a season these machines run at ultimate capacity. For example in the mineral water industry at Christmas time or over the Easter period the factories start probably at least a month or two beforehand to build up a stock to carry them over the peak period. I think that anybody who knows our coastal towns in Natal will tell you that there is a direct correlation between hot sunny weather and production. After a rainy week then production in a factory goes down and the consumption of stocks goes down, but a succession of four sunny week-ends in December and January can make a tremendous difference to the sales of a mineral factory. All these are matters which must be taken into account. The mineral water industry could not meet a changeover to the metric system overnight.</p>

<p>This report also mentions the question of pipes and all the various standards of pipes throughout South Africa, the pipes for our buildings, sewerage, conduit pipes for our electricity industry, none of which have their specifications based on the metric system. These are therefore factors which must be taken into account because when you are adding pipes to existing pipes you cannot alter the dimension because you alter the pressure in those pipes which can create fractures of the joints. Once you have put in for instance a one-inch pipe which does have to stand any pressure at all you cannot add to that a pipe with a greater diameter, no matter how slight, because an undue pressure can fracture the joint and create further complications. The whole of the underground system which is a highly technical, complex and important system in our big cities requires consideration when we change over to the metric system. None of these factors are considered in this report. I am not criticizing the report for that but I think that it is only fair when we are discussing a matter of this kind to bring those matters to the attention of the Minister.</p>

<p>In recent years we have not only had the question of changing over to the metric system as far as industrial pipes are concerned. To-day we have a new factor, namely the introduction of plastics. We have in this country to-day a fast developing plastic industry. The plastic industry has been developing a whole series of pipes for various industrial purposes. A changeover to the metric system will not only involve a change in the size of the pipes but a change in the original dies from which those pipes are extruded. The machines which extrude these pipes have dies which are very expensive. In the majority of cases the machines which extrude these pipes are made overseas. It will then be necessary to have dies made overseas and imported. In these days when the Minister of Finance is concerned about the conservation of foreign exchange, I wonder what he is going to say to the Minister of Economic Affairs should he decide after this discussion to-day to say that he intends to introduce the metric system at once and asks for the provision of foreign exchange. Then we come to the building industry and the question of all the building fittings, namely doors, windows, switches and particularly the internal fittings which will have to be changed to the metric system. It will be necessary for many years to come to stock or to store replacement parts so that if any alterations to these buildings are required, the fittings in the old measurements can be supplied.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, while I commend the mover of this motion on having encouraged this discussion and moved this motion, I think that he has not yet adequately defined &#x201C;as soon as possible&#x201D;. If he means &#x201C;immediately&#x201D;, I have a certain sympathy for his views. <b>I</b> think it has to come eventually. I do feel that as long as the United States of America and Great Britain are tied to the old system, if any changes are to take place, we have to calculate to what extent we can carry the dual system. That is our problem, not the problem of changing over to the metric system. For that reason I think that the discussion has been worth while. I think that it has given an opportunity for all points of view to be expressed. I am quite sure that it has added to the Minister&#x2019;s headaches, because in the last instance he has to take the responsibility and he has to obtain the necessary funds from the Treasury.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it does one&#x2019;s heart good to know that there is such a measure of unanimity in this House in regard to this important principle, namely the introduction of the metric system of weights and measures. It seldom is the case that there is unanimity in this House on a private motion. The hon. member for Kensington remarked that the mover of this motion did not, as is customary, convey his thanks and appreciation. But there is also another respect in which this debate is different. Although the Minister who replies is normally only able to thank Government members for their contributions, this is an occasion on which I am also able to thank members of the Opposition for their contributions. Therefore I want to thank the hon. members for Sunnyside and Koedoespoort, who spoke on the Government side, as well as the hon. members for Kensington, Berea and Pinetown for their respective contributions. In saying that I am glad that we are unanimous as regards this principle, namely that this system should be introduced in South Africa, I am also thoroughly awake to the problems which will be involved. We realize that introducing the decimal system as well as the metric system in a country is a momentous matter. We have experience of the problems the decimal coinage <span class="col_2385-2386" refersTo="page_1210"/>system entailed in South Africa, but we surmounted them. However, I can assure you that we have no illusions as to the fact that it is much easier to introduce the decimal coinage system than it will be to introduce the metric system of weights and measures. There is a big difference as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>We also realize that it entails major implications and complications for the consumers, for those who have to put it into practice. We realize that it will take time to change over. We realize that it will cost money to adapt this system. We also realize fully that we are faced with the problem here, just as in other countries, that the consumer has to adapt himself to it. We have here a large non-White population which may perhaps find it more difficult than others. The experience we have gained in the case of the decimal coinage system, is nevertheless encouraging to us, because that was the very system about which we had misgivings, namely that that section of our population would not accept the new system very easily; but they did accept it very quickly and easily. We realize therefore that this system has quite a number of implications. It was for that very reason that we also followed this practice of making inquiries, just as we did in the case of the decimal coinage system. In the case of the decimal coinage system there was the inquiry which the so-called Becklake Report dealt with in 1948. This was referred to a committee of the Bureau of Standards. There was a select committee which was converted into a commission of inquiry consisting of members from both sides of the House. In my opinion that commission of this House contributed most to this system being accepted eventually. There were problems. It had to be decided what the unit would be and out of how many decimals that unit was to consist. Subsequent to that legislation was launched, and we differed on that. I think the hon. member for Kensington was the only one who agreed when this Act was passed. At that time the Opposition differed from us fundamentally, and they felt that owing to the capital it would require and owing to the manpower position, it was not the proper time for doing so. Today we therefore have the position that, even though there may have been differences as regards the decimal coinage system, fundamentally we do not differ to any great extent at this stage.</p>

<p>After the report of the Decimal Coinage Commission had appeared and after it had been decided in 1959 to introduce a decimal coinage system in 1961, it was felt that we could move in the direction of a metric system as something which follows logically upon the introduction of a decimal coinage system. That is why in 1963 the then Minister of Economic Affairs also issued instructions to the Bureau of Standards to investigate this aspect. Subsequently it was referred to a committee whose report, which was referred to a great deal today, has already been published and Tabled. I think that it is fitting on this occasion to convey to the Bureau of Standards our thanks for the important contribution they rendered as regards both the metric system and the decimal coinage system. When this report was published, there were several problems. In the first place, the reaction had to be tested of commerce and industry and those sectors which would specifically have been involved in that matter. Testing was also necessary for the purpose of finding out how the Opposition felt about this. The Government also had to take a stand in regard to this matter. That is why there has been a lapse of time since this report was published in 1965. This afforded everybody an opportunity of responding to those recommendations. Last year in September the Minister of Economic Affairs announced in this House that the Government had decided to accept the principle of the metric system and to make further inquiries into the actual implementation thereof. At that time he intimated that here were certain problems about which he wanted to consult industry further. The Government therefore indicated the way and in addition allowed scope for reaction. Fortunately, as far as the Opposition was concerned, there was basically no difference as regards this principle. I think that to-day&#x2019;s debate also emphasizes the fact that as regards the desirability of introducing this system, there is basically no difference between us at present.</p>

<p>As regards the industrial sector, the reaction of both SEIFSA and the Federated Chamber of Industries was that they would have liked to investigate this matter further, since it entailed certain problems for them. After further negotiations had taken place, both the Chamber of Industries and SEIFSA informed the Minister in November, 1966, that they had no objections to it, but that they would support the introduction of this system. They also urged that, if this system were to be introduced, it had to be introduced as soon as possible. Therefore they agree with the views expressed here today by both the Government and the Opposition. They also emphasized that the principle of compensation for the introducers thereof, should be accepted. We know that the principle of compensation is not new. It was applied when the decimal system was introduced. Therefore there is no difference as far as that is concerned, but they requested further that a body should be established which would be representative of industry, commerce and other allied interests and which would be responsible to the Minister and be able to serve him with advice as regards the practical implications of the change-over. This was also carried into effect, and in December the Minister instructed the Standards Council in conjunction with his committee on the Metric System of Measures and Weights to inquire into essential machinery needed for coping with the first steps of the change-over. That was the first aspect this Council had to investigate. In addition they had to inquire into what the financial implications of this envisaged machinery would be, and, thirdly, what the terms of reference of this proposed Metric System Board would be. You will recall that after the Decimal Coinage Act had been passed, a Decimalization <span class="col_2387-2388" refersTo="page_1211"/>Board was established, and that it assisted in the change-over to the decimal coinage system. They performed a very important and essential function and they performed it very thoroughly, and the change-over was effected very smoothly and required even less compensation than was anticipated originally. Therefore it is necessary that such a body should also be established now, a body which can assist in the change-over to a metric system. Accordingly the Standards Council considered this request on 13th February this year, and the matter was referred to the same Committee, whose report is already available to us, which has to consider and report to the Government on these three aspects: the constitution of such a board, its terms of reference and its financial implications. As soon as this report is available, the Government will be in a position to judge whether such a metric board should be appointed, what its terms of reference are to be and how it is to operate.</p>

<p>In the course of this debate a great deal of attention was directed to problems which may arise. Therefore I think that this debate has served a very good purpose in that it has afforded hon. members the opportunity of indicating some of those problems. All of these are the problems to which this contemplated Metric System Board will have to pay attention. We realize fully that in order to effect this adaptation as smoothly as possible there will have to be the closest co-operation with commerce and industry and all these bodies which were referred to to-day. Its success can only depend on that.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to certain questions which may arise, i.e. when this metric system has to be introduced. It was pointed out that the longer the Government delayed the introduction thereof, the more the cost involved and the greater the disruption would be. On the other hand, it was pointed out that there could be a cost saving and that it would lead to higher productivity. Then there is the important question as to whether we should make manpower available for this purpose, or whether we have the capital which is to be made available for that purpose. These are questions which will have to be considered by the Government once it has received this report, because it will be important to give an indication as to the time at which this change-over will have to commence. In this respect, unlike the change-over to the decimal coinage system, we cannot have one date only for a complete change-over. This report pointed out that it might take ten to twelve years or even longer, and that it had to be adapted gradually, and that it also had to take place systematically so that there might not be any uncertainty as to what that programme had to be. A great deal of preparatory work will therefore have to be done initially by this contemplated Metric System Board that has been established, and I am convinced that the suggestions which were made to-day about the practical problems which will arise in this regard, will also be of very great value to this contemplated Metric System Board. Therefore, since the Government has already announced that it supports this principle, and since these differences and problems as regards industry did exist basically and uncertainty did prevail amongst them, and since there are indications that this step has the support of the Opposition and that the proposed step also has the whole-hearted support of the Afrikaans Handelsinstituut, the Chambers of Commerce and the Chambers of Industry, the way has been paved for us to make a concerted attempt at putting this system into operation. I think that this debate will to a large extent be instrumental in making those bodies, which will be faced with problems in implementing this system, realize that we have made a great deal of progress towards changing over to the metric system, and that it may at the same time also be an indication to them that they should start thinking of what their specific problems with the change-over will be, so that they may be submitted to the Board mentioned by me at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>I owe the hon. the Minister a great debt of gratitude for this information he has given us. I also want to tell the hon. member for Kensington that I thank that side of the House for their support and the fine contributions they made. I think that this matter has now been discussed very thoroughly&#x2014;in the past we often heard Decimal Dan, and now I am looking forward to hearing Decimal Dan&#x2019;s twin sisters, Hannah and Sannah&#x2014;and that is why I want to withdraw my motion.</p>

<heading>PROFIT MARGINS ON PRIMARY PRODUCTS</heading>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the motion standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that profit margins on certain primary products, and more particularly those not controlled by marketing schemes, are excessive and requests the Government to consider the advisability of immediately appointing a commission of inquiry to investigate and suggest measures to bring about the necessary relief to the consumer, while still allowing the primary producer a reasonable return.</block>

<p>I hope that in the course of the afternoon I shall enjoy the same remarkable experience as the hon. member for Sunnyside, and that the same support from that side of the House will be forthcoming for this motion. We do not often have such peaceful afternoons, and I would hate that peace to be disturbed.</p>

<p>I must necessarily use many statistics to demonstrate the profit margins, and I make no apology for that because it forms part of the argument I want to advance this afternoon to present my case; not so much that the producers should receive more for their produce&#x2014;actually I do not want to make a plea for the producer this afternoon. I want to deal with <span class="col_2389-2390" refersTo="page_1212"/>the consumer and the profit margin and the cost of living involved if products become too expensive. I do not have the time this afternoon to discuss the products controlled in in terms of the Marketing Act, which fixes both the producers&#x2019; price and the consumers&#x2019; price. Nor do I have the time to deal with the products which have a reserve price, or a minimum price, and afterwards an open market. I do not even have time to talk about the dairy industry, which I should have liked to discuss.</p>

<p>I want to begin with the meat product, in respect of which the minimum prices of certain grades are fixed, but not of all grades. I want to begin with the Cape Town abattoirs, and I take as few grades as possible to simplify the matter as much as possible. In saying that I begin with the Cape Town abattoirs, I want to emphasize that the prices on the Newtown market and on the Cape Town market and on the other controlled markets differ very little, with the exception of Durban, where there is some difference. I want to say that the day before yesterday the price of prime beef grade 1 here in the Cape was 18&#x00BD;c a pound, and the price of prime beef grade B was 18¬ºc and of prime beef grade C 17¬æc. Grade 1 beef sold at the abattoirs at 17&#x00BD;c, grade 2 at 17c a pound, and grade 3 beef at 16c a pound. If one compares the prices for the week ending 18th February&#x2014;so that nobody can tell me that I took the prices on the Cape market the day before yesterday but that the prices for the rest of the year were not the same&#x2014;one finds that the prices for the week ending 18th February on the Cape market were virtually indentical with the prices I now want to quote. The prices on the Newtown market differ so little that it is not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>I should now like to give the House the consumers&#x2019; prices. Yesterday the consumers&#x2019; prices here in Cape Town were as follows: rump steak, 50 cents to 60 cents; Beef steak, 50 cents; sirloin, 52 cents, and mince, 29 cents, and the cheapest cuts of the carcass, such as rib or brisket, which we describe as &#x201C;boys&#x2019; meat&#x201D;, were 23 cents. The price of grade A prime beef on the wholesale market was 18&#x00BD; cents a pound, and the cheapest piece of virtually the lowest grade beef carcass, which would sell at 16 cents a pound, is now 23 cents a pound. Sir, I have deliberately given the prices of the ordinary cuts for purposes of comparison, rather than the prices of choice cuts such as fillet, or other choice cuts of which the prices are even much higher. Fillet is sold for as much as 70 to 80 cents a pound, but because it forms a much smaller part of the beef carcass I did not refer to it. This afternoon I just want to demonstrate the large gap between the producers&#x2019; price and the consumers&#x2019; price, and then I want to try to analyse the reason why there is such a large gap and to see whether I cannot suggest some means of reducing this price gap.</p>

<p>On the same dates mutton prices were as follows here in Cape Town: Lamb, grade I, 23&#x00BD; cents; lamb, grade II, 20 cents; mutton, grade I, 20 cents; grade II, 18&#x00BD; cents and grade III, 15 cents. For these the consumer had to pay the following prices: 50 cents to 55 cents for leg of lamb, and 35 cents to 48 cents for barbicue cutlets or &#x201C;chops&#x201D;, and nowadays a mutton carcass is cut up in such a way that by far the major portion, with the exception of the leg of mutton, is cut up into chops. Everything except loin and neck is sold as chops. Nowadays they even cut chops from the shoulder.</p>

<p>When dealing with fruit and vegetables, I take only Cape Town as an example, for the sake of convenience, simply because the prices in Johannesburg and Durban differ very little from those in Cape Town. I have the statistics here in respect of all the controlled centres and I may read them to hon. members, but there is virtually no difference.</p>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>To enable us to see the picture in its correct perspective, could you also give us the prices on that same day or during the same week for half a sheep and a whole sheep?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There are so few people who buy a whole or half a carcass that I did not check the prices, but I can get them. I am now dealing with the large majority of the consumers, not the few people who have the facilities and the funds to buy a whole or half a carcass.</p>

<p>I want to come back to fruit and vegetables. On the Municipal market in Cape Town potatoes, grade I, sold at 70 cents per 37&#x00BD; pounds pocket. The retail price was 5 cents to 6 cents a pound, which comes to 187 cents for the pocket which cost 70 cents. Onions, grade I, sold at 70 cents to 80 cents per 28 pounds pocket on the municipal market, and the retail price as 7 cents a pound, which comes to 186 cents a pocket. Pumpkin sold at 20 cents to 40 cents per 120 pounds pocket, or at 5 cents a pound, and the retail price was 300 cents to 400 cents a pocket. I mention potatoes, onions and pumpkin first, because these are products which are not so perishable that one could argue that it is necessary to demand such a high profit margin with a view to the perishable nature of the products. I want to continue. Green peas were sold at 62 cents per 22&#x00BD; pounds pocket, and the retail price was 6 cents a pocket, which comes to 135 cents a pocket. Yesterday the price of beans on the municipal market of Cape Town was 100 cents to 120 cents per 22&#x00BD; pounds pocket, and the retail price was 15 cents a pound, which comes to 337 cents a pocket. The price of carrots per dozen bunches was 50 cents to 60 cents, and the retail price was 6 cents a bunch. The wholesale price for beetroot was the same and the retail price was 8 cents a pound. As for fruit, one finds that large oranges are now sold at 120 cents a pocket, and that the consumer has to pay 4 cents a piece for large oranges. The price of medium oranges ranges from 80 cents to 100 cents a pocket, and the retail price is 3 cents each. Apples, grade I, are sold on the wholesale market at 200 cents <span class="col_2391-2392" refersTo="page_1213"/>to 250 cents a box, depending on the variety, and the consumer pays 5 cents a piece, which comes to 400 cents per bushel box. A 10 pounds box of grapes is sold on the municipal market at 25 cents to 40 cents, and the retail price is 7 cents to 9 cents a pound.</p>

<p>I think the prices I have mentioned above prove that the producer does not make a fortune from his products, but that the consumer pays through his nose. In my view the consumer has to pay unreasonable prices for the fruit and the vegetables he has to buy to feed his family and to keep them in good health. I appreciate the perishable nature of these products and the problems involved in handling such products. If we analyse the reason why the consumers&#x2019; price is always double and treble the producers&#x2019; price, we come to the conclusion that over-trading is most certainly one of the causes. In this regard I have also done some research. The statistics I obtained in this connection are almost shocking. I knew that there was over-trading in many of these industries, but I never knew that there was over-trading to such an extent. Here are the latest statistics in this connection, which I obtained from the municipal licensing section of Cape Town. The white population of the Cape Town Municipal area totals 198,480; the Coloured population 319,440; the Bantu population 88,930, and the Asiatics 500; a total of 607,350. Sir, here in Cape Town we have 420 licensed retail butchers; 2,010 greengrocers and 1,300 hawkers. There are 2,010 greengrocers. [Interjection.] I referred to wholesale and retail butchers. There are 1,300 venders and hawkers. If one person in a family of five or if one person in five buys the supplies needed by a family, it means that every greengrocer can cater for only 35 customers. That is all that will buy from him out of the population of all colour and race groups in the Cape. A butcher can cater for 300 customers. Surely this is irrefutable proof of the fact that the industry is hopelessly over-traded. I am not saying that the vendor does not render a service. Nor do I want to say that the retail greengrocer does not render a service. Nor do I want to say this afternoon what has been said so frequently, namely that the housewife is too lazy to walk to the municipal market and that she consequently has to pay these prices.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I said I was not going to say it. I may say that if the housewife were to take the risk of going to the municipal markets, not so much in Cape Town, where the position is somewhat better, but in Newtown and other municipal markets, she would have the utmost difficulty to buy on the retail market. The reason for that is that the wholesalers buy the wares in large quantities, and as a result the housewife finds it difficult to get anything. The fact of the matter is that some of the people render services in the trade merely by taking the products around to the front doors of the consumers. Do you know, Sir, that the licensed hawkers trading in the more well-to-do parts of Cape Town add a further cent to the selling price just because they bring the fruit and vegetables to the housewife&#x2019;s front door? They do that even though they trade only by means of a cart and two horses, and do not have licence fees to pay in respect of permanent premises, or lights, rent and other costs in connection with premises. The prices I have quoted should therefore be increased by a cent if I were to use the hawkers&#x2019; prices as examples in respect of the distribution of products. Here we have an interesting figure. We find that Durban, with a population of 55,000 more than the population of the municipal area of Cape Town&#x2014;Durban&#x2019;s population is 664,000&#x2014;has only 256 licensed butchers. Therefore Durban has 164 butchers fewer than Cape Town, which has a smaller population. We know that the Meat Board issues the licenses. I do not know what policy they follow in determining to whom licenses should be issued. I find it abominable that Durban, with its larger population, can get along with 164 fewer butchers than Cape Town. It goes without saying that if they are to make a profit on their turnover, after paying their costs, they will necessarily charge more for meat in Cape Town than in Durban, for example. If everyone has to make a living, everyone&#x2019;s profit margin will have to be so much larger if the distribution and the industry are over-traded.</p>

<p>I want to repeat, Sir, that I am not pleading for higher prices for the farmer. I am pleading that the consumer should not have to pay such a high price, and that the profit margin should be reduced. Not only will this mean a lower cost of living, but it will also mean increased consumption of the farmer&#x2019;s produce, which is so frequently over-produced. This will be possible if his produce is brought to the consumer in such a way that the profit margin will be reduced.</p>

<p>It should also be done in a way which will bring about a larger market and which will enable a larger cross-section of the population to buy, a section of the population which frequently cannot afford buying the products at the abovementioned prices. If it is felt that I have been unreasonable in the quotations I have made, I want to tell hon. members that over a period of three or four days I visited the humblest and best butchers and dealers and simply wrote down their prices. The figures I have furnished here represent a fair cross-section. Some of the dealers charge prices which are much higher than the ones I quoted. But those are not the ones I wanted to use. What I wanted to do in this motion was to demonstrate that the products to which I have just referred, namely meat, vegetables and fruit, carry a profit margin which allows the consumers&#x2019; buying price to be twice or three times as high as the producers&#x2019; selling price. I repeat, Sir, that I am not pleading for a higher price for the producer. I am pleading <span class="col_2393-2394" refersTo="page_1214"/>that a commission should be appointed and a report produced. I am certain that even the hon. the Minister will welcome it if a method can be devised whereby marketing can be better and more economic. I think the time has come for this to be enquired into.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I am not convinced that the municipalities of our cities are the proper or best concerns to market the producers&#x2019; products on his behalf. There are other countries where it is done differently. There are other countries where it is done cooperatively. In some countries utility corporations are established to render this kind of service. The municipality provides a service which nobody else provides. As yet we have no other organization which can provide this service. In my view, however, it remains a question whether this is the best method of marketing the farmers&#x2019; products, whether the body doing it at present is in fact the best one.</p>

<p>They perform this service because in the past no one else performed it or expressed his willingness to perform this function. The fact of the matter is that the city council fixes the commission and the levy on the building made available to the producer for marketing his product. Those buildings have to pay for themselves over a period of years, although the commission basis remains the same. I am not sure whether or not it then accrues to the general revenue of the council. Nor do I know whether it is ploughed back for the benefit of the producer. But the fact remains that the producer himself will in the final instance have to pay for the buildings and premises provided for marketing his products. The commission may also inquire into this matter and make an analysis in order to determine whether there is not a more effective and better way of marketing the producers&#x2019; products. I just want to mention that in Australia a great deal of progress has been made as far as this kind of inquiry is concerned. In many of the major centres in that country it is no longer the municipalities who provide the marketing premises, etc., where the farmers&#x2019; products are marketed. We also know that the system in the Nordic countries, in Denmark and Holland, is completely different from the local one.</p>

<p>When opening the Cape Agricultural Show some days ago the hon. the Minister of Defence said something which in my view contains a great deal of truth. He said that food shortages and poor distribution systems in respect of food have given rise to more than one revolution in the history of the world. We see that wherever food is in short supply, the population is discontented. I think we should give attention to weaknesses in the distribution system. I want to state that in respect of the products I have mentioned, the distribution system is extremely poor and can do with a great deal of improvement. I think it is within the ambit and ability of a commission to analyse all the problems mentioned, and to produce recommendations aimed at the elimination of such points of friction.</p>

<p>I am aware of the commission appointed on the marketing of agricultural products. I want to make the statement that that commission is not the right one to deal with the aspect of agriculture which I have mentioned, within the ambit of its terms of reference and within the ambit of its functions and the investigation to be carried out by it. It cannot make recommendations to suggest a solution to this problem and to reduce the profit margin. I have no hesitation in moving this motion and in asking for the appointment of such a commission.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for East London (City) has made some interesting points, but one fact is as plain as a pikestaff. That is that although the hon. member did a great deal of homework, it was not of the right quality or kind. A moment ago, just before he concluded, he said that he wondered whether the municipal markets were the proper organizations for marketing farmers&#x2019; products. He is now calling for a commission of inquiry to investigate this matter, <i>inter alia.</i> Could he be unaware of the Slater Commission, which has just completed its inquiry into this matter? Thus I could continue to demonstrate that the hon. member has really not done his homework properly. He talked about a commission of inquiry to investigate these matters. Here in my hand I have a long list of reports available to this House. These are commissions which inquire specifically into the matter for which he pleaded this afternoon. In the course of my speech I shall deal with these reports. It is just one of those things that the distributor, or the so-called middleman, is such a convenient scapegoat for all the evils of high prices and large differences in profit margins. This phenomenon did not originate yesterday or the day before. Even the philosopher Plato referred to it in the fourth century before Christ in his well-known philosophical work <i>The Republic.</i> In that he wrote, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Few are the men&#x2014;they need rare natural gifts and the best of education&#x2014;who can show moderation when assailed by wants and desires; few, who are sober when they have a chance of making large sums of money and who are content with moderate profits. The mass of mankind are the exact opposite; their desires are unbounded, their appetite for gain unlimited. This explains the attacks on such occupations as retail business, commerce, and hotel-keeping, and the disrepute under which they lie.</block>

<p>Plato&#x2019;s philosophy of 23 centuries ago is still quite valid to-day. But it is equally true that man is negative by nature and usually tries to blame someone else. It is therefore a truly human attribute which the hon. member for East London (City) revealed this afternoon, namely to try to blame the next man for everything instead of searching his own heart <span class="col_2395-2396" refersTo="page_1215"/>or looking for the blame in the people for whom he made a plea this afternoon. No wonder the Great Teacher said 20 centuries ago: &#x201C;First cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother&#x2019;s eye&#x201D;. That also epitomizes the great difference between the statesmen on the one hand and the opposition, or the man with the opposition mentality, on the other hand. The latter finds faults and problems in society, and waxes very eloquent about them. The statesman, on the other hand, always has at least some ideas on how to solve that problem.</p>

<p>Many economists, many governments and many commissions have devoted attention to the problem of reducing the gap between producers&#x2019; prices and consumers&#x2019; prices. <b>The fact</b> of the matter is, <b>of course, that as a nation</b> becomes industrialized and urbanized, the channel or the distribution chain becomes longer and longer, and consequently the gap between the producers&#x2019; price on the one hand and the consumers&#x2019; price on the other becomes wider and wider. In the old days we had the first step, of course, when the town dweller bought his fruit, vegetables, butter and eggs and even his slaughter stock from his farming neighbour. Then there was no gap. The second step was when the town butcher went out into the district to buy some slaughter stock. He then slaughtered only enough for that particular day and saw to it that all the town dwellers got their meat. There was no waste as a result of meat going bad. The transport costs were very low, because the butchers did not travel very far. I am also thinking of the farmer who took eggs and butter with him when he went to town and sold them either directly to the public or to the shops. The profit margin was very small, because there were few overheads and no complaints. There was also the fruit vendor who went to the farms to buy some fruit and vegetables and then sold them to the town dwellers. Then again there was a very small gap between the producers&#x2019; prices on the one hand and the consumers&#x2019; prices on the other. Here, Mr. Speaker, you will permit me to tell something from my childhood days, because I recall that little scene with nostalgia. The old Malay vendor came to our farm every morning on his one-horse cart and loaded watermelons and sweet melons, a few boxes of hanepoot grapes and some boxes of other fruit, and within half an hour he left with that fresh fruit. Then one could hear him travel up and down the streets of Paarl, &#x201C;Die waatlemoene! Die watermelons! Hier, die lekker waatlemoene! So rooi as bloed, so suikersoet! Hier, die lekker waatlemoene!&#x201D; It is like the fish bugle of the fish vendor. In that way he called out the housewives, and long before midday all the women in town had bought their fresh fruit at a very reasonable price. That is how the old vendor supplied the housewives, who in those days of course did not have outside jobs so frequently, of fruit in season.</p>

<p>This contains a very important principle. If one wants to keep the consumers&#x2019; prices low, one has to see to it that fruit and vegetables are sold in season and not out of season. This old vendor, Alec, also made it his job to educate the housewives. If a housewife dared ask for watermelon during the orange season he would tell her very quickly: &#x201C;But my dear madam, don&#x2019;t be difficult and don&#x2019;t be troublesome. Surely this is not watermelon time. This is orange time!&#x201D; The housewives of those days had old Alec to educate them to buy in season. It is a pity the East London housewives do not have old Alec. All they have is Jan Moolman. I am afraid they do not get the necessary education, with the result that they buy injudiciously, and that is why the prices are so high.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member&#x2019;s motion calls for a commission of inquiry. That is the easy and convenient solution, of course. If you yourself do not have a solution to a problem, you simply call for a commission of inquiry. If you cannot run with the ball yourself, you simply pass it on. No matter who catches the ball or whether he can play it. You simply pass the ball. But will the hon. member for East London (City) give evidence before such a commission, and evidence of a positive nature, evidence to offer a solution to this problem which he emphasized so eloquently this afternoon? In my hand, as I have said, I have a bunch of commission reports relating to these matters. Here I have the report of the Distribution Costs Commission on the system of distribution prevailing in the Union, with particular reference to essential foodstuffs and the principles of State-controlled marketing. I really thought the hon. member would have studied that, because it is a commission report of a United Party Government under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Stratford. It is a remarkably interesting report on the question of the distribution costs of fresh products and commodities. Then there is a further report by the Marketing Act Commission of 1947, which is also most informative. Here in my hand I have the latest report of the South African Agricultural Union on these matters. Then there is the report of the commission of inquiry into abattoirs and related facilities, which deals with the distribution costs of meat, amongst other things. Then there is the report on marketing agents, and also the report to which I referred a moment ago, the Slater report, which has not yet been tabled but which further investigates the question of municipal markets.</p>

<p>What are the dates of those reports?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>They range from 1947 to 1965. Here in my hand I also have the latest report of the National Marketing Council on the boards of control in terms of the <span class="col_2397-2398" refersTo="page_1216"/>Marketing Act, for the period 1950 to 1964. All these were available to the hon. member. If he had studied them he would perhaps have had the solution to the problems he outlined this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the crucial problem always centres on the alternatives of State control versus private enterprise with free competition. Since the Marketing Act was passed in 1937 our well-known agricultural products have come under State control one by one. At present there are no fewer than 18 such control schemes in operation. They control about 91 per cent of our total agricultural production. There are wide differences between these various systems, of course, but I fear I shall not have the time to elaborate on that. The interesting phenomenon which I want to emphasize is that at present the trend is once again away from total control. I take the example of the Deciduous Fruit Board. With regard to export there is of course the single channel pool scheme, and all deciduous fruit, except melons, are controlled by this single channel pool scheme. As for the domestic market, there has been a great change since 1939, when the scheme was established. Let us consider the example of grapes. At first there was a fixed-price policy, with the board as the only dealer in the 19 major municipal areas of the Union. It was only by 1952 that control was abolished in the production area of the Western Cape. That immediately meant a minor tendency away from total control. Then fixed producers&#x2019; prices were abolished and a pool system was also established in terms of which the yields on the pool accrued to the farmers. By approximately 1963 there was a further departure from this total control in that distributors registered with the Deciduous Fruit Board were allowed to sell directly to the trade in the large municipal areas. You will therefore perceive that there is a trend away from total control. In passing I want to recommend to the hon. member for East London (City) that he make a thorough study of this system of the Deciduous Fruit Board, because in my view it is one of the finest schemes under the Marketing Act, and he may learn a great deal from it. The recommendation of the National Marketing Council, as stated in its latest report, which I have here, also shows a tendency in that direction. Thus it states in paragraph 47: &#x201C;But even in the case of maize,&#x201D; which is pre-eminently a product for rigid, complete control, &#x201C;the Council is of the opinion that a greater measure of flexibility is desirable.&#x201D; Let us see what the Marketing Council has to say about meat in paragraph 131&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Marketing Council does not believe that the Meat Board can effectively rationalize the retail butchery trade by means of restrictive registration &#x2026; It cannot be assumed, however, that an arbitrary reduction in the number of butcheries will lead to reduced costs.</block>

<p>Surely we have been experiencing that for many years in the case of bottle stores. If one wishes to restrict the number of distributors by means of licensing or any other method, one attaches to that licence a value for which the buyer of the licence then has to pay, which must necessarily increase the price of the product to the consumer. Less than 9 per cent of the agricultural products which do not come under one of the 18 control schemes is vegetables and certain kinds of fruit, for example avocados, papaws, mangos, guavas and apples, to which the hon. member referred. The Stratford Commission is very explicit on price fixation. In paragraph 85, for example, they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are definitely of opinion that, except in times of emergency, no prices should be fixed unless a most thorough investigation has established the existence of unduly high profits or high costs or inefficiency as well as their causes, and an examination of all the difficulties involved has shown that price fixation is not only practicable but is likely to achieve, on its own or in conjunction with other measures, the ends in view.</block>

<p>Now I do not know how the hon. member for East London (City) would reduce or restrict the gap between producers&#x2019; and consumers&#x2019; prices. With regard to vegetables, more particularly, the Stratford Commission states very explicitly in paragraph 87 that it would never dare to attempt the fixation of prices in respect of vegetables. We have had all these commissions of inquiry and their reports have been published. On the part of the producer, on the part of the distributor and on the part of the State a vast deal has been done to meet the consumer in an attempt to reduce the gap between the producers&#x2019; price and the consumers&#x2019; price.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for East London (City) should now turn to the consumer for a change and try to educate him in order that he may do something for his part to reduce that wide margin, that large gap. In the little time I have left I shall make a few suggestions which the hon. member may use in his constituency. The first I have already mentioned, namely to buy in season and not out of season. Secondly, the housewives may join forces to buy on the market. The hon. member said that the housewife had no hope of buying there because the wholesalers bought large quantities with the result that the housewife did not stand a chance. Under the system which has prevailed on the Cape Town market for many years, the out-of-hand sales, and which has now also been extended to Johannesburg and Pretoria and other markets, the housewife can indeed buy her requirements on the market with the greatest of ease. But Cape Town has gone even further. The Cape Town Municipality has established retail markets in the various suburbs, but the housewives do not make adequate use of them. Thus, for example, there is the retail market at Plumstead, and to say that it is visited by 200 <span class="col_2399-2400" refersTo="page_1217"/>buyers would be putting it too high. The market is brought virtually to the housewife&#x2019;s front door, and yet she does not use it. Finally there is the system of private orders. Here in my hand I have a list of private distributors who can carry out private orders, which I obtained from the Deciduous Fruit Board. Anybody who is interested in this list can get it and can select the distributor with whom he may place his orders, and then he would eliminate that &#x201C;scape-goat&#x201D;, the middleman. In these ways the consumer for his part can begin to do something to reduce this wide gap. I want to repeat that so many reports have been published that there is really no need to appoint another commission to consolidate all the work of the other commissions. I see no reason whatsoever for another commission as requested by the hon. member for East London (City).</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl started off by being a philosopher, but before he got very far he changed his role to one of a trouble-seeker. I see no reason at all to have turned this debate into an attack on the hon. member for East London (City). I had not intended to deal with the motion before the House in that spirit, but seeing that the hon. member has deliberately gone out of his way to attack both the hon. member and the motion he introduced, I think it is perhaps wise to spend a little time on the speech of the hon. member for Paarl.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl started off by saying that there had been a mass of reports, and he named five of them which he had in his hand. If, instead of reading those reports, the hon. member had read the motion, he would have seen that this motion specifically refers to items not under the control of marketing boards.</p>

<p>Read the motion.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>In introducing the motion, the hon. member made it clear that he was dealing with products not under the control of marketing boards. [Interjections.] He made it quite clear in his opening remarks that he was referring to the words &#x201C;and more particularly those not controlled by marketing schemes&#x201D;, and his whole speech was designed to deal with those not controlled by marketing schemes. The trouble with the hon. member for Paarl is that he had already prepared his speech, and having got his notes in front of him he was unable to make any other speech but the one he had already prepared.</p>

<p>But the other field in which the hon. member for Paarl is seeking trouble is by his attack on the housewives. The implication of his speech was to put the blame on the housewives of South Africa for the high distribution costs. He ended up by saying that we have had all the investigations we want and it is time that the housewives got down and solved this problem, and this is what they must do, and that is what they must do. I will deal with those points in due course, but I think it was most unwise of the hon. member to attack the housewives in this manner, because if there is one group of the population of South Africa which is suffering to-day, it is the housewives who have to stretch their budgets to cover the continually rising costs of the foodstuffs which are essential for their families. She is the last person to be attacked; she is the victim of price inflation, and not the cause of it. What I want to know is this. That hon. member quoted the report of one commission after the other, but I specifically asked him the date of those reports, and he admitted that the first was in 1947. It was the report of a commission appointed by the United Party Government. He must not blame us for raising this matter. He must blame his own Government for having sat there for 18 years with all these reports before them and doing nothing about it. It is no good having reports; what we want is solutions. Therefore it is a pity that that hon. member should have taken the line he has taken. I want to admit immediately that this is no easy problem; it is not a simple problem which can be solved by a simple formula. It is a problem which has defied successive governments. So I say without any shame, or without trying to make any political capital out of it, that it is not only this Government that has failed, but that all governments in South Africa have failed to find the final solution to the marketing particularly of perishable products, which must be sold within a fixed time or otherwise they go bad and must be destroyed.</p>

<p>But that does not solve the problem of the housewife who is usually, in 99 per cent of cases, a person with a fixed income from which she must first of all meet fixed expenditure. She has to meet her rent, which is a fixed expenditure. The breadwinner has to meet his transport expenses to get to work, and there are educational and medical expenses. Most of the expenses of a household are fixed expenses which go on month after month. There are really only three variable expenses in a household budget. One is food, one is clothing, and one is entertainment and pleasure. As costs go up and up and rents go higher and higher, and transport costs increase, the housewife, trying to come out on a fixed income, or the pensioner, or the lower income groups with a very low income with which to meet that expenditure, must turn to those three items to try to effect savings. The tragedy is that we are reaching the stage where far too many families in facing that problem have come to the point where they have already cut out their recreation and their entertainment. They have reduced their clothing expenditure to a minimum and they have had to turn to food as the item on which they have to cut. They start usually by buying food of slightly poorer quality; then they turn to reducing the variety of food, and in reducing the variety they usually turn away from the more expensive foods to the cheaper foods, which means that they usually turn away from proteins to starches.</p>

<p><span class="col_2401-2402" refersTo="page_1218"/>Everybody knows that proteins are essential to the health of the human being, but they are the things which come from the most expensive items in the budget. I have here a cross-section sample of the requirements of an ordinary household, and if you look at the expensive items you find that they are eggs, bacon, butter, cheese and meat. These items cost from two to ten times as much as items like mealie meal, bread, the starches, the cheaper foods, in terms of price for weight. In pruning their budget therefore it is in the more expensive items that the cut is made, and that means that the cut is made in the protein containing foodstuffs. This essentially reacts upon the health of the family. Sir, I am not scoring a debating point&#x2014;it is a fact&#x2014;when I say that in South Africa as we stand here this afternoon there is starvation amongst our people. There are people who are in hospital because of starvation.</p>

<p>I am coming to the markets. I am dealing with the problem of rising costs which affect the health of our people. I say again that there are people in South Africa suffering from starvation and from a lack of the essential proteins which are to be found in the more expensive foods, and while that is going on one reads about foodstuffs being destroyed, about fruit being fed to the pigs and cattle, about health-giving and life-giving foodstuffs being destroyed because their sale would bring down the prices of those products.</p>

<p>Have we not always had this diet problem in South Africa?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, it has not always been a problem; it is a developing problem. As meat and animal products have become more and more expensive, the consumption of those products has dropped. Starches have always been the staple diet of a large section of our people, but their diet has always been supplemented by animal foods, by milk, butter and meat. The Bantu no longer keep their little herd of cattle or goats which could provide them with milk and meat, once they move into the cities, as they used to do when they were on the farms and in the reserves. As South Africa&#x2019;s population has become urbanized, the rural peasant type who could supplement his starch diet with proteins is no longer able to do so. We have not always had the present pattern; it is a pattern which has developed as a result of urbanization.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, year after year, when there is a glut or a surplus of some commodity, we read of the destruction of foodstuffs. Surely we in this country can find some solution to this problem so that food is not thrown away while people are starving; that people are paying high prices for food while the producer is barely able to make a living on the prices paid to him. The price gap between the producer and the consumer is one which has concerned the producer particularly over the years. Many attempts have been made to find a solution to this problem. Let me look for a moment at the various ways in which a product goes from the farmer to the consumer. There are ten methods. The first four methods are direct sales, the methods referred to by the hon. member for Paarl, firstly, sales by the farmer direct to the consumer, a method which is still followed in some country towns and in some of our cities. The farmer himself takes his own product and goes and sells it direct to the consumer. He loads up his lorry, finds a parking spot somewhere outside the city and sells to the passing traffic, or he may even go from door to door selling his own product.</p>

<p>The next step is the farm stall, where the farmer sells his own product from his own stall, on the farm, usually alongside a main road. The third is the market stall where the farmer can hire a stall and market his own product. The fourth is the auction where his product is put up for sale. But each of these steps, as it gets further and further away from the method of direct sale by the producer to the consumer, becomes more expensive to the <span class="col_2403-2404" refersTo="page_1219"/>consumer. The cheapest method is direct sale by the farmer to the consumer, and then as you get further away from direct sales, as you move to the stalls, where rent has to be paid and where other costs come into the picture, and then finally to the auction, where you have your market fees and your agents&#x2019; fees and your transport and other costs, so the gap between the producer&#x2019;s price and the consumer&#x2019;s price broadens; and then you move beyond that to the indirect sale, the sale at stall level, where somebody buys the product on the market, a middle-man, and sells it at a stall on the same market. Then again it moves from there to the hawker who takes the product from the market to the consumer, again a slightly more expensive process; and then thirdly we get the shops and the tearooms, the third form of indirect sale, with the price then reaching its peak.</p>

<p>I am not dealing here with the third form of sale, the preserved form, the canning of a product, the freezing of a product or the dehydration of a product. With those three you have ten different ways in which products are sold and each of those methods costs more and more as it gets further away from the producer.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it was the hon. member for Bethlehem who spoke of the mobile markets in Pretoria. I happen to have been one of a group of farmers who once decided that we would try to beat this problem of the gap between producer and consumer and we established a co-operative business to sell our own products direct, as a hawker would do, to the consumer. Sir, we had all the answers. We were going to show that this tremendous gap between producer and consumer was not necessary. I think it lasted for two years.</p>

They want that extra delicacy which may be out of season or which may come from another area. And, Sir, they are entitled to want it.</p>

<p>You still have to distribute the products.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The distribution can be done evenly. The prices can be levelled out when the fresh produce is stored. We will not have the peaks and the valleys due to the producer having to accept the price he is offered to-day because to-morrow his product will be bad. As long as the producer is forced to sell at whatever price he is offered, for so long will we have rings coming together, cornering a particular item, offering low prices for it with no competition. The buyers form a buyers&#x2019; ring and the producer is forced to accept their price because he cannot wait for the next day or the day thereafter by reason of the fact that his goods will go bad. But if the producer knows that he can put that product into cold storage then it is not obligatory for him to accept the rock-bottom price forced on him. That is one aspect of the problem. It is not the final answer. I concede that it is an expensive factor, but nevertheless it is one that can contribute towards solving this problem. The other problem is that of the rings, the buyers&#x2019; rings cornering an item. The third problem is the one which the hon. member for Paarl so glibly passed over, namely that of the housewive personally buying at a normal market. I know that in theory the housewives can buy goods in single boxes. In theory they can do it. But who can do it? Firstly, the housewife with a motor-car who can get to the market. She can then, as the hon. member suggests, form a group and buy for three or four families. Secondly, the housewife who can afford to buy in semi-bulk quantities which, nonetheless, to the producer is a small quantity, although to the consumer it is often, relatively speaking, a big quantity. I think of the purchase of a bag of potatoes, a box of tomatoes, which is the minimum quantity which can be bought, but which, for two people living in a flat, is to much.</p>

I said at the beginning of my speech that this Government has been sitting for 18 years with commission after commission reporting and making suggestions, yet it has not found a solution. [Interjections.] No, it is not wrong. The hon. member for Paarl says that: &#x201C;here are all the reports.&#x201D; But we have not got the solution. Mr. Speaker, we are years and years behind the U.S. when it comes to refrigeration.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The gap in America is no bigger than it is in South Africa. Refrigeration contributes to reducing the gap. I am not one of those who claim that the middleman is making all the profit. We do not find an awful lot of hawkers driving around in cadillacs. That privilege is confined to the Cabinet Ministers, to Deputy Ministers, Commisioner-Generals, etc. But the hawker does not normally drive around in a cadillac. He is not a millionaire. So the middleman is not making a fortune, although there are some who have. But I think that some of the causes can be found in the points raised by the hon. member for East London (City). He mentioned the multiplicity of distribution points here in Cape Town, for instance. It works out that for every hawker there are 35 potential customers. Every time there is an increase in the number of distribution points, there is an extra one who has to make a profit, who has to cover his overheads.</p>

<p>I repeat, Sir, that there is no simple solution. But there are numerous items which, although it might not eliminate the problem, will at least contribute towards easing it. We ask that the Government, if it does not want to appoint a commission now, do something about it. If it has not got the answer, let it continue investigating. Even if it requires 20 or as many as 100 commissions, then, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, let us have them, until eventually one of those commissions finds an answer. Because five commissions have not found an answer, it does not mean that we should stop investigating. Or is the Government prepared to say that it has tried, it cannot do any more, simply shrugs its shoulders and give up? We must go on trying, seeking solutions. We will not find them in this House, but we can go on looking for them, until we and public opinion force the Government to do something towards reducing the margin between consumer and producer, before we have a greater number of our families reducing their food to the danger level.</p>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down referred to the report to which the hon. member for Paarl also referred, namely the report of the Distribution Costs Commission. He said that that report was presented in 1947, and that the then Government did not have the opportunity of implementing it. I shall now read an extract from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe, however, that the loss of political and individual freedom will be too high a price to pay for the autocratic, planned economy of State capitalism, and we recommend that the State should not intervene with improved measures before the problem has been studied carefully in advance and before the possible effect of intervention has been considered carefully.</block>

<p>The hon. member asked why the recommendations of the Commission could not be implemented. The recommendations were that in certain cases certain things should not be implemented. A commission was appointed in 1943. There were not only five commissions. If one reads the following extract, one is reminded of the hon. member for Durban (Point). Just listen, Sir. If one reads this one thinks of the hon. member for Durban (Point). The extract reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1943 the Reconstruction Committee of the Department of Agriculture went even further in its plea for unified guidance and found the following: &#x201C;While, however, municipal markets play a very important part in feeding the people, it has to be admitted that their conduct and organization has by no means kept pace with modern demands. <span class="col_2407-2408" refersTo="page_1221"/>mands. In the first place, even in the bestrun municipalities, the market has often been the play-ball of parish politics &#x2026; at the mercy of rank amateurs.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Do you not think that this is descriptive of the hon. member for Durban (Point)? It was not at all my intention to attack people in this vein, because this motion is praiseworthy in the sense that we all want &#x201C;relief to the consumer&#x201D;&#x2014;as this motion reads&#x2014;and that we also want to allow the primary producer a reasonable return. However, not one of the previous speakers offered any practical solution. It is such a relative question to ask what constitutes a reasonable price. The intentions of the hon. member for East London (City) were probably very good. I thought that he would give us something positive to-day and would say, &#x201C;Look, this is a positive suggestion and now you can solve the problem.&#x201D; To one person 50 cents for a pocket of potatoes constitutes a very reasonable price. To another person R1 per pocket constitutes an unrealistic and unreasonable price, because it does not afford him a living. These things depend on the distance from the market, on the place where the potatoes are produced and on the fact whether that is a frost-free area with a low yield. I can mention whole series of cases to you in which there is this marked difference. I should like the hon. member for Durban (Point) to remember that in spite of all the control exercised by his Government in the past, or views which it held in this regard, there was a tremendous shortage of potatoes on the market for a period of four weeks in 1943. The price of potatoes soared and what did the then Government do? It fixed a maximum price of ¬£1 5s. Od. for a pocket of potatoes of 150 lbs., but fixed no minimum price. After a period of six weeks the price fell to half-a-crown per pocket and at that time, in 1943, farmers were forced from production. That was the practical way in which that Government dealt with agriculture. [Interjection.] Yes, a war was in progress. In regard to the commissions I want to say that of the numerous reports of the commissions, there is one in particular which is informative. The hon. member for Benoni went on an overseas mission in connection with one of these commissions. They sent experts throughout the world to investigate marketing in the different countries and to return with recommendations. It was then said, &#x201C;If you apply those recommendations in practice, you come up against many problems&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I repeat that we should all like that margin to be narrower but it should be borne in mind that at present we cannot tell a producer, &#x201C;You may send your products to such and such a place and you may not send your products to such and such a place&#x201D;. Everyone is free to send his products to wherever he likes. You must remember that the Cape market is entirely dependent on products from the Transvaal at times, whereas the Transvaal is dependent on products from the Cape. How is one going to control such a variety of things? The hon. member spoke of control. It seems to me that the hon. member for Durban (Point) specializes in agriculture. To me he would look very nice as the chairman of the pumpkin board. There are seven or eight varieties of pumpkin. We must bear in mind the quantity which is available. Do you know, just to mention one small example, that the Johannesburg market is the largest distributor of water melons in the southern hemisphere on a summer&#x2019;s day? If it is overcast the next day and rains, the price of those beautiful watermelons drops by 40 per cent, because who eats watermelons on a rainy day? Solve this problem for me. How can you? Then it is said that the producer receives very little and that there is a surplus and wastage. The present position in South Africa is&#x2014;and I admit that and I give the hon. member for Durban (Point) full marks on that score&#x2014;that one finds a small retail distributor of fruit on every street corner. There are too many of them. In order to make a living he must make a large profit. He does not specialize. He also has a variety of other things. Are you prepared to say, &#x201C;Decrease their numbers. Take away the livelihood of those people&#x201D;. At times I am inclined to say that we should investigate or consider that, but just go into that matter. What is his percentage of wastage? It is 20 to 30 per cent. The hon. member spoke of Indians who got rich. Do you know I can give you the names of hawkers who work for 18 hours per day and have not become rich.</p>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I misunderstood the hon. member, but I ask whether they are not rendering an essential service. Before asking whether it is possible to eliminate these people, we must consider who the people are who buy from them. Can we expect housewives to go to the market, for example in the case of Johannesburg which has one million residents? [Interjection.] No, if every suburb has its own market with its own railway line it will be possible for those people to go to such markets. In view of the fact that we are at present aiming at one thing, namely the reduction of the number of Bantu in the White areas, with the result that the housewife does her own work and takes a job, I want to ask you whether you have ever thought that a tremendous change is taking place in the eating habits of our nation and that we should not be blinded by the problem of distribution.</p>

<p>There are other solutions. During the past three years the consumption of tinned food in our country has increased by between 10 and 12 per cent annually. During the past season, which ended last week, 20,000 tons of green mealies were tinned in one pound tins in this country. Four years ago 9,000 tons were tinned. The eating habits of our people are changing. Instant foods, foods which can be prepared quickly and vegetables which have already been peeled, are being used to an increasing <span class="col_2409-2410" refersTo="page_1222"/>extent in our country. I admit that irregularities sometimes do occur on our municipal markets, but fortunately some places are eliminating them. In this regard I should like to mention the Cape Town market in particular. The markets of small villages are disappearing. In the Eastern Transvaal one hardly finds a village which has a market. There is a concentration of buyers on the large Johannesburg market. Twice a week lorries go to fetch the supplies for that week. Things are fortunately also changing on markets where auctions are held. On the Cape Town market more sales are effected through negotiation and auctions have decreased by more than 40 per cent. The producer is faced with the difficulty that he may lose his bargaining position&#x2014;one person is selling by private contract, the other sends his products to the market and at present there is a considerable number of wholesale distributors who enter into contracts with farmers. That has a major disadvantage. The small man is going to disappear. That is the present trend. Let us examine overseas conditions. In America there are wholesalers who go in for special packaging and quality and specialize in entering into contracts. They are cornering the market. There are chain stores in America who enter into these contracts with the result that the municipal market is bleeding to death. At present there is a commission of inquiry in Washington&#x2014;and I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) will be very pleased about that&#x2014;which is investigating this matter in order to ascertain whether the market cannot be restored to its rightful place, because the small man is complaining that he cannot make a living. Those wholesale distributors themselves provide the storage and refrigeration to which the hon. member referred.</p>

<p>It has been found that the refrigeration of an essentially cheap product, such as beetroot and carrots for example, more than quadruples the original price of that product. The refrigeration of a cheap food or a staple food for the market is something which is extremely expensive. On the basis of a random test which was conducted in England&#x2014;just to prove to you that the entire world is looking for a practical solution in this regard&#x2014;it was found that 261 producers sold their products through agents and by means of negotiation. In conducting that test every one in that area was questioned at the same time. 167 sold to wholesalers, 144 sold directly to retailers, 56 sold directly to processors and canners, 54 sold directly to co-operative societies, 43 had their own organizations as producers/wholesalers, and 44 sold as producers/retailers. In England it is apparently a &#x201C;free for all&#x201D;. There is no uniform system. The best system I can mention to you, is the system of Holland. There the producer sends his product&#x2014;that is often done on a co-operative basis&#x2014;to one central point. I am not saying to the municipal markets. In our country that may perhaps be the proper thing to do, because we have the machinery to do so. But then the farmer is retaining his bargaining power. Everyone sends his product to that point where they are sold by means of negotiation, or, if necessary, by auction.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is Friday afternoon and I think we must not sit much longer. I just want to point out in a few words the direction in which I think we ought to move. I want to suggest that we may possibly consider a system of licensing small distributors in order to ensure as far as possible that there will not be too many of them and to exercise a reasonable measure of control, but also to see to it that quality will not be impaired. In the second place I want to suggest that the co-operative idea has been implemented in other countries. Co-operative marketing entails problems, because the co-operative society must compete with private initiative. A wage earner must compete with a person who is making profits for his own pocket. This problem always exists. Then the question still remains: &#x201C;Who has to establish the co-operative society? Should the producer or the consumer do so?&#x201D; I say the consumer should do so, because consumers outnumber producers. Producers are often asked: What are you doing about this matter&#x2014;the matter mentioned by the hon. member for East London (City)&#x2014;i.e. an increase of 200 per cent in price? I reply: But what are you doing about it? Buy on a co-operative basis. Solve your own problems. As far as it is possible to effect that in practice, there ought to be a marketing system under which marketing is effected through a central channel, under which sales are effected by means of negotiation so that speculation may be eliminated and re-sales may be prevented. Especially in the case of potatoes it may happen that a person negotiates on a farm and buys potatoes at 50 cents per pocket. He then takes the potatoes to the municipal market and sells at 70 cents per pocket. In this way one person is competing with another. Then there is the question of more effective distribution among non-Whites, a market which is waiting to be exploited. The purchasing power of the Bantu population is increasing constantly. We must give attention to that. Better distribution and selling methods must be introduced in locations.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to mention this. Our population must be educated to make use of the fresh fruit which we have in this country. Mr. Speaker, I think that you yourself have noticed what I am speaking about. We have our meals in the House of Assembly. On the tables we find beautiful baskets of fruit. But what are they? They are merely arrangements. Once we have eaten all the rich foods which cause heart trouble&#x2014;also the hon. member for Durban (Point) who heartily enjoys those rich foods&#x2014;the stewards offer us fruit. At that stage we no longer have any room for fruit. That beautiful, sun-ripened fruit of the Cape remain untouched. Do we, as a people who have the opportunity to make use of that fruit, actually do so? The hon. member for East London (City) also emphasized this matter in his motion, because in his motion he asked for a reasonable livelihood <span class="col_2411-2412" refersTo="page_1223"/>for the producer. Do we propagate the use of that fruit? Do you not find it ironical that a little less than half a pint of Coca Cola costs more than a full pint of creamy, fresh milk? To me it is inconceivable that we are moving in that direction. I now come to fruit juices. A bar is the place where one gets alcoholic beverages. In a bar one can also get tomato juice but just ask for guava or pineapple juice. It is simply impossible to obtain them. The intentions of the hon. member for East London (City) in moving this motion were good in that we also have to think of propagating our own products.</p>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what we are concerned about to-day are the excess profit margins consumers have to pay for so many of our products. We are not pleading for better prices for the producer. We are not asking that the producer should get better prices. What we are suggesting here this afternoon is that the consumer should have to pay less. If the consumers can pay less, naturally they will buy more and they will consume more. In that way the producer will enjoy the benefit of lower prices for the consumer. We have heard matters discussed this afternoon about perishable produce and other produce which is not so perishable, such as potatoes and onions, pumpkins, etc. One can understand that when an article is perishable it should cost more. But when one has to pay to-day in the region of 10 cents a lb. for potatoes, and 8 cents per lb. of onions, it is very difficult to understand. What I want to discuss this afternoon, relating to this motion of the hon. member for East London (City), is chiefly the question of meat. We know that meat is one of our primary foods. Everybody has to have meat, but not everybody can afford to have as much as they would like to have. Today meat is a very expensive commodity. I know that there are very great problems in this regard, but I should like to make a suggestion, not that it is my job to provide solutions, as the hon. member for Standerton would like me to do. He led me to believe that he appreciated the difficulties, but he wanted us to give him the solution. In other words, I must come here and give this Government the solution to the problem. If I were the Government, I would find the solution, but what I want to do this afternoon is to point out a few difficulties and give a few reasons as to why I believe that meat is being wasted. We are not being as careful as we should be in relation to the supply of meat to our big cities. It is all very well when one thinks of the producer&#x2014;as was mentioned here&#x2014;who can take his produce to the market. In the case of a city like Cape Town, very few producers can bring their meat to the market. The meat supplied to cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg&#x2014;and they are the principal cities&#x2014;has to be transported over long distances. We know that. There is no other way out. Stock has to be transported by the Railways and it naturally takes a long time before the stock being marketed reaches its destination; sometimes it never arrives. I want to prove that this afternoon. What is worrying me is the time taken from when the animal leaves the farm to the time it reaches the abattoirs. It is simply shocking. I frequently visit the abattoirs wherever I go. When I was last in Kimberley I visited the abattoirs there. I am interested in the subject, and in many cases I have to visit abattoirs to check up on behalf of producers who send stock to those abattoirs. I want to mention the remark made by the hon. member for Paarl, who is not here now, who showed us a whole pile of reports which he had collected. I do not know whether he has read them, but I would suggest to him that he goes to the abattoirs in our large cities, to see what is going on there, and then come back and read those reports. We are only asking for a commission to be appointed to investigate the difficulties we know about.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Tell us what those difficulties are.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell you about them, but unfortunately my time is limited. Here I have a memorandum drawn up in December, 1966, by 13 livestock auctioneers in one of our principal cities. It deals with the treatment of stock at the slaughter markets. This memorandum only deals with one market. If the Minister is interested, I can hand it to him so that he can see for himself what is going on, but he has probably received dozens already. The memorandum shows concern about the treatment, the wastage and the uncalled for deaths relating to stock. The complaints reflected in this memorandum are briefly these. Firstly, they are concerned about the thieving going on at the abattoirs. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die diefstal van vee is &#x2019;n groot bron van kommer en ergemis vir die lewende hawe-agente wat die verliese moet ly. &#x2019;n Opname toon dat die volgende verliese sedert 1 Julie 1966 gely is: Diere gevrek, 315; diere vermis, 80. Die lewende hawe-agente voel dat die diefstalle bevorder word deur &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then they give the reasons. One is that despite the regulations at the abattoirs, many people gain access who should not be there; bad boundary fences around the sale pens, and too few night watchmen to keep guard. Sir, do you know that the other day one of the lucky farmers who was able to deliver his oxen at the abattoirs, at the sale pens, one evening late he himself took in 20 super prime animals. He locked them up himself in one of the pens, where they waited to be sold and slaughtered early next morning. Before sunrise next day he was there to check up on his oxen. There were still 20, but four of his best oxen were gone and four scrub cattle had been put in to make up the number. What would <span class="col_2413-2414" refersTo="page_1224"/>have happened if Jack Wainwright from Molteno had sent the consignment to the market by rail? I would have received a bad report, and I would have queried it, and asked how it could possibly be that out of 20 prime oxen, four were hardly accepted by the abattoirs. They would probably have reported back that the four had measles, or something like that. This is what is happening. There is thieving going on. It is done cleverly, but it is happening all over, and not only in relation to cattle but to pigs and sheep as well. This is very serious. Apart from stock disappearing completely, there is substitution of inferior quality animals in many cases. In edition bad conditions at some abattoirs result in the animals losing condition while waiting to be slaughtered. This memorandum says so. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; dat vee in morsige toestande in die krale staan of l√™, en dat daar nie behoorlike voerbakke aangebring is nie, sodat voer dikwels op die morsige vloer gegooi moet word en oneetbaar vir die diere word; dat die waterbakke met die beskikbare arbeid nie daagliks skoongemaak word nie en al te dikwels in so &#x2019;n morsige toestand verkeer dat vee die water daarin nie kan suip nie.</block>

<p>Sir, I have seen in many cases that not only is there no water in those drinking throughs, but there is not even a plug to keep the water there. It is small wonder that when we send stock to the markets the animals lose condition and weight. In this way it is costing the consumer thousands of rands every day in cities like Cape Town, because the condition of the stock deteriorates. Who is to blame? [Interjections.] I hear the hon. member for Vryheid suggesting it is the Mayor&#x2019;s fault. Well, the abattoirs fall under his jurisdiction, but many mayors tell me, when I complain about the conditions at the abattoirs and the stock-pens, that municipalities are not paid enough; the rent being too low. The point is that someone is to blame and it is for that reason that we want a commission to investigate the problem. I quite agree that the pens belong to the municipalities and that they are being leased to and paid for by the livestock auctioneers. The agents hire the kraals. We see that at one very large abattoir which daily handles from 16,000 to 20,000 sheep and from 3,500 to 4,000 head of cattle and some 1,500 pigs and other animals, there are only four Coloured men, according to this memorandum, to care for all this stock. The complaint I have had is that they cannot get more men to supervise, and we see that in this memorandum as well. It would be a shocking thing to organized agriculture and to the meat marketing in general if the S.P.C.A. came and poked their noses in. I would not be surprised if we woke up one morning and found them interfering. It would be a reflection on all of us, who are so concerned about this matter, and to those of us who are interested in organized agriculture, let alone the Department and the Minister concerned. I have another case here about stock disappearing. This farmer happens to live near Richmond, who sent a consignment of slaughter sheep to the market, a long way from Richmond. He received a report that some 41 of the consignment of sheep had died on reaching their destination and he naturally asked for a report. This is the report he received. This letter was written as recently as the 21st February of this year. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons is verwittig dat u &#x2019;n rapport verlang oor die 41 skape onder die laaste besending wat in die trok en in die aanhoukrale dood is en oor die toestand wat daardie week op die mark geheers het.</block>

<p>The letter goes on to say that this particular consignment of slaughter sheep arrived at the sale pens at 7 a.m. on the 30th January and that that morning there were already 25,145 sheep on the market and in trucks, waiting to be slaughtered, and at noon that number had grown to 33,000 sheep. When one takes into consideration that this abbattoir can take a maximum of only 15,000 sheep per day and that there were already 33,000 sheep waiting, it is quite clear that a large number of the sheep had to wait over, as was the case with this particular consignment. They had to wait over and were off-loaded on the 1st February. Sir, I want to quote from this letter explaining to the farmer what happened&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Toe u besending afgelaai kon word was daar 20 dood in die trok gevind terwyl 21 ooglopend in &#x2019;n swak toestand was. Laas-genoemde is in &#x2019;n kraal geplaas wat spesiaal vir die doel afgesonder is. Die balans van die besending is op 6 Februarie geslag en is u vir die 41 skape vergoed teen die gemiddelde opbrengs van die gedeelte wat geslag is.</block>

<p>They were slaughtered eventually on the 6th February, seven days later. The other day I happened to check up and investigate on behalf of a farmer from Molteno who had sent his stock to a similar place&#x2014;it was not the same market. Ten days after they had left the siding in Molteno I saw those same sheep still standing in the sale pens. I made inquiries and asked whether these were Mr. Viljoen&#x2019;s sheep and I was told that they were. It made me sad to see them; they looked as thin as planks. I asked, when were the sheep to be slaughtered, and I was told not until Monday. Sir, reference has been made here to cold storage and <span class="col_2415-2416" refersTo="page_1225"/>deep freezers; now surely we should devise ways and means of slaughtering those sheep before the weekend. It is impossible to carry on like this and allow thousands of sheep to stand over the weekend until the Monday. Let me go further. It is stated in this letter, which explains the losses to the farmer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Graag wil ons hier verduidelik welke metode ons volg met skape wat ons hier in &#x2019;n swak toestand ontvang.</block>

<p>These sheep were not in a poor condition; not by any means&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eerstens moet ons noem dat die vee-arts dit toeskryf aan uitputting en word groot verliese veral ondervind gedurende warm weer.</block>

<p>Sir, I see my time is limited, so I will have to curtail my speech. I must mention too, as far as this particular sale is concerned, that on the Monday, the 30th January, 1967, 5,572 sheep were slaughtered, on the Tuesday, the 31st January, 6,562; on the Wednesday, 4,279; on the Thursday, 5,480 and on the Friday 5,848, making a total of 27,741 for the week, and then they go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Uit bogenoemde blyk dit duidelik dat skape wat Maandagoggend reeds in die mark was nie voor die daaropvolgende Maandag geslag kon word nie. Trouens, as gevolg van verdere aankomste gedurende die week het daar Vrydagaand, die 3de Februarie, 7,100 skape oorgestaan.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the problem. The Minister knows that this is happening, hence the reason why we are asking for another commission to be appointed as soon as possible if only to investigate this serious question of meat which everybody wants and must have. We can do without so many of the other commodities but meat is our most popular diet. I see no reason why we should neglect this very serious matter.</p>

<p>This question of the marketing of vegetables and other perishable products will probably be discussed as much in future as it has been discussed in the past. We all admit that it is a very difficult problem. Even the hon. member for Durban (Point) admits it. The hon. member for East London (City) <span class="col_2417-2418" refersTo="page_1226"/>has asked for a commission of inquiry to be appointed to investigate the difference between the price which the producer receives for his produce and the price which the consumer must pay for produce, particularly perishable products which are not controlled under the Marketing Act. I am afraid that the hon. member for East London (North) misunderstands completely the motion of the hon. member for East London (City), because the hon. member for East London (City) did not plead for the appointment of a commission to investigate the difference between the producer prices and the prices which the consumer has to pay; he pleaded for the appointment of a commission of inquiry into abattoirs and abattoir facilities, the handling of animals at abattoirs, the supplying of animals to abattoirs, etc. A commission of inquiry such as the one he has just pleaded for, recently submitted a report. I announced in Parliament last year that legislation would be introduced as a result of the report of the Abattoirs Commission. That legislation will be introduced during the present Session in order to give effect to the recommendations of the commission. That commission investigated all the facilities at the markets, as well as abattoir facilities, and made certain recommendations. Quite a number of those recommendations, as I have already announced, have been accepted by the Government, precisely so as to make provision for those things which the hon. member for East London (North) has now been advocating here.</p>

<p>The legislation will also make provision for the appointment of a three-man commission. Such a commission has already been provisionally appointed, but that commission will receive its legal powers and status when the legislation is finally passed. That commission will even have powers, in cases where local authorities do not want to create slaughtering facilities for farmers in the controlled areas, or in the areas where abattoirs should be provided, to establish and control abattoirs itself. I made that announcement here last year&#x2014;the hon. member is aware of it. I cannot appoint another commission to investigate the same matter. After all it would look a little ridiculous. Apparently the hon. member misunderstood the motion completely. The hon. member for East London (City) asked that a commission be appointed to investigate marketing as well as the difference in prices. The hon. member for Paarl pointed out that there had been many such commissions in the past which had investigated these very matters. The hon. member for Durban (Point) asked what had become of the reports of those commissions. He stated that steps had never been taken as a result of those commissions, that the Government had done nothing about those reports.</p>

<p>But of course, Mr. Speaker. It is quite possible that the problem which the hon. member sees remains unsolved. But to say that nothing has been done in connection with those commissions&#x2019; reports, is surely quite incorrect. The Government has, on recommendation of those commissions, taken many steps. It has introduced legislation for the very purpose of having control over municipal markets. A Market Advisory Council has been appointed especially to advise the Minister and his Department. Special steps have been taken to protect the producer selling products on that market against the agent so that he does not lose the money he receives for his produce there. Special steps have been taken to improve the transport facilities of the Railways from the producing areas. Many other steps have been taken to introduce codes on the market, codes not only in respect of the handling of the producer&#x2019;s produce but codes in connection with the sale of that produce. That is why it is not correct to say that nothing has been done about the reports of those commissions. If the hon. member were to say that there is still a gap between the producer price and the consumer price of those products, then he would be correct.</p>

<p>An unnatural gap.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says there is an unnatural gap. However, it is doubtful whether there is in fact such an unnatural gap. I want to mention an example to the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (North) raised a plea to the effect&#x2014;and I agree with him&#x2014;that the facilities at the abattoirs should be such that if the stock arrive there in good condition it should be possible to handle that stock under good conditions there and slaughter it in a proper and hygienic way. He also suggested that the distribution should take place very efficiently. I agree with the hon. member. But those services which he is asking for we do not get for nothing. It costs money. If it costs money somebody has to pay for it.</p>

<p>If somebody pays for it, then there is a difference between the consumer price and the producer price. The costs have to be recovered between those two prices. Surely that is clear. Therefore, when hon. members ask for better facilities, when they ask for better abattoirs or the erection of new abattoirs, then they must realize that the establishment of those facilities entail costs, costs which somebody has to bear. The greater the costs, the greater is the gap between the producer price and the consumer price. Surely that is obvious.</p>

<p>It is easy to criticize the Government in these two spheres. On the one hand there are complaints that the Government is doing nothing, that better facilities should be created. On the other hand it is being said that the facilities which we create should be cheaper&#x2014;that it should cost the consumer less. But that is surely impossible. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the costs in connection with the erection of a new abattoir in comparison with costs of the existing abattoir are so tremendously high that the slaughtering fees would immediately increase by almost 100 per cent, merely to enable the recovery of interest and the discharge of costs.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The farmers pay it. But it does not matter who pays it. It means that the more interim fees there are, the greater is the difference between the farmer&#x2019;s selling price and the consumer&#x2019;s buying price. That is the point I want to make. It does not matter who has to pay. I am dealing now with the difference between those two prices. That is after all what this motion is concerned with.</p>

<p>Often we speak about these things as if they were easy matters. All kinds of solutions are suggested. Hon. members have said that there is an over-utilization of facilities, of distribution points, and that there are too many people distributing fruit and vegetables. That may be so. There may indeed be overtrading. But if there is over-trading there is also a demand for the services of those people. Must we now do away with free trade? When those same hon. members on the opposite side discuss agricultural matters and they mention the number of farmers in South Africa, they say that the producer&#x2019;s price must be pushed up so that each farmer in agriculture can remain <span class="col_2419-2420" refersTo="page_1227"/>there. They say that the farmer must not give up agriculture. If that is their point of view, why is there one criterion for the farmer while there is another criterion for the butcher and the people who have to distribute the products? Surely the criterion should be the same, if that is the criterion?</p>

<p>Let us consider the difficulty of overtrading. What can we do to counter overtrading in an industry? It is only possible to try and rationalize that industry by having steps taken by the State. In other words, permits can be issued restricting the number of people in the industry. By that means people can be kept out of or excluded from the industry. However. we must also remember&#x2014;and this argument was also raised here this afternoon&#x2014;that when we have large consortiums, large groups of people acting as buyers on the market, they form syndicates. When they form syndicates they force down the producer&#x2019;s price on that market. It is logical. The hon. member says so himself. Even with a co-operative he could not compete with them. If that is the case, to what extent must one rationalize such an industry? Must it be rationalized in such a way that that small group of people who would in time to come participate in this industry, whether it is the meat trade or the distribution of fresh vegetables and fruit, form a small majority or a small group?</p>

<p>Why must we consider the extremes?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking to what extent we must bar those people? If a start is made with restriction and registration there must be a basis or criterion in terms of which steps can be taken. Surely that is clear. Once the principle has been applied there must be a criterion which determines how far one can go. How are we going to determine how far we can go? The only logical way of determining how far one can go is to take note of the demand for those people&#x2019;s services. If there is a demand for those kind of services, then it means that the consumer is prepared to pay for that service. But let us take the argument as far as it can go.</p>

<p>If we could eliminate all the people in the meat trade in Cape Town and establish just one large distribution centre, say, for example, a chain-store with shops at all the various points in Cape Town which distributed meat only, then I would admit, and so would everybody else, that that would probably be the cheapest way in which that distribution could take place. But the question we have to ask ourselves is whether it is desirable to do so. Is it desirable for our economic structure? Is it desirable for the producer? Is it desirable for the producer that there will later on be only one, two or three, or a small number, of large distributors of this product which they have to buy from the producer? Because, Sir, if that was the case, they could determine the producer price because they would not have any competition. When one discusses these things one must at least have an idea of where and to what extent one wants to control these things. It is so easy to say that business people are always increasing their prices. It is being said that the difference between the producer price and the consumer price is always being increased in order to enable those people to make a living.</p>

<p>I took the trouble of having the price index figures determined, particularly in regard to meat and how prices between the auction price paid to the producer and the price for certain first grade cuts increased and varied since 1960. Now, taking August, 1960 as a basis, with the price of first grade rump and brisket meat on the basis of a 100, and the auction price of beef on the market set at a 100, we find that the prices displayed a very interesting phenomenon. Compared with the position in August, 1960 the price of rump and beef steak in the Cape in January, 1961, was 86.3 and the price of brisket was 87.9. But, contrasted with this, the producer&#x2019;s price was 113.6. In other words, there was a very large increase in the producer price and there was a real decrease in the distribution price. That was the position in January, 1961. But I shall now mention a few other dates. In January, 1964&#x2014;the prices vary according to circumstances&#x2014;the index price of those cuts to which I have just referred, was 88.4 and 90.3. On the other hand the producer&#x2019;s price was 103.6. In other words, it was just above the floor price.</p>

<p>Let us glance at what happened in January, 1965. In that year the index price in respect of those two cuts increased to 115.2 and 123.8 respectively. But the index figure of the auction price increased to 180.5. I am mentioning these figures to indicate that even though there was such a tremendously great increase in the producer price, the selling price did not increase proportionately at that stage. The reason for that is the following. The butcher cannot adjust his price each day to the auction price on the market. He must try and determine for himself a price which will remain valid throughout the year and which will result in a reasonable profit fluctuation, whereas on the market one finds tremendous differences in the auctioneering prices over short periods of time. But if one really goes into the matter thoroughly one finds that in January, 1966, the index figure for those two cuts was 115 and 120, whereas the producer price was 150. If one makes this comparison it is clear&#x2014;those are figures which have been <span class="col_2421-2422" refersTo="page_1228"/>checked&#x2014;that over the past few years since 1960 the index figure in respect of producer prices has increased more than the index figure of the selling prices at the butcher shops. Hon. members may tell me that there are many occasions when this is not so.</p>

<p>There are times when the price differences are much greater. But I am talking now about the average prices over the whole period. That is the problem which one is faced with in regard to these things. Let us consider for a moment the index figure in respect of vegetables. Hon. members are all aware that we experienced a drought last year. There were tremendous increases. But I have taken the trouble to compare the index figures of our vegetable prices. During the years from 1957 to 1960, with the index figure set at 100, there was in 1965-&#x2019;66 an increase in tubers&#x2014;in other words, potatoes and similar vegetables&#x2014;of 30 per cent. In respect of vegetables&#x2014;with the exception of tubers&#x2014;there was an increase of 15 per cent. In other words, there was a 30 per cent increase over that period for tubers and a 15 per cent increase in respect of vegetables which do not fall under that group. But the consumers prices for those same two products, jointly, increased by only 15 per cent.</p>

<p>In other words, the consumers&#x2019; prices actually increased less than the average of the two figures over that period. Having made these analogies, certain questions arise. Where there is a difference&#x2014;and we all admit that there are big differences&#x2014;a means must be sought to reduce that difference. One cannot merely say that the obvious reason is that the middle man is making a tremendously large amount of money. It is not as easy as all that because if one analyses the figures it nevertheless appears that the balance between the two differences remains reasonably constant, i.e. the increase in the producer price and the increase in the consumer price. In addition the question of distribution must be taken into account. To my mind the hon. member for Paarl put this matter very cleverly when he spoke about the vendor who had, in former years, delivered fresh fruit and vegetables to the houses in Paarl on his own advertisement. But one must remember that as one&#x2019;s cities grow larger and as one&#x2019;s population is concentrated into larger complexes, this distribution becomes more expensive. The further away from the city one&#x2019;s produce is produced, and the more it is necessary to undertake distribution within the city itself, the higher the costs are. I now want to mention to you an example of a product which is controlled. I want to mention the example of a product such as fresh milk. The price of fresh milk to the producer and the consumer is controlled and the margins between those two prices are investigated each year by all the distributors. The average is calculated in order to determine the profit margins for the distributor of milk. Do you know that to deliver a pint of milk to a home costs just as much as the producer gets for that pint of milk. I am talking now of delivery per bottle. In other words, we have here a product the costs of which is definitely controlled, not as is the case with vegetables where one has free marketing. Even with that product which is less perishable because one has a method of handling it, which prevents it from going bad as quickly as is the case with vegetables and fruit which lie for days in shop windows, one finds the position that the costs of delivering that product per pint are as great as the price which the producer gets for that product.</p>

<p>These people do very important work, and there are also certain risks attached to it. I do not think our farmers always realize what an important function these people fulfil in getting the farmer&#x2019;s product to the consumer. It is not realized what an important function they are performing. They all have their problems. They have to buy on the market. Many of them have to buy on the auction market. Many of them even have to buy from a wholesale dealer on the auction mart. This has already happened. They must transport their products to the place where they display them. That place where they are displaying their products costs money. They must pay rental. They must have somebody who delivers the product for them. You must also remember that he does not buy one bag of potatoes and does not then proceed to sell that bag of potatoes to the consumer. Neither does he buy a bag or a box of cabbages and proceed to sell that bag or box of cabbages to the consumer. He buys it in small quantities. Many of those products have in the meantime deteriorated in quality as a result of handling. There has been a deterioration in grade. But it is not always merely a deterioration in grade. Often that product goes bad and that means that that loss has to be recovered. If we were to put the loss in handling at 10 per cent it would already make a tremendous difference to the ultimate price, calculated only on a loss basis. We are fully aware of all these things. In addition to that, study projects are from time to time undertaken by my Department in regard to these matters. I have just finished dividing up the research section of my Department into two sections: A section for agricultural production and economy and a section for marketing research. By this means we are hoping to be able to concentrate more specifically on the problem of costs and distribution.</p>

<p><span class="col_2423-2424" refersTo="page_1229"/>I just want to mention to the hon. House another few projects on which my Department has been engaged in the past few years. A report has already been published in regard to the cost structure of the marketing of fresh produce. We have also undertaken a source study in order to determine the most important marketing areas of vegetables and fruit. We also have in progress a series of reconnaissance studies of information services in regard to crop prospects. There was also an inquiry into the structure of the apple industry. In addition an operational study amongst the retailers of fruit and vegetables in Pretoria, as well as one in regard to the cultivation and marketing of fresh green beans in the Low-veld, an investigation into the production and marketing of factory tomatoes and tomato paste, an investigation into the agents&#x2019; commission of marketing agents, etc. We intend introducing another two projects shortly. An investigation into the purchasing habits of consumers in Pretoria in respect of fresh vegetables and fruit, and an inquiry into the purchasing habits of consumers of meat in Bloemfontein. You will see, therefore, that the Department is continually busy undertaking studies. An hon. member mentioned the vast market potential of the Bantu. But an interdepartmental committee has been appointed precisely for this purpose of trying to find a method of establishing a market for our surpluses in the Bantu areas. Surpluses create a difficult problem; it is not easy to find a solution to that problem. Nevertheless markets have in fact been found in times of surplus for some of those products. As far as the cost structure is concerned, therefore, I can only say that the Department has already taken every reasonable step to obtain information in this regard.</p>

<p>In Pretoria we once tried to make a study with the help of 13 housewives. We arranged for these 13 housewives to buy their vegetables and fruit on the market over a period of 13 weeks, each one of them for one week or four weeks in the year. We wanted to find out how much cheaper they could get their products. They persevered for a few weeks. An analysis of the prices disclosed that they were able to get their fresh vegetables and fruit 30 per cent cheaper on the market than at the corner shop, or from the vegetable pedlar. Unfortunately the housewives could not persevere any further with that study because they were not prepared for those cheaper prices, to bear the burden of purchasing their own requirements. If we take into consideration the costs which the vendors have to incur in order to purchase the vegetables on the market and transport them to their shops and divide those vegetables up there into smaller quantities and then sell them to the public, one wonders whether the 30 per cent less they paid for their products on the market is really such an exorbitant profit. I think that if one takes all the factors into consideration one must come to the conclusion that it definitely does not mean that they make an exorbitant profit.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Standerton when he said that the agriculture in South Africa is to a large extent capable of organizing itself in order to market its products cooperatively. If there is such a high cost structure, is it not time that our consumers gave more attention to the purchasing of their requirements on a co-operative basis? If they are really so concerned about the high cost structure, does a solution for their problem not lie in that direction? But this has not been our experience in the past. To my mind the hon. member for Durban (Point) testified to this very well. Often in the past the producer has tried to get his produce to the consumer himself for the same price which the consumer paid at the corner shop. But what became of that producer? The hon. member for Durban (Point) himself admitted that he could not compete. There he sits now, although, under the circumstances, he does not look too badly off! In the field of co-operative societies we have organized our farmers so that they could deliver their products directly to the consumer. The Government has even gone so far as to make monetary contributions in order to finance them. But notwithstanding all that they could not make the grade against competitive prices. Take meat, for example. The co-operative meat trade began with the small butcher, but most of them could not make a living, and that in spite of the fact that they bought and sold at the same price. This thing is therefore no easy matter. It is of course easy to say that the middle man is making unnecessary profits. But the matter is not as easy as all that. We are all concerned about price gaps. But I am afraid that if we were to create all these facilities for which the hon. member for East London (City) asked, facilities at abattoirs, and if municipal markets were to be organized in the way we would all like to see&#x2014;beautiful new buildings with every possible facility included&#x2014;then I am afraid we would not be reducing the costs. The costs would be more inclined to increase.</p>

</speech>

<p>In the light of all these things I see no need for the appointment of a commission of inquiry such as the hon. member has asked for in his motion.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Estimates of the Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue and Loan Accounts during the year ending 31st March, 1967.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to ask Parliament to provide an additional amount of R81,320,016 to cover expenditure during the current financial year. Of this amount, R31,891,109 is in respect of revenue services and the balance of R49,428,907 in respect of loan services. The amount required on revenue services represents approximately 2.5 per cent of the amount voted in last year&#x2019;s Appropriation Act. Hon. members will note that under various Votes, additional amounts are required for salaries, wages and allowances. These increases are mainly due to the fact that the full effect of the salary adjustments and the new post structure in the Public Service as from the 1st January, 1966, could not be foreseen when the 1966-&#x2019;67 Estimates were compiled.</p>

<p>The amount of R49,428,907 required on loan services is just over 10 per cent of the amount of R478,214,000 provided in the main Estimates. I wish to admit that this is a substantial amount but hon. members will note that not less than R25,300,000&#x2014;over 50 per cent of the amount required&#x2014;is in respect of a new service, an interest-free loan to the External Procurements Fund. This money is required in connection with the Government&#x2019;s stockpiling programme.</p>

<p>A further R8 million is required on Loan Vote A&#x2014;Miscellaneous Loans and Services&#x2014;for transfer to the Railways and Harbours Fund. The expenditure has already been approved by this House and the inclusion of this amount is merely to obtain parliamentary approval of the transfer of the money to that fund.</p>

<p>Sir, it is not customary for a Minister of Finance to go into detail at this stage. My colleagues are present and, as in the past, they will give full details of the amounts required under the Votes relating to their portfolios.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to give the House the assurance that I am satisfied that every rand asked for is essential and that I am convinced that the services for which the money is required cannot be postponed without harm to the country.</p>

I can only say that his experience has been happier than ours in the past because our experience has been, when it comes to the Additional Estimates, that the Minister of Finance is very often left in lonely state to answer for all his colleagues. I hope that all his colleagues have heard his words of wisdom this afternoon and that we shall have the benefit of their presence when we go into Committee on these Estimates.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has pointed out that we are being asked to vote what amounts to an extra 2&#x00BD; per cent in addition to last year&#x2019;s Revenue Estimates and some 10 per cent extra on last year&#x2019;s Loan Estimates. Sir, that is a very considerable sum. The hon. the Minister dismissed the matter in a very few words and I hope that he will be able to give us further details when we are in Committee.</p>

<p>Sir, duly fortified by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) I have no doubt that we shall be able to conduct a very thorough investigation here this afternoon. I do not propose to go into any detail on these Estimates. But I think in the past there has been a tendency to deal with them as a mere formal matter, and I think that is a mistake, especially when you are dealing, as we are in this instance, with very considerable sums of money. These things should not be dealt with merely as formal matters. The hon. the Minister merely said that these were matters which could not be delayed without harming the affairs of the country. There are quite a number of things in these Estimates which, it seems to me, considering that we are within three weeks of the end of the financial year and within a fortnight of the introduction of the main budget, could have waited until the main budget without the affairs of the country suffering in the least. But there are certain features of a general nature which I think should be touched upon and on which the Minister should be prepared to give us his views.</p>

<p><span class="col_2427-2428" refersTo="page_1231"/>In the first place, in the general budget which was introduced only in the middle of last August, five months ago, provision was made for spending some R1,275 million, and that was an increase of some 10 per cent over the previous year. We had been told by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor that he regarded an annual increase in the normal Government expenditure of 2 per cent per annum as normal. Having told us that, he then introduced the budget which provided for an increase five times the size of what he regarded as normal. Now we are being asked for a further increase of what the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor regarded as the normal increase for the whole year. I think that gives us an idea of the way in which Government expenditure is going on increasing, not only year by year but on every opportunity the Government has of submitting Estimates to this House. After all, the feature which distinguishes these Estimates from most others is that the main budget was not introduced until half the year had gone. As a rule, the Estimates have to be prepared before the financial year has started and it can be well understood that it is extremely difficult to frame the Estimates accurately for 12 months ahead. But when the budget is not introduced until the financial year is half over, there does not seem to me to be any adequate reason for many of these increases. The Minister said this afternoon that the reason was that many of these increases could not be foreseen, but surely, with increases of this magnitude, to say that they could not be foreseen halfway through the year argues that something is very wrong somewhere. As I say, if it was done at the beginning of the year, there might be some reason for it and one would not be able to blame the present Minister of Finance for it because the mantle has fallen on his shoulders, and the fact that it is a rather uncomfortable mantle at the moment is most unfortunate for him. But I hope that the Estimates he is introducing to-day will be a lesson to him and will impress upon him the necessity for more accurate budgeting in the future, and that we shall not have to suffer, as we have for years past, from the grossly inaccurate budgeting we have had year after year.</p>

<p>There is another point to which the hon. the Minister referred. Of the extra funds being asked for, amounting to roughly R32 million, no less than R14 million, and possibly R16 million, if we include what is being paid to the provinces, is for increased salaries and wages. The Minister told us that it was quite impossible to foresee what would be required when the budget was framed. Sir, I do not think the House can accept that as the chief reason for the increase. It is true that there are new posts, but the chief reason for the increase was the general increases in salaries and wages which were announced in 1965, and not in 1966. They were not payable until 1966, but the increases were announced in 1965 and the budget was not introduced until nearly a year after that announcement. To say that it was not possible to foresee what the increases would cost is not an explanation that this House ought lightly to accept. The total salary and wage bill in the Estimates last August was some R325 million, and that made provision for an increase of some R34 million. When we asked the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor what these increased wages and salaries would cost, I think he said it would be something like R40 million.</p>

<p>Anyway, provision was made for an increase of R34 million, but now, five months later, the hon. the Minister comes along and requires another R14 million. In other words, the Estimates laid before this House last August, as far as these increases were concerned, were wrong by over 30 per cent, because he is now asking for well over 30 per cent more than was asked for last August. One is completely at a loss to understand how there can be such a big discrepancy. Is it due to bad estimating? I find it rather difficult to think that, because if one looks at the Estimates one finds that they are spread all over the Departments. Some of them are much bigger than others. We can discuss that later on. But I cannot believe that every Department was so far out in its Estimates. The only reason one can imagine is that it was done deliberately and that the Government knew very well that they were under-estimating and decided to bring in the other Estimates now, in March, just before the end of the year. If that is so, I think it is very reprehensible of the Government, and I hope the Minister will do more than simply tell us that the reason for it is that the amount required could not be foreseen at the time the budget was drawn up. I think that if this is the nearest they could get to it, they ought to get a new computer in the Treasury, because this is extremely bad arithmetic.</p>

<p>The only other point I wish to make is the number of token amounts, the new items appearing on these Estimates, mostly in the Loan Account. It has been growing in recent years and it is becoming more and more frequent that very large amounts are being asked to be voted in the Additional Estimates, in principle, and then an amount of R40 or R50 or R100 is actually voted simply to get the item on the books.</p>

<p>I think that that is wrong as well. There are some very large items in these Loan Votes. There is for instance one item amounting to R16 million for which we are asked to vote R50 this year so as to agree in principle that it must be done. Mr. Speaker, you cannot tell me that between now and approximately the next month is going to make much difference as to whether or not Parliament has agreed in principle to this vast expenditure when we are only going to vote R50. I think that the Treasury should be much more careful in putting these amounts in the Estimates when it is only asking for a token amount to be voted. When they are important matters they should be put on the main Estimates and they should be available for discussion on the main Estimates <span class="col_2429-2430" refersTo="page_1232"/>and treated with the importance that they deserve. I do not intend to go into detail because we shall deal with this in the Committee but I hope that the Minister will be able to reply to some of the questions I have asked before we go into Committee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when one examines these Additional Estimates, I think what strikes one most is not the quantum asked for but the various heads under which the amounts appear under the particular Votes. One usually accepts that there will be Additional Estimates during the period between one Budget and another, but the Additional Estimates, one believes, are meant to provide for exigencies and matters that have arisen since the last Budget. What strikes one in these Additional Estimates is that in so many cases there is one item in the Estimates which has simply been increased throughout. The classic example is the one mentioned by the hon. member for Constantia, namely the question of salaries and wages. It is almost unbelievable that six months after the Budget, without there being any increase in salaries and wages, of which we are aware, apart from those which took place, as the hon. the Minister said, with effect from 1st January, 1966, and which were provided for in the last Budget, we should suddenly find ourselves facing an increase actually not of 30 per cent, because if you take <i>virement</i> into account the increase is R16 million on R34 million, an increase of 46 per cent. This is not over a period of 12 months because only six months have passed since the last Budget. I think that this House is certainly entitled to an explanation from the hon. the Minister as to why when the Budget was framed in August, 1966, R34 million was asked for to cover salaries and wages, the Government being well aware at that stage of the increases that were granted, while the hon. the Minister comes to this House to-day and says that he needs another increase of R16 million or an increase of 46 per cent. Something has gone wrong somewhere. It is almost impossible for budgeting to be out to this extent.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has told us that the full effect of these increases was not known. I think that that statement requires elaborating. Surely the full effect should have been known in August, 1966, when the salary increases were made retrospective from 1st January, 1966. He had eight months to decide what the extra salaries were going to be. This pattern is followed throughout the rest of these Additional Estimates. If you take for example the Vote of Posts, Telegraphs, Telephones and Radio Services you will find that under one heading there is an increase of 100 per cent. Under another sub-head in Vote 10 you will find an increase of 30 per cent and under another you will find an increase of 20 per cent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>The point I am raising is that we do not object to an isolated increase under a particular Vote for a particular item. When one particular item such as salaries and wages or telephone expenditure has been increased throughout under all the Votes there seems to be something radically wrong in the original budgeting. We want to know from the hon. the Minister why the pattern flows through every single Vote. As the hon. member for Constantia said it is impossible for every department to make an error in its budgeting.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>This flows into other items. Mr. Speaker, at your request I shall be brief. I think that what we want from the hon. the Minister of Finance is not so much an explanation for individual items which we will certainly ask of the individual Ministers. What we want to know from the hon. the Minister is the reason for this general increase in specific items of expenditure flowing right through the Additional Estimates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not customary to go into all these matters in detail. It is also clear that it will be of no use for us to hold a general discussion at this stage. The replies required by hon. members on the other side will be given to them when we discuss the Votes in detail and then we shall see the reason for the increase in that expenditure. However, I want to agree with the hon. member for Constantia on the general principle, namely that it is the task of a government and a Minister of Finance to submit Estimates which are as accurate as possible and, as far as it is humanly possible, to see to it that the amounts furnished in the Estimates are as accurate as possible. The hon. member for Constantia will agree with me that this is not always possible in a growing economy, in a country where conditions are liquid and where so many demands are made upon the State from time to time. It is impossible for any framer of Estimates to foresee a year in advance precisely what demands will be made upon the State. I want to tell the hon. member that I agree with him on the general principle and that we as a government will to the best of our ability always endeavour, as we have done in the past, to make the Estimates as accurate as possible. However, new circumstances have now arisen here, especially in respect of salaries. Hon. members on the other side apparently intend making great play of the Estimates in respect of salaries. When I took over this portfolio, I tried to investigate this matter personally, because it worried me too that there were such large increases in respect of salaries in general. I tried to ascertain the reasons for these increases. I was generally assured by the various departments that by as early as the middle of last year it had been impossible to form an accurate estimate of the additional amount the new salaries would cost the State. It was only towards the end of September, when the Estimates <span class="col_2431-2432" refersTo="page_1233"/>had already been printed, that we formed a more or less accurate idea of the additional expenditure in respect of salaries, because it was not merely an increase in salaries. It would not have been so difficult, but in this respect we had to deal with a new structure in the Public Service which had to be worked out. It was an entirely new structure and new posts which had been established. Added to that there was the fact that certain departments had been fortunate in that they had recruited new officials in the past year. In other words, additional officials were added to their establishment, and this could not have been foreseen. All these elements taken together made this matter a particularly complicated one. The various Ministers will be able to explain those items. In the third place, I also want to tell hon. members this: On the whole the hon. member for Constantia spoke of the tremendous increase in expenditure. I also mentioned it. We are concerned here with additional expenditure only. If hon. members look at these Estimates, they will find that tremendous savings have also been effected. You will find that under one item of Defence, for instance, there was a saving of more than R35 million. Not only was there expenditure which has to be accounted for, but there was also a considerable amount in extra savings, which has been recorded here. I think that it is not my duty to continue this general discussion any further, but that we should leave that to the individual Ministers.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, under sub-head A&#x2014;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, the anticipated saving is R4,500. That is attributable to the differences in salary adjustments, various staff changes, and so forth. The hon. member will notice that there is a decrease. Under sub-head C the amount is R1,300. This is a question of under-estimation. Nor do I think that that hon. member is interested in the R800 under sub-head D.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why there is such a large increase of more than R2 million. What I particularly want to know from him is why this only applies to the Province of the Transvaal and not to the other provinces.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this amount relates to the subsidies paid to the provinces each year. In actual fact it does not apply to the Province of the Transvaal only. It also applies to the Cape and to the Free State, but we are able to meet the subsidies paid to the Cape and the Free State from other savings. That is in fact the reason why the money is being voted in respect of the Transvaal only. This amount which is being voted in respect of the Transvaal is required because, just as in the case of the other provinces, there was a deficit owing to increased expenditure in respect of salaries, additional officials and allowances for pensioners and other services. This resulted mainly from an under-estimation by the Transvaal of their expenditure in respect of salaries. Unfortunately the expenditure was calculated wrongly because wrong figures had been supplied to the officials, and as a result the amounts required were under-estimated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that the Minister of Finance has now made a very serious admission, namely that a major error was made in connection with the Estimates submitted to the Treasury by the Province of the Transvaal, an error to the extent of more than R2 million. That is something unheard of. I think that it is something which is so outrageous that the hon. the Minister ought to investigate the matter to ensure that something like this will never again happen in the future. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain to us how this happened. The provinces prepare their estimates and submit them to the Treasury. The Treasury has to examine those estimates. How then was it possible for the Treasury with all its staff not to have noticed this tremendous error amounting to more than R2 million&#x2014;and it is more than that if the savings are included; I think it is almost R3∆ê million&#x2014;and for him as Minister not to have noticed it either? What went wrong there? Can he give us the assurance that steps will be taken in future to check these estimates which are submitted to him by the provinces and, of course, particularly those submitted by the Transvaal? As the hon. the Minister has admitted, the position is that one of the most important items, namely more than R3 million in respect of the salaries of teachers, was calculated wrongly. There are teachers whose salaries were not reflected in the estimates according to law, and who were nevertheless paid. Now, after the time, the province asks the Minister for more money and upsets his entire estimates as well as the entire estimates of the Province of the Transvaal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The increase in salaries, wages and allowances is firstly due to the increase in the establishment of the department with effect from 1st January, 1966. Secondly it is due to salary adjustments, thirdly to the regrading of certain posts, fourthly, to advancement through efficiency in terms of Public Service Commission circular No. 5 of 1966, and fifthly to further salary adjustments in terms of a Public Service Commission circular. The increase is therefore in connection with regrading, higher salaries and wages and more employees.</p>

<p>In regard to the telephone services, there was an increase of R300 as a result of the exceptionally high number of detailed telegrams sent to all receivers of revenue in connection with amendments to the Transfer Duty Act, which came into immediate operation. A shortfall of approximately R300 is anticipated in respect of this item&#x2014;a small amount. As regards telephone services, the increase is due to, firstly, a general expansion of the department and, secondly, salary adjustments with effect from 1st January, 1966, of telephone operators, and, thirdly, the increased tariff applicable to local calls with effect from 1st January, 1967.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister of Finance said that we could obtain full details from the Minister concerned when we came to his Vote. Here is one item in respect of the hon. the Minister. He said that one of the reasons why the salaries over-all had increased was that some departments had been fortunate enough to recruit increased staff. He said that we could obtain details from the various Ministers. Can the Minister tell us to what extent the staff of the Department of Inland Revenue has been increased in the course of this year? In what respects is the increase due to additional staff? The Minister gave a number of reasons, for instance regrading and the provision of funds therefor. He also mentioned extra staff. I ask the hon. the Minister this, Sir, because I am going to ask every Minister this question. I hope he will set a very good example to his colleagues by telling us to what extent the Inland Revenue Department has been successful in increasing its staff in the course of last year. The other question relates to posts and telegraphs. At the end of the reasons for increased costs of posts and telegraphs and telephone services the Minister in a rather small voice said, lastly, the increase in telephone charges. Could the Minister pluck up courage and tell us just what the increased cost to his department is as a result of increased telephone charges?</p>

<p>On 18th May, 1966, Adam J.

After all the documents had been completed it appeared that the consent to the marriage which had been handed in by Miss Van der Westhuizen, who was a minor, had been signed by a relative and her parents had actually refused to give their consent. Consequently the marriage ceremony was not conducted by the assistant magistrate, nor did he sign the marriage licence. He wanted to cancel the licence, but since the money which had been paid for it had already been entered in the books and banked, it was not possible to do so.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member will forgive me for not going into this matter in detail. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this is a case of a company which had always met its obligations to the State. However. as a result of its bookkeeping system, it found itself in difficulties in regard to undistributed profits. The company entered into its books in one year the profits which it was only to receive in the next. They paid out those profits and therefore did not pay any undistributed profits tax because they had paid out everything they had received, which had been entered into its books. In the following year, the year in which the profits were actually made, they could not pay them out because they had already been paid out the previous year. The company was then assessed for undistributed profits. If its bookkeeping system had been correct, it would not have had to pay that amount. It was all-in-all a <i>bona fide</i> case which was only due to the fact that the company paid out its profits too soon instead of doing so in the year in which they had actually been received.</p>

<p>The position in connection with the last item, &#x201C;Gilbey-Santhagens (Pty.) Ltd.&#x201D;, R11,488, is as follows: 832 gallons of cane spirit representing 800.41 gallons of absolute alcohol, was lost as the result of a leakage caused by a tear in the plastic packing surrounding the outlet of a storage tank in the company&#x2019;s customs and excise storage warehouse. The loss occurred over the weekend 23 to 25 April, 1965. The excise duty on the 800.41 gallons of absolute alcohol amounted to R 11,488. This is just a repayment of excise on the alcohol that was lost.</p>

<p>The position pertaining to the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of customs duty to Caltex (Africa) Limited, Cape Town, is that on the 19th September, 1962, the Government gave, <i>inter alia</i>, the following assurance to Caltex in connection with the refinery at Cape Town&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government shall ensure that the responsible authorities shall arrange that exemption from import duties shall be allowed on the importation of machinery, equipment, materials, accessories, catalysts, additives and other processed chemicals and spare parts for the refinery during the construction and later operation or additions or alterations of the refinery provided that these are not reasonably and practically available at competitive prices in the Republic of South Africa and provided the Board of Trade and Industries recommend accordingly.</block>

<p>The increase is owing to (1) the increased salaries and wages which were introduced with effect from 1st October, 1966, and (2) the acquisition of additional rolling stock for the transportation of Bantu passengers with the resultant increase in interest and value depreciation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ascertain from the hon. the Minister of Finance whether this amount is being paid blindly? We should like to know what precautionary measures are being taken by the Treasury, what inquiries the Treasury made and to what extent the Treasury itself is satisfied that this amount has in fact been spent. I must now understand from the hon. the Deputy Minister of Railways that the Railways submits an account to the Treasury in respect of losses on the transportation of Bantu passengers which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education is evicting from the cities. The Railways receive a subsidy on the loss on railway operation costs in respect of Bantu passenger services. The subsidy has increased by more than R2 million and the hon. the Deputy Minister says that in the first instance the increase is attributable to an increase in salaries and wages, an increase which was well known when the main Estimates were submitted. No additional amount ought to be requested. He says that the increase is attributable in the second place to the purchase of additional rolling stock, but the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot tell us what amount represents increases in salaries and wages and what amount additional rolling stock. In other words, the Treasury has apparently not been informed. Could the hon. the Minister of Finance give us more information? Does the Ministry of Transport merely call upon the Treasury for the payment of so many millions, and does the Treasury simply pay up? Is there any control? [Interjections.] No, I do not want to ask the hon. the Minister of Railways for an explanation; I want this information from the hon. the Minister of Finance. Was this amount of R2,400,000 voted by the Treasury without the details having been submitted to the Treasury? If the details were furnished, could the hon. the Minister tell me how much of this increase is attributable to additional rolling stock and how much is attributable to increased salaries and wages? I would be grateful to ascertain that from him.</p>

The Auditor-General is also there to go into these things, but it is for the Department in question to furnish those details.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister of Finance has strengthened our case considerably. As a Parliament we are not prepared to vote money when the Deputy Minister concerned is unable to give any details. Perhaps the Minister himself could give us the details, and I would ask him specifically to deal with this aspect. The increase is approximately 25 per cent. We are told by the hon. the Deputy Minister that it is due to increased salaries, which were certainly not 25 per cent, but only about 7&#x00BD; per cent, and also to an increase in rolling stock, whereas the figures available indicate that the figures for the increase in third-class railway passenger traffic which is covered by this item do not even get near 25 per cent. If I remember rightly, it was 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So with the increase in traffic being not even half the percentage increase asked for here, and the increase in salaries and wages being only a fraction of this, there must be some other reason for this increase which we believe we are entitled to obtain from the Department. We are not to be bulldozed into voting money where there is no explanation whatsoever of why that money is required. That is our task here, and although the Government may think that it can do as it likes, it cannot do as it likes.</p>

<p>May I just explain again? It is a question of the Central Government having compensated the Railways under the Transport Vote, and the Department of Transport as such has nothing to do with it. It is a matter between the Railways Administration and the Treasury. The Railways Administration has furnished the reasons for this increase. How would it help hon. members now to know what amount was for salaries and wages, and what amount for traffic? [Interjection.] Next week they have the opportunity of discussing it in full under the Railway Estimates.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Next week the money has been voted and then it is an accomplished fact. We as members of the House of Assembly are being asked to vote money and keep a watchful eye over the spending of the nation&#x2019;s money. Here we have a case where the Department of Transport came to the Treasury and requested millions of rand, and when we ask why the money is necessary, we are shown two heads, but no details are given. We then turn to the Minister of Finance, and he says we must ask the Department. Why must we ask the Department? Surely the Treasury votes the money; the Treasury gives the money to the Department of Transport. The least we can expect from a Government which does its business properly is that the Treasury will say: &#x201C;Good, you can get the money if you need it, but what do you need it for?&#x201D; But here a blank cheque is being made out. It is being said here that they want it to cover losses, but not the slightest interest is taken in what the losses are and whether it is justified or not, or whether it is something on which the nation&#x2019;s money can, in fact, be spent. Unless we can get a reply to the fair question which we are asking, and that is, in respect of what losses are these millions of rand being requested from Parliament, we will be obliged to oppose this item and call for a division of the House of Assembly. We would not like to do so. We want to afford the Deputy Minister an opportunity of telling us what, we want to know, or we want to ask the Minister or the Minister of Finance: As guardian of the nation&#x2019;s purse, what did you find out in regard to this tremendous amount which is being requested? If we cannot get this information we will be obliged to refuse this amount.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>One almost gets the impression that this is the first time an item such as this has appeared on the Estimates. Every construction bill which has been submitted to this House, where a new railway-line has been constructed, contains an agreement, a guarantee agreement to the effect that the Treasury will compensate the Railways for any losses, and this House has approved it every time. The House is aware of the guarantee agreement. In addition it provides that the Railways will submit certified accounts to the Treasury and that everything will be settled once every five years. If too little or too much has been paid the account will be rectified, but each year provision is made for an estimated loss&#x2014;not an actual loss but an estimated loss. Anybody who knows anything about railways will surely know that it is impossible to say at the end of February or the beginning of March precisely what the loss on a specific service for the following 12 months is going to be. Nobody is that allknowing. That hon. member will not be able to say within 50 per cent, never mind 25 per cent. He does not have the least knowledge in that regard, and will never have it either. It is impossible to calculate precisely what the loss is going to be for the 12 months which lie ahead when you do not know what the increase in passengers is going to be, and you do not know precisely when your new rolling stock is going to be delivered and when the depreciation and interest on that capital will have to be calculated, and when you do not know precisely what the increase in wages for specific staff will be. It is quite impossible to determine all those things at the beginning of the year. It is only at the end of the year that it is more or less possible for you to determine what the real loss was. and that is what has happened in this case. It was calculated in the beginning of the year that the loss would amount to approximately R8 million. It has now been found that that loss will apparently be R2.4 million more. The Department of Transport is merely the bookkeeping department in regard to this matter. All that the Department of Transport has to do with <span class="col_2443-2444" refersTo="page_1239"/>it is see that this amount comes on the Estimates Vote instead of on the Estimates Vote Treasury, just as in the case of the next Item 11. But if the hon. member is so curious to know what the real reasons for that increase were, he must ask Railways and not the Department of Transport. He has ample opportunity to ascertain all the details in the debate next week. But these accounts are certified and handed over to the Treasury, after that the Auditor General also comes into the picture and he goes into those accounts. After these have been properly taken care of, and after it has been ascertained that unnecessary money is not being taken from the public&#x2019;s pocket this amount is voted. I think the hon. member is quite out of order to want to know from the Department of Transport what the details are of an account which the Railways have submitted to them. He must ask the Railways.</p>

The excess amount paid to the Railways appears under the Transport Vote. That is the extent to which the Department of Transport is concerned in the matter.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Minister can become personal if he likes but it will not help him to do so. There is a very simple point before this House. We are being asked now, not next week, to vote a further amount of more than R2 million of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money in respect of losses which were suffered by the Railways. The Minister has informed this House that we should merely go ahead and vote this amount: then, next week, when it is an accomplished fact, we may discuss this matter. What restitution is there then for this House? The amount has been voted and it is a thing of the past. I cannot understand how an experienced Parliamentarian such as the hon. Minister of Transport can suggest in the Parliament of South Africa that we must vote the money and discuss it later when it is an accomplished fact. It is also difficult to understand why the Minister should suggest that we are so stupid that we are asking him to give a separate account of every cent spent. Surely it is ridiculous to say that. Nobody is asking for that. I am asking a very simple question. I say that the Department of Transport and the Depart ment of Finance should be able to tell us how much of this amount of more than R2 million was needed for increased salaries and how much was needed for the purchase of rolling stock. I am asking for two figures. I am not interested in cents. What I am interested in are two amounts and two heads which were mentioned not by me but by the Deputy Minister of Transport. What is to become of Parliament if we conduct our business in such a way? What becomes of Parliamentary control over finances? What kind of nonsense is this on the part of the Ministry? It is an impossible state of affairs and I am asking once again, courteously but urgently. &#x201C;Before we vote this amount we want to know why we are voting it&#x201D;. The increase in salaries amounted to approximately 7 per cent. An increase of more than 25 per cent is being asked for here. What is going to happen to the balance?&#x2019;</p>

The Minister of Railways must have given the Minister of Transport a certificate and on it he must state that the cost is X, the revenue is Y and he requires the difference. It appears now that the Minister of Transport is simply signing a cheque without any backing for the account against which he is paying it. He is merely being told, &#x201C;I want another R21 million&#x201D;. He does not ask any questions and he cannot give any answers to the questions we ask. If there are certificates somebody has got them. Who is sitting on those certificates? In whose file are they? Are they in the file of the Department of Railways, the Department of Transport or the Minister of Finance or is the Department of Bantu Administration sitting on it? We state that there is not a 25 per cent increase in wages nor in the traffic. Therefore Unless we know what makes up the actual increase in traffic and therefore the actual costs which are likely to have been incurred and the differences between the increase in wages and what is actually being charged, there must be some hidden factor in this increase. There are to my knowledge no new lines which have been opened up in the course of this year which could account for this amount.</p>

To our knowledge there is no new major line which could account for it and no new major service and no increase relative to this percentage on any of the new lines or of the existing lines anywhere in South Africa. It is quite clear that if there is a certificate that certificate must indicate the facts. This House is entitled to those facts.

<p>Does the hon. member think that I have put the money in my pocket? That is the kind of stupid remark one is used to hearing from that side of the House. It has nothing to do with getting away with it. What happens is this. We have not even reached the end of the current financial year. The current financial year ends at the end of March. What happens here is that we say to the Treasury at the beginning of the year: &#x201C;This is what the estimated loss over the year is on these services.&#x201D; That was done at the beginning of the year, and it is now found that the losses are going to be greater. The Railways are now asking for an additional R2,400,400. The Treasury must accept it in terms of the guarantee agreement. They must pay it. The Treasury has no option, but from time to time the accounts are properly audited. If there was any excess payment by the Treasury to the Railways, then it is rectified. If there were any underpayments, these are also rectified. The actual losses are determined when those accounts are audited. If the hon. member displays no interest in this, then it is just an indication of how useless this debate is. He sits and converses with members behind him while I am replying. That proves that they are not serious about this. They are merely talking.</p>

<p>The account states: This is the amount which must be paid. In broad, general terms it is being stated, as my colleague said, that it is mainly attributable to, say, three factors, i.e. salary increases, additional rolling stock on which interest and value depreciation must be calculated, and additional passengers who have to be transported. It is not stated on any certificate that these are the actual losses. No certified account, with all the details of this amount of R2,400,400, is sent to the Treasury. It is the estimated loss for the entire year. When the accounts are drawn up and when it is being determined what the actual loss by the Treasury and the Railways was, the Treasury is compensated if there were any excess payments. If there were any underpayments on the other hand, they have to reimburse the amount. It has happened in the past that there were underpayments and that additional payments had to take place. Whether hon. members like it or not, that is the procedure which is followed. They can argue as long as they wish, but that is the procedure which was followed, which is being followed and which will be followed in the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, although the Minister has now intervened himself, the position still remains as unsatisfactory as it was when we started. I should like to remind the Minister of this. He said that whether we liked it or not, this is the procedure and this is the practice and this is the way it has been done and will continue to be done. I submit that we should not be told that whether we like it or not, this is the way it is going to be done. The Minister would not run his private affairs in this manner. I should like to remind the Minister that at this particular time there is a cry from the Treasury and from the Governor of the Reserve Bank that we must save money to avoid inflation. When a call is made on the small man to watch his finances and to see that he does not waste his money, I submit that it is quite unreasonable to come to this House and to ask us to give money in this manner, without being able to tell us how it is arrived at. On every other vote and in regard to all the other expenditure here, we are entitled to get up and ask as we have got up and we have received exact information as to how the money is spent. The Minister of Finance himself has said that the Minister responsible must give us the information. It is not for the Minister to say that they are merely bookkeepers. If they are bookkeepers, we are the people who are going to pay. They are our bookkeepers and we as the employers are entitled to say: You are our bookkeepers. Tell us how this amount is arrived at. I shall tell you why, Sir. The Deputy Minister said that it was for an increase in salaries and for rolling stock. Now it is quite obvious that that cannot be all. Those two items cannot make up more than 25 per cent. The Minister himself has said that there is an additional amount. The Minister has introduced something more. He says that there is a loss because of carrying additional passengers. The Deputy Minister did not give us that information. He never mentioned that. Now we want to know how many additional passengers have been carried. It must be an infinitesimal number.</p>

<p>There is an old saying which goes: You can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. That is what is happening with the Opposition now. One can explain as much as you like, but they cannot understand it, either that or they do not want to understand it. It astonishes me that so-called sensible people can adopt this kind of attitude. I am quite flabbergasted. If they had the least understanding of business, they ought to know that when money is appropriated for a year, one merely needs an estimated amount. After the end of the financial year, and when the accounts are drawn up, then only are the final figures calculated. Now the hon. member has that foolish smile on his face, I cannot believe it. Let me now try to explain, like a school teacher to his pupils, how the matter works. Perhaps they will then understand it. Even the Leader of the Opposition cannot understand it. It is no wonder they are sitting there. Let me once again try to explain. An estimate is made of the estimated losses which will be suffered during the year.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The estimates were made in February of last year, as usual. Is the hon. member not aware when estimates are made for the following year? Then why does he ask such a stupid question? When I introduce my estimate on Wednesday all my expenditure and income for the next year are estimates which have been made. Is the hon. member aware of that, or is he not aware of that? Does he realize that these are estimates which are being made? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The estimates were originally made at the beginning of the year. As I have said, I must now try and teach them. In any case, estimates are made for the coming year. Provision is made in the estimates for the possible losses which may be suffered on a specific service in that year. At the end of the year it is found, as in the case of all additional amounts, that the estimated losses are going to be greater than the amount which was estimated. Now the Railways says to the Treasury: We originally estimated that the losses would amount to R8,800,000. We now find that for the current year the apparent losses are going to be R2,400,000. We can as yet not say what the precise amount will be. That is impossible. The financial year only ends in March. Unless one is a soothsayer or somebody who can see into the future, one cannot say what the actual loss will be until the end of March. That is the estimated loss&#x2014;an amount of R 11,200,000 for this current year. The Railways informed the Treasury what the apparent reasons for that loss were. There are, after all hundreds of different small reasons why an amount larger than the originally estimated amount is required. Amongst other things there were salary increases. If overtime has to be paid, additional payments have to be made. It cannot be said at the beginning of the year how much overtime will have to be worked. Surely that is impossible.</p>

<p>Everything is estimated, but one can never say precisely what it will be. We are a business undertaking; is the hon. member not aware of that? We are not a penny-ha&#x2019;penny shop in one of the small country towns. Estimates are made for the year ahead and it is estimated what the deficit is going to be in respect of losses on those specific services. The actual loss will not be known before two or three months have elapsed, until such time as the accounts have been checked by the Auditor-General. Then only will we know what the actual position is. In terms of the guarantee agreement is it the case that when the accounts are finally audited and there has been an excess payment, it must be paid to the Treasury or carried over into the following year. If there has been an underpayment, it must be settled by the Treasury. All that the Railways are doing at this stage, before the accounts have been properly audited, is to give the general, the main reasons why the additional amount was necessary. There have been additional salaries. That also includes overtime, as well as Sunday time. That expenditure may be even greater than was originally estimated. It includes additional interest, and value depreciation of new stock purchased. It also includes the fact that additional trains were operated and that there were more passengers. A hundred and one different items are included, which all contributed to making the expenditure greater. It is quite simple. I hope hon. members will understand it now. That gentleman will never understand anything&#x2014;it does not help explaining anything to him. I will not get it into his head even though I use a sledge hammer to din it into his head.</p>

Then the Minister himself indicated that it was impossible to say what the precise amount was, and that one could only make an estimate. We on this side were merely asking for the estimates under these various subheads. Because, Sir, presumably it was not just a lump sum. Presumably, more particularly because of the original explanation given by the Deputy Minister, as enlarged upon by the Minister, there were various heads. Were they certified accounts? Were they wild guesses, just one lump sum, or were different items attributed to the different heads? We on this side were attempting to find out what the actual estimates were in respect of the various heads. It is a perfectly simple question.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The increase of R 190,000 is attributable to the following reasons. But before going on to that I just want to say that the hon. member stated that the hon. the Minister treaed me as a schoolmaster would. Well, I took it&#x2014;apparently I over-estimated the intelligence of the Opposition&#x2014;that the hon. members on the opposite side were aware that we are now dealing with revised Estimates. Why does the hon. member look so astonished now? Why does he not say a word? We have been dealing with revised Estimates all along. We are not dealing with actual figures which have already been dealt with. I want to say again that this case is precisely the same as the previous one. The Railways attribute the increase to, in the first place, an expected lower percentage of commercial goods traffic which will be imported through the harbour of Lourenco Marques to the competitive area. Chiefly as a result of an import of mealies through the abovementioned harbour which was less than expected. The hon. member must not ask me now how many fewer bags of mealies will be imported through the harbour of Louren√ßo Marques. I cannot supply that information. The second reason is the unforeseen sudden increase in the world demand for chrome-iron ore and the resultant increased exports through Louren√ßo Marques. Hon. members must not ask me now how much chrome-iron ore will be exported, because I do not know.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>During the period Mr. J. C. van Rooy served as information attach√© in Washington he incurred exceptionally heavy medical expenses as a result of the fact that his wife was admitted to hospital five times in one year because of grave illness. Furthermore, one of his sons died during this period and the official had to <span class="col_2455-2456" refersTo="page_1245"/>meet the high funeral charges. His total expenditure on hospital charges and doctors&#x2019; and nurses&#x2019; fees amounted to R4,734. This amount did not include the charges for the son&#x2019;s funeral or the ordinary medical expenses which all families incur, such as expenses in respect of dental or specialist services. A medical benefit scheme of which the officer was a member and to which he contributed more than R14 a month paid about 50 per cent of the expenses. Had he been in the Republic, his medical benefit scheme would have paid three-quarters of his expenses. The current allowances paid to officers abroad are considered adequate to meet normal medical expenses, but not extraordinary expenditure caused by grave illness. In this case it was consequently decided to make a contribution to this official&#x2019;s heavy medical expenses by paying roughly a quarter of the total costs. With the addition of the contribution made by the medical benefit scheme in the U.S.A., approximately three-quarters of his expenses will be met, which means that the official himself will pay a quarter of the expenses, which is the percentage he would have paid in the Republic as a member of the medical benefit association system.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister under Item E, Miscellaneous Expenses, about the <i>ex gratia</i> remission to National Salvage of R7,000. As I understand the word &#x201C;remission&#x201D;, it is an exemption granted to somebody not to pay an amount, but in this case, as I read it, it is a payment by the Department of R7,000.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>A contract entered into with National Salvage was cancelled with effect from 1st November, 1966, because the contractor failed to pay within 30 days for waste-paper which he had received. New tenders were called for for the period ending 31st December, 1968, and only two tenders were received, namely from National Salvage and Cape Salvage. The first-mentioned tender quoted R4 a ton for unbaled wastepaper and R7 a ton for baled paper. The previous tender had been for R9 and R19 a ton, respectively. The last-mentioned tender quoted R8 a ton, but the tender applied only to paper available in Cape Town. It was decided to accept this tender as far as the Cape Province was concerned. As for the rest of the country, there was no alternative but to accept the tender of National Salvage, although there was no certainty that it would in fact be able to dispose of all the waste-paper at prices yielding a reasonable profit, even at the lower tender price. A guarantee is nevertheless required. On the recommendation of the Tender Board, Treasury approved that, in view of the difficult position in which National Salvage finds itself at present, the apparent loss incurred by the State as a result of the high tariffs of the cancelled contract as against the lower tariffs of the tender should not be recovered from the firm. The amount is estimated at R7,000; covering Parliamentary approval for the amount to be remitted is now requested.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amount being asked for here is to provide for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to a certain Mr. Els. He was a senior professional officer who acted as trade secretary in Madrid. He was travelling from Madrid to Berne and on a frozen road the car in which he, his wife and his child were travelling skidded and they were very seriously injured in the accident. The car was a complete writeoff. They were taken back to Spain, where they were admitted to hospital. They spent a month in hospital. The estimated cost was initially R2,000, but in fact came to R2,119. After that he returned to South Africa and his wife received protracted treatment in hospital in Pretoria. At the time it was required that provision be made for a R2,000 loan to him. He was neither insured nor a member of the Medical Benefit Association. It was then decided to grant him a loan of R2,000 at 5 per cent interest to cover his medical expenses. His medical expenses in Madrid alone came to more than that. That does not include his hospital expenses here. In the accident his wife lost the use of both eyes permanently, which also gave rise to additional expenses for the care of his wife. He has paid off that loan in part and there is still a balance of R1,426. To date he has therefore paid off more than R570 plus interest, but he will not be able to resume his original employment. With regard to his wife there are also additional expenses. It is estimated that if he had had that accident in South Africa his expenses at an ordinary provincial hospital would have totalled no more than R210. It was therefore felt that under these circumstances we should meet him and grant him this <i>ex gratia</i> payment of a portion of the loan.</p>

If they are leaving the country in the interests of South Africa and working for the country, it would appear the natural thing that they should be covered against these expenses rather than that it should be a matter of charity or a special <i>ex gratia</i> payment. It should be a matter of right that they should have protection as though they were in South Africa. Could the Minister tell us what the position is in respect of Government policy.</p>

We had exactly the same position in respect of another Vote we have dealt with.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to support the hon. member who has just sat down in his plea. If you go back to Vote 18 you will find that it is now a condition of service as recommended by the Public Service Commission that members serving the State should automatically have an opportunity of insuring themselves in terms of a comprehensive medical scheme. &#x2019; I think that the same should apply to all posts outside the country. I think that it is up to the Government to make sure that these people are insured at the expense of the State. We must take into consideration that the cost of medical services overseas is much higher than in South Africa and out of proportion to the salaries earned by these people. We have just heard of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment that had to be made. I think that we on this side of the House would recommend to the Minister that those of our citizens who are working outside the country for the State should be insured by the Government against illness.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with regard to officials serving abroad, provision has been made for the payment of additional funds to them with the very object of covering extra expenditure in such countries. There is no obligation with regard to insurance, not in the case of our local officials either. He was covered in Madrid under third party insurance. The advice from our Ambassador there was that Mr. Els would not benefit from lodging a claim in terms of the third party policy. He would not have succeeded in such a claim, because it did not cover such cases. With regard to third party he was therefore covered. He had covered himself, but it was not sufficient, or he could not have succeeded in any claim.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something about sub-head E&#x2014;Control of evaporation, R190,000. There is no need for me to emphasize that this is a new item, an item for which no provision was made previously in the Estimates. Consequently I shall be able to discuss this matter in greater detail. This is a sizeable amount, but if the results were favourable, this side of the House would have no objection. As I understood, evaporation from the Vaal Dam alone comes to approximately 200 million gallons a day. In any case, it is some fantastic figure. In other words, the evaporation from our dams is one of the major problems to be combated. Until now the only method to combat it has seemed to be spraying these dams with chemicals so that a thin layer spreads over the entire surface of the dam, with the result that evaporation may then be reduced by approximately 50 per cent. The hon. the Minister told us that he would have the Vaal Dam sprayed, and we have already had some information in that regard. I should now like to know some more. Will the hon. the Minister tell us how successful the spraying has been? Will it be worthwhile&#x2014;and I think it will quite likely be worthwhile&#x2014;to have further investigations carried out and experiments made in this regard, in order that if a crisis situation similar to that of last year arose, we might have made somewhat more progress in this regard and might be able to employ new methods? I am thinking, for example, of the fact that some of the aircraft were involved in accidents in this case. Those were unfortunate incidents for which no-one is to blame. I now want to ask the Minister whether some other method of spraying is not possible. It has been said that the alcohol wax may be sprayed from boats, and also by means of buoys floating on the dams. If all these methods are investigated&#x2014;which, I presume, is being done at Pienaars-rivier&#x2014;I am convinced that the resourcefulness of our Department of Water Affairs and Department of Agriculture would have the result that sound methods will yet be discovered, methods through which we might show the rest of the world how to counter the grave problem of evaporation.</p>

<p>The Minister said that he did not intend spraying only the Vaal Dam, but that he also had plans for spraying the Allemanskraal Dam and the Erfenis Dam. I presume that after the recent rain these measures are no longer necessary. I should nonetheless like to hear whether the steps taken in respect of those two dams had favourable results; that is, if steps were in fact taken. I do not know what the position is in respect of the water in those two dams. We should like to know more about that. This is an important method of preventing evaporation. We know that malaria has been wiped out partially by spraying oil on the water. I wonder whether one cannot perhaps in the same way spray cheaper oil on water and thus also prevent evaporation. Water <span class="col_2465-2466" refersTo="page_1250"/>cannot evaporate through a layer of oil, of course. I shall not talk about this any further. I should like to hear the views of the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the question of spraying water with alcohol to prevent evaporation is something new to us here in South Africa, of course. At the time of the crisis I asked my Department what could be done on a short-term basis to conserve more water. One of the proposals submitted to me was that the water be sprayed with an alcohol mixture. The very afternoon I received this report I gave instructions that the chemicals should be ordered the next day. Someone had to make the experiment, and I considered that nobody would be in a better position to make this experiment than the State itself. The reports I have received on the results of this spraying are most favourable. The spraying of the Vaal Dam&#x2014;I am speaking under correction, because I do not have the exact figures before me&#x2014;saved 15 million gallons of water a day. That represents approximately 30 per cent of the water used by the Pretoria complex. That was effected at a cost of approximately 9c per 1,000 gallons of water. That is very reasonable, of course. The hon. member also asked me for information about the spraying of two dams in the Free State. Well, they have not been sprayed. They are now overflowing, so that it will be somewhat na√Øve to spray them. The order is nevertheless being executed, the chemicals are stored, and we are prepared to start spraying immediately we come up against such a problem again.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me whether we could not use a safer method. I think the safest method of spraying is by means of aircraft. There has been an accident, but accidents occur wherever aircraft is used. I deeply regret that. Nevertheless, I think it is still the best way of spraying water.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked whether further research was being carried out. The reply is, yes, further research is certainly being carried out. Not only in our country, but also in other countries research into the prevention of evaporation is being carried out continually. It is not always necessary for a country to incur high expenditure in connection with research of its own account. We should follow the example of our businessmen to some extent and let other countries do the research. We may then watch what happens. If their methods are fruitful, we move in too and share in the results. In any event, research is still being undertaken with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to hear that research is still continuing. I am also pleased to hear that supplies are in fact being stockpiled in order that we may not again find ourselves in the position that no chemicals are available and have to be ordered first. These are important matters. I hope this will be continued with to the benefit of water conservation in South Africa. There has been mention of the cost per gallon involved in spraying. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has the figures. I do not expect him to have the figures, but I thought the figure was somewhat high and that it may perhaps be possible to reduce it in due course.</p>

<p>In reply to a question the hon. the Minister told me that the chemicals were not manufactured in South Africa because the manufacturers felt that they did not want to manufacture this alcohol wax on such a small scale here; it then had to be imported from Holland and Germany.

<p>When something is abundantly available at a competitive price, it does not always pay to have it manufactured locally on a small scale. If it was going to cost the country a great deal in foreign exchange it would be profitable to subsidize the manufacture in this country, but if one is dealing with an item such as this, which can be obtained abroad without any trouble and which is not used on a large scale, it is not worthwhile subsidizing the manufacture in this country.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The position with regard to the second item is as follows: Mr. C. J. Korff, owner of the farm Pampoenepan, Hopetown Division, applied on 16th June, 1965, for a subsidy on a borehole which he wanted to have sunk by a private boring contractor. The application was considered in terms of Government Notice No. 1016 of July, 1963, and on 14th July, 1965, the applicant was informed that his application had been approved. On 28th October, 1965, the applicant submitted a statement together with a completion report form in respect of ten boreholes which he had sunk at a cost of R4,750. Only the first borehole was <span class="col_2467-2468" refersTo="page_1251"/>successful, with a yield of 400 gallons per hour, while the other nine were unsuccessful. In terms of Government Notice No. 1016 of 1963, which was substituted by Government Notice No. 74 of 1966 on 14th January, 1966, with retrospective effect as from 1st April, 1965, it is a requirement that an applicant shall apply in advance and may not commence boring until the Department has informed him that his application had been approved. As the last nine boreholes had been sunk without prior approval, the applicant was informed that a subsidy could not be granted on those boreholes. Mr. Korff made further representations to the Department. He had incurred high expenses in an attempt to find water and he submitted plausible proof that he had in fact spent the money. All the boreholes comply with the provisions of Government Notice No. 1016 of 1963, and if he had applied in advance, the Department would have approved his application. It is my wish that the customary subsidy shall be paid in all cases where during the drought applicants were compelled by circumstances beyond their control to sink boreholes in order to provide water for stock drinking purposes. The subsidy which may be granted amounts to R3,167. With Treasury approval it was decided to pay an <i>ex gratia</i> subsidy to the amount of R3,167 to Mr. Korff, and in view of the fact that it exceeds R 1.000, the approval of Parliament has to be obtained in respect of it.</p>

The firm cancelled the contract on 31st December, 1964, and maintained that as a result of the increase in the price of meat since the contract was entered into, it has incurred a loss already of R1,365. The Tender Board, after investigation, recommended to the Treasury that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R 1,350 be made to the firm, and the Treasury concurred.

<p>We have had increases in the Estimates in respect of salaries, wages and allowances in most of the previous Votes, but here we have a much greater increase in the amount and also percentagewise than in the previous Votes. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister would explain why there is such a large increase under this Vote?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_police">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Here the circumstances differ somewhat from those in respect of the other Votes. I should like to explain the details under item A, to which the hon. member referred. That amount should be sub-divided into several subsections. The main reason for the increase is of course salary adjustments. The amount that provides specifically for that is an amount of R4.541.000 for ordinary salary adjustments and R600.000 for salary adjustments for special constables. In other words, a total of R5,100,000 comes specifically under salary adjustments. I should like to mention that it was only in October, 1966, that Treasury approved. on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, the salary adjustments in respect of ranks from constable to lieutenant. Treasury also approved the recommendation <span class="col_2469-2470" refersTo="page_1252"/>that the adjustments come into effect as from 1st January, 1966. Consequently these salary adjustments could not be provided for when the Estimates were framed. There is a further factor which bears on this position, and that is that the retirement age was extended from 58 to 60 years. As a result of that there were fewer retirements from the service. In this regard, too, there was therefore additional expenditure which could not be foreseen when the Estimates were framed.</p>

<p>The reasons I have just mentioned are also of application in respect of the special constables to whom I referred a moment ago. In this case the amount is R600,000. But there are further factors which contributed to the increase. On 10th January, 1967, Treasury granted approval for certain adjustments based on the promotion qualifications. For example, provision was made in the case of constables and other ranks up to sergeant, in which the personnel do not have a Std. 8 certificate but have gained the required promotion qualifications, that adjustments may be made as though they are in the possession of a Std. 8 certificate. The same applies in the case of sergeant to lieutenant, if the staff member does not have a Std. 10 certificate but has completed the promotion examinations. This was approved only on 10th January, 1967, with retrospective effect as from 1st January, 1966. It also contributed to the increase of R5.950.000. I do not know whether the hon. member wants further particulars in respect of this particular item. I have actually only referred to the ordinary salary increases and the salary increases in respect of special constables. There are some other minor items which are responsible for this increase. I may perhaps just mention that there was also a decrease under this Vote. There was a saving of R 192,000 on the personal non-pensionable allowance.</p>

<p>I asked the Department the same question the hon. member is now asking. These amounts are not in respect of the ordinary detective services, according to the concept of the man in the street. This amount is much too small for that. The detective services provided for here do not relate to officials of the Department but to outside officials who are appointed for specific purposes to obtain certain information for the police. That is the reason why it is hard to predict. It is paid to certain people outside in order to obtain certain information for which the Department then has to pay.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE</person>:</from>

<p>Referring to the question of the hon. member for Pinelands, I should like to reply to him as follows. There is no need to hide the information. In addition to payment regarding information in serious criminal cases, payment is made in advance for scientific investigations, for example to the Bureau of Standards, for analyses, and to accountants in respect of expert examinations of accounts in fraud cases, and also medico-legal costs.</p>

<p><span class="col_2471-2472" refersTo="page_1253"/>As regards the question asked by the hon. member for Musgrave, he referred specifically to the amount of R9,688. I do not know whether he wants me to deal with the amount of R2,500 as well. As you will appreciate, Sir, the police frequently have to appoint firms of accountants to carry out certain extensive inquiries in connection with fraud cases and other criminal offences. Thus it has been necessary for the police to appoint such accountants from time to time to perform the work. In some cases the work assumes very large proportions and demands a good deal of time. It has also been the experience of the police that when a firm is appointed the work is frequently not completed within a reasonable period of time. A penal provision was therefore laid down to the effect that if the work was not completed within a specific period, the amount in remuneration would be reduced. As background I should first mention that if the work is not completed within the stipulated period the amount of the remuneration is reduced, and if it takes even longer the amount is reduced even further. Thus the firm mentioned here was appointed to carry out a certain investigation with regard to the liquidation of certain companies. It was agreed that the work was to be completed within two years, at a remuneration of R 2,000. If the work was not completed within two years but was in fact completed within three years, the amount was to be reduced to R 1,000, and if it was not completed within three years there would be no payment. This work was undertaken and commenced on 14th December, 1960, and was completed only in January, 1966. In other words, the work occupied more than five years. It appeared, to the satisfaction of the Department, that the scope of the work had been vastly underestimated and that the work involved more than was originally anticipated. As a result of that it was felt that there had actually been no delay on the part of the firm and that they were not to blame for the fact that the work was not completed within the stipulated period, but that it was due solely to the fact that both the firm and the Deparment had completely underestimated the scope of the work. The value of the work at the ordinary tariff was then calculated at R9,688. As you will appreciate, their claim against the Government in respect of the R2,000 for which the original contract was entered into had superannuated, and they could then no longer lodge a claim for R2,000 and it was necessary to include the R2,000 in the R9,688. That is, an inclusive fee of R9,688 was decided upon, and under the circumstances it was considered equitable to pay them the amount.</p>

Because the police are compelled in many cases to provide home telephones for their officials, particularly in the smaller rural police stations, the scope of the telephone services expanded and consequently the amount required was underestimated.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked for particulars regarding &#x201C;K&#x201D;. Here it appears that there has been a systematic expansion of 10 per cent per annum in the course of the past three years.

<p>As regards the first question my reply is, both, partly professional but partly also non-professional. I cannot define it more closely. It relates to detective services.</p>

<p>As regards &#x201C;K&#x201D;, we cannot necessarily conclude that the number of detained persons increased by the same percentage. These persons must be supplied with clothes and ablution facilities, etc. In view of the circumstances which arose in recent times, I think the hon. member will be aware of the fact that such detentions are essential, and there have been expansions in the past.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the <i>ex gratia</i> payment was approved by the Treasury subject to the prior approval of Parliament to compensate the firm for additional costs which were incurred as a result of an unprecedented and unforeseen increase in the price of hides from 8c to 16c. The details are as follows. The Johannesburg Tanning Company applied to the State Buyer on the 28th April, 1966, for compensation for the additional cost of R9,592 on hides in respect of 130,000 sq. ft. of footwear leather which was outstanding in December, 1965, on a contract of 245,375 sq. ft. awarded to the firm on 27th July, 1965, on a firm tender price. The additional cost was due to an unprecedented and unforeseen increase in the price of hides from 8c per lb. when the contract started to 12c in November, 1965, to an average of 15¬æc per lb. in March, 1966. The State Buyer, being aware of the increase in the price of raw hide and in view of the fact that the increase could not have been foreseen by the firm at the time of tendering, recommended that an increase of 5.287c per sq. ft. be allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the additional amount of R8,000 is required to augment the grant-in-aid payable to the University of Stellenbosch. When the amount of the grant-in-aid was determined an amount of R6,000 was provided for the purchase of specialized equipment with the proviso that should this amount prove to be inadequate to cover the purchases of specialized equipment during any one year representations from the university for the increase of the amount for that specific year would be considered. The university approached my department for an additional amount of R20,500 to cover purchases of specialized equipment required for research purposes. The application was considered by the Departmental Coordinating Research Committee and after consultation with the university it was decided that only one of the items required, a D. Mac Pencil Follower could be purchased during the 1966-&#x2019;67 financial year. The cost of the item is R 10,000. An amount of R2,000 could be found out of the original amount of R6,000 included in the grant-in-aid to cover the purchase of specialized equipment. Approval was therefore sought to increase the grant-in-aid in respect of 1966-&#x2019;67 only by an amount of R8,000 to cover the balance on the price of the D. Mac Pencil Follower.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As regards sub-head G, these costs relate to the extension of office premises firstly as a result of our increasing activities, which oblige us to rent additional office accommodation and to furnish such offices. The increased activities are particularly in the spheres of immigration and economic affairs. The amount involved is R14,540. Secondly, this additional expenditure is the result <span class="col_2475-2476" refersTo="page_1255"/>of expansion in the form of two new missions, the one in Geneva, where we established a second mission at the U.N., and the other in Munich, where we established a Consulate-General. In the case of the mission in Geneva we did prepare an estimate of the costs, but the estimated amount was too low. In the other case we did not realize a year ago that we would establish this Consulate-General there, with the result that in that case we did not prepare an estimate of the costs. Thirdly, this additional expenditure is due to moving into larger offices in Wellington, New Zealand. The rented offices we occupied were not satisfactory, particularly as regards security. As a result of moving into the new premises which we rent at present, certain alterations had to be made. The total amount involved was R21,000.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Minister of Mines I supply the following information. The Bellsbank Company applied for the return of a diamond which had been used as evidence in the case of the State versus one Anthony Thatsama. The case had been heard. He was convicted of being in possession of a diamond illegally and in terms of the Act under which he was convicted, the diamond was confiscated and came into the possession of the State. It was subsequently proved that that diamond had in fact been mined by the Bellsbank Company, and the State was satisfied that the company had been able to prove that the diamond had had its origin with it. Consequently application was made for the return of that diamond to the Bellsbank Company, the original owners. In terms of the regulations, Parliament&#x2019;s approval has to be obtained for the return of any amount which exceeds R1,000. That explains why this item appears here.</p>

The Secretary for Finance reduced the amount asked for under this subhead in the Department&#x2019;s original draft estimates by R1 million. It now appears that as a result of this reduction the appropriation of R23,637,000 will be exceeded by approximately R888,400.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to refer to items 16 and 19 on page 26. In connection with item 16 I only want to ask the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs whether he could give us an explanation of this <i>ex gratia</i> payment to a certain firm in connection with the new automatic telephone exchange building at Kimberley, and whether he could also give us some information concerning the increase in the cost of the Barrack Street automatic telephone exchange, particularly as Barrack Street is very near this House and might affect us. We shall be very happy to know the extent of the increase in respect of this telephone exchange.</p>

<p>But the most important matter I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is this new item under sub-head 19 on page 26&#x2014;Kempton Park: Jan Smuts Airport: New terminal building. For this it is estimated that R16 million will be spent and the magnificent sum of only R50 is being asked this year. I realize that it is a token amount, because if we were to spend <span class="col_2477-2478" refersTo="page_1256"/>this amount every year, the period between to-day and the time we shall have Jan Smuts Airport will be the same as the period between to-day and the time of the extinction of the dinosaur. But Sir, I am glad that at last this new item has appeared on the Estimates and I think that the country should recognize that it is largely owing to the unrelenting efforts on the part of members on this side of the House, who have been insisting for the past eight, nine years that the facilities at Jan Smuts Airport were totally inadequate. I am glad that now, at last, this item has appeared on the Estimates. It is too late, and again too little is being granted this year, but as long as the item is on the Estimates, there is an indication that at last the Government has come to listen to this side of the House. The hon. the Minister can go through Hansard for the past five, six years and he will find that on nearly every possible occasion we demanded this new terminal building. We pointed to the overcrowding at Jan Smuts, how the space was becoming insufficient, how the passengers were crowded, how the freight facilities were so bad that the delivery of goods was delayed for a long time. At last, in November, 1964, as late as that, planning of this new airport was started. We waited and expected that something would be done about it in subsequent years. 1965 passed and nothing was done. 1966 passed and nothing was done. Now at last, we have this item on the Estimates of R50.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister told me, when I asked him in the past when this terminal was going to be started and when it would be completed, that he could not tell me, because no money has as yet been voted on the Estimates for this new terminal at Jan Smuts. Now at last, we have this global amount being voted. I ask the hon. the Minister of Transport to fulfil his promise and to tell us, now that this item does appear on the Estimates, when does he expect they will start building this new air terminal and when will it be completed. As I said, Mr. Chairman, the Estimates were compiled, a plan was started 24 years ago and now at last we have this R50 on the Estimates. I want to know whether these plans have not gone out of date in the meantime. After all, there has been expansion. There have been new developments. There is a distinct possibility that supersonic planes might come to South Africa in spite of the denial of the hon. the Minister of Transport to me some time ago. There is the possibility that much of the work that has been done during the past years to expand the present facilities there, will now have to be broken down. I think we should know how much of that expenditure was actually wasted owing to the delays in starting this big project. I can only say that, now that this item is on the Estimates, we shall watch it extremely closely. We cannot ask the hon. the Minister what will appear on the Main Budget. We shall wait until the Main Budget does appear. But this is an item that we, particularly the members of Parliament for Johannesburg and the Reef, will watch with the closest interest and I trust that there will not be a long delay before we do have this new air terminal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we are embarking on this very important new public building, I do want to address a plea to the hon. the Minister to be certain that this is a worthy terminal building. I am doing so particularly because I do not think that the existing building really was designed as an air terminal. It seems as if it was designed by, you might say, people who remembered rather the days of the Railways. We have moved, as far as this is concerned, into the time of air travel and all modern airport buildings have been designed entirely on their own. I do not think that such a design would be at all appropriate. Therefore I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he could tell us what the plans are in so far as the architectural design of that building is concerned. Are the designers going to be absolutely <i>au fait</i> with air terminal buildings, and above all, will there be a sufficiently strong architectural team to ensure that it has the very latest ideas in air terminal buildings, and that aesthetically the building will be thoroughly satisfactory. It really will not be sufficient if we do it on the basis of the present terminal building which conjures up the wrong type of memory in an air age.</p>

These are all new services in respect of coloured schools. I see there are items in respect of Windermere and also Ida&#x2019;s Valley, Stellenbosch, which is in my area. I see that in respect of each of these schools an amount of R50 is put down. This is merely a token amount. Will the Minister please tell me what stage of development these schools have reached? When will it be possible for them to start? Obviously architects&#x2019; fees will be very much more than R50. Can the Minister give me any idea when teaching will commence in these schools?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should first like to deal with the schools for Coloureds. The reason for the inclusion of several new items in the Estimates&#x2014;items in respect of which only small amounts are asked for&#x2014;is the fact that it is necessary, according to particulars supplied to us by the Department of Coloured Affairs, to have these schools ready at the beginning of the next school year. Therefore it is essential to invite tenders at this stage already. So as to authorize us to write out tenders at this stage, Parliament first has to sanction these amounts. That is the reason for the inclusion of these items in the Estimates.</p>

<p>The same applies in respect of the terminal building at Jan Smuts Airport. I may just say that it is not on account of representations from hon. members opposite that it is deemed necessary to build the terminal. It has become <span class="col_2479-2480" refersTo="page_1257"/>necessary to do so because this Government has used its common sense. As a result of this Government&#x2019;s sound policy such a large number of visitors come to South Africa and such a large number of people travel from South Africa, seeing that we do not isolate ourselves from countries abroad, that this building has become too small to cope with the heavy flow of passengers. In any event, the need for the new terminal building arose long ago but as a result of more essential services to which attention had to be given, this matter had to be held in abeyance for years. The plans of the new terminal building are being drawn up and have already reached the final stage. Several firms of architects are working on them. Initially the contract was awarded to one firm, but the services of other firms were subsequently called in. People who have knowledge of the culture and character of South Africa were called in to give the terminal building, particularly as regards its interior decoration, a truly South African character. Provision has also been made for several of the officials who are concerned with supervisory work, officials employed in the Department of Public Works who are concerned with supervising the working drawings, the plans, the finish, the air conditioning and electrical installations, to pay special visits of observation to different modern airports in the world. They will then be able to give guidance to the architects, engineers and others who are engaged in these matters.</p>

<p>It will be one large complex. It will be the international part.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove asked questions concerning the automatic telephone exchange in Cape Town. As a result of the fact that the South Atlantic Cable proposals were approved, it has become necessary to install the Cape Town microwave and national subscriber dialling equipment at an earlier date. The equipment will be installed in the Barrack Street automatic telephone exchange building, and the accommodation for such equipment is required early in 1967, in order to ensure that it will be possible to complete the installation of the equipment by the end of 1967. The equipment concerned forms part and parcel of the national telecommunications system and its installation cannot be delayed without that having adverse effects. Provision was not made in the Estimates which are in force at the present time; consequently a Special Warrant was obtained and therefore it is necessary to sanction the service now.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked a question in connection with the <i>ex gratia</i> payment to Hubert Davies and Co. This company&#x2019;s tender of R20,200 for the electrical work in the new automatic telephone exchange at Kimberley was accepted on 21st June. 1962. In terms of this contract the period allowed for the completion of the electrical work was the same as the period specified for the completion of the building in the building contract. Originally the building had to be completed 15 months after 28th August, 1962, i.e. in November, 1963, but because the building contractor went bankrupt in the interim period, the building was only completed by the guarantors on 10th December, 1965. As a result of this delay, Messrs. Hubert Davies and Co. put in a claim for R6,520 as compensation for the interim increase in costs. Without any prejudice to the State&#x2019;s rights under the contract, the firm was requested to submit a statement certified by auditors to show how the amount of R6,520 had been arrived at. According to that figure the firm suffered a net loss of R2.568. The following clause was incorporated in the specifications relating to the electrical installation which form part of the contract document (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No claim from the Electrical Contractor shall be considered in the event of there being any delay in the building work or in the event of the date of completion being postponed to a later date by the Department.</block>

<p>In a similar case the State Attorney of the Cape ruled that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the persons concerned was justified, and it was subsequently decided, with the approval of the Treasury, to pay R2.568, the actual amount of the loss incurred as a result of an interim <span class="col_2481-2482" refersTo="page_1258"/>increase in costs, by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the firm.</p>

<p>No, I can show my Hansard to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister said that it was their common sense which prevailed upon them to make these plans and not the United Party. Well, the United Party displayed common sense but the Government delayed these plans for four years and in addition nearly five years will elapse before the completion of this terminal. Under these circumstances I fear what we are going to discover when this terminal is eventually completed, because by 1972 there will yet again have been new developments, for example, in connection with supersonic aircraft. In Australia there is already talk of sending those aircraft to South Africa; the hon. the Minister of Transport does not know about that.

<p>I am far more concerned about our having got the right architects for this building than the hon. the Minister seems to be. The hon. the Minister did say that originally one architect was engaged and that others were then brought in. I do hope very much that he himself gave his attention to the question of getting the most outstanding South African architects engaged on this job. This is probably the biggest single public building that has been built for many a year. Even a whole railway station does not cost much more than this and this is a single building complex calling for tremendous architectural skill. We therefore need our most imaginative architects, drawn perhaps from Pretoria, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and possibly other centres. I do sincerely hope that the significance of this as an architectural and technical achievement is being appreciated and that only our most talented architects have been considered for the job because we would hate to come up with a very ordinary achievement at the end of it all. I would like to have greater assurance in this regard than the hon. the Minister has given us so far. I appreciate that some architects are on the job but we need our best architects for this job.</p>

<p>I understood the hon. the Minister to say that the architects were still busy completing plans for this new big complex. I am just wondering how the figure of R16 million has been arrived at because the plans are not yet complete. Obviously no tenders have been called for and the estimate must be a very rough one if the plans have not yet been completed. This is a very big undertaking and I wonder if the hon. the Minister can give us any indication as to whether he really thinks that this building is going to be completed at a cost of R16 million or anything like it. My own belief is that the cost will probably be nearer R25 million by the time it is finished. Would it not be wiser to try to get a closer estimate of what we are letting ourselves in for? We all agree that the work has to be done, but are we not deluding ourselves by making provision for a figure which is not likely to cover the final cost? Would it not be wiser to try to ascertain what the final cost is likely to be? If that figure proves to be an over-estimate then it would not matter because we would be saving money. We know that it so often happens that money is voted here for an undertaking and that by the time it is completed the cost is twice as much as the original estimate. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can give us any idea as to how closely the estimated cost of this building has been investigated. Was provision made for R16 million just because it is a round figure or how was the figure <b>arrived at?</b></p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, as far as the architects are concerned, I just want to tell the hon. member for Pinelands that I entirely agree with him that in projects of this nature we should obtain the services of the best architects in the country. However, it has been the practice of the Department of Public Works for many years, since the time of the previous Government <span class="col_2483-2484" refersTo="page_1259"/>as a matter of fact, to appoint architects for projects on the advice of the Institute of Architects. The architect for the Jan Smuts terminal building was appointed on the advice of the Institute of Architects. Only one firm was appointed. With the consent of that firm we called in other architects to obtain their views in connection with the type of building. In the meantime I have changed that procedure, because I believe that in future when we are dealing with large projects, one should appoint a consortium of architects so as to avail oneself of the experience and knowledge of a larger number of people. This will be done in future.</p>

<p>As far as the estimate is concerned, the hon. member is quite correct. At this stage we cannot say with certainty what the final cost of that terminal building is going to be, because the price level may possibly change entirely before 1972. The building will be completed in various stages. In many respects this is a highly technical building. It will not be possible to complete it before 1972. This estimate was made by my Department, one that has knowledge of the cost of buildings of this type, but the estimate was based on present price levels. Hon. members must realize that the estimate was based on the approximate cost per square foot for that type of building, due regard being had to its technical nature, etc. We concede that the final cost will be much higher, and I believe that the cost will in fact be higher as a result of the constant increase in building costs, but that is no reason why we cannot say at this stage that a building of that type, according to the experience of the Department, will cost approximately R16 million. I think that is as close as we are able to estimate the cost at this stage, and we must, after all, give Parliament an indication of the estimated cost.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister spoke of the Jan Smuts Airport, he told us that persons had already been sent overseas by the architects, and also by others, to conduct investigations at the most modern airport terminals in other parts of the world. Now I want to ask him this: If those persons had been sent overseas, it would surely have cost more than this small amount of R50 which is indicated? From what source then is that expenditure being met?</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise is this. The hon. the Minister will have wide powers in regard to the building of this terminal at Jan Smuts. Will he be the person who must determine priorities in regard to a major work such as this, or is it the task of the Minister of Transport to say that he would like to determine priorities?

Will the Minister give us some information as to whether this school will serve a wider area than Pretoria itself, or whether the fact is that there is no high school for Coloureds in Pretoria at present and that one is thus necessary?</p>

<p>The other point on which I should like to have some information is why it is that most of the coloured schools appear under Loan Vote &#x201C;B&#x201D;, under Public Works, and then we find that there are a number of coloured schools which fall under Loan Vote &#x201C;P&#x201D;, Coloured Affairs? Is there some reason for putting some of the expenditure under Public Works, and other expenditure under Coloured Affairs, seeing that they both relate to the building of schools for Coloureds?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove once more spoke of the building at Jan Smuts Airport. It is very obvious that the hon. member does not know how the machinery of State operates. As a matter of fact, he has never been a member of a governing party, because when the party to which he now belongs was in power, he was a member of the Opposition, and now that we are in power he again is a member of the Opposition. However, when an architect receives a commission and goes overseas to conduct a personal investigation, that is his affair and he himself foots the bill. But when the Department of Transport, or my Department, sends someone, that expenditure is included in the normal administrative expenditure of the Department and is not entered as a charge against the building. It is normal procedure for officials to be sent overseas from time to time to investigate certain specific matters, and that is done according to normal practice. For that reason no provision was made for the expenditure before. The provision we are now being asked to make is simply to enable us to issue tender documents for the first phases of the work to be carried out.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked who would be responsible for determining priorities. Neither the Minister of Transport nor I myself will determine priorities; the Government as a whole will do so. The person who will really have the most say will be the Minister of Finance, because he will have to make the money available whereupon the Government <span class="col_2485-2486" refersTo="page_1260"/>as a whole will determine the priorities in the interests of the country.</p>

<p>‚Ä†The hon. member for Umlazi asked me in connection with the first item, the large number of various services re-voted. According to the latest revised Estimates of Expenditure on the whole Loan Vote &#x201C;B&#x201D;, an excess of R 1,700,000 is expected this financial year, but this is partially decreased by the amount voted in respect of the named services in the Additional Estimates, and consequently it is expected that an additional amount of R 1,446,232 will be required to meet the commitments of the Department of Public Works for this financial year. Available funds are usually exceeded as the result of slower progress during the previous financial year than was expected, and quicker progress during the current financial year by the contractors than could be foreseen. There are some 500 separate services under Loan Vote &#x201C;B&#x201D;, of which a number are globular provisions. The number of buildings being erected, therefore, exceeds the number of items in the Estimates, which indicates how difficult it is to forecast the actual expenditure during a financial year.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Green Point asked me questions in connection with the school at Pretoria. I regret that I cannot give him the replies. My Department does not determine what area a school should serve. My Department merely carries out the tasks which other Departments ask it to carry out. The Department of Coloured Affairs gave high priority to this particular school and indicated that it must be completed by the beginning of the next financial, or rather, school year. For that reason this amount is now being asked for. I cannot tell him what need there exists for that school. The hon. member must obtain that information from that Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked why two items requesting loan funds for schools for Coloureds appear under the Loan Estimates. The reason is that the Department of Coloured Affairs finances the completion of schools that were under construction when coloured education was taken over from the provinces, with money it obtains from the Treasury, but my Department is responsible for all new works.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, these items are different from those to which the hon. member is referring. In the first place, the increase can be attributed to an amount of R1 million which is needed for the expanding telephone system. The tremendous demand for telephones and tele-communication equipment has been the reason for an additional estimate of R1 million. Then there is also an amount of R55,000 in respect of work done by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the Department of Defence. At the same time one should subtract a saving of R258.000 in respect of the S.A.B.C. which curtailed its expenditure in respect of the V.H.F. F.M. service as a result of the appeal made by the Government. If you add all these amounts, namely R1 million plus R55,000 minus R258,000, you will arrive at the amount of R797,000.</p>

This accounted for R50,000 of the R100,000. In addition a large amount is involved in salary payments. The amount that has been given to me is that approximately R 1,800,000 was the original Estimate for salaries, wages, etc. That Estimate was lower than the actual amount required.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as you will see, this item makes provision for an interest free Loan to the External Procurements Fund. The External Procurements Fund was established in 1942 by the previous Government by way of a war-time proclamation. At that time this empowered the Government to purchase strategic goods, to transport them and to store them until such time as these goods would be used by the private sector or by the Government itself. That fund has remained in existence since that time. It was used again particularly after certain countries had taken steps to withhold certain goods from us, as Pakistan did when it stopped exporting jute to us. This fund was retained and used for building up local supplies of those strategic goods, because it was essential for the survival of our economy. These funds, which were required for purchasing such supplies and keeping them in stock, were obtained by means of a Government guaranteed overdraft by the Reserve Bank. When such supplies were sold or disposed of, that fund was once again credited with the amount concerned. You will recall that as far as this Procurements Fund is concerned, it was provided earlier this year that funds could be made available to the private sector from this fund. In the interests of our survival it was deemed necessary also for the private sector to be able to purchase strategic goods in larger quantities than their normal supplies. It was, therefore, approved that the private sector could also make use of this External Procurements Fund for special long-term supplies. There is one change now. It has been proposed that, as regards our storage of strategic goods, all those funds should not be spent abroad, but that certain arrangements should be made locally, particularly as regards the storage of such goods. When these funds are borrowed from the Reserve Bank and paid out abroad, it is not inflationary as far as our own economy is concerned, but when these funds are borrowed from the Reserve Bank and are in fact utilized domestically, it has an inflationary effect. For that reason provision has now been made&#x2014;especially since loan funds are available at the moment&#x2014;instead of borrowing this money from the Reserve Bank on an overdraft, guaranteed by the Government, for a loan to stock-pile those strategic supplies. That is the real reason why an amount of R30 million, minus the savings which were effected, has to be provided in this way instead of its being obtained from the Reserve Bank, as would normally have been the position.</p>

On those grounds I gather that the Minister is not prepared to give this House any further information as to how the money is to be spent. Is that so?</p>

<p>That is correct. Besides, I do not think that it is in the interests of those people abroad who want to do us harm to have knowledge of the goods which are being purchased. These purchases are not only made by the Government. A very large percentage of them is being purchased and kept in storage by the private sector itself. The additional cost incurred in this way is being financed from this fund in terms of legislation passed earlier this year. Therefore I believe that it is not in the interests of South Africa that those people who want to do South Africa harm should know what supplies we are purchasing and storing.</p>

<p>Hon. members will realize that the National Housing Fund makes allocations to local authorities. The latter enter into contracts for the construction of schemes, schemes which often extend over a period of two to three years. Usually the maximum time within which the scheme has to be completed, is stipulated. but not the minimum time. It is not possible to say how much of the work involved in the scheme will be completed within a specific year. Experience has shown over the past year that owing to building restrictions and credit control, local authorities have made more rapid progress with their respective housing schemes than either they or we originally expected. Building contractors employed more workers and consequently the schemes were completed at an accelerated pace. The increase is attributable to this. The position is therefore that we managed to have more houses built over the past year, something which, in my opinion, justifies a further allocation.</p>

<p>The expenditure in respect of both these aerodromes is covered by savings under this Vote. The amount of R1 is shown merely to bring the additional expenditure to the notice of Parliament. As regards the expenditure of R2,200 shown in respect of the Kortdoorn aerodrome I want to say that the work was completed as long ago as February, 1966. No further expenditure had been foreseen when the Estimates were drawn up, but in July, 1966, a delayed claim was submitted by the Department of Mines, which had carried out the work in conjunction with Consolidated Diamond Mines of South-West Africa. Kortdoorn is situated near Alexander Bay. Katima Mulilo is situated in South-West Africa and the expenditure is covered by savings in this case as well. The work was completed by the Roads Department of the Transvaal Provincial Administration during November, 1965. When the Estimates were drawn up we did not foresee that additional expenditure would be incurred. After the work had been completed, however, it was decided that the equipment belonging to the Transvaal Provincial Administration would be used for the construction of a road between Katima Mulilo and Ngoma. The equipment was sent back to Pretoria only during the current financial year. A claim for the cost of sending it back to Pretoria as well as one for an amount of R35,000 in respect of repairs was received from the Transvaal Provincial Administration.

<p>Provision is made here for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R2,600 to a Japanese company, the company which has built the departmental vessel <i>R.S.A.</i> This vessel was handed over to the Department on 30th November, 1961. In terms of the guarantee, however, the company still had obligations for a further period of 12 months. Shortly after the vessel had been handed over, difficulties were experienced with the deep-sea echo sounder. This instrument did not work satisfactorily. In fact, the company had to send one of its employees to South Africa several times to work on this instrument, but without satisfactory <span class="col_2491-2492" refersTo="page_1263"/>results, even though the instrument had been attended to four times. The Department adopted the attitude that the company concerned still had obligations in terms of the guarantee, and on 29th January, 1965, the company was therefore requested to replace the defective instrument. The Japanese company eventually replaced the recorder of the echo sounder. The company&#x2019;s agents in South Africa requested the Department to pay half the repair costs, which amounted to R5,182. Later a claim submitted by the company itself was received for the full amount of the repairs, which then, according to the company, amounted to R5,914. Because the Department felt that the original device was not wholly defective and because it was replaced at considerable cost to the Japanese company, the Department decided that the claim be paid as a matter of prestige and in all fairness. The opinion of the State Attorney was thereupon obtained and he suggested that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to cover half the repair costs be made to the firm as requested by its agents in South Africa. The matter was then settled amicably in this way.</p>

Then there is a shortage of water at the various Bantu townships built by the Department. An amount of R1,100.000 is required for that our-pose. Then there is an urgent payment which had to be made by the Trust as a result of its liability for part of the costs in respect of the laying of a water pipeline to the Garankuwa Bantu township. That gives a total of R4,650,000. The balance of R550,000 was used for assistance during the drought, which caused very great difficulties amongst the Bantu farmers. and, <i>inter alia</i>, unemployment as well. The last amount which also forms part of the R550,000 relates to the establishment of prison farms, which has become very urgent. That brings the total amount to R5,200,000.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, during the discussion on this Bill it has become apparent that it is actually only the hon. member for Houghton who has serious fundamental objections to this measure. She entertains those objections despite the fact the hon. the Minister is trying, by means of these training centres for Coloured cadets, to introduce a positive measure in order to draw Coloured youths into a specific programme of preparation for greater preparedness to work and purposeful training. This will enable them to take their rightful place in society, in the Coloured community in particular, and in the country in general. The hon. member for Houghton is not here at the moment, but I do want to say that the hon. member surprises me time and again by the hopelessly negative attitude she adopts here. I do not know what her aim is in doing so, but her kind of liberalism is actually a fellow-traveller of Communism. One gets the impression that she actually wants to take delinquency into her protection in an attempt to further her liberalistic notions in some way or other. If liberalism takes delinquency into his protection, one is surprised at the stupidity with which such people approach life. I want to leave the hon. member for Houghton at that, and just say that unless she begins to think more positively about possible solutions to our country&#x2019;s problems, the time will soon come when she will no longer have a seat in this House.</p>

<p>When a measure such as this is introduced, by means of which it is attempted to move in the direction of better preparation and employment, better training of the Coloured youth, regard should be had to those people&#x2019;s background. Just like the Afrikaans-speaking people, the Coloured has a preponderantly rural background. Relatively speaking he is a stranger to the modern urban environment into which the process of urbanization has drawn him. In more than one respect he is not very well adjusted. In consequence of that, tremendous problems have arisen in the Coloured community in the course of the past few decades. We know that in the movement to the cities, where there is a lack of proper housing, the people were massed together in areas and under conditions where housing was very poor and where all kinds of social evils developed as a result. The responsible leaders among the Coloureds are therefore aware of the fact that they are facing a tremendous problem which arose in the past few decades. This problem is tremendously harmful to the Coloured population, and is most injurious to the good name of our Coloureds. In the rural areas there was more of a natural discipline for the Coloureds. Where they lived on farms the parents could <span class="col_2495-2496" refersTo="page_1265"/>still exercise fairly good supervision over them. The master of the farm maintained a natural discipline on his farm. There were jobs for the Coloured. Even if the Coloured did not go to school, he learned from an early age to do something useful. Thus he developed self-respect and pride and was naturally assimilated very easily by the community.</p>

<p>In the new urban environment, however, it is much more difficult for the Coloured youth to keep to the straight and narrow. In most cases both parents work. There are fewer recreation facilities. There are none of the opportunities for employment which he or his parents enjoyed on the farms. Consequently, there is more occasion for delinquency, even for crime. In saying this I do not want to cast any reflection on the Coloured population, of course. There are hundreds of thousands of those people who are honourable and who play a very useful part in society, people who present no problem to the State and to society. They are people who make a worthy contribution to our country&#x2019;s development in a large variety of industries, not only in the rural areas but nowadays also in the cities.</p>

<p>One forms a conception of the nature of the problem if one listens to what is said by Mr. Tom Swartz, Chairman of the Coloured Council. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people in the townships are crying out for protection against the &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-works&#x201D; and the hooligans who are responsible for the weekly toll of knifings, murders, outrages and thefts. One has only to glance at the headlines of those newspapers which specialize in crime and sex to realize how serious the position is. It is largely a social problem concerning education and wages. The Government is the only one so far to apply a practical rehabilitation policy for the Coloured people &#x2026; This Bill appears to be part of that policy.</block>

<p>Here he refers to this measure. You see, Mr. Speaker, there are people and leaders among the Coloured population who would like to provide positive guidance for their people. They would not like to have a large number of Coloured youths lost to their own population group. They would not like a continuation of this knifing, robbery and damage to property, which occurs so frequently&#x2014;not only in respect of the property of Whites but also in respect of the property of Coloureds. They wish to have this kind of thing prevented. Those people see in this Bill a positive step by the Government and the hon. the Minister to combat these evils and to prevent their increasing even further. Because, Sir, the Coloureds are becoming an urban population to an increasing extent. We cannot afford, they cannot afford, the reputation of the Coloured population cannot afford, the loss of a too high percentage of those people to South Africa and to their own Coloured community. For that reason I welcome this measure. We dare not ignore these conditions and these problems, and we cannot possibly provide only for gaols to imprison people once they have become criminals. We have to make provision as far as possible to prevent people becoming criminals. The Minister&#x2019;s introduction of a measure which, as set out in this Bill, proposes to have these people exercise, to have them take part in physical exercises, in sport activities, in drilling, and also to let them perform other kinds of work, is in my view most certainly a positive measure to foster some self-respect in Coloured youths, people who would otherwise perhaps fall into crime. Through this measure they may find themselves and make a proper living as human beings. Thus they may be assimilated somewhere in industry or in farming, or wherever it may be, so that they may be contented people.</p>

<p>In particular I also see this measure from the point of view of the loss of labour, a most important matter. We are engaged in a large-scale programme to remove the Bantu gradually from the Western Cape. The reason for that is partly that we have a large and rapidly increasing Coloured population here, and partly that we know that this part of our country is not the homeland of the Bantu. In other words, this is actually the natural employment area of the Coloured population, of an increasing Coloured population, an area in which we also want to assure them of a future and afford them an opportunity to make their full contribution to the development of our country. If one considers the statistics for the year 1960, it occurs to one that the Coloured population has not really become economically productive in a high degree, compared with the White population. In this regard I should like to quote some figures.</p>

<p>According to the statistics furnished the number of White men who are economically active is 848,805. The number of men who are economically inactive is 690,000. I am taking only the figures in respect of the male section of our population, which perhaps affords us a reasonable basis of comparison. The position in respect of Coloured men is as follows. 369,290 were economically active, while 331,542 were economically inactive. 45 per cent of the White men are economically inactive, while 55 per cent are economically active. As for the Coloured men, 52 per cent of them aie economically inactive while 48 per cent are economically active. In other words, there is a difference of at least 7 per cent. And that, Sir, while there is a tremendous shortage of labour here in the Western Province. Among the able-bodied persons in the Western Province, White as well as Coloured, there is not one who can complain of not being able to find employment, provided he wants to work. I will not be told that a man who wants to work and who can work, even if he only wants to do some simple job, cannot get work. Everywhere people are looking for workers. Our entire industrial development, our agriculture are begging for workers. If we take the degree of employment of the White population as a standard&#x2014;and here it is the position that there is almost 100 per cent <span class="col_2497-2498" refersTo="page_1266"/>employment&#x2014;then there is a difference of 7 per cent in respect of the male Coloured population. If we calculate this figure in terms of the total it means that there are approximately 50,000 Coloureds in the Republic who are more or less constantly unemployed, people who are doing nothing. That makes a total of 100 million man-hours a year, man-hours which are simply lost. These are people who lounge about on the streets, people who sit at home, people who simply do nothing. I repeat, Sir&#x2014;100 million man-hours a year. In my view that is a tremendous labour loss in a young, developing country like the Republic of South Africa, a country which is crying out for men, for labourers, skilled or unskilled, in every field. And yet we are faced with the position that that tremendous labour potential remains unexploited. The reason why it remains unexploited cannot be explained in one sentence.</p>

<p>The fact remains that many people simply will not work&#x2014;as Mr. Tom Swartz put it, they are the &#x201C;won&#x2019;t-works&#x201D;. They accept no responsibility towards the country in which they live and the community whose privileges they enjoy. And that while we have to cater for those people in our entire national economy. Because, Sir, the day they become 65 years old, we give them old-age pensions. We give old-age pensions to many people who did preciously little in their lifetime. In my view&#x2014; and I think it is a sound view in a democratic country&#x2014;we shall be compelled, if we want to reach a stage where we may accept responsibility for all our aged people to ensure them of a living once they become 60 or 65 years old, to take into consideration whether they were prepared to do anything during their lifetime of 18 to 60 years&#x2014;65 in the case of men. They must be useful. We provide hospital services for them. Those people enjoy such services more or less free of charge. We provide education services for them. That is one of the problems of South Africa, that the responsibility for a large population is resting on the shoulders of a too small section of the population. Too few people are carrying the burden. In our country too few people have to work hard for too many. On the other hand there are too many people who do next to nothing. I am not saying this in condescension, but in view of what is said by leaders of the Coloured population, I say it is at present one of our problems on the road of progress and the creation of a better future for the Coloured population. There are too many of those people who are maladjusted in relation to normal work. There are too many people who are maladjusted in respect of their elementary obligation to do their fair share in society. This measure is a start, and I am convinced that it is a good start, in creating the machinery and the opportunities for drawing our Coloured youth into a positive development programme.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago I visited the rural areas. There I called at a farm where some Coloureds were working. The work they were doing was not particularly hard, but under their short sleeves I could see their arms, and I told myself that there, at least, we still had workmen with muscles. One could see that they were proud of themselves, of what they were doing. On the other hand, if one looks at the young Coloureds strolling about in the cities and towns, one feels, that it takes six of them to make one man. They have no muscles; they are sloppy; their whole way of walking is slack; they lounge about in the streets with their hands in their pockets, wearing tattered and dirty trousers and shirts. He simply does not know what he wants to do. And on top of that he is hungry. That man does not believe in himself. He finds no place in society because he is not acceptable to any employer. In fact, he is not acceptable to himself. He is a problem to his own parents. If one encounters a person who is physically developed and strong, it is one who is prepared to do something, a man who is useful, a man of potential. The Minister states in this measure that the object of the training of Coloured cadets is to let them take part in physical exercises, sport, drilling exercises, and to teach them to do something. I maintain that from a psychological viewpoint, and also from a sociological viewpoint, this is one of the soundest methods, educational and development methods, to let people find themselves, to let them develop confidence and to make them serviceable. This is a most important step, and for that reason I welcome this Bill.</p>
