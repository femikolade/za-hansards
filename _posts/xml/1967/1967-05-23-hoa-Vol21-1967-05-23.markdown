<heading>Inquiry into Deaths at Umlaas Pipeline</heading>

<question by="#lewis" to="#minister_of_labour">

<num>*8.</num>

<from>Mr. H. LEWIS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the proceedings of the special inquiry into the deaths at the Umlaas pipeline have been completed; if so, what were the findings; if not, when will the findings be available;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement as soon as the findings are available;</li>

<li>(3) whether diving has been permitted to be resumed; if so,</li>

<li>(4) whether he has taken steps to ensure that (a) the apparatus used is suitable and (b) the conditions imposed will be a sufficient safeguard for the lives of the divers.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_labour" to="#lewis">

<from>The MINISTER OF LABOUR:</from>

<p>The reply to the question as a whole is as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">As indicated by me during the debate on the Labour Vote the diving operations as such are not subject to the provisions of the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act but certain equipment used by the divers must conform to requirements laid down in the Regulations under the Act. The Inspector of Machinery in the area concerned is charged with the duty of enforcing the relative requirements and the necessary steps have been taken as far as equipment is concerned. In addition, the employer has agreed to a number of safeguards suggested by the Machinery Inspector in order to eliminate accident risks and has suspended diving operations until it can be determined, in the light of the inquiry, whether further safety measures are necessary.</block>

<block name="quote">The inquiry into the deaths which have occurred is taking place by virtue of the provisions of section 32 of the Act in terms of which the Inspector may inquire into any accident arising from the use of machinery which is defined in the Act to include <i>inter alia</i> pressure vessels or portable gas containers. In the case of a fatal accident the Inspector is in terms of the Act required also to send a copy of the written evidence and his report to the Attorney-General of the Province concerned. It is the Attorney-General&#x2019;s prerogative to decide upon any further action in regard to the accident and I do not consider it proper for me to make any statement on the findings of the Machinery Inspector. Should any action in the form of amending legislation prove necessary in the light of the investigation this will be announced in the usual way.</block>

<block name="quote">The inquiry commenced on the 19th of this month and is expected to last until the 26th.</block>

<p>I may add that on the 18th instant the South African Underwater Union addressed a letter to me in this regard, which I have here and if it is the hon. member&#x2019;s wish I shall, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, read it to the House. It reads as follows: &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir,</block>

<block name="quote">We are disturbed that from local press reports, an apparent effort has been made to make political issue of our urgent approach to Parliament.</block>

<block name="quote">We apologise to you and your Department if our approach has been misconstrued in any way&#x2014;as all we are only basically interested in, is seeing that some form of legislation is eventually introduced to act as a protection to professional divers in the future.</block>

<block name="quote">We have already commended the actions of Mr. Leff&#x2014;the Chief Inspector of Machinery, Durban. Here again we appear to have been misunderstood in that it is quoted in the Press that you should have immediately halted all work on the Collins pipeline project, until the official inquiry is to be held on Friday, 19th May, 1967.</block>

<block name="quote">This was certainly not our request, in that we attended Monday&#x2019;s (15th) urgent meeting called by Mr. Leff, at which all parties present were agreeable that certain basic safety precautions be immediately enforced, so as to enable work to continue on the project.</block>

<block name="quote">We are delighted that Surgeon Commander Pretorius has been appointed to your Commission of Inquiry and know that his subsequent recommendations to Parliament on future diving safety and training regulations, will be of the highest order and completely acceptable to us.</block>

<block name="quote">If you feel it necessary, we would appreciate that you make this letter public in Parliament, in an endeavour to stop a political party issue being made of our genuine attempt to help introduce safety regulations, which we feel may help save the lives of the young men of the Republic.</block>

<block name="quote">In anticipation of your urgent attention in the matter of this future legislation,</block>

<p>I remain,</p>

<block name="quote">Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) TIM CONDON, President.</block>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour, please&#x003F; I want to take the opportunity this afternoon to firstly congratulate the hon. member for Johannesburg (West) on his taking over the portfolio of Mines. It seems fated that the newly elected member to the Cabinet should be burdened with the portfolio of Mines, and it would appear to me, from what has happened in the past few months, that after the next election we will again have another Minister of Mines.</p>

<p>I also want to take this opportunity of making a complaint to the new member of the Cabinet and tell him that if he expects hon. members on this side of the House to take an intelligent interest in the affairs of his Department and if he wants us to make a reasonable contribution to the debate, then I should like him in future to see that when reports are to be tabled they will be tabled well in advance of the Vote that is going to be discussed. I want to point out that in this case particularly it was only over the weekend that we received the report from the Government Mining Engineer. It is very difficult for the members of our group to go through this very long report and be able to come here a day or two later and consider the report satisfactorily.</p>

<p>During the past year it has fortunately been possible for the disputes between the Chamber of Mines and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union to be settled. I want to congratulate the participants in those negotiations that took place on their final settlement. We on this side of the House do not know the details of that settlement, but I think it would be in the interests of those people who are interested in the affairs of the Department if they could have an opportunity of studying the final outcome of the negotiations. It would appear to us that these negotiations were satisfactory and that a final settlement was arrived at. I think it is just as well for the Department to have had this load taken off its shoulders.</p>

<p>The picture that is painted of the mining industry at the moment is a very sombre one. The future of the gold-mining industry as revealed in report after report from the mining <span class="col_6499-6500" refersTo="page_0511"/>houses is perhaps only relieved and brightened by the efforts of the Federation of Mining Unions and the Chamber of Mines to come to an agreement whereby there will be an average increase of 11 per cent in the total earnings of union members who are working on the mines. Certain changes have been designed to make better use of available labour which will result, it is hoped, in greater efficiency and higher productivity. The life of the industry could be prolonged if that is successful. But if these arrangements are not successful then we in South Africa are due for a very serious setback.</p>

<p>According to the Chamber of Mines survey which was prepared for the hon. the Prime Minister through his Economic Advisory Council some very startling figures were revealed. As we know, the price of gold has been fixed for over 30 years at 35 dollars per ounce, which is R25 per ounce in our currency. If there is no increase in this price, and if there is no favourable tax revision then, so this report states, R2,250,000,000 worth of gold will be left underground and will not be exploited, i.e. at 2 per cent increase in inflation. There has been a steady rate of inflation in South Africa and if inflation increases by a further two per cent per annum this figure of R2,250 million worth of gold will rise to R4,250 million. That is the value of the gold that will remain underground.</p>

<p>The search for gold goes on, and if it is considered that in the last 10 years R30 million was spent on the search for gold, and one realizes that of this amount R20 million was unproductive, it shows us in what a parlous state our present gold fields are. It must also be borne in mind that it costs eight times as much to develop a mine to-day as it did in 1930. So the chances of new mines being developed are not very rosy. Investigations show that for a new mine to come into production it would require a recovery of 10 pennyweights per ton to make its development economic. At the moment there are only five mines in the whole of South Africa that exceeds this figure. It means therefore, from the figures that I have given, that the life of the gold-mining industry&#x2014;if there is no inflation at all&#x2014;can last until the year 2015. If there is inflation, and the rate of inflation is 2 per cent per annum, the industry can only last until 1996. If there is a 4 per cent increase in inflation, it can only last until 1989, which is a matter of 12 years.</p>

<p>What about uranium&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>As regards uranium, if there is a 2 per cent rise in costs we will lose R190 million worth of uranium. This will be left in the ground. If there is a 4 per cent rise in costs, we will lose R290 million worth of uranium. It will be unproductive to mine it.</p>

<p>The Government must decide now what plans it is going to make for the future. That is imperative. The hon. the Minister is also in charge of planning. He has to make sure that his future plans include every possible effort to keep the present mines going, to keep them as productive as possible, to see that the price of gold is raised, to see that the costs of production are kept as level as possible. I am perturbed, if these figures are right, about what is going to happen to those towns, particularly in the Free State, which depend entirely on mining activity. If it is going to be the policy of the Minister to take away industry from certain areas and divert them towards the borders of the Bantu homelands, and if he is not going to give due regard to the necessities of the towns which at the moment depend on mining, he is going to be responsible for ghost towns especially in the Free State. It will be said that mining towns such as Springs, Brakpan, Benoni, Nigel, and Krugersdorp, are also dependent on mines for their existence. The difference is that when we were in power we encouraged secondary industries to come to those towns, with the foresight that one day those mines would go out of production. Something had to take their place. I ask the Minister now to tell us what he intends doing in his planning campaign for the next five or 10 years to ensure that these towns do not become ghost towns. I would say to him as well that every eifert must now be made so that new industries can be developed such as are being developed overseas at the moment. I am speaking of those industries which use products from our mines. We are exporting metals and minerals of all kinds. The overseas concerns are using our products. I would suggest to the Minister that those industries which are using our products overseas should be encouraged to develop in our country so that we can compete with them on our own ground on our own terms. We have the essence of such industrial development. We are producing those substances which they do not have. Let us then try to develop those industries here. They will to some extent offset the difficulties which may arise later in the mining industry.</p>

<p>I want to leave that subject now, and say a few words about a topic I know the Minister is very concerned about. We on this side of the House have been discussing this matter in a reasonable atmosphere over the past 10 to 12 years. That is the question of pneumoconiosis. It would appear that during the last five years the position in regard to pneumoconiosis has been settling down. There is a reasonable hope that a better deal will be afforded to the underground worker and to the surface worker who comes into contact with dust. I have been looking at the figures which the Miners Medical Bureau has issued to us. They are very interesting. They show that there has been a steady drop in the number of persons who are affected by pneumoconiosis. If the Minister will look at page 9 of the report for the year 1965-&#x2019;66, he will see that there are 539 cases which have been referred for re-examination. Out of this group of persons, 51 of them were found to have tuberculosis only. Ninety were new cases with pneumoconiosis. <span class="col_6501-6502" refersTo="page_0512"/>Only 12 were re-classified in a higher stage of pneumoconiosis. If you look at the percentage at the end of the column, you will see that only 31 per cent of the total number of persons who were certified, have been re-classified. Of course I cannot doubt these figures, but it seems strange to me that there should be a relatively high number of persons on the mines with tuberculosis, and a relatively low number of persons suffering from pneumoconiosis. I would have thought that it would be the opposite. I would have thought that they would find more cases of pneumoconiosis, because of the new system of classification and examination, than tuberculosis. I think it is a matter which we must keep our eye on. We must see whether or not changes have been taking place on the mines, which have made it safer for the mine worker, or whether this is due to some new method of examination. I want the Minister also to look at page 7. At the top of page 7, it says:</p>

<block name="quote">The very strict standards governing the selection of recruits were relaxed in 1962 because of lack of scientific proof that age, weight and body build influenced the development of pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis, or seriously affected efficiency in a mining career.</block>

<p>I am very perturbed about that. I think that this is the first time that I have read in any report that we should not take into consideration those matters which were strictly adhered to previously, namely age, weight and body build. We were very careful in the past to make sure that when a mine worder went up for an examination, he had to conform to certain standards. Every insurance company in existence places emphasis on the weight, height and body build factors. It is terribly important. I may be wrong. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I do think that this relaxation was only effected because of the scarcity of recruits. To me this is scraping the very bottom of the barrel. If this is the way we are going to get recruits for the mines, I think it is the wrong way, and it ought to be altered immediately. The right way to get recruits is to improve their working conditions and to make their wages and salaries much more attractive. Their conditions of work must be made better. To let people like this go into the industry is, I think, dangerous and unwise. It says here: &#x201C;Because of lack of scientific proof&#x201D;. There could not have been proof because we were always very strict as far as that was concerned. These people were not allowed to go and work there. How could there then have been any proof&#x003F; What we will be able to prove is the sudden rise in the cardio-respiratory conditions following the admission of persons such as are now going to be allowed to enter the industry. I would ask the Minister to take particular notice of that, and to make sure that this paragraph on page 7 in the report is reviewed. If he can possibly get it excluded, we on this side of the House will be very pleased. If it is going to be found impossible to get more recruits by any other means, and he is going to allow these people to come into the industry, then I say to him that he must have two categories of admission, an A category and a B category. The A category will be those persons who reach the standard of physical development as we knew it up to now. Those who are allowed to escape the strict observations that we had previously, should be put into the B category. Those in the B category must have regular examinations whether they like it or not. That must be obligatory. They must be examined at least every six months, and not only see whether the respiratory organs are working but also to see what effect strenuous work has on the cardiac system. I feel that this relaxation that is coming about now is going to be a very expensive item for the Chamber of Mines. They are going to have to pay thousands of rand in compensation as a result of this.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Which paragraph is this&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>If you look on page 7, you will see that the chapter deals with the activities of the Bureau. It starts off with the words:</p>

<block name="quote">The very strict standards governing the selection of recruits were relaxed in 1962.</block>

<p>Other members on this side of the House will be dealing with other matters concerning pneumoconiosis. I just want to say to the Minister that I am also very perturbed by the question of asbestosis. I am not going to go into detail into this matter. The Minister will see in the report that the question of asbestosis which is dealt with on page 119 is quite unsatisfactory. The report of Mr. Wright, Inspector of Mines at Witbank states that:</p>

<block name="quote">More attention has been paid to the following aspects of asbestos dust &#x2026;</block>

<p>He deals with that matter and then he says that the position is still very unsatisfactory. The Minister must please investigate the question of asbestosis. I think that the hon. member for Durban (Central) will deal with that in somewhat more detail.</p>

<p>I want to deal with is the number of accidents rate on the mines. The most important item I want to deal with is the number of accidents that occur as a result of explosives. This is a very important matter. I want to be as brief as possible as far as this is concerned. In 1964 there were 276 accidents and in 1965 there were 318 accidents. That may be connected with the following statement on page 115 of the Report:</p>

<block name="quote">Ammonium nitrate blasting agent. The use of ammonium nitrate blasting agent was extended at the beginning of the year but towards the end it seemed to be <span class="col_6503-6504" refersTo="page_0513"/>losing its popularity. A number of complaints were received from the miners that the blasting agent caused an irritation of the skin and eyes during charging up. On investigation it was found ffiat while loading a certain amount of blow-back occurs, which does irritate the eyes and the skin. Instructions were given for some form of dust-arresting device. Towards the end of the year these complaints ceased and everybody now appears to be quite content with its use. As the holes have to be perfectly dry before charging with the blasting agent, compressed air was used to blow out the holes. A new regulation prohibiting this was promulgated during the year and since then numerous devices for deslodging the holes have been tried.</block>

<p>That is a report by the Inspector of Mines in Johannesburg and the Inspector of mines in Klerksdorp makes similar observations. He goes on to say that the use of this blasting agent has been sharply curtailed. Only two mines are still using it extensively. They are experimenting with new devices. They have been using this substance, ammonium nitrate blasting agent, and this report is for the year ending December, 1965. In the first week of February this year, we passed a Bill permitting the use of ammonium nitrate as a blasting anent. It was used on the mines apparently, from what I can make out, a year or two before permission was granted by Parliament for its use. I may be wrong but if one looks at Hansard (col. 469 of this year), the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs in his Second Reading speech said:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Speaker, as a result of constant research and scientific progress both overseas and in the Republic it is now possible to mix explosives consisting of a mixture of ammonium nitrate and non-explosive component parts at the blasting place where they are needed, for immediate use, with the result that it is no longer necessary in all cases to convey the explosives to the blasting place &#x2026; These modern techniques are actually safer, therefore, and in many cases people prefer them to the conventional methods.</block>

<p>I do not know how it is possible for the Minister to have made that statement in regard to the use of this blasting agent prior to the passing of this Bill in Parliament. I think in this particular case we should have the whole position investigated. I do not know how that sort of thing comes about. It says distinctly that we did have experiments here, but I do not know whether these are the experiments that took place. It may be. but who gave permission for these experiments to take place in all these mines&#x003F; Is it any wonder then that the accident rate in regard to explosives has been going UP&#x003F;</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to ask the hon. Minister, if he can, whether he would be good enough in his reply to give the country some indication as to I what the prospects are for us finding oil in the country, and whether he thinks that it is worth while going on with the tremendous activity that is taking place and what hope and signs there are for finding oil. All of us are praying that oil will be found in this country. I do not know if we are likely to do so. The hon. the Minister will know more about it, and if it is possible to divulge some of the details to this House we will be most grateful and I am sure that the country will be relieved if he can indicate to us that at least there is some hope that oil will be discovered in our country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the hon. member for Rosettenville in the appreciation he expressed of the fact that the monthly-wage agreement had been successfully concluded. I hope and trust that it will be conducive to labour peace and order, but I think we are also indebted to the mediation committee, which performed a gigantic task in order to make these negotiations succeed.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to congratulate the new Minister of Mines on his appointment as Minister of Mines. We believe that his medical background, his knowledge and ability will enable him to implement the Pneumoconiosis Act in such a way that it will give rise to general satisfaction. We know that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s task is not an enviable one, because on the part of the mineworkers there has always been dissatisfaction with the operation of the Pneumoconiosis Bureau. In fact, I expect that with his ability this Minister will succeed in bringing about a mutual spirit of trust between the mineworkers, the Chamber of Mines and the Department of Mines, because I think that this holds the key to a satisfactory solution to all the difficulties. In this regard we also want to convey our appreciation to the previous Minister, who made it possible for a number of members of Parliament to visit the Pneumoconiosis Bureau during the recess. We were really impressed by everything which is being done there. The research project in connection with the prevention of pneumoconiosis and the consequences of pneumoconiosis was indeed a revelation to us. One of the tasks of the Bureau is to determine the effects of working in dust-laden air and the dangers involved in this, as well as to determine how long a person can work in dust-laden air without harmful effects. It is also essential that after-care should be applied, and we were truly impressed by the work done by the research unit in this connection. Visits such as these are not only informative, but I believe they will also create confidence in the Department of Mines and in the new Pneumoconiosis Bureau. The only point of criticism one may perhaps raise is that the reception and waiting rooms at the Bureau have a gloomy atmosphere because of their dark walls, and this is of course not beneficial to a person who thinks that he is suffering from pneumoconiosis. We were assured, however, that the necessary changes would be made in <span class="col_6505-6506" refersTo="page_0514"/>the new building, and we hope that a more cheerful atmosphere will be created in the reception rooms. Sir, pneumoconiosis is and remains a frightening disease. Fortunately, as the hon. member for Rosettenville also said, the incidence of the disease has decreased remarkably in recent years. This is attributable, of course, to the new development methods which are employed and also to the preventive measures which are taken to ensure that there is not so much dust present in the air. Nowadays it is not unusual to meet a person who worked in the mines all his life without contracting pneumoconiosis. In the old days, when we still referred to miners&#x2019; phthisis and not to pneumoconiosis, one was actually marked for this disease the day one started working on the mines. Nevertheless one should, when dealing with a mineworker, treat him with the utmost circumspection. One should show interest in him without pitying him unnecessarily. He must be treated sympathetically, because pneumoconiosis also has a psychological aspect which has to be taken into account. It is therefore essential that there should be the closest co-operation and mutual trust between the Department of Mines, the trade unions and the Chamber of Mines. Mutual trust and co-operation must be created between them in order that the suspicion and distrust which are frequently aroused unjustly against the Bureau may be avoided and removed. It is a fact that there has always been dissatisfaction among the miners as regards pneumoconiosis and the compensation payable in respect of it. In 1962 the Pneumoconiosis Act was revised in this House, and many improvements were effected to the Act, and one expected and hoped that this would result in great satisfaction among the miners. On the contrary, however, it resulted in great dissatisfaction, and a campaign was launched against the implementation of that Act, which was deplorable. The Mineworkers&#x2019; Union then pleaded for a new approach in respect of pneumoconiosis. The Chamber of Mines and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union then produced the so-called new scheme. The premise or basis of the new scheme was the principle that pneumoconiosis compensation was a matter for negotiation and bargaining between the employer and the employee, and that the State should not be involved in it. The previous Minister of Mines then referred this scheme to the Silke Commission, who inquired into the whole scheme. As we expected, the Silke Commission rejected the new scheme and stated most unequivocally that certifying and compensation in respect of pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis of miners working in dust-laden air should remain the responsibility of the State. In my opinion, however, there were nevertheless two aspects in this new approach which merited attention. The first is the patient-family doctor relationship, on which the Silke Commission made a recommendation, and the second is the principle of combining a pension scheme and pneumoconiosis compensation in order to make one payment. We know that on a previous occasion the Government had a draft Bill in this connection, and I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that the Chamber of Mines and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union have now also accepted this principle, whether he will not try to effect a compromise between these two schemes, the one proposed by them and the one devised by us, in order to be able to provide better compensation to a mineworker if he has to leave the mines. The Silke Commission published a report on the question of the patient-family doctor relationship, and I shall deal with that at somewhat greater length, but in the time available to me I cannot elaborate any further on the principle of combining pneumoconiosis compensation and a pension scheme. In the time available to me I would just like to mention briefly that the Silke Commission made certain recommendations which most certainly merit attention. From the report it appears that there are certain provisions in the present Act which caused dissatisfaction among the miners. The commission found that there were certain factors which gave rise to dissatisfaction among the miners, firstly the relationship between doctor and patient, and secondly the ineffectual liaison between groups of employers, groups of employees, the Department of Mines and, thirdly, certification standards and the concept of pneumoconiosis as a disease. The commission concluded its report with these significant words:</p>

<p>The commission has refrained from commenting on matters not mentioned in its terms of reference but would nevertheless suggest that various relevant matters dealt with by witnesses in their evidence before the commission enjoy the attention of the Department of Mines as soon as possible.</p>

<p>These are the matters which they requested should enjoy attention, and we should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether these matters have already enjoyed the attention of the Department, because we believe that if proper attention is devoted to these matters it will create confidence and distrust will be eliminated, in order that there may be a satisfied and contented mineworkers&#x2019; community.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Permit me to thank the two hon. members who have just spoken for their congratulations to me. The hon. member for Virginia did not qualify his congratulations, but the hon. member for Rosettenville did, with the qualification that he was certain that after the next election there would be a new Minister of Mines in this House. Well, I do not know what plans the hon. the Prime Minister entertains as far as the portfolio is concerned, but I want to assure the hon. member that if I am spared I shall be back as the member for Johannesburg (West), and I may also add that I think Johannesburg (West) may distribute some of its strong sections among the surrounding constituencies to reinforce them. I hope that hon. <span class="col_6507-6508" refersTo="page_0515"/>member will still be here, if in the following five years he will behave as he did this afternoon. With reference to his remark, I cannot refrain from just making this observation. I have been away for three and a half years, and if my memory serves me correctly there were 53 members on that side when I left, and now I count 39 members. The hon. member should therefore not try to write me off as far as the next election is concerned, but I thank him because I know that his congratulations were sincere, notwithstanding the humour which he added and which is typical of him. I also thank the hon. member for Virginia. I think I have now disposed of the congratulations and thanks, except that in his absence I want to thank my predecessor, the present Minister of Economic Affairs. I want to convey my appreciation to him for the period he acted as Minister before I arrived in the country and also afterwards, up to and including 3rd May, when the election claimed so much of one&#x2019;s time. I am particularly grateful to him for the attention he devoted to these Departments while he himself had to take over a new Department.</p>

<p>Then there is just a third point which I feel duty-bound to correct in the House. After my arrival from London there were several reports in newspapers, some correct and others, incorrect, which stated that I had said at the airport that if I could choose I would not have chosen Mines and Planning. I want to correct this. I said exactly the opposite. I said that it was not for anybody to choose which portfolios should be assigned to him, but if I could choose I could hardly have made a better choice. I say this here specifically in order that hon. members who come into contact with me, and also my officials and other concerns such as the Chamber of Mines, the mine-workers and those who are concerned with the general planning of the country, should not get the impression that they are dealing with an unwilling horse of a Minister. For that reason I just want to put this right and say that I was very pleased and that I could hardly have made a better choice if the choice had been mine.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville also mentioned the question of the Government Mining Engineer&#x2019;s Report, which was tabled a few days before this discussion took place today. May I say that there has been a tremendous backlog in years gone by, as the hon. member knows, in regard to tabling this particular report. But we have been fortunate in overcoming certain staff shortages and also certain printing problems, so that we were able to table the 1965 Report, which is now before the Committee, and we also hope to be able to table the 1966 Report during this Session still. So that we will catch up on the backlog there has been in past years. In all fairness, I should also like to point out that although the hon. member referred to the report of the Government Mining Engineer, there is this other report from the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau, which is up to date. The 1966 Report is the one being quoted from now. The hon. member. and also the hon. member for Virginia, referred to the settlement in the gold mining industry. I think we should couple with that also the coal mines. I am extremely grateful that matters have developed up to the stage where to-day we have a reasonable settlement. But may I in this respect point out that the Minister of Labour and the Committee he appointed have been largely responsible for the negotiations, and I think that the Chamber would also like to put on record our sincere appreciation to the three gentlemen who served on this Committee for the work they did, and also to the miners and the Gold Producers&#x2019; Association. May I say in this respect that I think the results they have achieved are in a large measure also due to the fact that we as politicians have refrained from saying too much about the whole matter. I, for my part, since I have been Minister of Mines, have not said a single word because I feel that this is a matter between the employees and the Gold Producers&#x2019; Association. I think we have served a good purpose by not in our public utterances referring to this particular issue, and I hope that during this debate we will refrain from doing so, except for what has been said up to now.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the price of gold and the statement made by the President of the Chamber of Mines a few days ago. Now, I have not had discussions with the Chamber of Mines. It is my intention to have very full discussions in the recess, but I would like to point out that all of us, including the President of the Chamber of Mines, ought to be very, very careful not to paint too dark a picture of the gold mining industry, or to speculate in this regard; because, as the hon. member perhaps does not know, the Chamber has submitted for consideration by the Economic Advisory Council a full report on the present situation together with certain proposals. This report and the proposals are being studied at the moment by the Economic Advisory Council, and in the meantime of course the Government is continuing its assistance to mines. Hon. members are familiar with these measures which the Government has taken. I would like to suggest that whilst the Economic Advisory Council is considering this report and the proposals, it would be unwise for me to disclose what these proposals are. I repeat that I think one must be extremely careful, and especially people in high places like the President of the Chamber of Mines, not to paint too dark a picture of the gold mining industry. One can easily play with figures. That reminds me of the story of the hundred workers, males, who were working somewhere in South Africa and there were two elderly ladies looking after them and doing their cooking, and then, as happens all over the world, one of these workers decided to marry one of the ladies. The man in the office was not content with reporting to head office that one of the workers was marrying <span class="col_6509-6510" refersTo="page_0516"/>one of the housekeepers; he thought he would make it a little more attractive and wrote a report saying that 1 per cent of the workers was marrying 50 per cent of the housekeepers. One therefore has to be careful in playing with figures. I would not like to say more about this, except to say that one is of course very much aware of the difficulties of the marginal mines, and although the question of the price of gold is entirely a matter for the hon. the Minister of Finance, as hon. members know, it has always struck me as rather peculiar that South Africa, which produces 70 per cent of the gold of the free world, which is the basis of the whole economy of the free world, should have to subsidise certain of the mines producing that gold.</p>

<p>It seems to me so wrong that a relatively small country like South Africa subsidises 70 per cent of the basis of the economy of the free world. I leave it at that because, as I say, it is a matter for the Minister of Finance, and, as hon. members know, the question of the price of gold is receiving the continual attention of the Government and other interested bodies.</p>

<p>*There have also been references to pneumoconiosis and asbestosis. I shall reply to that later, because I know that there are other hon. members who also want to speak on that.</p>

<p>But I feel that it is nevertheless my duty to make a statement here in connection with the search for mineral oil, to which the hon. member as well as the hon. member for Virginia referred. I should therefore like to report to the House on the progress and the present position of the search for oil in the Republic. As far as I can, I also want to report on the financial implications, in which this House will be interested.</p>

<p>Two years ago, on 12th January, 1965, Soekor was founded at the request of the State, and on 1st May of that year it came into being with the appointment of the general manager. Six months later four local diamond drills started the first boreholes in the search for oil. These drills were located in accordance with existing geological knowledge and on the advice of the Geological Survey Division, which is a branch of the Department, as you know, which serves as technical advisers to Soekor, and of overseas oil geologists whom private oil companies and the Geological Survey Division appointed in the past as consultants to investigate the possibilities of oil in the Republic. Approximately a year ago the first great imported oil drill started operating on Kareebosch, in the Murraysburg district. It is the drill which was commonly referred to as the &#x201C;Scottish drill&#x201D;. This drill started drilling operations and in January of this year the second imported oil drill of a French company was started by the hon. the Prime Minister on the farm Weltevrede in the Aliwal North district. Both these drills are rotation drills. The drilling sites were chosen on the basis of the latest knowledge available at the time when those drilling operations startel. So far three holes have been completed, two diamond drill boreholes in the Fraserburg and Victoria West districts, and one rotation drill borehole at Kareebosch. Drilling operations are still in progress in four places, with two diamond drills and two rotation drills. At the moment the position is that rotation drill No. 1 is on Skietfontein in the Aberdeen district. It has reached a depth of 2,900 ft. Rotation drill No. 2 is on Weltevrede in the Aliwal North district, and has reached a depth of 8,785 ft. Diamond drill No. 1 is on Sambokkraal at Laingsburg, and has reached a depth of 12,770 ft., and the second diamond drill, on Klipdrift at Sutherland, has reached a depth of 11,350 ft. Further sites for drilling are at present being located intensively and scientifically.</p>

<p>I offer the House a somewhat detailed statement of Soekor in respect of drilling activities, as it may be stated unequivocally that the ultimate location of oil sources can be achieved only through drilling, and because drilling activities comprise at least half of the total expenditure. The whole point I am trying to make is that with our present knowledge it is only by means of drilling that one can determine finally whether or not there is in fact oil in paying quantities.</p>

<p>The three completed boreholes did not produce oil or gas of any significance, but did in fact yield valuable information, and the new knowledge will play an important part in Soekor&#x2019;s further exploration programme. I must emphasize that we are only at the beginning of our search. There are approximately 200,000 sq. miles of sedimentary rock on land which justify testing, and with regard to which we have extremely little geological knowledge. The first three dry holes must therefore by no means be regarded as a criterion for our expectations of oil. In two years&#x2019; time Soekor has established a dynamic organization. I think hon. members will agree with me that the search for oil and everything related to it is such a great and complex matter that Soekor truly deserves the gratitude of this House and of the country for what they have achieved within the period of two years. In addition I should also like to mention that some 20 qualified geologists and geo-physicists of the Geological Survey Division are taking an active part in the search for oil in support of Soekor. Over and above drilling the most comprehensive and expensive aid to the programme are the four imported seismic teams, two of which are British and two French. In the final instance these seismic teams approve those places which are indicated by the other geologists, geo-physicists and geo-chemical technicians as sites of promising oil-geological interest, before drilling is undertaken at such places. Soekor is not the only oil prospecting concessionary in the Republic. I should like to place the emphasis on the prospecting&#x2014;as yet it is not mining for oil&#x2014;also as regards our people outside. At present there are ten ether concerns which hold oil prospecting <span class="col_6511-6512" refersTo="page_0517"/>rights in the interior, and of these five have agreements of active co-operation with Soekor, to their mutual benefit. Soekor&#x2019;s original prospecting area comprised approximately 100,000 sq. miles. At present Soekor has a mandate over approximately 150,000 sq. miles in the interior, over the continental shelf, i.e. the sea areas, which comprise approximately 65,000 sq. miles, and over the Transkei. Soekor must be regarded as a catalyst and as the co-ordinating body which brings about the desired uniformity in participation by technically qualified and economically strong companies. In this regard I also want to refer to Soekor&#x2019;s successful attempt in respect of sub-letting on the continental shelf. This is the sea area. In February, 1966, the Government decided to extend the search for oil to the sea areas of the Republic, and this task was entrusted to Soekor. Because Soekor could not explore the areas on its own in view of limited funds&#x2014; because sea exploration is approximately five times more expensive than land exploration &#x2014;a shortage of trained manpower and technical experience, the area which, as I said, comprises approximately 65,000 sq. miles, was subdivided into eleven exploration blocks. Qualified and financially strong exploration companies were approached to take part in the search, and here it is a pleasure to be able to say that Soekor received no fewer than 44 applications for these blocks. The blocks were finally allocated to ten companies, including eight of the world&#x2019;s biggest oil companies, of which four are united in one consortium. For the past ten months Soekor has been finalizing contracts. Our mining legislation had to be adjusted, and as hon. members know these amendments were passed by this House in March of this year. Our Income Tax Act had to be reviewed and the necessary legislation will be before the House shortly. This attention had to be given to numerous facets, for example fisheries, shipping, marketing, customs regulations, divisional control, etc. In the process virtually every Government Department has been consulted. These consultations have now been concluded. The companies are ready, and as soon as all the necessary legislation has been passed, I shall have the contracts finalized. Operations will then commence immediately.</p>

<p>Soekor has also succeeded in arousing the interest of local groups, groups in the Republic who have certain convictions as far as oil is concerned and who are prepared to put these convictions to the test by way of financial expenditure. Hon. members will know how many people there are with divergent views on the matter of oil. But I am now referring to those who are prepared to bear them out and to proceed with their own financial expenditure. Agreements have been concluded with three groups holding prospecting rights &#x2014;and by this I mean more specifically drilling rights&#x2014;from Soekor in areas of a hundred or two hundred square miles, respectively. Two of these areas are situated in the Free State and another in the Transvaal. Apart from these companies three other groups have approached Soekor for similar prospecting rights. Other foreign groups are at present assessing inland areas with a view to possible participation in the search for oil.</p>

<p>The search for oil is an expensive and lengthy process, but it is essential that it should also be seen in its proper perspective. The annual expenditure in foreign exchange on the importation of oil products borders on the R100 million mark. That is what it is costing us in foreign exchange. If Soekor therefore spends an average amount of from R5 million to R7 million annually on a search for oil, it cannot be regarded as exorbitant. As far as overseas companies are concerned, I want to assure hon. members, the House and the public outside that clauses were included in the prospecting lease contracts and that the possibility was provided for in the mining lease that if oil was discovered, the Republic&#x2019;s interest would be fully safeguarded. These people advanced vast sums of money, and for that reason we cannot impose demands on them which will deter them. But I want to give the assurance, without going into details&#x2014; which would be unwise in any event&#x2014;that it is a matter of serious concern to the Government that the Republic&#x2019;s interests should be safeguarded if oil is discovered on a large scale. As hon. members know, R14 million has been made available through the Strategic Minerals Fund. There are indications that this provision will not be adequate to complete the drilling programme, that is, to the end of the period for which these large oil drills will be available to South Africa. I think this period extends to somewhere in 1969. For that reason more money will have to be made available to Soekor. Subject to certain reservations, it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to complete at least the present phase of the search for oil. I want to give the assurance that Soekor is very much aware of the fact&#x2014;it was impressed upon them&#x2014;that where large sums of money are handled there must be no wastage or unnecessary expenditure of public funds. But it is in the interests of the country that we complete this drilling programme, at least up to 1969. After that we shall have to take a new decision on the matter.</p>

<p>I presume hon. members would want to know why more funds have to be made available. It should be borne in mind that the two drills cost some R3 million each, while the expenditure in connection with the seismic work undertaken by the four teams to whom I have already referred and who have to point out the final drilling sites, comes to approximately R1 million a team per annum. As I have said, there are four teams afield in order to keep ahead of the drills. This is the reason why more money is now needed, something which we could not foresee; mainly because the work was commenced with at a relatively late stage and the first drill, which was to go down to approximately 16,000 feet, struck the pre-Cambrian stratum at a depth of about <span class="col_6513-6514" refersTo="page_0518"/>8,000 feet and had to be employed elsewhere as soon as possible. I mention these things in order that hon. members may appreciate that on the basis of the knowledge available at the stage when these drills were taken into service it was thought that they would go down to a depth of 16,000 feet. It has now been found that they drill more rapidly and not as far down as was originally thought on the basis of all available technical and geological knowledge. For that reason the seismic teams now have to work at a greater pace and more extensively, and drilling has to be done in places where the maximum amount of knowledge is not available in order to determine the possible results. But I want to repeat that although we are going to complete this programme in the interests of South Africa, there will be no wastage of money. In the light of the strategic importance and the economic independence of the Republic I want to assure the House that my Department and I and also Soekor will persevere industriously in the search for oil on land and at sea, in order to give the critical answer as soon as possible to the question of whether or not the Republic has oil resources. I think South Africa should be prepared to pay if we want to know whether or not we have oil.</p>

<p>I think I have now disposed of this matter &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>We appreciate the fact that the Minister has given us such a lengthy explanation in regard to our prospecting for oil. I do not think there is anything we on this side of the House can add except to say that we certainly hope we shall find oil. We are also glad that a number of outside firms are sharing the costs of this venture and whether oil is found inland or on the continental shelf we shall be glad to know that oil has been found. I should also like to congratulate the Minister on his maiden speech as a Minister in this House. I want to tell him in all sincerity that although he may be the junior Minister in the Cabinet he has in his charge one of the most important portfolios at this particular moment, a portfolio which is going to become increasingly important as the years go by.</p>

<p>Last year I dealt fully with the question of marginal mines or marginal ore, as I prefer to call it. I dealt with the mines that had already been forced to close down as well as those that we foresaw would have to be closed down in the foreseeable future. I also dealt with the volume of gold that was being left in the ground. We noted the help that was being given by the Government by way of grants for pumping, loans against losses and allowing amalgamations of certain mines, and other measures. In the reply of the debate last year the then hon. Minister of Mines said the Chamber of Mines had been asked for proposals on how marginal mines could be kept going and how marginal ore could be assisted. He did not want to say anything further until this report had come to hand. Well, part of this report is now available and although the report contains no proposals it has some very interesting things to report. I think the hon. the Minister has either said too little or too much when he talked about speculating with figures. I do not know now whether the hon. Minister means that we are not to take the Chamber of Mines&#x2019; figures as authentic and as being of value.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I was speaking to the hon. member for Rosettenville.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>So we can start a new discussion. I had a client once with whom I was doing business. Every morning when I saw him and talked to him about what we had discussed the previous day he used to say that that was yesterday and that we should start again to-day. So the hon. the Minister and I can start <i>de novo.</i> That is fair enough. The hon. the Minister also said that he could not understand why we as a gold-producing country had to subsidize goldmines. I agree with him. I cannot understand why we only get 35 dollars for an ounce of gold. I cannot understand it either, but unfortunately we are not the ones who make the decisions. Therefore, although we cannot understand, we have to accept, because these are some of the facts of life. There is one point in this appraisal which I believe to be of the utmost importance. That is where it says that South Africa is as dependent as ever on its gold production, that reliance on gold production cannot continue indefinitely and that secondary industries, aided by primary industries, must eventually take over from declining goldmines. This is not a new thesis. This is what we said to this House last year. I am going to be immodest enough to quote from the speech I made last year (Hansard, Vol. 18, Col. 3459):</p>

<block name="quote">Form what we know it seems that for the next four or five years we can expect gold production to increase by approximately 12 per cent by 1970. but thereafter it is expected that a steady decline will take place. <span class="col_6515-6516" refersTo="page_0519"/>Unless of course, as has happened in the past, new gold-fields are discovered, or some revolutionary means is found whereby production can be increased at no extra cost. But time is running out for us to change our base from mining to industrial production, particularly in so far as our exports are concerned. &#x2026; It is clear that gold is the driving force in our entire economy, but its steam in the engine of our progress is beginning to run somewhat dry.</block>

<p>These views are reinforced by what we read in this report. The problem of the gold mining industry, or of gold in this country is very much like the problem of inflation. People just do not believe that gold is ever not going to be produced in this country. We have got used to it. We have had four crises in the gold industry. We have had devaluations, we have had increases in the price of gold, we have had new mines being discovered. Each time we have had what we may call a fortunate escape. Four times lucky is four times lucky, Sir, and we have to appreciate the fact that although our gold production will rise within the next few years, it is thereafter likely to come down. If by some <i>casus fortuitus</i> the price of gold should go up, or new goldmines should be discovered, or processes should be discovered which will make it cheaper to mine gold, we shall raise our hands in thankfulness, but we cannot expect it. I hope the hon. the Minister in handling his Department will deal with the matter on the basis that these things will not happen. If they happen, good luck to him. We shall be the first to cheer with him.</p>

<p>Some of the problems in regard to new goldmines have been pointed out by the hon. member for Rosettenville. It is interesting to find from the Chambers&#x2019; report that, on the basis of pennyweight per ton in respect of most of the old mines on the Rand, few mines would have been opened with costs as they are today. This is an interesting factor we must remember. History is past. The days of the 188s are gone. We are now living in the 1960s. Gold mining is still the largest single industry in this country. It provides the base on which our other industries are being built, figures are given as to when we are likely to end gold production in this country. I do not want to use those figures again, but I want to point out one very important thing. One is apt to say that gold production will end in the year 2015, if there is no inflation, which of course is an impossibility.</p>

<p>If the production of gold ceases in the year 2000, to settle for an intermediary figure, it does not mean that we have got until the year 2000 to deal with this problem, because the production of gold will drop at the rate of about a third of the production for each third of the period. We will find ourselves in 1975 with half our production gone. This is the aspect of which we must be mindful. We have not got until the year 2000 because there will be a decline all the time unless other factors come to our aid. I think that what one has to realize is that the production of gold affects every single person in this country. I hope that this debate on mining will be treated in that light so that we will not have some of the discussions which we have had in the past about what the gold-mining companies are doing and the taxation that they should be paying, etc. Gold is the wealth from which we operate. It is the base on which we are building, but our building is going very slowly because we have problems in our building.</p>

<p>We have inflation and we cannot expand at the rate we would like to. Yet we all know that industrial production has eventually got to take over from gold. We need time. That is our greatest problem because every single person, the farmer, the industrialist and the worker, everybody in this country depends upon the production of gold for a great deal of his well being. The usual clich&#x00E9; that one uses is: Export or die! I am going to suggest to the hon. the Minister that in the face of the situation which is likely to develop after the next five years, the clich&#x00E9; we may have to use is: Mine more gold, or die! Because gold is what keeps our economy turning. The change from a mining economy to an industrial economy is very difficult. It is by no means easy. The mines are the people who are buying a great deal of the production of all our factories. If you take that away, the base is gone and the problem remains. This is what we must achieve: Mining first, industry thereafter. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, discussed the problem of a wasting asset, such as the gold-mining industry, in a very level-headed way. I just want to ask him that he should perhaps be a little more positive in his approach in the sense that he, as an expert in that field, should be specific in suggesting to us exactly what he expects from the Government. Exactly what does he expect us to do in this regard&#x003F; In what way must we accommodate the mining industry as such&#x003F; I know that the hon. member&#x2019;s time has expired and I accept that he will speak a second time in order to put that to us. The Estimates we have before us at present, clearly prove that assistance is being rendered to marginal mines, which is, for instance, one of the means by which we are trying to help them. The increase in expenditure for one year amounts to R1,124,000. Therefore the amount that was spent last year has been more than doubled within one year.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>No. The hon. member is throwing up his hands. I quite understand. I say that in the form of assistance to marginal mines, the State itself does as much as it possibly can. It doubled its expenditure in this regard within one year. Name me another Vote where expenditure has been doubled this year. We do not want to say that it is wrong. We do not want to say that the matter should not receive attention. Therefore I want the hon. member to tell us more explicitly where the assistance has to come from if we have the need for it.</p>

<p>I want to address a few words to the hon. the Minister. He has already been welcomed in his new capacity and therefore I shall not repeat it. I just want to tell him that on behalf of the Randfontein constituency I want to extend to him a word of cordial thanks for his personal interest during his visit to the sinkholes in and around Westonaria. By doing that he immediately showed the inhabitants of that town and everybody that he takes a personal interest, because he took the trouble to see for himself what is happening there. I know that the community there has the greatest confidence in him; they are confident that this problem, over which we actually have no control, will receive all his personal attention, and that he is prepared to go to all lengths to ease this problem for those people as much as possible and to take the necessary steps to obtain compensation for those who need it. That is my first point.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention is the question of pneumoconiosis compensation. The Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act of 1962 was passed and the undertaking was given at the time&#x2014;and this is the way we made it known to the electorate outside&#x2014;that this Act would serve as a basis and that it would be reviewed from time to time and that the bottle-necks would be eliminated. There are a few bottle-necks that I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister on this occasion. The first bottle-neck is in connection with section 94 (1) of the 1962 Act. That section provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total amount of any pension awarded under this Act to any person in respect of pneumoconiosis or pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis, shall not exceed the amount of such person&#x2019;s monthly earnings: Provided that for the purpose of determining the total amount of the pension to which a miner is entitled, there shall be added the amount of R15.</block>

<p>In the Act the concept &#x201C;monthly earnings&#x201D; is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Monthly earnings&#x201D; means the average wage or one-sixth of the wage he earned during the previous 156 shifts.</block>

<p>I want to bring a specific case to the notice of the hon. the Minister in order to illustrate my point. There are three such cases in my constituency, and I understand that in the entire country there are only 133 such persons left who are affected by this specific section. Persons who left the mines in the thirties and in the early forties earned monthly earnings of between R60 and R65 at that stage. The Act provides that the total amount awarded to any person in the form of pneumoconiosis compensation may not exceed his maximum monthly earnings plus R15; that is, the maximum pension these people may receive under this Act is R75 a month, but some of these people qualify purely on health grounds for this stage of pneumoconiosis, namely more than 75 per cent respiratorial impairment, and under this Act such a mine-worker, with a wife and three children, would be entitled to R105 a month, but in terms of this specific section he may not receive more than R75 a month. Mr. Chairman, we know that there are certain problems and that this matter is also connected with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and with labour legislation, but, surely, we cannot compare the value of money in the thirties and forties with the value of money at present. Since then the value of money has decreased considerably, and I think that the correct technical way of remedying this position is to increase this R15 for which the Act already makes provision&#x2014; which appears to me to be a sort of adjustment for the reduced purchasing-power of money&#x2014;to a reasonable amount, if we do have to retain the principle that the compensation any person receives in the form of a pension, may not exceed his original maximum wage. I think that this is a reasonable request, and since this provision only affects 133 of these unfortunate people and the financial implications are not exceedingly great, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to devote his personal attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The second matter I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister is the following:</p>

<p>The report of the Silk Commission was made available at the end of the session last year. The then Minister of Mines pointed out that it was impossible to study that report fully at that stage, along with the recommendations contained therein, particularly the recommendation in regard to increasing pheumoconiosis pensions. At that time he also announced a general increase of 20 per cent in the pneumoconiosis compensation and he undertook to study the implications of the Silk Commission fully during the recess, and that he would then have actuarial calculations made as to what the exact situation was. and that subsequent to that, in the light of the facts that would appear from a study of that report, a further adjustment would be made if the 20 per cent were not enough and, if the 20 per cent appeared to be enough, that he would then make a statement to that effect. I should just like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is in a position at present to tell <span class="col_6519-6520" refersTo="page_0521"/>us, after a thorough examination of the report of the Silk Commission, that the mine-worker may expect a further increase in his pension this year or next year, and whether, as a result of the recommendations made by the Silk Commission, he regards the 20 per cent that was awarded last year, as sufficient.</p>

<p>The third point I should like to raise also concerns the question of pneumoconiosis, and that is the certification of mine-workers. We who are dealing with mine-workers in our constituencies every day, appreciate the problems these people have. They go to the Pneumoconiosis Bureau for an examination and that examination is done very thoroughly&#x2014; as we learnt from the report and as we also noticed during our visit to the Bureau last year&#x2014;but to the mine-worker himself nothing is said on that occasion. He is not at all informed about the result of the examination; he does not have the vaguest idea of what is happening. He returns to the mine with a sort of resistance to the Bureau; he has been examined thoroughly by them; he passed through the Bureau like a number and when he arrived at the other end, they did not tell him anything, and he knows that in two or three weeks&#x2019; time he will receive a letter informing him that there is nothing wrong with him. That is the general attitude adopted by the mine-worker. I do not want to suggest that the doctors who are doing the examinations there do not act humanely, but I nevertheless want to ask if it is not possible for the doctors to be more talkative while they examine the mine-workers, and whether it is not possible for the patient-doctor relationship there to be a little more intimate. The impression the mine-worker gains, is that he is regarded as a number and that the doctor adopts this attitude: &#x201C;I must examine number so and so now, and I must still examine a further 20 cases to-day.&#x201D; The mine-worker gains the impression that the examination is carried out as quickly as possible. I am not saying that this is the case. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not explain to him why the doctors do not talk more to the miners when they examine them. He will get that much better from the hon. the Minister who is peculiarly well qualified to give him the reasons.</p>

<p>I want to add my congratulations to the hon. the Minister on his appointment, and I do so particularly because he was kind enough, when I made my maiden speech in this House, to congratulate me, and I hope that in congratulating him I have more reason to do so than he had on that occasion when he congratulated me.</p>

<p>I want to move away from the general outlook which has run through this debate so far and I want to refer in particular to the diseases which afflict miners, the chief occupational diseases, pheumoconiosis and tuberculosis.</p>

<p>As far as tuberculosis is concerned, one can say that roughly about 50 cases a year during the last five years have occurred in miners who entered the mines with a clean bill of health. In other words, these men contracted the disease after the initial examination. I am not saying that they contracted the disease in the mine but they acquired it after starting work in the mines, and I think one can assume that a certain proportion of these 50 men did actually acquire it in the mine. I think that every effort is being made at the present time to prevent miners with active tuberculosis from entering the mines, and I think with a great deal of success, but it is evident that somewhere along the line there is a breakdown in preventing miners from acquiring this disease during their working life. I suggest to the hon. the Minister that he must now change his outlook as far as the bureau is concerned. While the bureau must continue with its present efforts and continue to use the methods which they adopt at present, I feel that it should consider whether there is not a new outlook to-day as far as tuberculosis is concerned. He will find, if he asks the co-operation of the Government adviser on tuberculosis, that in the last two years the anti-tuberculosis programme of the country has been modified to this extent that the Department is using immunological methods in the hope of preventing the development of tuberculosis. Already tuberculosis is largely under control among the white population and it is hoped by this method that further control will be obtained over the non-White population who are so susceptible to the disease. This is the introduction of B.C.G. injections to immunize patients who are tuberculin negative.</p>

<p>The Department of Health has found that there is no longer any need for pre-testing these patients. It has found that B.C.G. will change the outlook altogether for many of these patients. It may be able to reduce the number of miners who contract the disease, particularly among the Bantu. There is a new method of giving the injection which is being carried out by the Department, and so far the results are most promising. Last year the Government adviser on tuberculosis was able to obtain R5,000 from the Department for the purchase of this vaccine, and this year I see from the Estimates that the Department is purchasing R80,000 worth of this vaccine. In other words, they are now convinced of the value of this vaccine and of its harmlessness. I ask that the Minister should consider this with a fresh mind. I want him also to look upon the question of pneumoconiosis in a different light from that of his predecessors. He comes to us with a fresh mind, a mind which to some extent has been trained in this type of observation, whereas his predecessors have all been tied to their advisers. I want him to deal with the advice of his advisers in a new light. I refer to the fact that the engineers have reduced the dust content and improved the ventilation of the mines as far as possible <span class="col_6521-6522" refersTo="page_0522"/>There may still be refinements, but on the whole they will not get very much further. I refer particularly to the asbestos mine, where the outlook is extremely grave. The latest figures I have from some years back were that, roughly, the average working life of a miner in an asbestos mine was about seven years, whereas in the quartz mines and the gold mines the average was about 20 years. Can we perhaps find some method to protect these people&#x003F; I know that one of the predecessors of the hon. the Minister sent medical men overseas to study this question, and particularly to study the question of aluminium substitution in the case of the gold mines. He was kind enough to let me see the report he received, and his advisers reported unfavourably. But I have examined the evidence and the literature and I am convinced that in this country we ought to give the matter a trial I have found that, firstly, the aluminium is easily administered. It is in a fine dust form and it is pumped into the changing rooms of the miners in such a fine form that they cannot see it. It is harmless. They breathe it for about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I have not much time left, but I would like to say that the American College of Chest Physicians recommend the use of this substance and the German Mining Institute in Westphalia has carried out experimental work and recommends it, and the mine which uses it mostly, a mine which employs 1,100 miners all the time, about 900 of whom are exposed, has 200 miners who have worked for 30 years and still show no sign of silicosis. Since they have used this aluminium, excluding those who worked there before aluminium was used, there has been, in some 16 years, no new case of silicosis. It seems to me that here is a cheap method and one which probably would be the saving of the asbestos mines, because if asbestos goes on as it is doing, costing the lives of people through cancer and a high incidence of silicosis, there must come a time when the people of this country will say that we will no longer mine asbestos.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>I can agree with many of the points raised by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, and it will be worthwhile to investigate those various points. But permit me, Sir, also to congratulate our new Minister of Mines. I am doing so because I represent one of the biggest, if not the biggest, mining constituencies in this House. More or less 11,000 of my voters are connected with the mines, and I am grateful for being able to convey the congratulations of my voters to our new Minister. I want to wish him a very successful career.</p>

<p>I agree with other hon. members who said that the problem at present, the danger the mine-workers see and feel once they go underground, is pneumoconiosis. In the past there were many problems in the mining industry. There were difficult circumstances. We are aware of the problems and unrest that prevailed recently, and we are grateful that that unrest has now come to an end. You will permit me, Sir, also to thank the Minister of Labour for having assisted, by means of his mediating committee, in settling those disputes amongst the workers in both the gold mines and the coal mines in such a way that we have peace and calm to-day. As I have said, pneumoconiosis is a disease which is feared by every person who works in the mines, and the 1962 Act makes provision for us to review that Act.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister to appoint a commission to inquire once again into all the aspects of this Act, but in this case to consult all the trade unions in the mining industry as well, so that we may obtain the co-operation of those people in order to see whether there is a possibility of our solving this matter once and for all in the foreseeable future. Since 1910 this Act has virtually been reviewed every year, but discontent amongst the mine-workers remains. The main reason for this is the fact that the mine-worker does not understand it very clearly. It is not made very clear to him. It is as the hon. member for Randfontein said. One passes through the medical bureau, but the necessary contact between the mine-worker and the medical staff does not exist. I myself passed through that bureau for 19 years. I know that those people are doing their best. They are people who are well-trained for that purpose. They do not tell the mine-worker whether his condition has improved or deteriorated. They do not say that they recommend this or that. There is a barrier between the doctors and the patient. I am pleading for those workers to-day. When the worker contracts that disease, his troubles start. He does not only suffer financially, but there is not much of a future left to him either. He may die within a year or two or three after contracting that disease. I am pleading for those persons who are qualified under the Pneumoconiosis Act. They, as well as their dependants, receive a pension. If such a worker has children, a pension is paid to them until they reach the age of 18. Once they have reached the age of 18, that pension is no longer paid out to them. Those persons who have children studying at universities, receive assistance from the bureau in the form of bursaries and other financial aid. But for the girl or boy who goes to a teachers&#x2019; college, there is no such financial aid. I am pleading with the new Minister that he should render assistance in this respect as well. It may be said that bursaries are being made available. That is so. Bursaries are also being made available in respect of high school pupils. In the case of a child attending a high school, even his school funds contributions, his clothes, etc., are paid by the Tuberculosis Board. I feel that when these children go to a teachers&#x2019; college, an exception should be made in their case as well. I shall not go as far as to say that the amount that should be paid out in their case should be the same as the amount paid out in the case of those children who attend universities. <span class="col_6523-6524" refersTo="page_0523"/>But a grant should nevertheless be made to them. A parent whose child is already attending a teachers&#x2019; college&#x2014;and this happens when the child is 18 or 19 years of age&#x2014;loses a great deal. When he contracts phthisis, he loses a large part of his income. In the first place, he will automatically be removed from his work&#x2014;where he may perhaps have earned a large income&#x2014;and be given other employment. I am pleading that the hon. the Minister should please help us in this respect.</p>

<p>I also want to plead for another matter. Hon. members on that side of the House said here to-day that the mines could only continue in existence for a relatively short period. The year 2000 was mentioned here. Is it not time the mines cut down their large expenses a little&#x003F; In my area five new shafts are going to be sunk. The companies are erecting many houses there. These houses are not being erected in the area of the local towns, but in the immediate vicinity of each of these new shafts. Now the danger exists that if these mines are to be closed down in the year 2000, the State will be landed with these small townships that sprang up like mushrooms. Hon. members will remember the Dominion Reefs township in the Western Transvaal and how there were advertisements for the sale thereof. At present it belongs to a private undertaking in Pretoria. Therefore I plead that permission should not be granted for living units and married quarters to be erected at these shafts, or else they should be restricted to a minimum. Where local authorities are in a position to satisfy housing requirements, those houses should be built in the areas of town councils. This is a serious matter. I cannot over-emphasize it. I feel that the mines spend millions and millions of rands unnecessarily so as to cause their expenses to soar in order that they may tell the Government, &#x201C;Look how high our expenses are in respect of production. What must the State do to help us&#x003F;&#x201D; To the Opposition I just want to say that no government can make gold. Everything possible is being done to help the gold mines. Once our gold resources have been exhausted, I hope and trust that there will be a substitute for gold.</p>

<p>When making my first speech in this House during the last session of Parliament, I pleaded for a substantial expansion of the diamond-cutting industry in South Africa, and in making this plea I stressed the fact that this very valuable industry had been allowed to stagnate over the years and that because of this it had not made its proper contribution to the economy of South Africa. I went further and expressed the opinion that with the right kind of encouragement the South African diamond-cutting industry could have been expanded to the point where it could have employed at least 5,000 qualified diamond-cutters.</p>

<p>Are you talking about the question of diamonds being cut in this country&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>That is right, yes. Mr. Chairman, when you ruled me out of order I was expressing the opinion that the diamond-cutting industry in South Africa could have been expanded to where it could employ at least 5,000 diamond-cutters, as against the mere 600 odd which it was employing at that particular time. I am very happy indeed to say that apparently my plea did not fall on deaf ears, because we find that just a short while later the then Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech made this statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For many years now the export duty on uncut diamonds has remained unchanged at 10 per cent. I believe that a moderate increase which will have the indirect effect of giving encouragement to our own diamond-cutting industry would be justified. I therefore propose that the rate be increased to 15 per cent from to-day.</block>

<p>It is perfectly obvious from this statement that the 5 per cent increase in the export duty was designed, firstly, to bring in additional revenue and, secondly, to encourage the expansion of the diamond-cutting industry in South Africa. There is no doubt that this 5 per cent would have been a shot in the arm for the local cutting industry, because it would have meant that the South African diamond-cutting industry would now be receiving from the Government an indirect subsidy of 15 per cent as against the 10 per cent which it had previously.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the South African diamond cutting industry has not benefited from this 5 per cent increase because, according to my information, the central selling organization, the body which is responsible for marketing South African rough diamonds overseas decided not to pass this 5 per cent increase on to its customers and in fact absorbed the 5 <span class="col_6525-6526" refersTo="page_0524"/>per cent itself. This of course meant that the <i>status quo</i> as between the price charged in South Africa for rough diamonds and the price charged in London remains the same. I appreciate that the central selling organization is a very responsible body. I will be the first to admit that it has been mainly through their efforts, through the system of control and correct marketing, that the world diamond industry has remained as stable as it is. So one must assume that they had a good reason for not passing this increase on to their customers in London. Nevertheless, this body through its actions has created a very anomalous situation. On the one hand we find the Government making a constructive move to expand the South African diamond cutting industry and on the other hand we find the central selling organization through its action completely nullifying this gesture. In the light of this action I must ask myself very seriously whether the central selling organization really wants to see an expansion of the diamond cutting industry in South Africa. I realize that we are dealing here with a new Minister of Mines but I am certain that he will have some knowledge of this rather strange situation. I wonder if the hon. the Minister in the course of his reply to this debate will tell us what his reaction is to the action of the central selling organization.</p>

<p>I must be honest and say too that there have been efforts by the Government in the past 18 months to assist the South African diamond cutting industry to expand because we find that a number of new licences have been granted by the Department of Mines which brings the established number of diamond cutting firms in South Africa to 55. At the same time a fairly large number of apprentices have been allowed into the trade. The result is that we now have 650 qualified diamond cutters and 611 apprentices. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that obviously the new apprentices will not make any sizeable contribution to diamond cutting production in South Africa for a number of years. We know too that of the 650 qualified diamond cutters many can be classed in the higher age groups. Unless therefore there is a continuous injection of new blood into the diamond cutting industry, we will find ourselves back where we started in a few years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>I realize too that because of the critical shortage of the larger sized gemstones, it will not be possible to expand the diamond cutting industry substantially unless a far larger percentage of diamonds below one carat in rough are processed in this particular country. It is also true that because of the wage structure pertaining in the South African diamond cutting industry, it would be quite uneconomical for the existing factories to process diamonds below one carat in weight. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should give very serious attention to assisting in the establishment of a separate diamond cutting industry in South Africa, an industry which will concern itself mainly with polishing diamonds below one carat in weight. We know that in Belgium and Israel, where the bulk of these small diamonds are polished to-day the industry has become very highly mechanized. We find that in these countries the small diamonds are being polished very economically indeed. I want to suggest that there is no reason at all why the type of machinery needed for this mechanization cannot be imported into South Africa. I see no reason why we cannot develop our own smalls industry in this country. I have always believed that in the interests of South Africa we should eventually process every gem quality diamond found in South Africa. I want to say that the ex-Minister of Finance was obviously thinking in the same direction because we find that when he opened the Finch Mine, he said this:</p>

<block name="quote">A side-effect of the development of the diamond industry, was the expansion of the cutting industry. This comparatively new industry was playing an important role in providing gem diamonds for major jewellery manufacturers overseas, besides providing employment for more than a thousand people. The time must surely come when an uncut diamond should only leave South Africa as a high exception.</block>

<p>I appreciate of course that this ideal cannot be brought about overnight, but I certainly believe that we should start working in that direction.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) quite rightly says that we have known one another for a long time. As a matter of fact I am sure he will not mind me saying where we met for the first time. It was in a Turkish bath and since then a lot of water has passed under the bridge. I must say that we have come a long way to find the member, and I appreciate it and am grateful for it, pleading here so vigorously for the extension of South Africa&#x2019;s own diamond industry. Naturally I am not prepared to say much about the central selling organization. I saw something of it in London, as the hon. member knows. Amongst other things they have a very beautiful building. I must say that I was rather perturbed by the reply I had to give to the hon. member the other day in regard to the mining of diamonds in this country. I gave him the figure of approximately 27 million carats of diamonds, of which something like 20 per cent are of gem quality. Of those nearly half are under one carat. The figure that really upsets me, and which I think will upset any South African, is that only 2&#x00BD; million carats out of the 27 million are being cut in this country. As the hon. member said, the previous Minister of Finance had certain thoughts about this. Having indicated my own concern about these particular figures in the reply given to the hon. member, I think I must leave the central selling organization at <span class="col_6527-6528" refersTo="page_0525"/>that, if the hon. member is satisfied with the reply I have given him, because I do not think that I can go much further.</p>

<p>*Then I should just like to say the following in connection with the question of asbestosis that was raised here by several members. The question of asbestosis as well as pneumoconiosis, which is coupled with it, is, of course, a very important one in South Africa. More and more attention is being paid to these two diseases, particularly in countries that are large-scale importers of asbestos for secondary industries. Unfortunately it is also true that in certain countries exaggerated importance is being attached to this problem, and that it is being seized upon for ulterior motives. As regards the diseases connected with this industry, namely asbestosis and pneumoconiosis, it is unfortunately the case in Europe and also in Britain that attention has been focused upon political aspects, which, unfortunately, has also made it more difficult for us to continue with certain research projects. I do not want to elaborate on that at the moment. The fact of the matter is that this has affected our interest in what is being done abroad. However, as regards the Republic I want to give the assurance that the health problem which arises from the mining and processing of asbestos is receiving the serious attention of both the Government and my Department. As regards the asbestosis research project I can engage the attention of hon. members for a long time by mentioning a whole series of steps that have been taken, but I do not think that hon. members expect that. A year or two ago this research project was undertaken as an urgent and intensive effort. We are making good progress. As I have said, I have here a progress report in this connection. A research clinic of the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau at Kuruman has already been completed and equipped, and one of these days I shall open it personally and put it into commission. However, I want to give the assurance that the situation is under control, and that on the part of the public there is no reason to be panicky as far as asbestosis and pneumoconiosis are concerned.</p>

<p>&#x2020; I should also like to point out to the hon. member for Durban (Central) that we do not accept that in the case of asbestos, the engineer in the prevention of dust has fulfilled his role. The difficulty, however, is that appliances to prevent dust efficiently are too expensive for asbestos mines to afford. Experiments are continuing and progress is being reported from time to time. May I also say to the hon. member that in regard to the aluminium therapy which he referred to&#x2014;I think &#x201C;aluminium therapy&#x201D; is a term which is more easily understood&#x2014;it has been found that it has a limited application in other countries, for instance Canada and Australia. My medical advisers tell me&#x2014;here I would like to say that I am very grateful to have Professor Oosthuizen as my medical adviser&#x2014;that they are not very enthusiastic about this aluminium therapy. But I shall, as a result of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech this afternoon, ask for a very up to date report on this whole matter.</p>

<p>*I should like to tell the hon. member for Stilfontein and the other hon. members who conveyed their congratulations to me that I appreciate this gesture very much. The hon. member for Durban (Central) also did so. If my memory serves me correctly, it was when I congratulated him on his maiden speech that I also availed myself of the opportunity to thank him because during my years at university he, in his capacity as the external examiner, had been so kind as to give me a first-class in surgery. However, I can assure the hon. member that I shall not use it on him.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stilfontein asked whether it was not possible for us to appoint a commission to conduct another inquiry&#x2014;or to review the whole matter once again&#x2014;into the Pneumoconiosis Act, which has now been in operation for five years. I think I am correct in saying that the then Minister held out the prospect that once this Act had been in operation for a certain period&#x2014;five years, or whatever the period may have been&#x2014;consideration would be given to reviewing it once again. However, I cannot accede to the request that a commission of inquiry be appointed now. At a later stage I shall make a detailed statement on pneumoconiosis as such. What I should like the hon. member to consider is that, in respect of pneumoconiosis and the interests of the mine-workers, this House has never been in a better position than it is at present. At the moment we have several members in this House who used to be mine-workers. In this House we have several members who represent large mining constituencies and who know the practical circumstances. But added to that we also have more doctors in this House than ever before. In addition to that we have the representatives of mining interests. In view of the machinery that exists in the House of Assembly&#x2014;I am not referring to machinery in this House, but outside, in the various caucuses, because it has to be joint action on both sides&#x2014;I wondered whether, if we used that machinery correctly, we ourselves could not achieve better results as far as reviewing the Pneumoconiosis Act is concerned than a commission of inquiry would achieve for us. Unfortunately I cannot accede to the request of giving the assurance at this stage that we shall appoint a commission to inquire into this matter.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised a very important point. It was in connection with the cost involved in a teachers&#x2019; college or university for the children of pneumoconiosis sufferers. I must say that I do not know anything about this, but I shall definitely go into this point very fully. I shall devote my personal attention to that and inform the hon. member by letter as to what may possibly be <span class="col_6529-6530" refersTo="page_0526"/>done. I want to tell the hon. member for Stilfontein, the hon. member for Virginia, the hon. member for Randfontein and other members on the other side that the way they act as intercessors for the mine-workers, is striking. I just want to say that if I were a mine-worker, I would have considered myself fortunate to have various people to present to the House of Assembly, in the way that they do, these various aspects which are matters of intimate and personal concern to me.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Stilfontein also mentioned the question of the provision of housing for mineworkers and matters relating thereto. I think that what he had in mind are the townships that are being planned by the mining companies themselves, as opposed to the available residential areas and housing provided in ordinary towns. I may just add that this matter has very prominently come to the fore on the West Rand, especially at Carletonville and Westonaria, where I paid a visit not so long ago and where problems are being experienced in connection with sinkholes. I have asked the Department of Planning in collaboration with the Department of Mines &#x2014;fortunately both of them are now my responsibility&#x2014;to look into this whole matter, also from the angle of co-ordinated physical planning. I want to say at once that to my mind it appears to be wrong to allow townships and hamlets to spring up everywhere, particularly in view of the fact that they are connected with an industry in respect of which we know beforehand that within a certain period that industry will no longer be in existence. In other words, I am now referring to ghost towns. That is the old term that we use. I am leaving the matter at that, but I think that the hon. member will have gathered that this matter has already been brought to our notice, particularly after our visits there. I am not saying that such towns are only to be found there, but that is where they first came to my notice.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville referred to the paragraph on page 7 which deals with the age, weight and body build of recruits. May I say that it is only a relaxation and not an abolition of that type of screening. The lack of proof that age, weight and body build play an important role became evident in the light of practical experience and statistics. Over the years this was discovered as a fact. I must also emphasize that although this is so, our screening methods are still very effective. I am not personally aware of this relaxation, but I shall investigate the matter, especially in regard to what degree changes have been made, and why. I do think that the question of age, weight and body build is important. One has to be guided in these matters by experience over the years and what is found by reliable statistics, and what one learns from the reliable statistics which have been built up over many years.</p>

<p>*Then the hon. member for Randfontein raised the question of pensions that had been pegged as a result of the monthly earnings such a person had earned originally. At this juncture I do not want to give a decisive reply in regard to the rejection or the retention of this principle, which is also embodied in other legislation; I am not in a position to do so, but so far it has not yet been possible to concede the principle that a pensioner should be better off than he was while he was still working. In other words, the fundamental starting-point&#x2014;and I am not saying that it is right or wrong&#x2014;is that the pension of a person cannot put him in a better position than the one in which he was while he was earning a salary. I may just add that even if, as a result of this principle, persons do not receive the maximum allowances at present, some of them nevertheless receive more than they did in the past because of the increased benefits granted to them in order to counteract the devaluation of money. My information is that this was in fact brought into account. But I shall look into the matter again. It appears to me that this is a matter about which I shall have to consult my colleague the hon. the Minister of Labour as well as the hon. the Minister of Finance. As a matter of fact, as far as the Minister of Finance is concerned, it is not merely a question of consultation; anything of this nature has to be done in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Then I come to another point which was raised by the hon. member for Randfontein, and that is the increase of workmen&#x2019;s compensation benefits and the possible adjustment of pneumoconiosis compensation. Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether at this stage I should occupy the time of the Committee with this very tedious matter. I wonder whether I should not make this information available to hon. members in the form of a letter, because I am sure that all hon. members, particularly those who represent mining constituencies, have to reply to questions in this regard from time to time. This information will then be readily available to hon. members, and then they will know precisely what the present position is. I can assure hon. members that the position in respect of the payment of pneumoconiosis compensation is favourable and not unfavourable, if one looks at the picture as a whole.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Parktown raised once again the question of gold-mines which only have a limited life, and he also raised the question of the price of gold. I think that it is being accepted generally that our gold mining industry cannot go on forever, and that can. of course, create a very serious situation in South Africa. I just want to point out to the hon. member once again that the Economic Advisory Council is at present looking into this whole matter, as it was out to them by the Chamber of Mines. But I nevertheless think that there are a few things I should tell hon. members, and the first is that our people do not always realize what an important contribution the mineworkers and the mine owners are making, in that they are still able to produce <span class="col_6531-6532" refersTo="page_0527"/>gold at a price that has remained pegged for as long as 30 years. I truly think that this is one of the greatest feats South Africa has accomplished. There are, of course, reasons for that&#x2014;the fact that more effective mining methods are used to-day&#x2014;but the fact of the matter is that the mineworkers and the owners of gold-mines are the people who are making it possible for South Africa to get out of the gold-mining industry what we are in fact still getting to-day. I do not want to under-estimate these problems at all. We are faced with the problem that the quantity of gold at our disposal is steadily decreasing, and we are faced with the further problem that we do not know what is going to happen in connection with the gold price. One should, at any rate, always bear in mind that there is still a great deal of gold left in South Africa, but owing to depth and other factors such gold cannot be mined economically at present, but there is always the possibility that new and better mining methods may be devised and that we shall be able to mine at greater depths. The hon. member laid a great deal of stress on secondary industries so that they may replace defunct gold-mines. I cannot agree with the hon. member more. Only yesterday somebody, who is not at all connected with my Department, pointed out to me that the people who are working in the gold-mines at present are pre-eminently people who should be absorbed into the engineering industry in particular. In other words, where a gold-mine can no longer produce, the mineworker is perhaps the most suitable person to be absorbed into secondary industries, particularly into the engineering industry. We should not merely be obsessed by gold-mines as gold-producing mines; we should always give very thorough consideration to the question of the production of uranium which is mined together with gold, and the way matters look at present the demand for uranium and the price of uranium may still be very favourable for South Africa in the years that lie ahead. In respect of the question of replacing gold-mines that are no longer in production by secondary industries, I may just add that there is, at any rate, one method by which the process of replacement may be facilitated, and that is to have co-ordinated physical planning, and having listened to hon. members in this debate on the question of the future of the gold-mines, I am sure that if I or someone else were to approach this House in the future for such powers, hon. members would lend the Government their full support.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Rosettenville raised the question of ammonium nitrate blasting agent which is known as Amba. I have certain information here in this connection and I think I should read it out to hon. members.</p>

<p>Experience gained in using Amba in goldmines, has shown that its effectiveness compares favourably with 60 per cent ammon dynamite. However, on the basis of the weight of explosives required approximately 16 per cent more Amba is required to bring down the same quantity of ore. Then there is a long story about its price, and I do not want to go into that now. The position in regard to this reasonably new material is that Bantu are helping white mine-workers with the transportation and the use of explosives. When explosives are open and accessible, the white mine-worker himself is held responsible. When box-holes are loaded with Amba, Bantu are allowed to handle the loading tube under the supervision of the mine-worker, but the latter must handle the detonator and place it in position himself. No white mine-worker has been replaced as a result of the use of Amba. Viewed from the angle of possible explosions, Amba is safer than ordinary dynamite because it is less sensitive and the blast cannot go off without a detonator. The mine-workers&#x2019; trade union is satisfied with the properties of Amba as an explosive, but to a certain extent it is nevertheless upset and anxious about the possible effect it may have on the health of its members. They are of the opinion that the loading apparatus that is used, is faulty and ineffective in some cases, and they would like to see that only loading apparatus of an approved standard be used. The trade union would like to see research being conducted on the effect the handling of Amba has on the health of human beings. We know that nitro-glycerine, an ordinal explosive, causes headaches. However, this effect is not apparent when Amba is used, and in the U.S.A. and elsewhere overseas, where Amba has long been used on a large scale, there is no evidence that it causes chest or any other serious ailments when it is used in normal concentrations. Amba dust does in fact burn the eyes and the skin, but it is not a serious burn; it is more of an irritation than a burn. Control measures are being adapted so as to prevent dust from escaping from drill-holes during the loading process. I understand that this dust is a powder.</p>

<p>There are control</p>

<p>measures for preventing dust from escaping from the drill-holes during the loading process, and the design of advanced loading appliances shows promise of these disadvantages being eliminated. However, from the nature of the case research is a long-term project. I can only say that in the meantime the position will be watched very closely by the Government Mining Engineer with a view to more rigorous action being taken in cases where control measures are inadequate.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, perhaps I may just deal with one other point that was raised by the hon. member for Randfontein, and that is the question of the doctor-patient relationship, particularly as far as the Bureau is concerned. I just want to call attention to a few points in this regard. The doctors of the Bureau must act sympathetically at all times, and I think that from the nature of his work the doctor is <span class="col_6533-6534" refersTo="page_0528"/>in fact sympathetic in most cases. But hon. members should realize that the relationship between the Bureau doctor and the mine-worker is not exactly the same as the relationship one finds between a family doctor and the family he has been caring for over the years. I know that the objection is that Bureau doctors do not devote enough time to the mine-workers they examine. I just want to point out that this matter has already been investigated by three different commissions consisting of doctors themselves. The doctors who are on the staff of this Bureau have a specific task. To them it is attempting the impossible to listen to the mine-workers other problems as well. We are like that; we go to the optician but then we also want to tell him about the other aches and pains we had at some stage or other, and if he does not want to listen to them, the doctor-patient relationship is disturbed to a certain extent. I am only mentioning these things because they are problems that are in fact being experienced in the Bureau. Then there is also the other problem, namely that the family and the panel doctors of the mine-workers are very much opposed to interference taking place in their field, and in this respect, too, the Bureau doctors have to be careful. However, I can say that in general the relationship between the Bureau doctors and the patients, and also the private doctors who have to care for those patients at their homes, is as good as one can expect it to be. I know that there is also a further complaint, namely that Bureau doctors are professional people and that they adopt an aloof attitude to mine-workers, that they regard these patients as machines. That is not quite true. Virtually every member of the Bureau&#x2019;s panel of specialist physicians has his own practice. But in pursuance of this discussion I shall once again bring this matter to the notice of the medical adviser, Professor Oosthuizen, as well as the doctors who is in charge there. As regards the relationship between the Bureau doctors and the mine-workers, I think that I can safely say that generally speaking there has been a tremendous improvement in the past few years.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to add my congratulations to those of other hon. members as far as the new Minister is concerned. I am pleased that the Departments of Mines and Planning fall under one Minister. We know that it is usually the discovery of gold or some other mineral that gives rise to the rapid establishment of towns. Now we have this problem, as the hon. member for Stilfontein put it, that we are dealing with the opening of new mines and the establishment of new towns. I want to associate myself with the plea of the hon. member for Stilfontein&#x2014;and therefore I am pleased that the Minister has replied to that plea&#x2014;that from the point of view of the greater physical planning, proper attention will be given to the establishment of such new towns situated at new mines.</p>

<p>At present our gold-mining industry is faced with three major problems, and it is in this regard that I want to express a few ideas. The first is the cost/price pincer. The second is the problem in connection with marginal mines and the third is the problem in connection with the anticipated disappearance of our gold-mining industry and its replacement by secondary industry. We can virtually say, if we read the latest reports in newspapers, that our gold-mining industry finds itself in a crisis, or at least, that is the impression we gain. There are many difficulties. I just want to mention a few of them, because I want to address a few requests to the Minister after I have done so. We hear that there has been talk in America that they want to do away with the statutory gold backing of the dollar so that that gold may be canalized as ordinary gold to their ordinary reserves of gold. We also hear that the U.S.A. is going to withdraw or abolish the convertibility of its dollar into gold. If these things do happen they must necessarily have an effect on our gold-mining industry as far as the cost of or the price for our gold is concerned. Confidence in the dollar will be undermined and that will cause a considerable decrease, calculated in terms of gold, in the value of the dollar. That may lead to the devaluation of the dollar, especially if certain countries maintain their rate of exchange with gold. If other countries decide to maintain their rate of exchange wih the dollar, it may be that our gold will fetch a higher liquid price. I merely mention these things&#x2014;I do not have the time to go into them&#x2014;as difficulties which our gold-mining industry will encounter on its road in the future. If we read the headings of articles in newspapers, we see the following. I just want to read a few which appeared in the Press in the past three weeks (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Costs of Mines Higher: Grade of Ore Lower.</block>

<p>Large Decrease in Profit of the Evander Mine.</p>

<block name="quote">Increase in Cost absorbs Higher Grade of Ore at Western Areas.</block>

<block name="quote">Profits of 56 Gold-Mines Decrease by 3.1 per cent.</block>

<block name="quote">Buffels Produces more Gold but Costs are Higher.</block>

<block name="quote">Decrease in Profit of Western Areas.</block>

<block name="quote">Increasing Mining Costs not yet Arrested, According to Mr. Straiten, Chairman of Union Corporation.</block>

<block name="quote">South Africa will Continue to Produce Gold only up to 1982.</block>

<block name="quote">Dark Future Predicted for Gold-Mining Industry.</block>

<block name="quote">Picture Alarming if Costs Increase.</block>

<p><span class="col_6535-6536" refersTo="page_0529"/>I mention these things because according to these headings our gold-mining industry finds itself, in the first place, in this cost/price pincer. As I am standing and as you are sitting here to-day not one of us is able to say on grounds supported by an investigation, that the cost structure of our gold-mining industry is at its lowest and that the industry is operating on the most economic basis. In the light of this crisis for which our gold-mining industry is heading, and always with that in mind. I want to say in all seriousness that we cannot depend on an increase in the price of gold, but even if that were to happen, my request would still be based on sound reasons. Therefore I want to ask very seriously for an investigation into the structure and the cost structure of the gold-mining industry, the part it plays in our country and the steps to be taken so as to utilize and exploit its enormous assets to the best advantage of our country. I honestly think that the public is entitled to an assurance that wise developments are taking place in the gold mining industry and that the management and the further development of the industry will be in keeping with the interests of the entire community now and in the future.</p>

<p>There is a second difficulty, namely our marginal mines, and here I pointedly want to make a request for the stripping of all marginal mines to be frozen. Once a marginal mine has been closed down and has been stripped, it has been closed down for all times. Our marginal mines still contain gold to the value of thousands of millions of rand, which can be an asset, even if it is mined on a subsidized basis in the future&#x2014;whether it is mined by the State or by private concerns after public tenders for the mining of such mines have been invited by the State. We do have evidence of the fairly profitable mining of marginal mines which were closed down and which were taken over by other private concerns. Therefore I ask this in view of the asset which is waiting to be exploited, because once a marginal mine has been closed down and stripped one can only reopen such mine at very high costs. I ask for the stripping of all marginal mines to be frozen until such time as this Investigation I have requested has presented a full report in connection with the entire cost structure and the entire economy of our gold-mining industry.</p>

<p>I then come to my final point, and that links up with what the hon. member for Stilfontein said. The day will come when the gold-mining industry will be going down and when one mine after the other will be closed down. The transition period between gold-mining and the establishment of secondary industries which must necessarily follow to take its place, will be a difficult period. That may come sooner than we expect and may cause a depression. But the blow is going to be even more severe if the population centres which have been established there as a result of the development of the gold-mining industry are going to be completely stripped of any source of revenue to justify their existence. Secondary industries will have to take its place. Now I want to ask, and with this I want to conclude, whether the time has not arrived for a fund to be established to be used when that evil day dawns at some such population centre. We have a fine example of the way in which such a fund can function in the establishment of the water fund of the Western Witwatersrand Dolomitic Association. Within a few years that fund became a very powerful one and at present people are being compensated from that fund, much to their benefit&#x2014;no one is suffering any loss&#x2014;as a result of developments and losses which arose because the gold-mining industry had attracted those people to that area. These three requests, a thorough investigation into the cost structure, the freezing of the stripping of our marginal mines until such investigation has been completed, and the establishment of a fund to lighten the burden during this transition period in which one mine after the other will close down, and to serve as a source for financing secondary industries which may be established there, are reasonable requests and they more or less cover all aspects of this major problem.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>First of all, may I add my congratulations to the hon. the Minister to that of others, and say, that I wish him well in his new post.</p>

<p>The theme I wish to develop is the future position of the Coloured people in regard to mining. To what extent does the Minister think they should share in the mining development taking place in this country&#x003F; Up to now, Coloured people have not had very many opportunities to participate in this very extensive part of our economy. Their experience in regard to alluvial diamonds has been a very sad one. The Department of Mines knows full well, that there are a number of Coloured men who hold diggers&#x2019; licences and who search for new ground from time to time. In many cases they struggle to make a living. One would think, that in terms of the Government&#x2019;s declared policy of separate development, all sections of the community would have an opportunity to share in the country&#x2019;s wealth. Alluvial diamonds, diamond digging or diamond mining in Coloured areas in which Coloured persons could work with advantage, should be allocated to them. I raised the question here a year or two ago, about the unfairness of the Government in giving the Komaggas Coloured Settlement to a consortium of private white companies to work. There was a sop given by the Department to the Coloured Development Corporation in the form that it would get 5 per cent of the gross finds, which last year amounted to some R60,934. When the second concession came along, we were horrified to find that an offer made by a diamond-mining company to develop this particular concession for the benefit of Coloured persons was rejected. After a strong plea made by me here, let me say to the credit of the Government, it was <span class="col_6537-6538" refersTo="page_0530"/>decided to accept the offer of this particular company. Negotiations have been proceeding in order to have this thing finalized. But now we come to a third one. Here, once again, we find that Coloured people are not getting their share of the possibilities of finding diamonds, or of mining diamonds for their own benefit. I refer in this case to the farm or Coloured settlement known as Mier, which is 120 miles north of Upington. What happened in this case&#x003F; It is for this reason that I rise to-day to lodge a protest on behalf of the Coloured community as a whole.</p>

<p>The Department of Mines advertised for offers to prospect this property, and among the applicants were 14 white companies or partnerships and individuals, one Coloured company to be formed, and one Coloured man on his own account. To the astonishment of all concerned, the Minister of Mines, in answer to a question I put on the Question Paper, said that by arrangement with the Minister of Coloured Affairs this concession was handed over to the Coloured Development Corporation, which would float a company consisting of the Development Corporation itself, the local management board of the particular settlement, the Coloured company to be formed and the individual Coloured man who had applied. This reply was given on 14th February this year. So far so good, but then we come back to the same old story, where the 14 companies, individuals and partnerships, were more or less directed to float themselves into a company to prospect this enormous farm. This farm is 432,000 morgen in extent and it seems to me a sad state of affairs that an enormous piece of ground like that, can be allocated to a group of white persons, entities or individuals, when it rightfully belongs to the Coloured community, who are just as skilled and know all about the prospecting and mining of diamonds. They also have access to all the money that could be required to prospect this property thoroughly and to the satisfaction of the Minister of Mines and his officials. One cannot help but wonder whether or not the attitude of the Coloured people is correct, namely that there is no intention by the Government that they should really share in these propositions, where wealth is possible and where wealth may lie in great measure. I am told, with unfailing regularity, that it is useless for Coloured people to expect to get anything in this particular field, because certain white companies get preferential treatment. When one looks at the names of these companies, and sees the individuals concerned, and examines the background of all the shareholders and the companies&#x2019; registers of these consortiums and companies who have worked on these concessions, one must be led to the conclusion that certain people have influence and that Coloured people have none. I therefore say to the hon. the Minister in his new capacity, that, in dealing with concessions which fall within the purview of the Minister of Mines, Coloured persons should be considered to a far greater extent than they are. I would appeal to him to deal with these matters, absolutely and exclusively on their merits. He should not concern himself in any shape or form with the type of arrangement which was made, and about which I have got a very full reply from the Minister who was then responsible for the portfolio.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the alluvial aspect and the mining aspect, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what facilities are contemplated for the training of Coloured men as miners. What share do they get of the higher remuneration which is paid to miners in the coal-mining industry and in the gold-mining industry&#x003F; We know of course that in the copper-mining industry many of them are employed and I am sure that it will be confirmed that these people are not only satisfactory miners, but they observe all the rules that go with that particular occupation. They acquit themselves very well indeed. It is a well-known fact, that the white mining unions object to some of the activities of Coloured miners, but I think these matters could be resolved. So, I ask the hon. the Minister whether he would not apply his mind to my plea, that Coloured persons, should be utilized in view of the fact that there is a tremendous shortage of manpower in this country. I see on the Estimates that there is a large sum of money for training schools for Whites to learn the art of mining. This is not the first time I am making this plea. I would like to have something placed on the Estimates&#x2014;I hope it will be next year&#x2014;providing for a training school for Coloured men to learn the art of mining, so that they would know how to go about the job. There will then be an end to this business, which is far too prevalent, where concessions which are within the purview of the State, are handed out to white mining companies and Coloured persons are excluded. I ask the hon. the Minister to give me some idea of what his policy is in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, I shall not reply to the matters raised by the hon. member. I leave that to the hon. the Minister. I want to associate myself with all hon. members who congratulated the Minister. I can boast, more than other hon. members in this House, that he is one of my political sons, that I raised him and that I am very proud of him. The general friendly reception of these words of mine proves that everyone agrees with me and that I have not done a bad job in this case. I want to wish the Minister a very prosperous and happy time and I hope that the country as a whole will benefit greatly, in all respects where we expect that of him, from his undoubted talents as a Minister. I may assure him that in general his appointment as Minister of Planning and Mines is highly appreciated by the mine-workers as well as by myself. <span class="col_6539-6540" refersTo="page_0531"/>When hon. members of the Opposition to-day pulled a kind of dark veil across the floor of this House in connection with the mining industry&#x2014;because of the story which is being told that the mining industry is now nearing its end&#x2014;one could not help but think that they were people who at least spoke with the authority of experts. The Chamber of Mines knows when they speak of this probable life of the mining industry. When they now announce that time is running out very rapidly and that we are beginning to see the end of the mining industry&#x2014;the gold-mining industry in particular&#x2014;I cannot help but think of the year 1931 when we also heard expert advice. The late Mr. Hans Pirow, the Government Mining Engineer, the most expert authority in the field of the mining industry, said at that time that the maximum life of the mining industry was only 25 years. We have exceeded that maximum by many years. I only mention this to show to hon. members that one cannot always depend entirely on so-called expert advice as far as the mining industry is concerned. This is an industry where one has to leave things to new discoveries, because subsequent to that year, in which the first prediction of the end was made, the mining industry has grown to an extent which has exceeded the wildest expectations of any optimist in South Africa. Let us wait a little while. There are many possibilities for the gold-mining industry which can still play a much greater part in South Africa, and I hope that that will be the case.</p>

<p>One does not sink a new shaft at a worked-out mine which has no more life. There are many indications that the gold-mining industry will continue to exist and prosper for many years to come. At this stage I want to express the hope that in the future, when the gold-mining industry may once more be blessed with new discoveries, it will adapt itself to a greater extent. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, will hon. members please leave this dialogue. When I hear those tiny voices I do not want to hear my own harsh voice intermingle with them. I want to express the hope that if a new day dawns for the gold-mining industry, it will, as an industry we have often boasted to be the goose that lays the golden egg, try to adapt itself to the South African way of life and will meet its obligations to South Africa. Not everyone agrees with me, but to my mind the gold-mining industry as such has never adapted itself to such an extent that it has produced the highest possible degree of prosperity for the South African nation. It has in fact been the goose that lays the golden egg, but for many years that golden egg has contained a considerable amount of poison.</p>

<p>Then we come to the biggest problem about which we have to hear year after year, namely the question of diseases and compensation in respect of them. I am pleased about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to the suggestions made here by hon. members. However, I want to go somewhat further to-day, because I do not want the hon. the Minister to find one of these days that he is being flooded with requests to which he has no reply. He has not yet heard the last word about the question of miner&#x2019;s phthisis. I humbly want to give him some advice to-day so that we may hear the last word about this question. During a major dispute which arose in the mining industry we followed a new method. We had a mediating committee in which interested parties were brought together. The outcome of that was a tremendous success. Now I want to extend that. I want a similar committee to assist in this connection in negotiations in the future, because there will have to be negotiations in regard to the question of miner&#x2019;s phthisis. But that should not be the end of it, as has been the case since 1930. I want to tell the Minister the following. The brain-racking which follows on the complaints we hear here year after year is attributable to the fact that each time a new Act is passed one always hears that it is a measure which has been agreed upon. Do you know why, Sir&#x003F; It is because Parliament has not accepted its responsibility but has made it a measure which has been agreed upon. Therefore, after such a mediating committee has completed its work, I want no Act to be amended until such time as a select committee has considered this matter so that this House will be able to accept its full responsibility. Mr. Chairman, do you know when last this troublesome question was considered by a select committee&#x003F; That was in 1931. Because the report of that Select Committee was not implemented and because all subsequent legislation in this connection was passed on the basis of being measures which had been agreed upon, the hopes of all predecessors of the present Minister were disappointed. Each time they were once more saddled with a series of new requests and a whole lot of new dissatisfactions. In my modest opinion one will never be able to put an end to that dissatisfaction until such time as one has done so according to this pattern. If the Minister proceeds along these lines I foresee the end of this problem and this annual repetition of the same complaints and dissatisfactions. I just want to repeat this because when I said it before the Minister was not in the House for the moment. I was saying that the question of negotiations should start at the mediating committee subsequent to which there must not again be talk of a measure which had been agreed upon. This matter must be referred to a select committee of this House so that this House may accept its responsibility and so that we may avoid a repetition of measures which have always been agreed upon and under which the mine-worker has been prejudiced time and again. I hope that these things will find favour with the Minister and that he will at least find it acceptable as a method of attempting to put an end to the <span class="col_6541-6542" refersTo="page_0532"/>constant complaints and investigations. I want to conclude by saying that an end will not be put to these complaints until such time as we, as a House of Assembly, say that we are really going to tackle this matter, and that we are going to start with a mediating committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should personally like to convey, also on behalf of the many mine-workers of Boksburg, our congratulations to the hon. the Minister on his appointment as Minister of Mines and Planning. We want to wish him, as an ex-Boksburger, the very best. We also want to wish him a very long and fruitful term of office as Minister of Mines. As a doctor from Boksburg he is acquainted with many of the problems of the mine-workers. I should like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Virginia said with reference to our visit last year to the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau in Johannesburg. We were really impressed with what we saw there and I also believe that we have the fullest confidence in what is being done there. The hon. member referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the reception room which in appearance created a somewhat sombre impression. I think that that is so, but in addition I want to ask the hon. the Minister, since a new building is being planned or has already been planned, for better provision to be made also in respect of the changing-rooms so that there may be more privacy for the older people. I notice that at present some of the older men have to share the same changing-rooms with the younger men. I do think that we may perhaps owe it to those older people to give them a little more privacy.</p>

<p>Quite a great deal was said here about pneumoconiosis. It remains a problem, particularly as regards the determination of the disability or the degree of a person&#x2019;s disability. In spite of the progress which has been made in respect of clinical tests and the improved apparatus being used, mistakes are still being made. This only shows us how fallible these tests may be. According to the Medical Journal of 22nd August, 1964, it was found at the post-mortem examinations of 88 white mine-workers that 38.7 per cent of the cases had shown no pneumoconiosis at radiological tests but that those persons did in fact have pneumoconiosis before their death. This is where a considerable amount of dissatisfaction is caused amongst the mine-workers. The mine-worker believes that he is a sick man. He feels convinced that he is certifiable. He goes to his family doctor and the family doctor&#x2014;a person in whom he has a great deal of confidence&#x2014;tells him that he suspects him to be suffering from some chest complaint. It is in this connection that I want to plead with the Minister that there ought to be close liaison between the family doctor and the Bureau. Section 31 of the Act provides that a medical practitioner is legally bound, if he suspects a person who has worked at a controlled mine to be suffering from pneumoconiosis or tuberculosis, to communicate his findings to this committee. But in spite of this, many of our medical practitioners are not aware of this provision. Even many of our mine-workers are not aware of it. In other words, in many cases of determining the degree of disability, the family doctor&#x2019;s knowledge of the person&#x2019;s background is not taken into account. A record is kept at the Bureau of the periodic examinations of that person, but that is a record of the examinations at the Bureau only. I should like to suggest that apart from the record which is being kept at the Bureau, a mine-worker, on being informed of his periodic visit to the Bureau, should first obtain a report from his family doctor, which he can take along with him, covering the period between his last visit to the Bureau and the present visit. Such report is also to form part of his record.</p>

<p>We know that the man in the street has a great deal of confidence in his family doctor. If his family doctor tells him that he is presumably suffering from pneumoconiosis, he attaches a great deal of value to that. Consequently I think that it will give a man a great deal of satisfaction and consolation to know that a report by his family doctor will go to the Bureau and that his family doctor also has some say in the matter. It does happen, for example, that a person feels very good on the day of his examination. When he arrives at the Bureau he is given a good report as far as his health is concerned, whereas he really is a sick man. If the Bureau had a report from the family doctor covering the preceding period it might possibly determine the degree to which that man had already been affected more closely. The opposite is also true. A mine-worker may suspect that he is suffering from pneumoconiosis but may not want to be certified. Even to the detriment of his own health which may suffer, the man is afraid that if he is certified he will no longer be allowed to work at the mine. It may also happen that the man may possibly have an attack of bronchitis on that day, something which, of course, also makes him certifiable. That may happen in spite of the fact that he feels that he does not want to be certified. As I have already said, the man in the street has confidence in his family doctor and therefore I should like to see that the family doctor, as far as certification is concerned, has more say so as to limit that doubt to a minimum. Should there then be any doubt, I want to ask that the mine-worker should be given the benefit of that doubt.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member addressed his remarks mainly to the hon. the Minister and I shall leave the matter at that. We are particularly glad that the Minister has indicated that he will go into the future of the gold-mining industry. On various occasions, both inside this House and outside, attention was drawn to the important role our gold-mining industry was playing in our national economy generally. On each occasion it was indicated that this particular industry was still making a major contribution <span class="col_6543-6544" refersTo="page_0533"/>to our national income; that it was one of the country&#x2019;s largest providers of employment; that it purchased large quantities of locally manufactured goods; and that it continued to earn foreign exchange at a rate which, at present, amounts to approximately R800 million a year; this is twice as much as the figure in respect of our agricultural industry and it is four times greater than the contribution made by manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>The particulars, the facts and the statistics about what is going on in the gold-mining industry and the effect of inflation on the life of our mines are well-known. Quite a number of reports have been prepared. These reports were submitted from time to time. All we ask now is that the Government should take active steps. Even when the Budget was introduced we felt that those mines which were still producing would be given some relief. But just the reverse happened; we found that the loan levy was increased.</p>

<p>The particulars are clear. I can only express the confidence that the new Minister of Mines will display the real insight that is required, that he will act dynamically, and that he will be more successful than his predecessor in convincing the hon. the Minister of Finance and his colleagues that something should be done in connection with this matter. He will probably get advice from all sides, but I just want to tell the Minister in passing&#x2014;because my time is limited and I should like to touch upon another aspect of the matter&#x2014;that he must really not accept the kind of advice he got from the hon. member for Krugersdorp, for example. I am thinking now of the time when the hon. member delivered himself of a lengthy tirade about the mining industry earlier this Session. When this side pointed out the difficulties experienced by the mining industry the hon. member adopted the attitude that we were only making propaganda on behalf of the mine-owners. What is more, he made a particularly serious allegation. He alleged that the mine-owners were pushing up the working costs of the marginal mines in an artificial manner in order that they might qualify for more concessions. I want to quote what he said amongst other things, and I refer to Hansard, Column 814, where the hon. member said the following on 7th February, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the question of working costs is taken into review, it will become clearer to you what I mean. If one takes the working costs per ton in those profitable mines and compares them with the marginal mines, one will soon see what is wrong. Why are the working costs of the highly profitable mines lower than the working costs of the marginal mines&#x003F; Let hon. members of the Opposition, who are so fond of pleading for subsidies in season and out of season, explain that to us.</block>

<p>But the hon. member brought us under a wrong impression. In actual fact he showed how ignorant he was. If he had done his homework, he would have noticed that the average cost in the case of the marginal mines amounted to R5 per ton at present, and that the average working cost of our 12 most productive and highly profitable mines was not less than R5 per ton, but amounted to R6.6 per ton. In other words, it is 30 per cent higher. I therefore say that that kind of contribution is of no use to us; it confuses the issue completely.</p>

<p>When speaking of the mining industry we are inclined to think of the gold-mining industry. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to refer briefly to another important sector of our mining industry, and that is our coal-mines. Here we are also concerned with an important group of mines. I should like to quote a few particulars just to give you an idea of the size of these mines. Approximately 80,000 workers, of whom one out of every ten is a white person, are employed in our coal-mines at present. These mines purchase manufactured goods to the value of approximately R36 million every year. The sales of these mines take place on a large scale. Local sales of bituminous coal at present amounts to approximately R73 million a year. Anthracite sold locally comes to approximately R2 million. Our coal exports amount to about R6 million. The total amount involved is therefore slightly more than R80 million. By any standards we are therefore dealing with a major industry here. However, in this particular industry, too, all is not well. I now refer to a summary which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> recently in which we read the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s coal-mines are losing ground more and more. Declining sales, resulting in a lower rate of production and rising costs, are causing a reduction in profitability, One of the largest mines has already warned that prices will have to be increased &#x2026; This follows the recent trend in the case of other coal companies. All of them have showed decreasing profits.</block>

<p>It seems to me as though this is another matter to which the hon. the Minister will have to give attention. We have to determine what future there is for our coal-mining industry. At present approximately 50 per cent of our coal is being used for the generation of power, and it seems as though this tendency will increase progressively. There is, of course, the possibility that coal may also be used in the petro-chemical industry, but I do not think this will ever assume large proportions. Taking Sasol as an example, we find that at present it uses only about 4 million tons of coal a year. It would therefore seem that the future of our coal lies in the sphere of the generation of power. Circumstances in South Africa are not particularly favourable for the <span class="col_6545-6546" refersTo="page_0534"/>generation of hydro-electric power, and experts think it unlikely that nuclear energy will be used for the generation of electricity in the immediate future. If then coal is seen mainly as a means of generating electricity, it seems as though we are going to have a problem in this respect as well. At present we in South Africa use approximately 6,000 megawatts at a time. Experts such as the head of Escom, predict that we will need approximately 60,000 megawatts by the end of this century. To produce 2,000 megawatts requires approximately 7 million tons of coal. The mining methods that are employed, however, are such that for every 7 million tons of coal taken out 5 million tons have to be left behind for purposes of support. In other words, reserves of approximately 12 million tons are needed to produce 2,000 megawatts. If we make the necessary projections it therefore follows that we will have to produce 360 million tons of coal a year by the end of this century in order to keep our power installations going. This immediately gives rise to the following question: What is the extent of our coal reserves&#x003F; It seems as though this whole matter as well as the integration and the co-ordination of power generation have to be properly investigated in order that this important asset we have in South Africa&#x2014;our coal&#x2014;may be utilized in the best possible way in the national interest and on a long-term basis.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, criticized what the hon. member for Krugersdorp had said in regard to the operating costs of mines. I want to ask him whether he is in favour of the proposal by the hon. member for Carletonville concerning an investigation into the economy of our mines. In the field of agriculture the Government is already engaged in such an investigation. As a matter of fact, all ramifications of our political economy have been investigated from an economic point of view, but this question of the operating costs of mines has not yet been examined by the State. It seems to me as if the hon. member for Hillbrow evaded that aspect. It seems strange to me that the mining industry has always been able to keep going over the past number of years, say, the past 30 years, in spite of increasing operating costs, at a price fixed in the thirties. Only such a commission of inquiry will be able to determine how the mining industry has been able to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow went on to deal with the coal mines. He drew attention to the importance of the coal mines as far as the generation of power was concerned and said that by the end of this century we would need 60,000 megawatts annually for the development of our industries. He went on to say that we would need 360 million tons of coal annually for the generation of the power which would be required by our economy. The Government is already taking our future requirements into account and for that reason negotiations are in progress at present with our neighbouring states in connection with the development of hydro-electric power. I can assure the hon. member that the Government is fully conscious of the importance of the generation of power and also cheaper power than the thermo-power we use at present. It is obvious that once the Sahara Bassa scheme on the Zambezi as well as the Kunene scheme has come into operation and has been linked up with the supply of thermo-power, it will be possible to generate considerably more power than we shall require at the end of this century. Mr. Chairman, it is true, of course, that our economy&#x2014;at any rate many divisions of our national economy&#x2014;is at present geared for and adapted to the use of oil. We use a considerable quantity of oil and other energy-supplying materials and for that reason every possible step is being taken to become self-supporting as far as these raw materials are concerned; hence the search for oil. The hon. member for Rosettenville expressed quite a great deal of concern in regard to our search for oil. He asked the hon. the Minister to tell the Committee what results had been achieved in this connection up to now. The hon. the Minister naturally was careful in his approach to this question. If I had been in his shoes, I would also have been careful, because it seems to me that in this regard we are dealing with something which is similar to the position in which a man finds himself who runs away from a lion, looks for a tree and at the end of that race finds a tree to climb. What happens in the meantime, from the moment he parts running until he climbs into the tree, is of course a serious matter. However, prospecting, or the race, is in progress and we do believe that we will ultimately achieve results in some form.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister spoke of four seismic teams who are conducting research. One of the investigations being conducted which really is a disappointment to me, is the position occupied by the Geological Survey Division in the investigations. Here one has an organization that has been engaged in investigations since the existence of the Union and the Republic. At present one finds that this sub-department of the Department of Mines is being gradually stripped down. As hon. members will see in the Estimates, there are certain divisions, such as the Atomic Power Research Unit, a Metallurgical Research Institute, etc. These are all divisions of the Department of Mines which do research work. Amongst these divisions one also finds the Geological Survey Division. The Geological Survey Division is the oldest of these sub-departments of the Department of Mines. It is the Division that has been doing basic research work since the earliest days. It is a division without which no nation, no national government, can do. It will be interesting to determine what part the Geological Survey Division has played in the basic development of our fatherland, directly and indirectly. Take for example the question of the discovery of our new gold fields about which some hon. members are so pessimistic. I simply <span class="col_6547-6548" refersTo="page_0535"/>cannot share in their pessimism. I agree with what the hon. member for Kirugersdorp said in this connection. We know that since the discovery of the gold fields on the Witwatersrand in the year 1898 there have been misgivings in regard to the future of the gold mining industry, but further research work has indicated that there are in fact further gold fields in South Africa. Just consider the Free State gold fields where there were no signs of gold-bearing ridges as on the Witwatersrand and which were discovered by scientific means alone. Just consider the contribution made in this connection by the Geological Survey Division. Just consider the contribution made by the Geological Survey Division and other geological organizations to the discovery of coal mines. There are numerous coal fields which were covered by other formations and which would never have been discovered were it not for the Geological Survey Division. There are also other mineral sources which were discovered as a result of the research work done by this Division. All these discoveries are directly attributable to the geological and geophysical research work initiated by this Division which stimulated the interest of private bodies and persons. For example, if I think of all the various oil companies that come to the offices of this Division to make inquiries in regard to the potential of our geological formations with a view to the discovery of potential sources of energy in our soil, it seems to me that the amount allocated for Geological Survey is too small by far. Then one comes to the question of staff. If one compares the salaries earned by the staff with the salaries paid to people outside the Public Service. the report of the Department of Mines, particularly that part relating to the Geological Survey Division, is in actual fact a charge against the Government. This report mentions staff problems. This report covers the year 1965 and I am convinced that the 1966 report will reveal a much worse position. In these Estimates of Expenditure particulars are given of the salaries which are paid and if we compare that with what is paid by mining groups to the heads of their geological departments we find amounts such as R9,600, R10,000, R12,000 per annum. One finds that juniors with B.Sc. degrees are paid R3,000. A man with four years&#x2019; experience is paid R5,000 if he has his B.Sc. degree. Then we come to the salaries paid to officials of the Geological Survey Division and we find that the salary scale of the director is R6,000 &#x00D7; R300&#x2014;R7,500 and that the commencing salary of a B.Sc. graduate is R1,680. It is obvious that if one can earn a salary of R3,000 after leaving the university with a B.Sc. degree one most certainly will not join the Geological Survey Division of the Public Service: one will offer one&#x2019;s services to the company which remunerates one at a rate of at least R3,000 and up to R5,000 or more.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I readily agree with the hon. member for Etosha that the Geological Survey Division is being neglected; it is one of the stepchildren of the Government. If we look at the Estimates, we see that the amount which is being supplied for Geological Survey this year has been reduced for R271,000 to R165,000. I wonder whether there was any other division where there was a similar reduction of 33 per cent. Particularly in view of this, it is important that this division should not be neglected any further, and I shall have something more to say about this later on, particularly because, as Treasury informed me this afternoon, the Geological Survey Division is chiefly responsible for the large number of boreholes which have been sunk in these subsidence regions of the Western Transvaal. Whether it is true or not, I do not know, but that is the information I received.</p>

<p>I just want to say a word about the irresponsible speech made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Krugersdorp who stated that the South African gold-mines were not aware of their responsibility towards the country. It is a pity that he makes an accusation of that nature and is then not present here to listen to the reply. It was a totally irresponsible accusation against an organization which controls one of the greatest industries in the world. I challenge anyone to show me a mining industry in any other country in the world which is better managed than the gold-mining industry. I hope the hon. the Minister is not in agreement with the hon. member for Krugersdorp when he accuses the gold-mines of this country of irresponsibility. We should very much like to hear what he has to say about that, because we want to be sure that the Minister does not share those ideas.</p>

<p>I should like to touch upon a matter which is a cause of continual concern amongst a large number of people in South Africa. This is in regard to the sinkholes in the dolomitic area in the Western Transvaal. It is not my intention to create unnecessary uneasiness in regard to the matter, but I cannot help recalling what happened earlier this year when a meeting of the inhabitants of that region who were deeply disturbed about the position there was held. At times stormy words were spoken at that meeting. A woman got to her feet and said: &#x201C;I cannot live here any longer. I refuse to live here any longer.&#x201D; That uneasiness is not as a result of anything which was written in the Press or which the Government or the Opposition is supposed to have done, the uneasiness was there as a result of a deep hole, almost twice as deep as this building, which subsided only 30 yards away from where that meeting was held and which caused damages to the value of R30,000. That was the reason for the uneasiness.</p>

<p>Something which caused me to feel uneasy in my turn, was part of a reply which I received from the Minister of Mines or his predecessor, in which he stated that they could not give the assurance that that specific area was safe, that surveys had been made but that the surveys had not been completed, and that <span class="col_6549-6550" refersTo="page_0536"/>an assurance of safety could not be given. The people in that area was definitely under the impression that the area was safe. Placatory words were conveyed to them. Why was it not said at that time that it was not possible to give them that assurance&#x003F; I should like to know whether it is possible to give an assurance to-day, and if it is not possible to do so, we want to know why it is not possible to do so. We want adequate investigations made so that that assurance can be given to those thousands of people who are living in fear, not so much in fear of their own safety, but for the safety of their women and children and for their properties. We hear of thousands of boreholes which have been sunk in that area, but when we examine the figures we find that 8,000 of them were to a depth of less than an average of 60 feet. Many instruments were brought to the area, but those instruments are not as yet successful in, as they are intended to do, predicting where further serious subsidences may take place. In this particular case in Westonaria the instruments could not predict the subsidences. There must be something wrong when R4 million has already been spent and it is still not possible to predict those subsidences.</p>

<p>Go and look at a hole 100 feet deep, near to schools and houses, and then the hon. member will realize what is wrong. He must not be so indifferent towards the interests and the lives of those people. I have not the slightest doubt that the position is even more serious. If we consider that 34 persons have already lost their lives in that area, and that more than 300 houses have been evacuated, that more than 150 have been demolished, and that there are schools which have had to be evacuated, that two explosives stores at West-Driefontein had to be evacuated, that a garage and petrol station building at Westonaria had to be evacuated, that an existing Buntu hospital at West-Driefontein had to be evacuated and demolished, that the Apostolic Church at Carletonville and a garage at Venterspos had to be demolished and if one considers that the damages there amounted to more than R14 million, then we cannot remain indifferent to the situation as that hon. member is doing.</p>

<p>Consequently I say that although the population of that region is not panic-stricken they are entitled to point out the following: Firstly, that they have the right to know from the authorities whether their houses, their families and their children will be safe in the future; secondly, they are entitled to maintain that the work which has been done up to now has not made it possible to indicate all the subsidences, because otherwise they would have found this hole at Westonaria; thirdly, they are entitled to point out that the instruments which are supposed to give an early warning, did not function correctly or did not function at all, fourthly, that the Government is still not able to declare regions where thousands of people are living to be absolutely safe. The Government simply does not know what the position is. Fifthly, as a result of the uncertainty, the capital value of the properties has decreased to a tremendous extent and the people there have suffered serious damages. That is why they are entitled to ask that if compensation is requested, the reply should be immediate and favourable and generous. I do not want to blame the hon. the Minister personally for the errors of the past, but from now on the responsibility is of course his.</p>

<p>The error was that that particular hole was not discovered at all, and that even those thousands of boreholes could not predict the subsidence. Another error which was made was to give the people an assurance which was not borne out by subsequent events. Of course errors were made. Is the Minister satisfied with the position there&#x003F; Can he tell the people there that the entire region is a safe one to-day&#x003F; The day he can say that, he will have fulfilled his duty as a Minister well, then we will no longer talk about errors, and then it will be possible to judge from future events.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, referred with great ostentation to the so-called irresponsible speech made by the hon. member for Krugersdorp. But the hon. member for Orange Grove is known for displaying great predilection for making irresponsible speeches and this afternoon he surpassed himself in that regard. The speech which we had to listen to this afternoon and which the country in general had to take cognizance of, is a speech which had only one purpose, and that was to sow unrest in that very unfortunate region which is being stricken by disasters which nobody could have foreseen or forestalled. But now the question arises as to why the hon. member was so alarmist in his approach to the matter. Is it because he is in earnest that the interests of the people living there must be protected&#x003F; Or are there other interests at stake which he has represented here this afternoon&#x003F; I can only say that the country outside will take as little notice of this speech of his as they usually take of his speeches.</p>

<p>However, there are three matters which I should very much like to bring to the hon. the Ministers attention. The first matter deals with the Report of the Inspector of Mines of Springs, in which he refers to the heat and the humidity in the mines around Springs. Many reasons can be put forward for these mines being warm and for their being humid. One of the reasons which has been suggested, is that the mines are deep and that that is why <span class="col_6551-6552" refersTo="page_0537"/>they are so warm. Other reasons are also mentioned in the Report, i.e. that there is a limited air supply available in proportion to the number of people working there. Whatever the reason is, I think that we have the right to advocate very seriously on behalf of our voters here this afternoon that the hon. the Minister should give this matter his attention in the near future. It is not only unpleasant to have to work under those circumstances, but those circumstances are also conducive to many diseases to which those people then become subject to. I really want to plead that the hon. the Minister should give this matter his urgent attention.</p>

<p>Another matter which is of equally great importance for our voters, is the following. In the same report we find that reference is made to the high dust counts. A little further on in the report it is mentioned that this is attributable to the faulty installation of the air conditioning. I think that this is a matter which cannot stand over but which should rather receive the necessary attention immediately in order to ensure that the dust count in that particular mine is decreased. I am asking this in the interests of those people who have to work under those conditions every day and who are as a result exposed to factors which may be prejudicial to their health.</p>

<p>But there is also a second matter to which I should like to refer. That is the question of technical examinations. If we glance at the annual report of the Government Mining Engineer we find that on page 121 it is stated that of the 528 candidates who presented themselves to be tested by the examination commission a total of only 67 succeeded in obtaining the mine managers certificate. If that was an exception to the rule then one could still accept the situation. But in the same report it is mentioned that in the previous year, stated as a percentage, it was also a case of only a little more than 10 per cent being allowed to acquire that certificate. Now I wonder, in view of the long hours of study involved and all the trouble this entails whether it is not time the Department had an investigation instituted into the reasons why there are such a large number of failures. It may perhaps be possible at the same time to institute an investigation into the possibility of amending the appointment of the examining body in such a way that it will fall under the Department of Education, Arts and Science. I other words, to see that it is amended in such a way that it will be an entirely neutral body. I could go much further and I could oose very interesting questions in regard to this matter but I should rather leave it at that. Perhaps it is time, however, that we began asking questions as to what particular language group those people who succeed in obtaining this certificate belong, and to what language group those people who do not succeed in obtaining this certificate belong.</p>

<p>The last matter I want to refer to, and one in regard to which I want to make a very strong plea here this afternoon is the question of heart diseases which are not acknowledged as industrial diseases. Now I know that the Allen Commission investigated this matter thoroughly as far back as 1952 and that it did not find itself competent to recommend that this be done. But I think we can accept with a great deal of assurance that our most healthy men enter this industry and that in spite of the small number who ultimately die of heart diseases one can nevertheless find reason to suppose that the circumstances under which they work can be conducive to the development of heart diseases as a result of various factors. For that reason I want to plead that our mine-workers be given the benefit of the doubt if there is any doubt in regard to the reasons to which those heart diseases have to be attributed. In all sincerity I want to ask that we look after, in this particular field as well, the interests of our mine-workers.</p>

<speech by="#vorster">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that I think we are all very pleased that it was in fact he who was given this portfolio. We have every confidence that he is going to get things going as never before. It is hardly necessary to say that our mineral wealth is a tremendous asset to our country. But it can only be an asset if that wealth is exploited. And it is precisely in regard to the exploitation of that wealth that there is a little matter which I would like to bring specifically to the hon. the Ministers attention. The hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that the northern part of my constituency in particular&#x2014;let us call it the Northern Cape&#x2014;is rich in minerals. It is in fact with the exploitation thereof that our problems have arisen. I do not know whether a stop has already been put to this custom by legislative means, but I want to refer to a custom which was put into practice in former years on a large scale. It is namely that in earlier years it was practically the custom, when a farmer sold his farm property, for that farmer to reserve the mineral rights for himself. You are aware that the original discovery of diamonds and other minerals was apparently an encouragement to do so. People secretly entertained the hope that there was some hidden wealth for them buried under the earth. That is why they reserved the mineral rights. In this way it came to pass therefore that they stated in their wills that there rights would pass on to their descendants without these descendants being definitely or more accurately defined.</p>

<p>Now it sometimes happens that when somebody in that vicinity is interested, say for example he is influenced as a result of his geological knowledge, in prospecting there he is confronted by the insurmountable problem that he cannot do so before he has obtained the written permission of the so-called heirs to those rights. In most cases those descendants have become widely scattered throughout the world over the years. I know of cases where it <span class="col_6553-6554" refersTo="page_0538"/>was established that the descendants were in Britain, in Australia, in Rhodesia and spread throughout the entire Republic. If we take these factors into consideration it is very clear to us that this is something which impedes the exploitation of minerals considerably. I can elaborate further on this matter, but I do not think it is necessary to do so because I know that the Minister realizes the full scope of this problem. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he consider whether legislation cannot be introduced in order to eliminate this problem. I want to make the courteous request that this legislation make provision for the following aspects.</p>

<p>In the first instance no owner must have the right to sell his land and reserve the mineral rights. Circumstances may arise which will justify his doing so, but in such a case he should not be able to do so without further ado. He should first have to obtain permission from the State. A concession must then be issued for a limited time, say for five years, or as the Minister sees fit. If, after that period has elapsed, no proclaimed discovery has been made, the mineral rights must resort to the owner. All rights which have already been reserved, except those which already belong to a registered company which acquired those rights through purchase, must lapse within five years from the date of proclamation of such an Act in favour of the owner unless minerals are discovered before that time which lead to a proclamation of an alluvial gravel or a mining area. Then it must be provided that mineral rights can only be sold to registered companies or reserved in their interests in the deeds office. I do not want to prescribe to the hon. the Minister what he should include in such legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. member for De Aar for displaying the courtesy towards me of believing that I understood everything which he had to say to me. But the hon. member made a very complicated suggestion and, to be honest, I must say that I am not quite sure what it was all about. However, I take it that the hon. member would not have raised the matter if it were of no importance, of no importance to his part of the country in particular. That is why I shall ask my Department to investigate his proposals thoroughly and to inform me of the implications thereof.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs spoke about the unpleasant conditions, such as heat and humidity, which exist in certain mines in his constituency. It is a good thing that these matters are brought to our notice. Perhaps it would also be a good thing to go and inspect not only the show-piece mines, but also those mines where the conditions are not of the very best. I think the French are playing a rugby match at Springs on 25th July and I want to suggest to the hon. member that if he can combine a visit to one of those mines with this match I should like to avail myself of the opportunity of visiting such a mine. The hon. member also spoke about planning. That, however, is a matter which will have to be considered in consultation with the Department of Education, Arts and Science. That is why I shall, after my Department has had an opportunity of giving this matter some attention, write to him and inform him of the circumstances in this regard.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Orange Grove. I must say that we have had a quiet afternoon, although the hon. member made a few statements which I cannot leave unanswered. Amongst other things the hon. member said that the Geological Survey Division was the stepchild of the Government. On the basis of figures which he dredged up from somewhere&#x2014;I do not know precisely from what source&#x2014;he alleged that there had been a major decrease in the amount which was being appropriated for Geological Survey. But if the hon. member were to glance at page 307 of the Estimates of Expenditure he would note, against the item &#x201C;Geological Survey&#x201D;, that there has been an increase of R7,150.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>But if one glances at item L on page 306 one will notice that there is a decrease of almost R90,000. Of course the overall amount will be larger if one takes salaries and wages into consideration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If one speaks of a Department, or a section of a Department, as a stepchild, then one creates the impression that the officials of that Department or section are also stepchildren. In this regard I want to refer the hon. member to page 301 of the Estimates of Expenditure where the staff of Geological Survey are enumerated. Here there is an increase of R87,000, i.e. from R457,000 to R542,000, in respect of the staff only. The decrease in respect of Geological Survey, so I have been informed, is attributable to certain apparatus which was purchased last year for oceanographic research, a purchase which is not repeated every year. Hence the decrease. But the total provision has been increased by more than R7,000, while the provision for the officials in this particular section has been increased by approximately R87,000. Therefore there can be no question here of a stepchild.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Etosha indicated clearly in his contribution that he wanted to be of assistance and that he knew something about this matter. In respect of these specific geological surveys we must not lose sight of <span class="col_6555-6556" refersTo="page_0539"/>the tremendous amount of work which has been done in the past, as well as in respect of the present search for oil. If it had not been for the years of consistent contributions and surveys by those people these things which are happening to-day could never have happened. I also want to say here that even after such projects as the search for crude oil may perhaps have come to an end one day the Geological Survey Division will always have to be there to continue their work in the interests of South Africa unabated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove also spoke about the sinkholes. I am wondering now what areas the hon. member visited there&#x003F; I do not think the hon. member did those areas a favour with what he said here this afternoon. It is of course a matter which is a source of constant concern. It is a matter involving human lives, a matter where human lives have already been lost. But let me also say this: I was there myself and I am satisfied that everything humanly and scientifically possible was done there. I want to pay the highest tribute to the technical committee which investigated this matter and for the tremendous amount of work which has already been done there. If the hon. member wants to witness appreciation for what has already been done, he need not talk only to individuals, he only has to go and speak to the town council of Carletonville or the town council of Westonaria. To tell the truth, I would appreciate it if our newspapers would publish a copy of one of the maps indicating the tremendous amount of work which has already been done in regard to the determining of what places are safe for occupation. Let me also say this. In the intensive investigations which have been made there, there is irrefutable evidence that the various methods which are being applied &#x2014;not only the boring of holes but other methods as well&#x2014;are extremely effective. I am not saying that they cannot be improved upon, but they are extremely effective. After intensive investigation it is possible to designate a site as safe for occupation. That is what has been done in regard to certain premises where, even after the subsidences occur, schools and other institutions had been built. However, the problem is that a site sometimes becomes unsafe owing to poor drainage. An entire strip is indicated as being safe, for example, but unless specific investigation is undertaken within a very small area, it is difficult to say that a particular site will be completely safe. It is difficult to say so unless that site has been intensively investigated.</p>

<p>I repeat that, in the full realization of my responsibility one can at this stage, particularly after the investigations which have been carried out in the Carletonville residential area, say with a great deal of certainty that it is reasonably safe to live there. Now I am not excluding a few odd sinkholes which can still subside. But we must not single out those areas as the only places where sinkholes can occur. Sinkholes occur in many other parts of the country. I do not want to arouse unnecessary unrest, but there are certain areas very near to Pretoria and Johannesburg where the number of sinkholes occurring there is greater than the number in this area. So it is not only in this area where we have the problem of sinkholes. In addition I just want to say that the technical committee is carrying on the good work they are doing there. There are large areas which have already been mapped, and it would pay hon. members to go and have a look at it.</p>

<p>In regard to compensation I may just say that there are two types of damage, namely indirect and direct. I do not think there are any problems as far as direct damage is concerned, but in respect of indirect damage we are at present making certain representations to the Chamber of Mines, from whence the money must ultimately come. As I have said, I am grateful for the sober and helpful attitude displayed by the hon. member for Etosha.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Hillbrow. This hon. member for Hillbrow seems to me to be a very clever man. I mean what I have just said, and I say it as a result of the contribution which he made in respect of our coal mines. But if he has so much knowledge of the gold mining industry as he revealed here in his speech then I think that it was unfair of him to create that impression which he created here in respect of the loan levy on the gold mines. The hon. member is aware that the formula is such that this loan levy and all that goes with it does not affect marginal mines and other mines which, shall I say, are almost suffering hardship.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<p>I spoke about the other mines.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the impression which the hon. member created, was that these loan levies make it difficult for gold-mines to maintain their gold production and whatever was associated with that in respect of the benefits which this entailed for the mine-worker on the mines. That is not so. The benefits of the mine-worker and the gold production in the gold-mines which are producing normal profits are not affected by this specific loan levy in such a way that it is difficult to produce gold. The hon. member had quite a lot to say about the hon. member for Krugersdorp. Now I must say that arising from what the hon. member for Krugersdorp said about me, I cannot allow the hon. member for Hillbrow to say all kinds of things about my &#x201C;Dad&#x201D;. You will recall, Sir. that the hon. member for Krugersdorp said that in a certain respect he was my &#x201C;Father&#x2019;. Now I just want to tell the hon. member for Krugersdorp the following: A good father sees to it that his will is made in such a way that his son is very well provided for. I also want to tell the hon. member for Krugersdorp that I was not discourteous when he spoke. I was in fact in the Chamber, but I was standing at the back here.</p>

<p><span class="col_6557-6558" refersTo="page_0540"/>The hon. member spoke about the Pneumoconiosis Act, and he laid particular stress on the advantages and disadvantages of an agreed measure. He then expressed the opinion that if any further legislation was introduced it should be referred to a Select Committee. Of course I cannot give a final decision on something like that now. I have only one problem in regard to this proposal which is that according to my view the outcome of a Select Committee&#x2019;s recommendations is also an agreed measure. However, I think we can settle this matter amongst ourselves when we discuss it again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boksburg, just as many other hon. members did, has acted as the champion of the mine-worker again, and in particular he also allowed emphasis to fall on the Pneumoconiosis Act. However, he raised a new point in regard to cloakrooms. I must honestly say that I have no knowledge of this matter, but I shall have this matter investigated in order to see whether we cannot accede to the representations made by the hon. member.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Karoo spoke about the Coloured people and the share they ought to have in the diamond industry. He raised a specific case as well in regard to the farm Mier. Let me just give the hon. member certain information about this matter. My predecessor gave a very full reply to a certain question which the hon. member asked some months ago. The position is this. The Department did not call for tenders or the submission of applications to prospect on Mier. All applications, including those received from Coloureds, were submitted on the initiative of the persons concerned in these applications. Furthermore, those Coloured applicants who are said to be capable of conducting prospecting on Mier are also members of the Leliefontein Company. Perhaps not all of them, but certainly a number of them. In that case the De Beers Company had to come to their rescue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>No, they did not come to their rescue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, perhaps the hon. member has not the full information, but I will come back to that in a minute. The Mier area is over 400,000 morgen, twice the size of Leliefontein which, as the hon. member knows, the Coloureds simply cannot manage on their own. The hon. member created the impression here that the Coloured people are not getting their fair share. Let me say emphatically that this Government will not allow, first of all. that the Coloured people do not get their fair share, and secondly, that they are exploited. The fact of the matter, and this we must also realize, is that whoever wants to share in the benefits of mining or any other industry must work and think and plan for himself. Moreover, he must also be able to finance the activities. Now, the hon. member knows full well that the Coloured people are not capable, and are not in a position to finance these rather expensive operations. It is the policy and the intention of the Department that the Coloured Development Corporation will look after the interests of the Coloured people. The interests of the Coloured people cannot be looked after by private individuals because somebody must finance them. The prospecting licence will be in their name and they will do the work. But who is doing the financing&#x003F; The C.D.C. is there to see that their interests are looked after properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the Coloured people being given the opportunity to be trained in the art of mining. I will certainly look into that and see what we can do about it, if we can do anything about it. That is certainly a positive suggestion and I will ask my Department to look into the matter.</p>

<p>*May I just return for a moment to the hon. member for Hillbrow. He said something about coal. I may just tell him that I already have representations before me asking for a new survey to be undertaken of our coal reserves. This will not, however, as was the case in the past, be done from a geological point of view but from a mining point of view. Research is already being undertaken into improved mining methods in the coal-mines. A study of methods which are being used in Europe is already in progress. I entertain the hope that even our coal exports can be increased as these processes are put into operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville also raised a few matters here. If I may say so, the hon. member dramatized things a little. To a certain extent this creates problem, especially since I have warned against sketching the gold-mining industry in too sombre colours. The hon. member said here that there was no possibility of an increased price of gold. Now, that I cannot subscribe to.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then the newspapers were wrong. The hon. member spoke about a crisis which our gold-mining industry was heading for. It is in fact a difficult situation, but I feel that we must be very careful when we discuss this matter. The hon. member also asked for the dismantling of marginal mines to be frozen. Well, those are brave words, but how it must be done, is another matter altogether. Suppose we decided to freeze the dismantling to-morrow, then those marginal money will have to be subsidized. Where is the money going to come from&#x003F; I am merely mentioning that in passing. The hon. member also spoke here about the establishment of a fund. Well, that is a good idea I am acquainted with some of the need which exist in the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency and I was <span class="col_6559-6560" refersTo="page_0541"/>grateful to be able to pay a visit there. But I would be in a difficult position if I were to accede to all those requests. It is simply impossible for me to do so. I do not want the people there, whom I grew very fond of, to entertain expectations of me which, on my part, I will find quite impossible to carry out.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to give an explanation and undertake a survey of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act. Several members raised this matter. I do not want to mention all the names. I think that just about every member who participated in this debate raised this matter. I should like, as far as it is possible for me to do so, to furnish a picture of the position as I see it to-day. When the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act was being introduced the then Minister of Mines, m. colleague the hon. the Minister of Finance, pointed out that the legislation was the product of research and of an intensive study of the systems which were operating in other countries of the world in respect of the compensation for pneumoconiosis. He then gave an undertaking that the working of the Act would be watched very carefully and that rectifications would be made if they appear to be necessary. However, he also said that in most respects the Act was so flexible that it would be possible in most cases to make the adjustments indicated by research and practical application without amending the Act. The Act will soon have been in operation for five years, and in my opinion that is a long enough period of time to be able to make an objective judgment of its efficiency. That is why I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to inform the House briefly in regard to the state of affairs in regard to the operation in general of the Act, and the statutory bodies involved in the administration of the Act. It will be realized that I have not had the time, nor the opportunity, to acquaint myself fully with these matters and that is why I will have to rely to a large extent at this stage on what has been reported to me by my Department, the Mine-workers&#x2019; Medical Bureau and my medical adviser.</p>

<p>From these reports it is clear to me that there is nothing much wrong with the operation of the Act and that at this stage there is no reason to expect that the underlying principles of the Act will have to be revised or amended in any important respect. As you are aware, the Act was amended in 1964 in order to rectify minor matters which had been overlooked in regard to compensation, aspects which had been disclosed by the revision of individual cases. In the same way compensation was increased throughout by 20 per cent in 1965 and compensation for the dependants of deceased mine-workers whom post-mortem examinations revealed to have been suffering from minimal pneumoconiosis without acceptable signs of any disability, was reinstituted. By that means a right was restored which the dependants of deceased mine-workers had had under former legislation. When I speak therefore of the operation of the Act, I am not referring to the compensation as such or to the question of whether the compensation is adequate. The question of compensation, i.e. the amount of the compensation which had to be paid, is a question on its own which has nothing to do with the medical basis of certification and the determination of disability.</p>

<p>Apart from the adequacy, or otherwise, of compensation, the basis of certification is the most important factor in compensation legislation and it is particularly this aspect which I have in mind when I say that basically there was nothing much wrong with the Act. From the medical side, the basis of certification introduced by the Act is not presenting any problems any more. The certification bodies, that is the Committee for the Certification of Mine-workers and the Revision Authorities for the Certification of Mine-workers, are functioning particularly well. From experience they have established for themselves standards of certification which, together with the standards which were promulgated in terms of the Act by my predecessor, acknowledge all the anatomical and clinical symptoms of dust damage. In terms of this Act full recognition is being given to the clinical symptoms of pneumoconiosis for the first time; that is why it is true that more than half of the certifications, during the lives of mine-workers, takes place on the basis of clinical symptoms and disability as determined by means of lung function tests in the absence of the acknowledged radiological science of pneumoconiosis. In this respect the Act has effectively succeeded in combining the former Siliosis and Bronchial Ailments Laws.</p>

<p>I know, and I think hon. members know, that the Republic, is, as far as is known, alone in the world in this approach towards the certification of pneumoconiosis, i.e. the fact that we acknowledge the existence of pneumoconiosis even if there is no accepted radiological evidence to that effect. In this respect our mine-workers therefore have a more favourable dispensation than their colleagues anywhere else in the world. At the same time, however, there are signs that our approach is beginning to gain ground amongst scientists elsewhere. I have even on a few occasions had the experience that important scientists have said to me in this respect that what South Africa is doing is as advanced and as modern as can be found in any country in the world.</p>

<p>The basic problem still remains that the mine-worker apparently cannot understand that a disease can be divided up into percentages. The same problem arose when we previously spoke of first, second, third and fourth degree pneumoconiosis. Apart from that, i.e. that it is possible to speak of the degrees of severity or stages of development of a disease, the categories of percentages in the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act do not imply that pneumoconiosis as a disease is divided up into percentages. I think it is important for us to <span class="col_6561-6562" refersTo="page_0542"/>understand this point very clearly. The percentages have nothing to do with the disease as such. They merely indicate the degree of disability for the purpose of compensation. The damage which has been caused by dust, measured on the basis of the degree to which heart and respiratory functions have been impaired, is expressed in percentages for the simple reason that there are varying scales of compensation for the different degrees of disability. In this respect there is no difference between the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act and, <i>inter alia,</i> the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act.</p>

<p>It makes no difference whatsoever whether one speaks of degrees or percentages of disability. The statutory basis of compensation remains the same, and for that reason I still believe that the use of the percentages in the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act is not seriously conducive to dissatisfaction. However, I myself am convinced that the present basis of certification and the basis on which dust damage is determined is the fairest one for the mine-worker. In this important respect therefore, it appears that the legislation is effective and functions satisfactorily, and in view of the advice at my disposal I cannot at this stage hold out the prospect of any amendment to the Act.</p>

<p>There are less important problems of a practical nature which hon. members of the House have already brought to the attention of my Department, and have done so again to-day. These problems are, <i>inter alia,</i> with the neglect on the part of the doctors to remove the respiratory organs of mine-workers after their death, the question as to whether house and panel doctors should be obliged to appear before the Certification Committee and the Revision Authorities on behalf of their patient, and so on. For example, the hon. member for Boksburg raised this matter here to-day. The Act already makes adequate provision for all these matters and, in my opinion, no amendments are necessary. However, there are practical problems and considerations, but my Department is giving renewed attention to these matters and I hope that it will in fact be possible to find satisfactory solutions and that we will also be able to muster the assistance and mental abilities of all members of the House in this respect.</p>

<p>A matter which has already been raised on occasion is the question of the revision of the categories of disability and the lowering of the percentages of disability so that mine-workers will qualify sooner for the appropriate scales of compensation. I am obviously prepared to give thorough consideration to any specific representation in this regard. In practice it of course amounts to an increase in the compensaton. In addition there are also serious economic and practical financial considerations involved and for that reason I cannot at this stage give any definite undertaking in regard to the matter. This is a matter in regard to which negotiations will, <i>inter alia,</i> have to take place between the mine-owners and the mine trade unions. The Treasury and the Minister of Finance are also intimately involved in any increase in benefits.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say the following. A matter which is seriously impeding the effective functioning of the Bureau is the critical shortage of the necessary accommodation and laboratory facilities. It is with very great pleasure, therefore, that I announce that a start has already been made with the construction of the new building for the Bureau. It is hoped that it will be possible to occupy the building early in 1969 and then the Bureau will have the necessary space and modern facilities at its disposal.</p>

<p>I think that I have replied to as comprehensively as possible to all the matters which were raised here. If there is no further discussion I now want to avail myself of the opportunity to thank hon. members for the friendly way in which the discussion has taken place here.</p>

<p>I think it is essential that we take this sink-hole problem raised by the hon. member for Orange Grove a little further. We cannot leave the matter there. Just as the present Government inherited other problems from the former United Party Government, it also inherited this sink-hole problem from them. I say that by virtue of the fact that with one single exception all the township establishments in these dolomitic areas took place during the time of the United Party Government. If the relevant proclamation for the establishment of townships had not been issued during the time of the United Party Government, then the preparatory work had already been done and had already reached an advanced stage when the National Party came to power. I am just drawing hon. members&#x2019; attention to that in view of the fact that the hon. member for Orange Grove always blames the present Minister, the Department or the National Party Government for the situation. I was personally concerned with the surveying off that region in the thirties. Even at that time there were about 27 sink-holes in that area. It is generally known that the sinkholes occur mainly in valleys. A mining company&#x2014;I think it was Western Areas or West Witwatersrand Areas&#x2014;applied to have the area in which Carletonville is situated proclaimed as a township. It was in an area where they knew there were sink-holes. I just want to conclude by saying that the hon. member for Orange Grove is making a sink-hole of himself and of the United Party by continually raising this matter in this House.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, yesterday the hon. the Minister was almost overwhelmed with felicitations on his appointment as Minister of Mines. This is my opportunity to welcome him as Minister of Planning and to say that we hope he will take the earliest opportunity to give us as full an account as he can of what he conceives to be the duties of this Department. Up to now there has been a certain amount of uncertainty as to its scope and about how far its duties are going to extend. It is said that man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward. I think I can say, speaking politically, that the hon. the Minister is a young spark who has flown upwards. No doubt troubles lie ahead of him and I dare say some of those troubles may flow from the Vote which we are now discussing. But as far as the hon. the Minister himself is concerned, one can only hope that his troubles may only be little ones. That, by the way, will please his colleague to the left, i.e. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, very much! Yesterday the hon. the Minister struck a little bit of bother from the hon. member for Rosettenville who complained that the report of the Department of Mines had come into his possession only during the week-end. Well, as far as the Department of Planning is concerned the position is even worse&#x2014;we have no report at all. When we made inquiries last week whether we could have a copy we were told that it would be made available some time during the recess only. Consequently, is the report for the period up to December, 1965, which deals with the activities of the Department from August, 1964. We, therefore, have to depend upon the hon. the Minister to bring us up to date in view of the fact that we have no recent report to refer to. The hon. the Minister has inherited a new Department&#x2014;as a matter of fact, the report which I have just referred to was, I think, the first report from this Department. As I have said, it was never clearly defined what the functions of this Department would be. In the report for the period up to December, 1965,. there is a paragraph in which the Department sets out the functions allotted to it. May I say that these functions include much more than mere planning. I notice the Department already has five divisions&#x2014;the division of scientific planning, of physical planning, an executive division, an administrative division and a financial division. In paragraph 5 of the report it is, furthermore, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The name of the Department must not give rise to any misunderstanding. It is not intended that all planning for the country or for Government Departments or for other organizations or authorities should be done by the Department. On the contrary each Government Department or other authority retains the planning functions and tasks within its sphere as before.</block>

<p>Well, that is all right. However, I should have thought that one of the most important functions of the Department of Planning would have been to co-ordinate and to insist on coordination of the planning undertaken by the various Departments. I say this because we have had instances from time to time of Departments working in watertight compartments which resulted in a great waste of public money and fruitless expenditure.</p>

<p>A recent outstanding instance was that the Minister of Transport built a very expensive railway bridge and he had scarcely finished it when the Department of Water Affairs proceeded to start building a dam which would have submerged the bridge. The result was that the Railways had to build a deviation and another bridge, and the cost ran into millions of rands. I do not know who is going to pay for it except the public. That is an instance of a lack of co-ordination between Government Departments. It does indicate where the new Department of Planning could perform a useful function if it were clearly understood that any major planning should be co-ordinated by some central authority to make sure that there is no clash of interest.</p>

<p>As far as the physical planning is concerned, the Department has been charged, apart from actual planning, with administering the provisions of the Group Areas Act relating to various buildings, etc., and also the Natural Resources Development Act. The Department has taken over the professional staff of the Natural Resources Development Council and <span class="col_6565-6566" refersTo="page_0544"/>presumably the administrative staff, too, because one notices that in the Estimates there is no reference whatever to the Development Council beyond an amount of R200 as entertainment allowance for the Chairman of the Council. I am sure we do not begrudge him that, but there is no other reference to it, so presumably the whole of the machinery of the Council has been absorbed in the Minister&#x2019;s Department. Since we have no report, I hope the Minister will be able to bring us up to date on this not unimportant matter, because the control of land use which was provided for in that Act of 1947 has been proceeded with by the Council from that time, and in its report it refers to a number of these areas which have been declared controlled areas, but they are all 18 months or two years old, and I hope that the Minister will be able to bring us up to date. There is Area No. 1, the Free State, which was the first area to be declared, and that, according to the report, has been revised and the revision was to be available in 1966. Area No. 2, the West Rand, from Klerksdorp eastwards, was also to be revised and the revision was to be ready soon. Then there is Area No. 3, in the Eastern Transvaal, the gold mining area around Kinross. That was declared in 1955 and it has been reappraised. One would like to know whether that reappraisal has been completed. Area No. 8 is the Milnerton-Rietvlei area, which was to be ready by the end of 1966. Now, that is a very important one, because as the report points out, that plan will have an important effect on the planning for the new harbour, and if it is not finished yet it may hold up the planning of the new harbour. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us something about that. Then there is the Port St. Johns area. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>In contrast with the hon. member for Constantia, who has just sat down, I am highly appreciative of the work being done by this very young Department. The Department of Planning was founded only in August, 1964, and we have received only this one report on the activities of the Department, but even from this report it is clear that very good work was done under the dynamic guidance of the present Minister of Economic Affairs, who had to bring this Department to finality, and that a good deal of progress has been made in the expansion of this Department. Now that we have a new, young, energetic and dynamic Minister to handle this Department, I look forward to great progress by this Department in the years ahead. I therefore wish to take this opportunity to convey my hearty congratulations to the new Minister of this Department and to welcome him to this Department. It is my wish that he may receive all the necessary strength, vision and drive for the work of this Department, and I am convinced that with all his talents he is going to make a very great success of this young Department of Planning.</p>

<p>Of course the activities of this Department had to take shape gradually, because the ground it had to break was completely new. I do not intend covering the whole wide field this afternoon. There are particularly three important branches of the Department, i.e. economic planning, scientific planning and physical planning, but as other hon. members on this side will deal with other aspects, I should like, in the limited time available to me, to make a few observations on economic planning.</p>

<p>Here I want to refer in particular to the third part of the economic development programme, which we received only a few months ago, and as the opinion has been expressed that this economic development programme will not appear so regularly in future, I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that this programme will in fact appear regularly every year in future. It is said that it will now no longer be necessary to publish this programme so regularly and that one should rather leave it to the Stellenbosch Bureau for Economic Research. But if one considers what is in fact said by the Director of the Stellenbosch Bureau for Economic Research, one sees how rapidly conditions on the economic front change, with the result that such an economic programme cannot be formulated only every two years or more. I read to you from <i>Reappraisal for</i> 1967, by this Bureau for Economic Research, which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The findings of this reappraisal on the basis of the assumptions maintained throughout the forecast differ in many important respects from the conclusions reached in the original forecast published last December.</block>

<p>Within six months, therefore, the economic conditions changed to such an extent that the director had to state that his findings had changed radically. I would therefore suggest in all courtesy that we shall not be able to manage with fewer of these economic development programmes than once a year. I would therefore respectfully plead that the hon. the Minister should in future continue having this programme appear once a year. It may perhaps be in an abbreviated form, because the great basic work in connection with this programming has now been done and it can now be adjusted annually to the economic conditions, but it can certainly not appear only once every two years, for as I have said, economic conditions change so rapidly and so radically that we should have a survey of this programme at least once a year. I just want to give you one example of how unforeseen circumstances can make economic conditions change radically within a short period. Last year we had a maize crop of 55 million bags; this year we suddenly have a crop which is <span class="col_6567-6568" refersTo="page_0545"/>expected to come to more than 90 million bags. This is going to cause a very great change in the country&#x2019;s economic climate. And then I am not even mentioning all the other agricultural products which are being produced in abundance after the good rains we received. I therefore want to plead that the economic development programme should continue to appear annually as in the past, even if in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to what appears in the latest issue of the economic development programme, on page 138, where we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Exports are, to some extent, hampered by the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s major industrial complex is situated in the interior, and consequently transport costs to the harbours are high.</block>

<p>Now it so happens that any export industry has to be based on a considerable inland demand. We are now confronted with the problem that the largest demand is far in the interior, that our greatest industrial complex is far in the interior. I therefore want to ask the hon. the Minister to have a very thorough inquiry carried out on how we can reconcile a flourishing export trade with the tremendous distance between our inland industrial complex and our main harbours.</p>

<p>Without being provincialistic, I do want to break a lance for the Western Cape, an area which is separated from the Witwatersrand complex by the tremendous plains of the Karoo. I want to ask that an inquiry should be carried out to determine how our export potential here in the Western Cape can be increased, because this will determine whether we will be able to export profitably. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that in the light of this economic development programme he should devise plans to enable private initiative to stimulate industry in the Western Cape, in order that we may build up a flourishing export trade through the Cape Town harbour.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was asking the hon. the Minister to bring us up to date in regard to some of these controlled areas which were being re-appraised and examined, because they are all aspects of long-term planning and they are all very important areas in which future economic development will take place. I think that the way in which the Northern Free State has developed under this system is a very good testimonial to the value of the system which has been adopted. I believe that the increase in the European population of the Northern Free State is the highest in the Republic over recent years. It is not by any means due entirely to employment directly in the mining industry, but is due also to the balanced economy which has been built up and which is based on the mining industry. It has been planned in a scientific way.</p>

<p>I was asking the Minister how far they had progressed with the Port St. John area, which is a difficult one. Then there is another one, namely the St. Helena-Saldanha Bay area. The report says that the investigation and planning there should &#x201C;very soon be completed&#x201D;. This was written in 1965.</p>

<p>Finally, the report talks about the development atlas which is a very interesting document, and it says that that should have been available during 1966. I want to ask the Minister whether that is available yet and, if not, when can we expect it&#x003F; I think that will give a very good picture to the country of how the areas are being surveyed, examined and planned on a scientific basis. I think that I have said enough to indicate to the Minister that most of this information should have been in the hands of hon. members by now. I imagine that most of this information as far as the planned areas are concerned, or a great deal of it, will be contained in the report if and when we get it. So it will be in the Minister&#x2019;s own interests to see that we do have this information before his Vote comes up. Because, Sir, then we can discuss the facts and not only ask for them without being able to discuss them.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, I wish to say that when the Minister makes his statement, which I hope he will make, as to how he views the scope of his future activities as Minister of Planning, I hope that he will try and give us an idea of how far his Department is going to remain purely a department of planning, investigating and co-ordinating other people&#x2019;s plans, helping them through the various sub-sections, for instance the scientific division, and so on, and collecting the data on which sound planning has to be done; and in how far it is going to become just an ordinary Government Department administering the laws of the country. There are indications already in the report that it is beginning to administer certain laws and there are also indications, as we know, that it may go further. I think that it would be a pity if the two were to be confused. If we are going to have a Department of Planning, co-ordinating all the scientific research under the Research Institute and so on; if it is going to co-ordinate the planning of the various departments; if it is going to assist local authorities in their planning and carry on with the encouragement of development in the controlled areas, then I think that it is a full-time job and it should not be burdened with the day-to-day responsibility of administering laws and carrying on the day-to-day administration of legislation. I should like to have the Minister&#x2019;s views on that subject.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place I should like to convey my appreciation to the hon. members for Constantia and Paarl for their felicitations; or rather, the hon. member for Paarl congratulated me while the hon. member for Constantia welcomed me. I thank them for doing <span class="col_6569-6570" refersTo="page_0546"/>so. I just want to add to that my personal appreciation to my predecessor for the period after my appointment during which he acted in my stead. I just want to tell the House that it may perhaps not be generally appreciated that Minister Haak had to work particularly hard during this period because he himself was also taking over a new Department. In addition he had a tremendous deal to do with the preparation of new legislation. I am very grateful to him for that. Furthermore I just want to add that the bit I have seen of the Department induces me to say that we are also particularly grateful to him for the fact that in the short period of this Departments&#x2019; existence he has built it up to what it is at present. It is a Department which is active, which is functioning on a sound basis, and I think my predecessor, who was the first Minister of Planning, deserves all due credit for that. Now I want to tell hon. members that I have listened attentively to what they had to say. I shall reply as far as possible. In addition I shall also see to it that replies are sent by letter in respect of certain matters which were raised here and to which I am unable to give a reply off-hand. Hon. members will concede that in the short period I have been holding this office it is not possible to form a complete concept of the activities of the Department.</p>

<p>&#x2020;May I say to the hon. member for Constantia that the functions of the Department as such have been fully stated in the first report of the Department. One can therefore find a full statement on the functions of the Department in the report, which I noticed he had on his desk. Secondly, in welcoming me to this House, the hon. member made one or two observations. May I say that I occupied the same post in London as the hon. member, after many years had elapsed since he had been High Commissioner there. I can say without fear of contradiction that I found many people in the United Kingdom who still remembered the hon. member as High Commissioner. It was quite clear to me that he made very many friends for South Africa whilst he was over there. Of course the hon. member also left an impression there, as he has on this particular institution. I once spoke to a friend of mine and also a friend of his, and while having a word with him about the hon. member for Constantia, he made this observation: &#x201C;We got on well together. He was a very good High Commissioner for your country, but he did not smile too often.&#x201D; The hon. member expressed the hope that my troubles would be little ones. Of course, coming from a serious person like the hon. member for Constantia, I am going to take this very seriously indeed. With the incentive emanating from my friend, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, I hope that I will be able to report to this House at this time next year. The hon. member quite rightly pointed out that this Department is a Department which co-ordinates. May I say in general that as I see it&#x2014;I shall give further details in a minute&#x2014;in regard to economic planning, one could perhaps say that its function is the striking of a balance between the available natural resources and the needs of our people. In regard to physical planning, it is the coordination of the demands on the available land for different purposes. Scientific planning, to my mind, involves making the best use of the scientific achievements of this age and at the same time the utilization to the maximum of the available scientists. Scientific planning also requires one to make every endeavour to increase the number of scientists available in this country. I am just making these general observations in regard to the Department of Planning. I do not intend to give a resum&#x00E9; of how I see planning in South Africa in the year to come and in years to come.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Paarl referred to the economic development plan. He said quite rightly that the economic development plan should be available annually. I fully agree with him. I may tell him that we shall convey this to the Economic Advisory Council, namely that it is sound to make it available annually. I also want to say that if my memory serves me correctly, it has already been decided that this economic development plan will be available annually in an abbreviated form.</p>

<p>In respect of the Department as a whole, I noticed from conversations with various concerns and also with hon. members and other persons that there is some uncertainty as to what the Department of Planning should actually do and with regard to everything that pertains to the Department of Planning. For the sake of clarity I just want to give a brief resum&#x00E9; of everything that comes under this Department. In the first place the secretariat has three legs. Firstly, there is the economic leg, under which the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister comes. The Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister is an official in the Department of the Prime Minister, but he is also an adviser to the Minister of Planning. All other officials and the administrative work come under the Department of Planning. Secondly, there is the scientific leg. The Scientific Advisers and the Scientific Council of the Prime Minister form part of the Department of the Prime Minister, but are also advisers to the Minister of Planning. All other officials and administrative work come under the Department of Planning. Then there is the physical leg. The physical leg comes completely under the Department of Planning. This also includes the Resources and Planning Advisory Council, which at the beginning of 1966 replaced the old Natural Resources Development Council. That was a statutory council. This council is an advisory council under the Department of Planning. I just want to point out that the permanent committee does not form part of the Department of Planning. It comes under the Department of Economic Affairs. Also under the Department <span class="col_6571-6572" refersTo="page_0547"/>of Planning are the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the Bureau for Statistics and the administration of the Group Areas Act, with its amendments and the concomitant activities. Hon. members will therefore appreciate that it would be unwise of me to make a major policy statement on the Department of Planning this afternoon.</p>

<p>I shall, however, give a report on the activities of the past year. As far as the activities of the past year are concerned, I shall deal with them under the following heads: Economic planning, scientific planning and physical planning, and then group areas. I shall do so very briefly. In respect of economic planning there is, in the first place, the economic development progamme. In the course of this year the third programme was prepared, covering the six-year period 1965-1971. From both the previous two programmes it appeared that the 5.5 per cent growth-rate in the real gross domestic product is the indicated target growth-rate. It was consequently decided that in the third programme it would be adequate merely to analyse the implications of the target growth-rate. In other words, this programme will not be as comprehensive as the previous ones. Then, in respect of research projects, a consolidated inset-outset table for 1960-&#x2019;61, which is used for drafting the economic development programme, was completed in 1966. At present this table is being revised. As regards scientific planning, apart from making recommendations on the planning of development and the co-ordination of scientific matters, the following matters have also received attention: Firstly, there is an institute for coastal engineering. An inquiry was carried out into the establishment of an institute of the C.S.I.R. at Stellenbosch and in the Eastern Cape. The removal of the existing facilities from Pretoria to these centres has already been approved in principle. Secondly, in respect of the acquisition of land by the scientific division for the tracking station at Hartebeeshoek, an inquiry was carried out and certain recommendations made in respect of the possibility of interference waves. Furthermore, a joint committee was appointed which inquired into the problems experienced in preconstructed building techniques and materials, and which is intended to ensure the protection of the community against possible malpractices. South-West Africa was also visited in order to get up to date on research undertaken by the C.S.I.R. in this territory. Fourthly, the scientific division devoted attention to the loss of physicists to overseas countries, the so-called &#x201C;brain drain&#x201D; to overseas counties. A scheme for the collection of statistics on the migration of South African scientists and immigrants with university qualifications is being investigated in consultation with the Bureau for Statistics. In this regard I may just say that it is a matter of very serious concern to South Africa and also to other countries that so many of our scientists and in particular our research workers are lost. From my own experience I may say that these people are so engrossed in the research work undertaken by them overseas or wherever they may be that they are not aware of the possibilities South Africa offers them. They are simply not the kind of people who check to see what posts are available. I think it is absolutely essential that in this connection, possibly by way of personal contact, we should trace these persons and present them with the possibility of appointments here in South Africa, where their powers, skill, experience and learning may once again be utilized for the benefit of South Africa. I think the Scientific Advisory Council is certainly giving attention to this matter, and will successfully undertake certain tasks in this regard.</p>

<p>In respect of physical planning, apart from the continuation tasks in connection with control within the nine controlled areas established in terms of the provisions of the Natural Resources Development Act, the following matters also received attention: The Northern Cape and the water requirements in the Vaal River Basin. A report in connection with the future water requirements in the area was passed on to the Water Planning Commission. The compilation of a development plan for the Northern Cape, with its important mineral resources, will now be proceeded with. A transport study was undertaken in the Western Cape and has been completed by the University of Stellenbosch. In respect of the establishment of a harbour on the Namaqualand coast, an inquiry is being carried out into a suitable site for a possible fishing harbour and the provision of commercial facilities on the Namaqualand coast. As regards the Durban-Pietermaritzburg complex on the Natal South Coast, there are surveys and analyses of data for the compilation of development plans for this area, which is being undertaken by the Natal City and Regional Planning Commission in co-operation with the Department. In this matter the desired progress is being made. In respect of the development atlas to which the hon. member for Constantia referred, I may say that I already have the first part in my office and that it has been released and is available. It comprises the following aspects: physical background, social aspects, water, minerals and mines. This atlas is unique in its class; its compilation is a remarkable achievement and it will be of inestimable value in future planning, not only to the Department but to all concerns interested in any aspect whatsoever of planning. I may also inform you that an atlas in respect of the following sections will later appear: agriculture, communications, industry, commerce, financing, economic aspects and possible regions for development.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the valuable glass-sand deposits on the Cape Flats have been investigated. This inquiry is proceeding according to expectations and a report will possibly be made in the course of 1967. In respect of the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex a survey of this <span class="col_6573-6574" refersTo="page_0548"/>area was commenced with in the course of the year with the object of drawing up a development plan. In connection with research and the training of planners I want to say the following. As a result of the acute shortage of town and regional planners close liaison will be maintained with universities offering courses in planning and with other interested concerns. If universities are more fully informed on the activities of the various planning bodies a more valuable contribution could be made to the solution of problems. Moreover, universities can undertake certain planning projects independently, thereby stimulating basic research where it is most necessary.</p>

<p>The Department also devoted attention to the question of noise and safety at airports. Particularly as a result of the problems experienced overseas in densely built-up areas, a committee was appointed to give timeous attention to this problem in South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say the following. During the year the demarcation of the country into development regions received attention. For statistical purposes the economic regions were taken as a basis. This is a very concise tabulation of the activities during 1966.</p>

<p>The last matter I want to refer to is group areas. Here I just want to give hon. members the following figures. Up to 31st December, 1966, 1,022 group areas, border strips and business areas were proclaimed in the Republic. Classified according to race groups, these represent the following:</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>White</p></td>

<td><p>550</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Coloured</p></td>

<td><p>283</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Indian</p></td>

<td><p>129</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Chinese</p></td>

<td><p>4</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Malay</p></td>

<td><p>1</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Bantu</p></td>

<td><p>8</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>To this should be added 47 border s ps and two business areas. In respect of the business areas hon. members may perhaps be interested to know that one was proclaimed in Port Elizabeth and the other in Pretoria. As far as beach areas are concerned, the allocation of beach amenities for the various race groups in the Cape Province has been commenced with, save for four areas, i.e. East London, Knysna, Port St. Johns and Komga. In other words, the entire Cape Province has been covered.</p>

<p>With this very concise tabulation of the activities of last year and with the few observations I have made in respect of the functioning of the policy of the Department in future I just want to emphasize once again that it would be unwise of me to make a major policy statement at this stage. But I want to tell hon. members that I intend visiting all provinces in South Africa during the recess. I think it is quite impossible and would be unwise to take decisions in respect of planning unless one has made a personal inspection and has at least seen as much as possible of the Republic with a view to future development. In order to carry out these inspections, I have already instructed my Department to arrange for me 14 visits of two days each during the recess. I exclude Cape Town and Pretoria from these, of course, because we spend one half of the year here in Cape Town and the other half in Pretoria. In any event, I intend paying two visits to the O.F.S., three to Natal, three to the Transvaal rural areas, two to the Witwatersrand-Vaal-Triangle, three to the Cape and one to South-West Africa&#x2014;altogether 14 visits of two days each. The officials of my Department who are concerned with the matter will of course accompany me. I hope to announce a full programme before the end of June, so that local bodies and other interested concerns may take note of it timeously, in order that my visit may be as fruitful as possible and that we may see everything which is necessary.</p>

<p>After these introductory remarks I want to say that I shall listen seriously and attentively to anything else hon. members have to say.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>It is a great privilege to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his maiden speech as Minister of Planning. I think this House can be proud of this young Minister who is now taking charge of this young Department. We are grateful for the survey he has just given us and for the promise it holds, that we can expect much of him in the days ahead. At the beginning of his speech the hon. the Minister made an important statement, a statement I want to underline. This is that we are dealing with a Department which stands on three legs&#x2014;i.e. the Economic Advisory Council, the Scientific Advisory Council and the Resources and Planning Advisory Council. These three important bodies must bring the future development in our country to finality. Jointly and severally they must ensure, in the first place, that there is sustained and systematic economic growth in South Africa as a whole. We are particularly grateful that the Minister himself, as he indicated with regard to his visits, is also seeing South Africa as a whole. A second task of these advisory councils is to see to it that the natural resources of our country will be developed to their optimum. Finally they have to see to it&#x2014;and to me this is very important &#x2014;that sustained technological development is maintained in all sectors of our economy. I am therefore particularly pleased to hear from the Minister that the whole of South Africa will be taken care of.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Chairman, I hope you will allow me to refer here to a particular part of our country. In doing so I am not suggesting that it is a part which is deliberately neglected. My approach is completely different. But I want to plead with the hon. the Minister and is planners to see to it that everything in their power will be done in order that the rural areas may also get their due share of the development taking place in our country<b>.</b> The contribution the rural areas have made and will yet make in future to the development <span class="col_6575-6576" refersTo="page_0549"/>of our country is vast and important. Professor Boulding of the University of Chicago wrote on one occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was not the spinning jenny which triggered off the industrial revolution, but technological development which took place at that time in agriculture, thereby setting free people for industry.</block>

<p>What happened at that time has also happened in our fatherland. And this is true. Because it is the rural areas, both the rural regions and the people in our towns, who when the development took place provided the people who left their own neighbourhoods and in that way brought about industrial development on a tremendous scale, though in regions other than those in which they live and dwell. It is the sons and daughters of the rural areas who made this possible. Here I am thinking, <i>inter alia</i>, of Vanderbijlpark, Sasolburg, the Free State gold-fields&#x2014;in short, development throughout our country. This development was founded on the manpower drawn from the rural areas. Then it is also these areas which are seeing to it that the necessary food and raw materials are provided to make the development possible.</p>

<p>It is on these grounds that I want to plead for these areas to-day. Of all the important resources the human resources are in my view still the most important. The rural areas are sometimes referred to as left behind in the economic field, but they are the factory where the people are produced who enable a country and a nation to forge ahead. But no rural areas can afford producing people of the highest quality simply to lose them and to surrender them to other regions. If it is not going to bleed to death, it cannot afford this. This is the reason why I want to plead to-day with the planners of this Department to see to it that the planning of the rural areas will not be neglected, not with regard to any services. Here I want to refer in particular to teaching and education.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Then I leave it at that. But the rural areas have another great function to fulfil, and that is that they have to serve as a place of rest and relaxation for our urbanized people. Our planners should bear this in mind and provide the necessary facilities in order that there may always be an opportunity for our city-dwellers to come and relax if they become tired of the concrete urban environment in which they have to work and live. We are convinced that if the rural areas are taken care of in future, just as in the past years, they will also contribute their share in providing people for the labour market, in providing leaders of industry, in providing cultural leaders and national leaders.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>In the ten minutes available to me I also want to say something about the matter raised by the hon. member for Smithfield. But in the first place I must say that we on this side of the House welcome the fact that the hon. the Minister was wise enough to say that he was not going to be so unwise as to make a broad policy statement in connection with his Department at this stage. This is understandable, of course, because the hon. Minister took over this Department only a few months ago. We welcome the fact that he said that he was going to visit every province, and in particular that he wanted to make 14 visits of two days each to bring himself up to date on each area. Personally I welcome the fact that the Minister said that they were compiling a development plan for the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area and that we would hear more about that in future.</p>

<p>The matter I want to raise is the following. In 1964 a report appeared on a regional survey in the Western Cape, and many important people served on this committee of inquiry, people who certainly have a good knowledge of their subject. In speaking of the Western Cape, and also from the inquiry carried out by this committee, one notices that they drew a line from Humansdorp more or less to Colesberg and then all along the Orange River, and that they regarded everything to the west of that line as the Western Cape, and of course they made surveys in the various regions. As far as the Peninsula and the South-Western districts are concerned, I think this committee did excellent work, but I am somewhat disappointed, not in the work they did but in the slight attention they devoted to the area which falls inside that horse-shoe, here in the Cape. I am speaking on the same aspect which the hon. member for Smithfield raised, the rural areas. Here we find the major portion of the Cape rural areas. Within this horse-shoe, down the west coast, all along the South-Western districts and then to the Eastern Province and upwards along the native areas, we find these rural areas. That large portion on the inside is the rural areas of the Cape, and all this committee could report to have found of interest was that there were certain mineral resources in the North-Western Cape; there were limestone and gypsum and certain other things which could be exploited, but apart from those the entire development of the interior of the Cape depended on a few things like irrigation farming and the further expansion of our sheep-farming and stock-breeding in that region. This was just about all they could tell us about this area. I think anybody&#x2019;s heart would ache if he travelled through this large part of the Cape and asked himself whether nothing could be done to develop such a large area of South Africa. I want to repeat that it is not only the major part of the rural areas of the Cape, but I would almost venture to say that it is the major part of the rural areas of South Africa. <span class="col_6577-6578" refersTo="page_0550"/>If one considers what the commission on the population of the rural areas said some years ago, one comes to the conclusion that from 1904 until 1958 the white percentage in the rural areas decreased from 47 per cent to 18 per cent. At present the percentage is likely to be much smaller, and here in the Cape one has this tremendous area which is lying fallow. The question I now want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether he should not ask his Department to inquire into the possibilities of this large Karoo area, over and above the Northern Cape and the Western Cape. Surveys are being carried out in connection with oil, and this is appreciated. The Minister told us yesterday that important facts were being discovered. This is most certainly so in respect of the search for oil. But I am almost convinced, and when one speaks to people who know those regions then they are also convinced of this, that there are still great mineral resources lying undiscovered in the large inland areas of the Cape. It cannot only be gypsum and limestone and asbestos. It is therefore our request that this area, which is still lying fallow, should be investigated, because over and above the fact that we may perhaps still have large mineral resources, there may still be great possibilities for white settlement in those areas. Over and above the fact that the Orange River scheme will bring water down to the northern part of the Karoo, I think other steps could also be taken to develop that region. I repeat that it strikes one to see how many of these small towns are becoming ghost towns. Where once one found high schools, there is at present such a dearth of young people that they have only secondary schools in some towns. In some cases there are not even secondary schools, but only primary schools. If there is one task the Minister could take upon himself, it is to see whether something cannot be done regarding these rural parts of the Cape. Here in the Cape he has fallow ground to explore.</p>

<p>Now the Minister wants me to give him a plan, but surely his Department is the Department of Planning&#x003F; They are the people who should carry out the inquiry. I listened closely to the hon. the Minister when he told us what the functions of his Department would be. I regard surveys as one of the most important functions of his Department, because one can never draw up a plan unless one has first made a survey. One must first carry out an inquiry, and then one draws up one&#x2019;s plan. I see one hitch as far as this Department of Planning is concerned, of course. Who sees to it that the plans submitted by it are carried out&#x003F; Just in passing, in this specific survey which was made in the Western Cape there were interesting recommendations, particularly in connection with transport. Who sees to it that those recommendations are put into effect&#x003F; If we ask the Minister to carry out an investigation and surveys, his Department should do so, because I do not regard these surveys which were made by this committee in respect of the inland areas of the Cape as adequate.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park that the hon. the Minister and his Department of Planning will plan systematically in the Republic. The hon. member for Durban (Point) would also do well to remember that even Durban (Point) will be properly planned by this Government and by this Department. [Interjection.] I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban (Point) that I have only 10 minutes, and I am not going to give him half of that in which to interrupt me. I want to take this opportunity to make a few requests to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>First I just want to tabulate them. In the first place I want to ask him to appoint a committee&#x2014;and I would say preferably the committee which demarcated the coastline of the Cape&#x2014;to demarcate the coastline of Natal for the various population groups in consultation with the Administrator of Natal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Look at the mess made by the Torlage Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is welcome to say that what was done by the Torlage Committee was a mess. I could not care less. But I know that the best was done for South Africa, for the Cape, for all the population groups of the Republic as regards the demarcation of the Cape coastline. That being so, we come from Natal and we ask for the same. We ask that justice should also be done by all the population groups of Natal on that Natal coastline. That is the first request I want to make to the Minister. [Interjections.] I am coming to the anglers.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to ask the Minister whether he will see to it, in consultation with the Administrators of Natal and the Cape, that all the natural forest along our coastline are not destroyed as a result of the establishment and expansion of towns. I feel that to the people who want to get away from the cities, the people who travel along our coastal roads at present, those areas are very important because in that way they can enjoy a part of nature which is at present unfortunately being wiped out through the establishment and expansion of towns along our coastline.</p>

<p>In the third place I want to ask the Minister to see to it, as Minister of Planning, in cooperation with the relevant departments, that inland pleasure and recreational resorts are demarcated for the various population groups. I am just mentioning this; I shall try to come back to it. In conjunction with this I want to ask that public gardens, public parks, for example here I am going to mention names&#x2014; <span class="col_6579-6580" refersTo="page_0551"/>Cape Town&#x2019;s botanical gardens inside the municipal area of Cape Town, should also enjoy attention. When we come up against city councils which are obstinate; city councils which sabotage the Government&#x2019;s policy; which fail to implement the national policy, which do not give the people of Cape Town, for example, what is due to them &#x2026;</p>

<p>I bow to your ruling, Sir. Allow me to motivate my first point. The committee which demarcated the Cape coastline gained sound experience of that task. I therefore want to ask the Minister that because the committee has already gained experience, it should also demarcate the Natal coastline. In that way we shall get uniformity on the coastlines of these two provinces, i.e. the Cape and Natal. We shall have a committee which produces work of the same standard in respect of demarcation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I want to ask that this committee should be a standing committee. [Interjections.] It is cheering to hear the United Party shout like that, because if they shout like that I know that I am dealing with the best cause and with the good cause. Then I know that I am right and that they are wrong. A coastline can only be demarcated by a committee which takes a broader view than&#x2014;with all due respect&#x2014; local persons could take. In Natal the coast line cannot only be demarcated for a local authority; it cannot only be demarcated for the province of Natal. It is demarcated in the interests of all the people in the Republic of South Africa, with its different population groups, and with due regard for the needs of each of those population groups. I want to say that this can be done by a committee which has already done something similar in the Cape and has thus gained the necessary experience to be able to do so successfully in Natal as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Who will be the chairman of that committee&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>There is a chairman at the moment. The hon. member for Durban (Point) thinks that I am after the chairmanship &#x2026; [Interjections.] A moment ago he insinuated that I wanted to be chairman of that committee. For that reason I am now telling him unequivocally that I am not pleading for myself&#x2014;I am pleading for the people of the Republic of South Africa and I am also pleading for his people in Durban (Point).</p>

<p>Why has it become necessary that this coastline should be demarcated. I quote from <i>The Daily News</i> of 2nd May, 1967, to give an example of why it is necessary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Durban city council deputation is likely to seek an interview with the Minister of Community Development to discuss the provision of permanent beaches for non-Whites in the city.</block>

<p>That shows you, Sir, that there is a need for the finalization of this matter in Natal and also in Durban. I therefore want to request the Minister, in consultation with the hon. the Administrator-in-Executive-Council of Natal, to let this committee go to Natal as well.</p>

<p>I now want to make a few observations in connection with our natural forests. The man who wants to get away from the cities for angling and recreational purposes, or for any reason whatsoever, perhaps even just to go and look at nature, nowadays travels along our coastal roads, and if the establishment of towns along our coasts continued along the present lines, he would in future have to drive through towns and cities all the way. I therefore want to plead that some of these natural forests along our coastline should be preserved and protected. I want to mention specifically a place such as Blombos in the Cape. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not here at the moment, but he will know the place I am speaking of. There are also parts of the Natal coastline where there are beautiful forests, and they must be preserved for the future. I feel that this matter should be tackled in cooperation with the Minister, who has control over the entire Republic of South Africa, and not only by one province. Thus we will be able to have this systematic planning throughout the country.</p>

<p><span class="col_6581-6582" refersTo="page_0552"/>I now come to my next point. These inland recreation resorts, these public leisure and pleasure resorts, should enjoy more attention in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Klip River will pardon me if I do not try to follow him down the Natal coastline. If I did so, I might well come to the reason why he put on the shoe and said that he did not want to be chairman of the commission, although nobody said so. With reference to what the hon. the Minister said in connection with the C.S.I.R. and research, I should like to devote some minutes to this. Then I want to come to one of the areas which has not been proclaimed as such. As for the C. S.I.R. and its activities, it is a body of which we in this country are just as proud as we are of the research institution at Onderstepoort. With the powers available to them they are certainly doing all they can. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister, however, that we do not have nearly enough purely scientific research workers. I know the Minister is aware of that; he mentioned that. He mentioned the powers we were losing. He said that perhaps those people were not aware of the posts available in our country and that as a result we did not get them back. I do want to bring it to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s notice, however, that so many of the pure research workers come to a stage where they do administrative work. They do not remain in scientific research work as such, and in that way we lose many people. We know of many of them who are wonderful search workers. But it does not take long before such a person becomes the head of a department. Then he is put to work on administrative duties and we lose his powers. A research worker is a person who is almost born to that; he is not a man who is simply trained for that. He has the knack for that pure kind of research. I could mention names from the distant past and from the war years, of people in our country who refused to be employed administratively. They finally left their country and went to other countries where they could continue with the research they were so eager to do. I want to point out to the Minister, without drawing unfavourable comparisons, that apart form the funds which are available to the C.S.I.R. the position does no': compare well with that of the Scientific Research Council in Australia, and this applies particularly to the funds made available to them for specific projects. I have neither the opportunity nor the time to go into these specific projects on this occasion. However, I want to mention one with which I am conversant and with which I had a great deal to do. I just want to mention what that Government in Australia makes available to the Scientific Research Council for research on fibres, and particularly in respect of wool, because it is such an important product of that country. That research is so far ahead of the effort made in this country to undertake scientific research in connection with the wool fibre that the two do not even bear comparison. According to the latest figures I have seen, that Government makes 11 million dollars available to the Scientific Research Council in Australia, just for wool research as such. In addition they make tremendous amounts available for fibre research, that is, for fibres other than wool fibres. I am just mentioning this to the hon. the Minister. I started off by saying that we lacked researchers to do the research work we wanted to do, and which I know is even planned by the C.S.I.R. They do not have adequate powers to do so. In the second place they need more funds. In my view it is one of the most important matters in the country. There must be research in many fields, and also in respect of agriculture.</p>

<p>I should like to leave this matter and deal with the controlled areas and the development areas referred to by the hon. the Minister. He mentioned some of them in particular, and also the development area Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage. I want to make a plea with the hon. the Minister in respect of the East London-King William&#x2019;s Town area. This area must receive attention, and must receive it soon. It must receive serious attention as a large development area. I mention this for a variety of reasons. The first is that that area is the natural flow-off area on the southern side of the Drakensberg. It has water resources equalled by few areas in the Republic. The Kei River, the Tzitzikamma River, the Buffels River and many other rivers form the flow-off from the Drakensberg. The area has a constant rainfall. It is in the eastern region, where there is a fairly high rainfall. Strangely enough the water resources available in that part of the country have never received attention. There has never been a proper inquiry in that connection, nor into the utilization of land and basic materials in that area.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell at length on the additional resources in that area, for example labour. I discussed that in another debate, and I shall discuss it again. In that area certain labour sources are available to us. But other resources are also available there. There are mineral resources and ore resources. We know that there are coal deposits which have not been properly exploited. We know that there are ore deposits. We know that they are found in Aliwal North. We know that they are found in Indwe. We know that they are found in Elliot. We know that they are found in various regions, such as Molteno. For some reason or other that area has not received the attention enjoyed by the other proclaimed areas. I wonder why we devote such a remarkable deal of attention to the west coast. Oceanographic research has been undertaken along the west coast, and much more intensively than in any other area, while that particular <span class="col_6583-6584" refersTo="page_0553"/>part of the east coast has never received the share of the research due to it. Apart from that, that area has a harbour which is not even fully utilized. It is one of our good harbours, which may be further expanded. I am not speaking of this because it is the constituency I represent in this House. It is because that is the area which in my view considering its natural resources and labour, has a great potential. It appears to me as though it is one of the areas which should enjoy the highest priority when it comes to development regions. I want to go further. The utilization of land in that part of the Eastern Cape has fallen far behind. In respect of the banks of the rivers and the land available to us, the research institutions we have there are minimal. They are manned by the minimum staff. Thus, for example, you may go and look at the research institution in East London and also at the institution at Dohne. I think this matter should enjoy the serious attention of the Minister. The Minister should give attention to how the planning board should plan for the entire Republic. I want to ask that in this connection this area should enjoy the highest priority. I think that if the Minister were to give serious consideration to this and discuss the matter with his board, they would be convinced that it is an area which has been left behind and which has potential equalled by few other areas.</p>

<p>If I can spend the time I still have available on this, I should like to refer to the proclamation of beach areas and beach amenities in the Peninsula and in the Port Elizabeth area, which have already been proclaimed. We do not know why there is such a delay in respect of the other Cape areas. The inquiry has been completed. It was completed quite some while ago. I want to ask that the proclamation of those areas should now be finalized. We know about the planning that has to be done in respect of the entire coastal region in the area where I come from. We should like to know where the beach areas have been proclaimed or where they will be proclaimed. We want to know what section of the population they will serve. Only then could one undertake proper planning.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. with reference to what the hon. member for East London (City) said about the west coast, and to the question he asked with regard to why so much oceanographic research was being done there, I just want to tell him that the west coast and the large areas of Namaqualand as well as my constituency form the country of the future. Along the west coast there are the fish potential and the mineral potential. Nor is there much doubt as to " horn that large region belongs to.</p>

<p>I am glad that the activities of the Department of Planning are clearly set out in the annual report. It is just a pity that there still &#x003F; appear to be hon. members who have not taken the trouble to read through this report. If they had done so, they would have been informed.</p>

<p>There are a few matters I want to raise to-day. To some of them the hon. the Minister has fortunately already replied. The first relates to the question of our loss of manpower. We know that a manpower centre has been established and is acting in co-operation with the National Bureau for Educational and Social Research. We have information on the physicists who are abroad, in which regard surveys have been made. Because we are concerned about this loss in brain-power, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister how much progress has been made in this comprehensive plan for tracing and recruiting scientists who go abroad. An exchange of scientists with the outside world could be a good thing, but then we should nevertheless like to have these people back if they belonged to us in the first place.</p>

<p>Then it is indeed a pleasure to me to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department on this development atlas to which he referred. The atlas appeared last year, and as he said, the first part comprises the physical background, social aspects and also minerals and water. I want to say that it is indeed a prestige publication. It contains a mass of information and I think it may serve, in accordance with its declared purpose, to provide prospective investors with an over-all survey of the country&#x2019;s resources and potential on a continuous basis. It can serve as a guide for physical planning purposes and the utilization of the country&#x2019;s resources.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that I now want to speak on resources, I want to go further and make some observations on economic development on a regional basis. This is a school of thought and a trend which has established itself in all countries of the world in recent years. Since 1955. 22 planning regions with planning machinery in respect of every region and with co-ordination on a central level have been instituted in France. In respect of England there is also already an administrative structure for the implementation of regional planning. In respect of South Africa I just want to quote the following from a paper by Mr. G. S. I. Kuschke, the managing director of the T.D.C. At the symposium on regional development during October last year he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The serious problems associated with the limited water supplies and availability of labour as experienced to varying degrees in Cape Town, on the Reef and Port Elizabeth; the scarcity of available or potential industrial land in the Durban complex as well as traffic problems and growing unit costs of engineering services, underline the fact that time is at a premium to give practical effect to the development of new regions of industrial activity.</block>

<p>Broadly speaking such views on the development of the country&#x2019;s economy have been encouraged <span class="col_6585-6586" refersTo="page_0554"/>through the years by the Natural Resources Development Council and also by the present Resources and Planning Advisory Council. As regards the classification of regions according to stages of economic development, we have in recent times heard about four kinds of regions, based on an original classification by a certain Mr. Friedman of the United States of America. He mentions the four kinds of economic regions. Firstly the metropolitan regions, such as Cape Town, the Rand and Durban-Pinetown. Then he mentions the development axles. These are regions along the main transport routes between the large cities. He mentions the settlement regions or &#x201C;frontier regions&#x201D;. That is how the Free State gold-fields came into being. Then he mentions the left-behind areas, the &#x201C;depressed areas&#x201D;. To me this is of particular importance because many parts of the rural areas fall in this group, as also my region.</p>

<p>I cannot devote even a second to the hon. member. Now, during the past 25 years approximately 50 development associations have come into being on a loose basis throughout the country. There is a great deal of duplication in the activities of these associations, on which people serve who are interested in the development of their regions. The Resources and Planning Advisory Council divided the country into development regions. I just want to mention that this division was actually for the purpose of collecting statistics, and not specifically for the purpose of regional development. Although it is essential for statistical purposes, I nevertheless want to plead that as regards the classification of regions in future, for the explicit object of compiling blueprints for development, a decision should now be taken. As a first step in that direction I want to recommend that a country-wide conference of development associations should be held under the Resources and Planning Council to eliminate duplication and to define these boundaries tentatively at this stage, in order that the boundaries may include regions with more or less homogenous interests. Then other sub-regions may be classified for development under the four main classes of regions of which we have already heard. I feel that development associations, particularly in the depressed regions, would then benefit. They could then continue with their economic surveys and with the compilation of blue-prints for development. I feel hat it will then be easier for the Government and the Resources and Planning Advisory Council to establish planning machinery to implement this policy of regional development.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the Coloured representatives I should like to convey to the Minister our congratulations on his appointment and I hope that he will have a successful term of office. I hope that we will have his co-operation in the matters affecting the Coloured people and that we will be able to talk to him man to man on matters which we feel should come to his knowledge. I am sorry that the hon. member for Klip River is not here but I do not intend to say much about the commission appointed in regard to the sea coasts. All I want to say to the hon. the Minister is that if ever again he appoints a commission, he must see to it that one thing does not happen again, as happened when I attended one particular meeting, and only one, because I was so disgusted as to what happened there that I would not attend any more. I want to tell the hon. the Minister what happened. The mayor of Hermanus gave evidence for the municipality of Hermanus and asked that the Commission should accept the findings of the municipality in regard to the removal of the Coloured people from the coastline. What happened next was something that I had never seen in my life before as a lawyer. The Mayor of Hermanus left the witness stand and went to take his seat as a member of the commission. That I understand from my colleague, the hon. member for Outeniqua, happened throughout the other deliberations. When the mayor of the town finishes his evidence, he then became a judge by being a member of the commission. How we, as Coloured representatives, could convince a member of the commission that the evidence which he gave as a witness was wrong, I think even the hon. the Minister will agree is beyond understanding. I did not attend another meeting. I only hope that will not happen again.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he has inherited a lot of trouble. I feel sorry for him in one respect, namely in regard to group areas. It is an unpopular subject of discussion. It is unpopular but it is the law of the land. The Department must know that if ever an Act is regarded by the Coloureds as a vicious Act, it is the Group Areas Act. They regard it as such and they hope that it will be implemented in such a way as to cause the minimum of hardship. It is no use us going into the past. That is the law of the land and it is going to be carried out because it is necessary, as we have been told, and we accept it, for the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. It is the law of the land and we accept it. But when this Act has to be implemented in some form or other, surely we are entitled to point out to the hon. the Minister and the Government that some of the proclamations are most unjust, and unnecessary and that there is no cally sufficient reason for such a proclamation. One of the cases I now want if deal with is the case of Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. If ever there was a case where there was no need for the proclamation first of the hamlet &#x2026;</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Therefore I want to appeal to this hon. Minister to de-proclaim this particular group area. I should like to give him some of the history attached to this. The municipality of Somerset West has a Coloured housing scheme right outside the town. A few years ago they wanted to extend it, passed the necessary plans and submitted them to the then Department of Housing. They were actually promised a loan for the extension. So they wanted to proceed with the work. But then the Strand municipality said &#x201C;stop&#x201D;. That gave rise to a reconsideration of the whole question of the Coloured boundary. Well, I am satisfied that eventually the Coloureds will go from Somerset West and also from the Strand. But here we have a little hamlet, called Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass &#x2014;right away from the white people; all on its own and hundreds of years old. There is no reason at all for declaring this little hamlet a white area. My advice to the hon. the Minister is to leave it as it is. The hon. member for Peninsula raised this specific matter during the No-Confidence Debate. The reply of the hon. the Minister of Community Development can be found in column 284 of the first weekly edition of the Hansard for this Session. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with previous hon. members as far as the welcome they extended to the Minister and as far as the congratulations they conveyed to him on his appointment to this portfolio are concerned. We of the Witwatersrand in particular are grateful that we now have a person in charge of this portfolio who is acquainted with the problems and circumstances of the Witwatersrand and in particular with those of the Witwatersrand-Pretoria-Vereeniging complex. I am convinced that we shall be able to co-operate very cordially in the future and that we have in the hon. the Minister a person with a sympathetic understanding of the problems of that area. If one looks at this Witwatersrand-Pretoria-Vereeniging area one involuntary comes to the conclusion that that is the area where one finds the heaviest concentration of the population in the Republic at present. If one tries to make an analysis of the future one involuntarily comes to the conclusion that that is the area with the biggest growth potential. Therefore <span class="col_6589-6590" refersTo="page_0556"/>we are glad that the hon. the Minister is acquainted with circumstances there. Of course, we have also had the most cordial co-operation from the predecessor of the hon. The Minister. Therefore I do not want what I have just said in regard to the present hon. Minister to be regarded as any reflection on his predecessor. We are naturally grateful for what he has been able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell on the economic and the scientific aspects of planning. As regards the physical aspect of planning, however, I want to express the hope that he will develop to perfection the pattern which this aspect of planning has already taken. The pattern we have at present is the so-called three-level pattern&#x2014;first the wider central umbrella under the Department of Planning, then the provincial level and then the local authority level. We should like to see this particular pattern being developed to perfection. If one makes a study of planning throughout the world, one finds that this is one of the forms of planning, particularly physical planning, which comes as close to the ideal as possible. But at present we find that something is still not functioning properly in the implementation of this plan and that is the existing lack of legislation to give real authority to the provinces to play their part. The provinces have been trying for a considerable time to get legislation, an amendment of the Financial Relations Act, to invest them with those powers. I now seriously want to bring it to the attention of the Minister&#x2014;he is most probably not aware of this&#x2014; that we must try to rectify this matter as soon as possible. I want to say to-day that the other provinces are somewhat envious when they look at the planning which is at present being done in Natal because Natal does have a body which can do this kind of physical planning in that province. Whether or not we agree with what that body is doing&#x2014;I do not want to go into that&#x2014;the machinery which Natal has to do this kind of work is the machinery which the other provinces would also like to have to enable them to do that work. But as the Financial Relations Act stands at present, the provinces are not able to create that machinery and they have to find various roundabout ways of getting past the Public Service Commission to get the establishment for doing that work. As a person who has had a great deal to do with the practical implementation of this kind of thing, I say that this is an awkward state of affairs and we should like to see an end being made to this state of affairs and the necessary amendments being effected to that Act.</p>

<p>As far as the other matter is concerned, the planning of this entire P.W.V. area, we hope to receive further reports in regard to this planning before long. I may say that at the present moment a very complete survey has been made in this area with reference to recreation resorts. It is likely&#x2014;I do not know whether the Minister wants to tell us that now&#x2014;that an announcement will be made before long in connection with the report which has been in the hands of his Department for a considerable period. I anticipate that we will receive further reports in the foreseeable future, as a matter of fact, the Minister also said this afternoon that separate reports would be presented on the various facets of the planning of this area. This is a very important survey. I must say that one regrets the fact that the survey could not have been completed at an earlier stage, but as a result of the tremendous shortage of manpower one has to work as fast as the human material at one&#x2019;s disposal allows one to do.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is all I have to say, but in conclusion I want to add that I do not think that we can speak with sufficient appreciation of the work being done by and the assistance we are receiving from our universities, particularly in connection with physical planning. I want to make special mention of the Northern Cape project, a project which involves the catchment area of the entire Vaal River. We want to speak very highly of the work being done by the Potchefstroom University in particular in conducting that survey for us. I think that is an outstanding job of work which will definitely be of great assistance to the Department in the planning of that entire area.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to talk this afternoon about the planning of the Tugela basin. This area is one with tremendous resources and is therefore one with tremendous potential. The development of this potential would naturally be of great benefit to that area generally, but it would do far more than that. As I pointed out in a previous speech, in this House, it would have a chain reaction throughout Natal which would give the entire province of Natal an enormous boost industrially, economically and agriculturally.</p>

<p>To give some idea of the extent of the resources available in the Tugela basin, I would draw attention to the survey prepared by the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission, to which the hon. member for Benoni has just referred in the very highest terms. This body has come to the conclusion that the Tugela basin resources are sufficient to support six Johannesburgs, six Cape Towns, four Pretorias, four Durbans and a metropolis the size of Greater London. This, Sir, is huge potential indeed. Some of its advantages are that it has almost unlimited water resources; 3,000 million gallons a day flow down the Tugela River to its mouth. It has large deposits of coal and abundant labour resources. It is centrally situated between the large markets of the Southern Transvaal and the Free State and the Durban-Pietermaritzburg complex. The main Durban-Johannesburg electric railway and Escom power lines traverse the basin, and so on.</p>

<p>I believe that the time has come when the Government must say clearly and unequivocally what plans, if any, it has to stimulate the development of the Tugela basin resources. <span class="col_6591-6592" refersTo="page_0557"/>With this arises the vital question of what part should the Department of Planning play. I want to make the suggestion this afternoon that the Department of Planning should merely ensure that the necessary stimulus for this enormous development is provided and that thereafter it should not involve itself with the detailed planning. This aspect, I believe, should properly be left to the body that the hon. member for Benoni has spoken so highly of, namely the Natal Town and Regional Planning Commission, because it has already conducted such extensive surveys that it is in the position to develop this potential to its fullest.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that right now. I come immediately to what is required to stimulate or spark off the full and proper development of the potential of this basin. These investigations I have referred to have gone into this aspect of the matter and they have come to the conclusion quite clearly that what is required is an industry which will give rise to what they refer to as &#x201C;the process of cumulative causation&#x201D; which would enable the area to develop its own market in the sense that it could launch itself into a state of sustained growth similar to that of the Witwatersrand or Durban or any other major industrial area. I point out that this survey has come to the conclusion that a highly labour-intensive industry, such as a textile industry or several textile industries, would not be sufficient to provide this spark which would enable the full development of this area to go ahead. Quite clearly the type of industry which is most suited to this is a steel industry, an Iscor. One knows that there is already a great deal of speculation as to whether the Government will or will not establish the third Iscor in the Tugela basin, and we in Natal naturally hope that it will be either in the Tugela basin or somewhere in the Richard&#x2019;s Bay area which is the other alternative which has been suggested. But if the Government decides that the third Iscor should be placed elsewhere, then I think&#x2014;and I urge the Minister of Planning to see to it and to ensure that it happens&#x2014;that some other industry of that nature which could have the effect of providing the spark necessary for this development should be encouraged to establish itself in that area.</p>

<p>The Government has said a great deal about the development of under-developed areas and there is no doubt that to raise the living standards of South Africa&#x2019;s population it is essential to develop the economies of the rural and semi-rural, as well as the more highly industrialized areas. The Government has tended up to now to concentrate this type of development in the border areas, and as a result it is tending to stimulate the Bantustans. It is time that the Government develops the white rural areas which also require this stimulus, and in this way we will ensure the raising of the living standards of our entire country.</p>

<p>What I am advocating for the Tugela basin will have such far-reaching advantages for the whole of Natal that I believe that it is time that the Government stated quite clearly what its intentions are in regard to the Tugela basin.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect of this matter. We have here in this basin these tremendous resources, these tremendous advantages, natural and otherwise, which are not being used properly and to their fullest. For that to happen in a country such as South Africa which is a comparatively small one is, I think, tragic. This is a basin which can so easily be developed and the advantages to the whole of Natal are so great that it is time that the Government gave its proper attention to this area and told the House and the country what its intentions are.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Musgrave started off by speaking about planning and during the first part of his speech one could at least get some idea that he wanted to speak about planning. And as a Natalian he quite rightly had to speak about the Tugela Basin. Other Natalians may as rightly speak about the development of Vryheid and the development of the Richard&#x2019;s Bay complex. I do not want to follow that trend. In any case, the hon. member for Musgrave subsequently wandered a little from his subject and, like other colleagues of his, he was not sure what things fell under the Vote of the Department of Planning. He consequently proceeded to a discussion of matters which, in point of fact, belonged under the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, in that he said a few things in regard to the development of the homelands. I do not want to follow him in what he said in that regard. He also referred to the possibility of a third Iscor in his area. If that area does in fact get the third Iscor then it will be so much the better for him. He will then be able to say that he has pleaded for that.</p>

<p>I want to address a few words to the hon. the Minister in connection with a matter which arises from this question of a third Iscor.</p>

<p><span class="col_6593-6594" refersTo="page_0558"/>Where one has sudden developments in the field of industry or mining or anything else and in this regard I also have in mind the discovery of oil in South Africa&#x2014;such developments completely upset the planning complex. The hon. member for Benoni clearly outlined the development plan for the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging area. In that connection we have seen sound reasons in the report. We understand that there are problems and that it has not been possible to process all data relating thereto. However, I want to state a proven fact and that is that the sudden development of a new complex in an area where there is gradual, normal progress, makes a tremendous impact&#x2014;I dare say for the good &#x2014;on such an area. I refer specifically to the development of the Atlas Factory in my own constituency. This factory is situated in the centre of five or six local authorities. The immediate reaction is for each individual local authority to regard such a factory as something for which to strive, as something from which it may strengthen its kingdom. I have found that they develop their towns in that direction. The one is, of course, quite rightly envious of the other and constructs an open road from its business area to the concentric complex whereas the other also does so. The situation may even develop where the first citizens of the various towns drive past one another, each on his own road and possibly put their tongues out and boast, &#x201C;My road is shorter than yours!&#x201D; This is a problem to which I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister. Where a sudden change comes about in the complex of a developing area, if an Iscor, for example, is established in an area where there already is gradual development, that upsets the entire administration and all the planning, and that is where we require assistance. Assistance is definitely required because the poor people living in the vicinity of such a place do not know exactly where they stand. Surely, Sir, you know the story of the old buyer of farms who arrives at a farm and is told by the owner, &#x201C;A railway-line will run here, a tarmac road will be constructed there, a dam will be constructed over there and electric power will be laid on.&#x201D; But the poor buyer always fails to ask, &#x201C;But why are you selling then&#x003F;&#x201D; In the same way we find that people are deceived and led astray in areas where development is sudden. They think their small plot&#x2014;in my constituency there are 3,000&#x2014;is going to be the very spot for a shop. Another thinks that the main road will run there and that that plot of his is going to come very valuable because factories are going to be erected there&#x2014;he can erect a small sub-industry on that site. They do not know where they are heading and they are deceived and led astray. There is speculation with their properties. At a later stage it becomes a matter of necessity that there should be planning and then they see that they have been cherishing false hopes all along. I should therefore like to ask the hon. the Minister that where such a sudden development of a complex does take place, there should be coordination between the local authorities concerned, so that they may afterwards jointly develop that undeveloped area on which they border.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to raise, and which is closely related to what I have said, concerns the standing committee on noise at airports. The hon. the Minister mentioned that.</p>

<p>I should like to know what progress that committee has made and whether there are any findings or complaints in regard to the noise of aircraft at Ian Smuts Airport. We find that people in England and France complain that their cows do not give milk and that their chickens do not lay. I do not want to go into that. We must, however, think of the future when larger aircraft will have to land at Ian Smuts Airport. They will make more noise. We must also think of the possible danger of the sound barrier being broken, if that happens in the near future. I should like to know whether the Minister is also taking those aspects into account.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to add my little share of congratulations to the Minister on his appointment, and to wish him well, especially in the portfolio which is under discussion at the moment. I hope that when I am found on his threshold very often, he will not take it in the spirit that I just intend pestering him, but in the spirit that when we are actually dealing with planning, we intend it to be for the benefit of all sections of the community. I wish to confine myself briefly to the planning of separate beaches, about which we heard earlier this afternoon. Apart from the hon. member for Klip River I think I am the one in this House who has had the most experience of the investigations of this committee which was appointed. I attended all sessions of the provincial committee in my constituency and also all sessions of the present committee. The Act was on the Statute Book and it had to be implemented. It was being implemented in this way, namely by the appointment of a committee to investigate the planning of the beaches for the various racial groups. I wish to add that in my humble opinion and with the expedience I have had of the activities of this committee, the way in which the former chairman of this committee, the hon. member for Klip River, conducted his work, was most commendable indeed. I am not concerned now with what was proclaimed in the end and whether it was to the satisfaction of all. I am merely concerned with the thorough manner in which these investigations were conducted. I was present in my constituency, from Betty&#x2019;s Bay to 17 miles north of East London, and I must say that it was most thoroughly done. The chairman of the committee certainly did not leave a stone unturned to do the job properly and to submit his considerations to the Minister with the best possible information he I could gather.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it is fair to ask the hon. member for Klip River whom he has satisfied. In my experience before this committee, it would have been a person with Solomon&#x2019;s wisdom who would have endeavoured even to satisfy all. If there is dissatisfaction in regard to the proclamation of the beaches, the culprits from place to place in my humble opinion and with my experience are the white people who in their selfishness suddenly want everything and leave very little for the Coloureds. There was dissatisfaction as a result of certain aspects of the proclamation of the separate beaches. But, taking everything into account, this committee was appointed just in time and started its work just in time, if not too late in certain respects. I say this, because apart from the difficulties experienced in the more densely populated areas like Cape Town, and the towns up the coast like Port Elizabeth and East London, it was perfectly clear to me that, if there had been no action at this stage and if this matter was not thoroughly investigated then, the white people, because of their stronger economic position, would have taken possession of the beaches along our coastline. By the time the Coloured people developed to that stage economically, they would have been unable to get access to very large tracts of the coastline of the Cape Province. If it were to be planned in 10 or 15 years&#x2019; time, it would have cost much more and it would have led to a great deal more dissatisfaction. Two factors made a very great impression on me. In the first place there was the amazing phenomenon that when these investigations took place and when the beaches were eventually proclaimed, the people who had the most to say about it in the newspapers, etc., were people who more or less frequented beaches where the Coloured people did not trouble them at all. In other words, these were the people who could buy their own apartheid and merely deliver comment on matters of which they had no experience. In the second place, in considering this coastline virtually from Cape Town to the north of East London, I was amazed to find that while there was never any legislation on the Statute Book empowering the Government or the Department concerned to plan beaches for the various racial groups, it was astounding to find, while the Coloured people had so-called free access to the beaches, to what extent these beaches had been neglected. These were beaches which were looked upon as beaches frequented by the Coloured people. I wish to mention one example. The Port Elizabeth Municipality in 1929 took a decision by which they demarcated beaches for the various racial groups. When the commission sat there and investigated the beaches in Port Elizabeth, they found that an enormous sum of money had been spent over the years on the white beaches. On the Coloured beach Cape Recife not even the most elementary facilities one would require at a camping site or a public beach, had been provided. Another aspect that amazed me was that whenever an area was being investigated or considered, even if Coloured people had been going there for hundreds of years, all of a sudden it was exceptional to find a white person pleading for the Coloureds to have a place in the sun on the beach. All of a sudden the Coloureds were a menace. It was said that properties would devaluate. The worst thoughts of what might happen in a camping site or on a beach, taking into account the various standards of education and economic development of the people, were emphasized in order to preserve beaches for the Whites only.</p>

<p>I am therefore grateful that in the planning of the beaches, the Coloured people were given their share. But I wish to point out to the Minister that when the proclamation was published, I was very dissatisfied with it, because it gave a wrong impression altogether. It merely showed the coastline and little strips of land which were demarcated for the Coloureds. Only these small areas were shown. The impression was created that the rest of the coastline was reserved for Whites. Actually what was proclaimed were only areas where one had access to a beach where people could swim or relax. The rocky coastline, where anglers go in fear of their lives to catch their fish, was not included. I should say &#x201C;to lose their fish&#x201D;, because one always hears about the long ones that got away. I do feel that with the planning of the beaches one factor was lost sight of. I should like to make an appeal to the Minister in regard to this matter. The same difficulties arose from place to place. The representatives of local authorities or of organizations from place to place made representations to the committee. At the end of the representations they would say: &#x201C;This is how we see it. This would be the best way of doing it. But that beach over there which we suggest for the Coloureds, or for the Whites, is at the moment inaccessible. There are no roads to it. On the other hand, where must we find the money to develop the beach&#x003F;&#x201D; In the Cape Province we have the system of divisional councils, apart from village management boards or municipalities on the coast. Everywhere we find the same difficulties. The representatives of those bodies will certainly not be a party to a decision by that body to spend thousands of rands for the development of a beach for the Coloured people from the rest of the hinterland, because they do not only come from that specific area bordering the coast. They will certainly not be a party to such a decision, because they are scared that at the next election it will be said that they have spent the ratepayers&#x2019; money on Coloured people from elsewhere. They are scared that they will not be elected again.</p>

<p>I had it in my mind to appeal to the Minister to consider whether a fund could not be created from which properly approved camping sites, caravan parks or picnic sites along the coast, demarcated for the Coloured people <span class="col_6597-6598" refersTo="page_0560"/>for instance, can be developed without the local authority being in the position of having to raise the money or that they cannot raise the money. I will give an example of what happened. Certain beaches were proclaimed before the end of last year. It will take years before the local authority could develop those beaches and the accesses to those beaches. I was a party to a request to the predecessor of the Minister of Planning to give those local authorities permission to waive the planning for the meantime because the people would have had nowhere else to go. They could not be accommodated on the newly proclaimed sites and they had to use the old sites again. In spite of this reprieve in view of the fact that the season was on hand, it is perfectly clear to me that by the next season most of these places have in the meantime done very little. They are unable to do so because they do not have the money. I want to ask that the Minister consider this issue seriously and investigate the possibility of whether the money cannot be made available in some form or other by the Central Government in order to assist the local authorities to plan and develop these beaches as soon as possible. I can assure the House that if that could be done, it would lead to a great deal of satisfaction and it will avoid a great deal of dissatisfaction because the situation is now that while people appreciate a beach and it is perfectly suitable, they cannot get to it, and if they can get to it, it is with great cost and difficulty. I hope that the Minister will bear this in mind because it is no use setting aside a beach if there are no amenities, water and toilet facilities and if it is not properly planned and controlled.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter which is not only of importance for this generation but also for future generations and which is not only of national importance but also of international importance. That is the planning of the capital of South Africa, namely Pretoria. As we all know. Pretoria is our administrative capital. At the beginning of this year the hon. the Minister of Planning set up an advisory committee for the planning of the capital under the chairmanship of Justice Kobie Marais. We know that that committee is engaged in certain planning. We also know that there are several bodies and persons, apart from the City Council of Pretoria and many bodies, who are occupying themselves at present with this matter and we want to ask the hon. the Minister to effect a higher degree of co-ordination in this regard and to take certain steps. We know that Pretoria is the largest geographical municipality in the world, namely 220 square miles.</p>

<p>There are 12 constituencies in the City of Pretoria. That shows one what a large area that is and how large the population of the capital, Pretoria, is. As you know. Sir, Pretoria is the jacaranda city and if we plant all its jacaranda trees in one row it will measure approximately 400 miles and its other trees will measure approximately 800 miles if they are planted in a row. I plead with the Minister to see to it that our capital will be properly planned as a capital. If one speaks of Paris, one thinks of France; if one speaks of London, one thinks of the entire England. That is also the case in other countries, but when one speaks of Pretoria, the world does not think of South Africa. Johannesburg reminds them much more of South Africa. When we think of our capital, Pretoria, we must also think that its planning must be such that it will attract tourists from all over the world. Revenue from tourism is one of the largest sources which still has to be developed in South Africa. Therefore I want to say that if we can plan Pretoria, with all its places of interest, and I shall mention a few of them in a short while, as a tourist attraction, we may be able to earn foreign exchange for South Africa as we may perhaps not be able to do with anything else. Pretoria is also very centrally situated for our national congresses and other big meetings and proper provision must be made for gatherings because we know that many problems in regard to accommodation, traffic, etc., usually crop up every year as a result of all the various congresses and gatherings.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems which I foresee for the future, is the health of the inhabitants of Pretoria, something we also encounter in Johannesburg. We find an enormous concentration of people. We now want that capital of ours to be planned properly so that we will not have a congestion of enormous blocks of flats without breathing space. We must also see to it that such proper central planning is carried through and that Pretoria is made an example which may be followed by cities such as Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and other large cities. We must give consideration to air pollution in the future where we have a congregation of these masses of people and in particular we have to give consideration to the gases discharged by thousands of vehicles. We know what a tremendous increase there has been in the number of vehicles. Then there are also all the breaths of those people who are in that one spot night and day. We must think of the health of our nation in generations to come. I also want to say that if our planning were better, even if Pretoria had to be extended over a wider area, and if plans could be drawn up now to construct express ways to carry people who might have to be conveyed to the capital from places as far away as 20 or 30 miles, it would be possible to do it properly now already for the day when it will have to be done. If we think of the future and since we are now living in a time of inflation, we also feel that we have to plan now to get a higher degree of effectiveness in our cities. It is virtually an impossibility in Pretoria to reach one&#x2019;s home early in the morning and at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. It easily takes one half an hour to cover a distance of two miles. The City Council does its planning, <span class="col_6599-6600" refersTo="page_0561"/>but there must be co-ordination of the various bodies. If this city is properly planned it may also serve as an example for the rest of the world. For the information of the hon. members who may not perhaps have given these matters any thought, it may be a good idea if I mention what things of national importance there are in Pretoria. Pretoria is the home of our State President. It is also the home of the Administrator of the Transvaal. It is the headquarters of our diplomatic corps and all Government Departments, excluding the South African Railways and Coloured Affairs. It is also the home of the Provincial Administration of the Transvaal. We know that that is housed in the restored &#x201C;Volksraad&#x201D; building of the Government of the old Transvaal Republic, a building which dates back to 1889.</p>

<p>It is a good thing if we preserve these historic monuments, if we protect them, do not wall them in with buildings and keep them as tourist attractions. The Peri-Urban Health Board is there as well as the world-famous C.S.I.R. The head office of the South African Bureau of Standards is there. We think of Onderstepoort, the Atomic Energy Board and Iscor, which at present produces two million tons of steel annually. We think of the Mint and of the training centres, such as that of the Police, for example. We think of the training school for dogs and the training camps of the Army, the Air Force, etc., which are in Pretoria. These are things of national importance. These are places which our people constantly visit and that applies particularly in respect of our Members of Parliament, our provincial councillors and our entire population. In addition we also have all the marketing councils in Pretoria. Pretoria is an education centre of renown. It is the city with the largest number of young people in the whole of South Africa. We have the University of Pretoria, the largest university in South Africa, with more than 10,000 students, and the University of South Africa with more than 14,000 students, if I remember correctly. There is also the Pretoria Teachers&#x2019; College, the largest teachers&#x2019; college in South Africa, with more than 2,400 students. We have a large number of high schools, primary schools and technical colleges in Pretoria. Therefore I want to plead for these matters to be planned properly. Pretoria is also of national interest on account of its historical monuments and museums. We have the Voortrekker Monument which was inaugurated in 1949. That is the symbol of our Great Trek and I think that it is right to bear all these things in mind in connection with our planning. We also have the Paul Kruger House in Church Street West where the State President lived from 1883 to 1900. We think of Melrose House where the peace treaty between the Republican forces and the British Supreme Command was signed on 31st May, 1902. These are all places we have to preserve. We think of our Transvaal museum with its scientific collection of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, fossils and particularly the prehistoric ape-man. We also think of the Cultural History and Open Air Museum. These things are of national importance and we shall have to see to it that there will be further developments in regard to these things to the benefit of South Africa. We also have the Radcliffe Observatory.</p>

We also think of the Hero&#x2019;s Acre, for example, in respect of which bodies and persons are considering what can be done in regard to that final memory we have of our great heroes. We trust that justice will be done to the Hero&#x2019;s Acre and, seen from the point of view of national interest, that it will receive proper attention. With that I want to conclude and I hope that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to extending this advisory committee even further perhaps so that this matter may also receive attention.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to quarrel unduly with the hon. member for Sunnyside in pleading for proper planning in Pretoria. All South Africans are justly proud of Pretoria as one of our capital cities. But I do want to remind him that it is one of our capital cities and that here in the Cape we also have a capital, namely the legislative capital whereas that is the administrative capital. I felt quite jealous listening to the hon. member when he described all the things which Pretoria already had. And I am sure that he will not begrudge some of the other areas of the country their share in the good things of life when it comes to their turn, areas which the hon. member for Smithfield earlier on described as &#x201C;agtergeblewe streke&#x201D;. I also refer to places such as those dealt with by the hon. member for Newton Park and also that area of the Eastern Cape which is situated west of the Ciskei. I only wish to make one point in regard to that, namely to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister the fact that if other institutions such as universities assist his Department with the initial socio-economic surveys&#x2014;as is being done in the Eastern Cape at the moment by the University of Port Elizabeth and the University of Rhodes&#x2014;that financial assistance may well be necessary from <span class="col_6601-6662" refersTo="page_0562"/>his Department. That is particularly the case where the areas to be surveyed are areas which are thinly populated and where the local authorities such as municipalities or divisional councils may not be able to make a very big financial contribution. I hope the hon. the Minister will remember that the financial formula under which the universities operate with assistance from the Central Government is a fairly stringent one and that the universities themselves are sometimes short of funds to pursue the surveys. I and several other hon. members hope to have an opportunity of discussing this matter with the Minister at a later stage. I am therefore not asking the Minister to commit himself on this matter at the moment. But I do hope that he is going to give it some attention. I want to deal mainly with a matter which falls under the second of the two Votes we are discussing, namely the Statistics Vote. It is a matter which I raised with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor some two years ago. It is something which affects every farmer in the country and that is the question of the agricultural census. On that occasion I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor if he would give consideration to making the return date of the census form the same as the date on which most farmers have to make a provisional payment for income-tax purposes, namely the 28th February. He said at the time that he would go into this matter with the Bureau of Statistics, but so far we have heard nothing further about it. Every September a big thick sheaf descends upon every farmer in this country containing a long questionnaire sent out by the Bureau of Statistics about a farmer&#x2019;s farming operations. It contains a long list of questions about the crops he grows, the amount of crops that he has reaped, every type of livestock that he has on his property, divided into age groups, the number of livestock he sold, what they have died from, whether from disease, drought, vermin or theft, particulars as to plantations that he may have on his property, motor cars, lorries, stationary engines, cultivators, threshing machines, combines, trailers, windmills, silos, dip tanks, etc. Furthermore, he has to supply details of how much he spent on things like packing material, fuel, buildings, fences, dips and sprays, machinery, balanced feeds and other expenses. He has to show how many labourers and domestic servants he employs and how much he pays them. And what is more, he has to show how many livestock, including the various classes of livestock right down to poultry, which his labourers may have. And, Mr. Chairman, every second year or so a few more questions are added to the form and I think the latest was the question about how much he contributed to workmen&#x2019;s compensation each year. No one denies the value of these forms and the value of these statistics that are gathered as a result of the filling in of these forms. And I think hon. members in this House who delight in shooting down their opponents with statistics are perhaps more than ethers mindful of the value of those statistics. But I do want to plead with the hon. the Minister to give this matter attention because the compilation of these figures is a matter which involves quite an amount of labour on the part of the farmer concerned. This is particularly so because most of the figures he has in any case to collect and compile when he makes out his income-tax return. And I think it is a very modest request to the hon. the Minister that the Bureau of Statistics arranges things so that the end date of the year for these statistics should be the 28th February, in other words the same date as that of the end of the income-tax year.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman is quite right, because we do not admit to making any, shall I say, &#x201C;wrong&#x201D; mistakes. [Interjections.] I think that the value of these statistics when they are eventually in the hands of the Bureau of Statistics is negatived to a very great extent by the fact that the reports are coming out so late. It is encouraging to see from the annual report of the Bureau on page 10 that a different type of computer is now going to be used and that in the Estimates there is provision made apparently for the first time, because it appears to be a new item, for a programmer. So one hopes the processing of these statistics is going to be considerably speeded up in future. If one looks on page 22 of this report one sees that the 1962-&#x2019;63 agricultural census will be published only early in 1967. I feel the Bureau of Statistics should make every effort to get these reports out at an earlier date.</p>

<p>There is one other matter regarding statistics I should like to deal with, namely the index of prices of farming requisites. These appear in the monthly bulletin of statistics as well as in the statistical year book. These are quoted in this House very frequently in order to show that the cost of production of the farmer does not really rise so very much after all. But I feel this index is not indicative of the true position at the moment. The base of this index is 1947-&#x2019;48 to 1949-&#x2019;50&#x2014;almost some 20 years ago. Since that time the whole pattern of agricultural production in the country has changed tremendously. It has swung over to mechanization on a great scale and, consequently, the weighting of the index itself has become out of date. The weighting of the index at the moment is 56 for short-term requisites and 31 for machinery and implements. It is this last-mentioned figure that I want to deal with. This us subdivided into spare parts where the figure is ten and repair charges only two. I think there are few agricultural producers in the country who will believe, having regard to the. tremendous increases there have been in the cost of labour at garages and other engineering firms undertaking repairs of agricultural machinery, that this weighting figure of I two is to-day a realistic one because of the <span class="col_6603-6604" refersTo="page_0563"/>tremendous increase there has been in the cost of repairs. I feel this is distorting the picture given by this index and, therefore, it is something the Bureau of Statistics can well look into, i.e. whether after a period of some 20 years the time has not come to review the basis on which this index is being compiled&#x2014; in other words, to review the weighting of the index.

<p>Apart from patience and courage he will also need prayers and wisdom, because it is clear from the description of his duties as Minister of Planning that he in actual fact is going to be the umbrella under which other Departments and bodies and persons will carry out their plans. We believe that the hon. the Minister will succeed in this task with the assistance of all these various boards and their experts in every possible field. I want to convey my special congratulations to him for having decided to make personal investigations in order to acquaint himself with the state of affairs in every Province. It is encouraging for us to know that. As regards physical planning, up to now the few hon. members of the United Party who have discussed it have pleaded for the development of certain areas. It seemed to me as if they did so with tongue in cheek. Therefore I want to predict even at this early stage that when the hon. the Minister requests powers for the development of specific areas, hon. members opposite will oppose him with might and main. The hon. member opposite who spoke first, as well as the hon. member for Musgrave, wanted the Minister of Planning to take his planning up to a certain stage and then to transfer the location of industries in areas to another body on which they might possibly be able to exercise influence. We have come to know them, Mr. Chairman. Just listen to what one of their publications has to say in regard to planning&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An industry is established in order to make profits by supplying a service in the form of goods.</block>

<p>Consequently they are only interested in the profits. The publication continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When an industrialist is planning an industry he takes into account the source of the raw materials, his markets, the cost of transport, the power that is available, water and labour. Labour includes managers and scientists as well as unskilled labourers. If considering all these factors he believes he can make a profit he invests his money.</block>

<p>Yes, that is elementary economics. I accept that and for that reason I am one of the persons who will object if hon. members opposite want to prescribe to the Minister in any way whatsoever how and where he is to locate specific industries. The hon. member for Musgrave pleaded for the establishment of an Iscor to serve as a spark in the Tugela Valley. I do not want to oppose the hon. member, but I nevertheless want to point out to him that there are steel works at Newcastle. Newcastle is within the Tugela Valley. However, those works could not supply the spark and I do not think that the necessary spark will be supplied by locating a second steelworks there. But, Mr. Chairman, as I see things, hon. members opposite are already engaged in paving the way for the attitude they are going to adopt when the hon. the Minister will come to this House for powers to model the future planning of this country. You see, Sir, they want to oppose it. Even at this stage I predict that. But the Minister must realize that members on this side of the House are squarely behind him to enable him to carry out plans in such a way that that will be in the interests of the country and in the interests of the entire population of the Republic and not merely in the interests of a few complexes. He must take into account all aspects of the infrastructure&#x2014;something which the hon. member for Durban (Point) said was elementary economics&#x2014;and he must not pay any attention to the barking on the opposite side of this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not want to take up the time of this House unnecessarily. Therefore I want to conclude by saying that I am pleased about the appointment of this hon. Minister and that my confidence in him is such that I see indications that although he has these bodies behind him to do the planning, he will also consult the Members of Parliament of the areas concerned when such <span class="col_6605-6606" refersTo="page_0564"/>planning affects their constituencies. In that case we will give him every assistance he may require.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Just allow me, Sir, to convey my sincere thanks to all hon. members who congratulated and welcomed me. Now, it simply is so that we are all human and that it is pleasant to receive good wishes, but unfortunately you, Mr. Chairman, ruled that that was out of order and that there might be no repetition. But in spite of your ruling, Sir, I want to convey to you my sincere thanks for having made things so easy for me during the discussions we have had on the two Votes and I hope that you will not regard this as repetition.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Vryheid that although he did not in the least discuss legislation at present before this House, I shall give him a full reply to his speech during my Second Reading speech on Friday. [Laughter.] The hon. member for East London (North) raised a few matters in connection with the availability of a sufficient number of scientists and expressed his concern that we did not have a sufficient number of those people. That links up with what I said earlier on in this debate. He did, however, raise one matter about which I agree with him, but unfortunately I do not know in what way one can get past that. That is the fact that the only possibility for promotion for so many of our scientists as well as engineers and other persons who have been trained in a certain direction and who are doing essential work in that specific direction, is to be appointed to an administrative post. I understand that in certain industries&#x2014;and this applies particularly to large organizations&#x2014; there is an alarmingly high percentage of scientists and engineers who do no scientific or engineering work. This is one of the evils which occurs in any large organization. How we shall be able to overcome that, is a problem which will possibly have to be considered by the Scientific Advisory Council. However, it is wrong that the only opportunity for promotion for a man with a highly scientific training is to go and sit in an administrative office and to do work which is really different to that for which he has been trained. I think this debate will bring this matter pointedly to the attention of the Scientific Advisory Council and possibly other bodies and persons who are concerned in the matter.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Albany also raised this question of scientists and research and financial assistance for them. May I just point out that I do not think South Africa, or any country for that matter, could ever do enough in this direction. But we must also realize that especially under the Vote of the Department of Planning a very large amount is being made available for research. I have a detailed list here specifying research at universities, projects on behalf of State Departments, and also planning and research done by private organizations and individuals. I am not going to read the full list, but the fact is that under the Planning Vote no less than R12,245,000 is being made available for research projects. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Albany also raised the question of the Bureau of Statistics and the long lists that the farmers have to fill in every year. I regret to have to inform the House that the Director of the Bureau would have been here this afternoon, but unfortunately he is in bed with malaria and will be in bed for quite some time. But I will certainly bring this to the notice of the Director as soon as possible, and especially this question of the long list, because the hon. member has pointed out that he has already raised this question on a previous occasion, but I will endeavour to give him a reply by letter as soon as possible.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for East London (North) also said that to his way of thinking the East London area was not receiving the attention it ought to receive. I may just say that East London and King William&#x2019;s Town are in fact receiving attention, but we should also bear in mind the fact that with the limited resources at our disposal it is impossible to do everything at the same time. But even if one takes that into consideration the hon. member will concede that King William&#x2019;s Town and East London have in fact received attention in recent times. The hon. member also referred to the question of beach resorts. I may just say that the question of the allocation of beach resorts at East London has nearly been settled. The Department is equally anxious to have this question settled.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gordonia referred to the development atlas and showed that this atlas was really something special. I cannot urge hon. members strongly enough to study this atlas, not because it is one which has been compiled by my Department, but because I think that the knowledge of this entire House will be considerably enriched if a proper study is made of this atlas as well as the parts which still have to appear. Then the hon. member also spoke of regional planning and specifically of the division into regions. In this connection I just want to say that we welcome the development associations. They are intimately concerned with the development. They fit into the planning of the country as a whole and to that they can most definitely make a contribution. I should like the hon. member and the Committee to know that from the point of view of the Department and from my point of view as Minister we welcome the activities of the development associations. With reference to the speech of the hon. member, I may just add that attention is already being given to holding a conference of all the development associations so as to consider the matters mentioned by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield made a strong plea for the rural areas and said very clearly that the planning of South Africa must be seen as a whole. As far as the rural areas <span class="col_6607-6608" refersTo="page_0565"/>are concerned, I may just tell the hon. member, as he will also be able to deduce from what I said earlier in repect of visits to different areas, that no less than eight of the 14 visits will precisely be ones that will be paid to rural areas all over the Republic. I shall be foolish to try and predict now what will flow from those visits, but the fact of the matter is that the importance of the rural areas is fully appreciated in the attention it is receiving, and it also has my full sympathy as a person who comes from the rural areas himself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klip River referred to several matters. In respect of several of them I really do not have the powers in my Department to deal with them. In respect of the question of public parks, etc., the provincial administration has the powers to deal with those matters. At this stage those things are not in the hands of the Department of Planning.</p>

<p>In respect of pleasure and recreation resorts, and their demarcation, we do have an interest, when it is on a nation-wide basis. It will most probably be so, after the passing of an Act which we are not allowed to discuss now, that the possibility will exist that the Minister of Planning may define a certain defined area for a certain purpose, for a recreation resort, for example. I do think, however, that I should leave it at that otherwise you, Mr. Chairman, would rule me out of order.</p>

<p>In respect of the committee which proclaimed the various beaches for the various population groups on the Cape coast, the hon. member asked for that to be done in Natal too in consultation with the Administrator. I just want to tell the hon. member that my information is that the Department has already made an offer to Natal to have their beaches allotted by this committee because this committee has the experience to effect uniformity. Therefore this matter is in the hands of the Administrator and the Executive Committee of Natal at present. While the hon. member was speaking, the hon. member for Durban (Point) was, of course, making his speech from a sitting position.</p>

When we are asked by the Administrator and the Natal Executive Committee, and I myself may perhaps have to pay a visit there, I shall make a point of taking the hon. member along because he may be able to help me.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Boland raised the question of the proclamation of a white group at Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. The hon. member discussed the matter but, if I may say so, he did not give any cogent reasons for his difficulties. Before I come to that, the hon. member referred to a certain commission of inquiry, at which he attended and gave evidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I did not give evidence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member attended the meeting of the commission at Hermanus. I do not for one moment doubt that the hon. member&#x2019;s facts are correct. I have not checked on them, but I take it that they are correct. I do, however, think it is rather unfair to have quoted this one instance, creating the impression that that is the way in which commissions of inquiry operate. I just want to make it quite clear that this is an exception, if it did happen. It is not the rule in South Africa that commissions operate in this particular manner. I want to make it quite clear that it is also not the rule in my Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. I should like to give the hon. member a full reply to that, because I think it is necessary. The facts of the matter are as follows: Due to a lack of proper planning and unsightly slum development which appears all over, the town makes a bad impression. It is situated in a white agricultural complex. Efforts by the Divisional Council of Stellenbosch to establish a Coloured housing scheme in the area were abandoned in 1956. Further extension will therefore only result in racial friction because there is also a fair amount of opposition to retaining the Coloured community in that particular area. Thirdly, of the 359 breadwinners, and this is rather important, in that area, only 40 work in Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. The rest are employed over a wide area as follows; I am giving these details just to point out to the House and to the public and to the Coloured people that these investigations are being made very fully and extensively. Only 40 of the 359 are employed in Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. The rest are employed over a wide area as follows: The Strand, 33; Somerset West 141; Gordon&#x2019;s Bay 16; Blackheath 59; Cape Town 27; Bellville 4; Firgrove 16; Stellenbosch 2 and Grabouw 23. That is 319 out of 359 who are not employed in Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>It is mostly within a five-mile radius.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have given these figures and it is quite evident that a number of these <span class="col_6609-6610" refersTo="page_0566"/>people do not work within five miles of Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. Furthermore the 11 Coloured owners own property in the area to the value of R.53,740 as against the 17 white properties to the value of R130,860. Furthermore, as far as distances and transport services are concerned, the Firgrove-Macassar complex is equally well-served, and in some respects much better situated than Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass. Only the Coloureds of Gordon&#x2019;s Bay will suffer hardships to some degree. The Coloureds employed in Grabouw may be settled in the local Coloured group area. Lastly, the situation of the two towns, <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the whole Hottentots Holland complex, will only create problems for the future. The popularity of Somerset West and the Strand is causing an accelerated tempo of residential development. It is therefore expected that the proclaimed white town of the Strand will be fully built up within 15 years where after extension can only take place between the white town and the Coloured group area. I do hope that this will settle this question because it has been proclaimed and I have no intention whatsoever of changing the position. I cannot think of more convincing evidence than that which I have before me and which I have given to the hon. member concerning the rest of the investigations done by the officials concerned with this particular case.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Benoni referred to the part played by the Potchefstroom University. I think he was justified in doing so because the Potchefstroom University most definitely plays a special part in respect of our Department of Planning in general, something for which we are very grateful. The hon. member also mentioned the position of the provinces and referred specifically to possible amendments to the Financial Relations Act. As it happens I had a discussion this morning with the Administrators at which this entire matter came to the fore. It also concerned physical planning by the provinces. Whether or not that belongs with my Department is a matter about which I cannot give a decisive answer now. In the second place, it is a matter about which the Cabinet will have to decide. I am pleased that the hon. member raised the matter here because hon. members will agree with me that it is clear from what the hon. member said that he has a deep interest in these matters. That cannot be otherwise because he has many years of experience of planning and of provincial matters. In my Department we are also very grateful for the contributions he makes on various committees in respect of planning as well as in other spheres. I want to ask the hon. member to have further discussions with me and my Department on this question of physical planning which may be undertaken by the provinces on their own initiative, so that we may go into the details of the matter.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Musgrave raised the question of the Tugela Basin. In reply to the hon. member, may I point out that the Government is very much aware of the vast natural resources in the Tugela Basin, Secondly, we have this particular area very much in mind in planning, not only as regards my own department, but other departments as well. In this respect I may say that it is of importance that the Tugela Basin be viewed in general, especially because of the water available and the possibilities of industrial development. But it is also correct to point out very clearly, as the hon. member for Vryheid did, that there is already industrial development in the Tugela Basin. It is not as if the Tugela Basin has been left out altogether, because Newcastle, as the hon. member knows, is well within the Tugela Basin. Furthermore, the Tugela Basin has featured and has been looked at very carefully in a number of surveys done by my department and other departments. I may also add to what the hon. member has said to-day, that there is the fact that the hon. member for Klip River, in his constituency at least, is constantly on our doorstep. I know from experience that he is not only on my doorstep, but also on the doorstep of the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned, and I hope I follow him correctly, that the development of the border areas is to stimulate the homelands and has nothing to do with stimulating the white areas.

I do think it is a misconception to say that that is to stimulate the homelands as such. It does stimulate the homelands, of course, but not to the extent which factories in the homeland self will stimulate the homeland. I thought I would just clear this up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brentwood raised a matter here in connection with his constituency. It is very clear to me that he is deeply conscious of the problems of his voters. I regret to say, however, that I do not have the powers in respect of this type of planning. To me this seems to be a provincial matter exclusively. The hon. member also raised the question of Jan Smuts.</p>

<p>Perhaps we ought to get that power.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that perhaps we ought to get that power, but we may of course not plead for new legislation. The hon. member also mentioned Jan Smuts Airport and the noise created there by gigantic aircraft, as we know, and the fact that that might possibly become worse in the future. A thorough investigation has been made and has virtually been completed. My information is that it has in fact been completed. At the moment it is just a question of drawing up a report. I do not know what will appear from that report, but I think hon. members will realize that this nevertheless remains an extremely difficult matter in spite of the fact that there has been an investigation and that a report is being awaited. I just want to say in passing that it is interesting that it has been found in certain cities in Europe that people who live close to the large airports, right opposite the runways, eventually become so accustomed to the terrible noise that they do not want to live elsewhere. In London, for instance, a great deal of financial assistance is given&#x2014;I think by the Corporation&#x2014;to make these houses as soundproof as possible. However, there is a large percentage of the people who simply do not want to make use of that. They like the noise. This reminds one of people who live near railway lines.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Outeniqua spoke very realistically&#x2014;I think his approach is very realistic&#x2014;about the reserving of beaches for the different racial groups. I am grateful to him for approaching this question in this particular manner. He was quite right in saying that, as a general rule, Whites and other groups do not really mix on the beaches. It is traditionally so that we have our places where we go. Unfortunately, there are those who want to upset this traditional way of life, such as we, for instance, have seen at Muizenberg a year or two ago. It is therefore very necessary to have this reservation of beaches to combat and to be able to handle these particular situations. But let me make this one point. In doing this, the intention is not to cause hardships to any racial group. It is to find a place in the sun of Southern Africa for all of us on a basis of harmonious co-existence.</p>

<p>Also the hon. member raised the question of financing of certain amenities and facilities on these beaches. May I just say in this regard that the demarcation and allocation of beaches never implies the development thereof. It is, however, the responsibility of the local authority in whose area the beach concerned is situated to develop it. Through the co-ordination of my department discussions were held some time ago between the Department of Coloured Affairs and the Provincial Administrations to evolve some means of assisting local authorities financially in this particular matter. It is appreciated that local authorities find it difficult through lack of finances to provide amenities, but I must also point out that it has always been, and always will be, the responsibility of the local authorities to provide whatever amenities ought to be provided for these people. The expense in providing amenities is not brought about by the fact that certain areas have been demarcated for certain racial groups.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sunnyside raised the question of the planning of our capital. I am very glad that he did so, because I hope that other cities will also take a closer look at their planning. The hon. member mentioned health and various other aspects, ones which are details, but I just want to mention in general that I should like to see Pretoria develop so that it may become a city like Washington and others and so that one may be able to recognize it as the capital of the Republic. It is my intention to have very searching discussions with this advisory committee during the recess and to have a look at the way in which it is constituted. It may be possible to effect improvements. But I do not want to go into the details now.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is making it very difficult for me, because I really had the South Coast in mind. I do not think it is possible to discuss this here now. The fact of the matter is that Pretoria is our administrative capital and we would like to see Pretoria an administrative capital in the true sense of the word. That is all I am inclined to say. That also goes for all other cities in South Africa. I think that there is scope in Durban. Cape Town, of course, is our legislative capital. It is perhaps necessary to see whether one could not also give advice to Cape Town in this regard. But I should not like to commit myself on that point now.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making one further remark. Where I have said that I want to visit various parts of the country. I want to make it very clear that those will be visits by the Minister and by the Department. All types of deputations must then not come forward with <span class="col_6613-6614" refersTo="page_0568"/>their complaints and problems. We are merely going to have a look at the circumstances at the places we visit. I want to say this in advance here and now. We will naturally consult and have talks with the local authorities. This is point No. 1 and I want to put that very clearly.</p>

<p>Point No. 2&#x2014;and I also want hon. members to know this&#x2014;is the following: I shall not go to any place without the M.P. of that constituency accompanying me if it is possible for him to do so. This is how it will be arranged by my Department.</p>

<p>Furthermore I just want to say that as far as the Department in general is concerned, we have received fine co-operation from other Government Departments. Seeing that this is such a young department and since you all know in what way Government Departments operate and set about things amongst themselves, I want to have it placed on record that we have received exceptionally valuable cooperation during the two years the Department has been in existence. In this regard I should also like others to take cognizance&#x2014; and here I have in mind Provincial Administrations, local authorities, the private sector, all bodies and persons concerned with or interested in planning&#x2014;that we are seeking their cooperation. This is the task of the Department of Planning. As long as I am the Minister in charge, this Department is not going to build an empire. This Department&#x2014;and I state this specifically&#x2014;does not want to take over the functions of anyone. We do not even want to create that impression. Thereby I am saying explicitly that the Department is asking for everyone&#x2019;s co-operation. Thereby I also want to say in conclusion that everyone may have trust in the Department as one that wants to co-ordinate functions and not take them over.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should be pleased if I could have the privilege of the half-hour. We are sorry that the health of the hon. the Minister of Immigration has troubled him of late. He has a great task to perform, and we on this side hope that he will soon recover and be able to resume his duties. We are particularly sorry that it is not possible for him to be present to-day, because there are few matters that have in recent times caused as much excitement in certain circles as has the immigration policy of the Government. The Government has nobody but only itself to blame for that, because for years its leaders have taught their people that an immigrant is a person who comes to this country to eat one&#x2019;s food, to take away one&#x2019;s work, to oust one from one&#x2019;s house, and that large-scale, planned immigration means nothing but &#x201C;undermining Afrikanerdom&#x201D;. This is the type of idea they instilled into their people. The wild oats that were sown, are sprouting now. The excuse that is being made by that side, is that General Smuts supposedly pursued a policy of allowing &#x201C;good ones as well as bad ones&#x201D; to enter and that their resistance was actually aimed at that. I myself often listened to General Smuts when he stated his views on immigration, and because this allegation about him is repeated so often in this House. I want to state the facts. I say that I often heard General Smuts stating his views. He made the statement that one could not divide mankind into good ones and bad ones and say that the good ones are always good and the bad ones are always bad. The bad person of to-day is often the good person of yesterday; or, the person who appears to be good to-day is at a later stage often not as good as he appeared to be. The result is that, no matter how strict the immigration selection policy may be, no matter how selectively the policy of only bringing in good ones may be applied, there will nevertheless be nothing to prevent a certain percentage of people, who are not as good as was presumed when they were admitted from entering this country. After all, does this not happen to every businessman&#x003F; With the best screening in the world the businessman cannot guarantee that every person in his undertaking will be a success. That is the point General Smuts made, namely that with the best screening in the world it cannot be guaranteed that <span class="col_6615-6616" refersTo="page_0569"/>not a single bad person will enter. His conclusion was, quite rightly so, that he could not put a stop to the immigration process because of the risk that a few bad ones might also slip in.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is also happening at present. Here I have an editorial that appeared in the <i>Vaderland</i> dated 28th January, 1967, and, <i>inter alia,</i> it says the following: &#x201C;No matter how selectively one may set about it, undesirable immigrants still slip in&#x201D;. That is all General Smuts indicated. As a matter of fact, here we have a statement in Hansard in which the hon. the Minister of Immigration said in this House that the screening system followed by this Government is nothing but the screening system followed by the Government before 1948. It would therefore be a false allegation if anybody were to suggest that General Smuts or the United Party wanted, as a matter of policy, to allow bad ones to enter South Africa. I say this is absolutely untrue, and anybody who makes such an allegation is wrong.</p>

<p>With the best selection one will find, as the <i>Vaderland</i> says, bad ones slipping in, but any person who says that it was the policy of the United Party Government to bring bad ones into the country, propagates a falsity. And the best proof of its being a false allegation, comes from the hon. the Minister of Immigration himself, who said that there was no difference between the selection process of his Government and the one the United Party Government followed before 1948. The policy of the United Party is to-day, and has always been, immigration with discrimination. I want to make it clear to-day that we are opposed to any policy which simply imports skin and bone because it is white or European. We are most vehemently opposed to South Africa&#x2019;s being made a market square for tagrag and bobtail at this juncture. Mr. Chairman, after all these years of attacks on the United Party on the question of immigration, we now notice two things. The first is that, after all the talk of the undermining of the Afrikaner which was supposed to follow, the present Government is the one which now holds the record for the greatest immigration gain of our time. The net gain of 32,500 immigrants last year was described by the hon. the Minister as &#x201C;an all-time record&#x201D;, a record which puts that of the United Party Government in the shade&#x2014;not that this is such an exceptional achievement. Under the previous Government immigration was a natural process: the people came here of their own accord. To-day more recruitment is done, more incentive is given and more financial encouragement is offered than ever before in our history, and that is why the gateway to South Africa is indeed wide open today&#x2014;more so than ever before; that is why there is record immigration under this Government in spite of all the claims that immigration, if it were to take place on a large scale and if it were State-aided would mean the undermining of the Afrikaner. According to what has recently been said by Government speakers, the target as regards immigrants has now indeed been set at 50,000. The second thing that we notice in the policy of the Government, is that the resources on which they draw for immigrants at present, are much more extensive than they were under any previous Government. In the past it was almost taken for granted that immigration meant immigration from our countries of origin, because immigrants from the mother countries can fit in immediately with the two white cultural streams in South Africa. But this position no longer applies. In February the hon. the Minister adopted the attitude in the Other Place&#x2014;and I am quoting him&#x2014;&#x201C;that at present we have such an urgent need for immigrants in South Africa that our countries of origin cannot meet our needs&#x201D;. According to the Minister they must therefore &#x201C;be sought elsewhere&#x201D;. The Government&#x2019;s policy is therefore to seek immigrants in countries other than our countries of origin, and this policy will be continued. What one notices therefore, is, firstly, that the immigration scheme is more extensive at present than it has ever been before; secondly, that it is State-aided to a greater extent than ever before; there is greater inducement for immigrants than ever before; and at present immigration includes more countries than it did when this side of the House was in power; and that is why we can rightly say that the Government Party&#x2019;s immigration policy has undergone a radical change.</p>

<p>I think we should now pause a little to see how this change fits in with our own views on immigration. As far as our policy is concerned, I want to make a few points to explain to the Committee where we stand. Firstly, I have already said that we are opposed to skin and bone being imported simply because it is white or European. We believe that the future of the Whites will not depend on a desperate, panicky importation of foreigners simply because of the colour of their skin. We believe that the future of the white man in this country will depend on the moral fibre of which he is made, and nothing else; and we think that the Government should not lose sight of the fact that the white man cannot be saved by an indiscriminate importation of skin and bone simply because it is white. That is why we take the view, as a primary point of policy, that immigration for South Africa should at all times remain selective, and that we should concentrate on quality rather than quantity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I have already proved that that was our policy, and I can also quote, if I want to, from speeches which <span class="col_6617-6618" refersTo="page_0570"/>were made by General Smuts and which were reported in the <i>Burger.</i> I do not care what those hon. members believe; I am interested in the facts. The second point of policy as far as this side of the House is concerned, is the following: We believe that natural immigration is at all times preferable to immigration planned or organized by the State. That is why we believe that the Government should not go too far by begging people to come here. We realize only too well that over the years the Government has seriously neglected its duty towards South Africa, and that we have a tremendous manpower shortage to-day owing to that neglect, and that that manpower shortage is becoming more and more critical every day. That is why we and the Government have no option but to set to work and to recruit people on a large scale, and consequently we support this effort. I am saying this openly. We support it because the country needs the trained manpower. But we want to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister, and I hope that he will furnish us with clear replies to these questions. Is the policy the Government is pursuing in connection with immigration, a long-term policy&#x003F; In other words, has State-aided immigration, as far as the Government is concerned, and on the scale it is being done at present, come to stay&#x003F; Must we view it as a long-term scheme&#x003F; If so, must we assume that planned immigration has become a set pattern of our lives&#x003F; If so, can the hon. the Minister tell us what his aim is&#x003F; When one advocates a policy, one has a target. I should very much like to know from the hon. the Minister what his target is, particularly as far as numbers are concerned. Does he have a target, and what is it&#x003F; For instance, is he thinking of half a million immigrants, or of a million, or two million&#x003F; He must have a plan; if one has a policy, one has to know where one is going, why one is doing it and how long it will take one to reach one&#x2019;s target. I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us what his target is. Is the hon. the Minister prepared to go so far with State-aided immigration as to change the whole character of white South Africa, for instance&#x003F; We must have a reply to these questions. We must know what the target is in any case, for otherwise we cannot judge whether or not it is successful. We must know what he is aiming at and what the numbers are that the Minister hopes to bring into this country, and over what period.</p>

<p>Our third point of policy is this: Our view is that in any immigration scheme the emphasis should be placed on immigration from the parent countries. That is not a question of good or bad. We do not take the view that one nation is worse than another. We do not believe that one can say that these people are bad and those people are good. That is irrelevant. The people of one country are not better than the people of another. But South Africa&#x2019;s human relations problems are so difficult and complicated that we think it would be unwise to multiply those problems by creating in South Africa new language blocks that are too big. Our fourth point of policy is this: We believe that the Government has a special duty in regard to immigration, a duty that does not only rest on the citizens, but also on the Government itself. It must prepare the country and the people for its immigration scheme. To-day one cannot launch a major immigration scheme without further ado, as the Government did, without preparing the country and the people for it. If we want such a scheme to succeed and to be accepted by the people of South Africa and by the established citizenry, then they and the country have to be prepared for it both spiritually and physically. What I mean is that not only the immigrants should be spiritually attuned to their new fatherland, but that the established citizens should also be prepared for receiving this concourse of newcomers. In this respect I regret that I have to accuse the Government of falling hopelessly short of the task of preparing the nation spiritually for receiving these immigrants. The first thing the Government ought to do, is to take its own Press to task. Nobody has aroused as much ill-will and suspicion against the present immigration plan than those very newspapers that are being controlled by that side. This time they can definitely not accuse the Opposition newspapers of such a thing. I am not referring to readers&#x2019; letters that are published, but look at the exaggerated and irresponsible reporting that appears in the Government newspapers at present. Let me furnish a few practical examples of how the public is being prepared for receiving immigrants. Here I have a report in the <i>Vaderland</i> of 6th April: &#x201C;Church estrangement amongst Afrikaners accelerates. Immigrants play a big part&#x201D;. This is a distorted image which is presented in banner headlines. Here is another quotation from the <i>Vaderland</i> dated 17th January, 1967: &#x201C;Threat to our culture realized; immigration plan unaltered&#x201D;. It tells the readers that the arrival of immigrants is a threat to our culture. Here is a report in <i>Dagbreek</i> dated 1st January, 1967: &#x201C;Shocking facts on immigration revealed. Afrikaner preponderence wiped out within 25 years&#x201D;. Here is another: &#x201C;Immigrants impede police work. Many of them abuse South Africa, says Keevy&#x201D;. <i>(Die Vaderland</i> 23rd November. 1966.) It has to be impressed upon the people that immigrants affect police work adversely. [Interjection.] Here is another: &#x201C;Afrikaans churches very upset about Catholic statement. South Africa Catholic by the end of this century. Immigrants will bring their influence to bear&#x201D;. (<i>Dagbreek,</i> 31st July, 1966.) Here I have a report about Professor A. D. Pont, the notorious Professor Pont: &#x201C;Hollanders are no asset to the Afrikaner,&#x201D; he says. There are stacks of these examples. My point is this. Nobody objects to newspapers publishing reports of what is being said, but in most cases the headings that appear in the newspapers are outrageous generalizations that have no bearing on the importance of the man who said it or even the contents of the <span class="col_6619-6620" refersTo="page_0571"/>report. A false impression is created, particularly by this report about General Keevy.</p>

<p>That is not my point. My point is that this is the standard of the reporting. [Interjection.] I am not saying that General Keevy said that; I am saying that the <i>Vaderland</i> reports in that way &#x2026; then the newspapers should have known better than to broadcast nonsense. [Interjection.] No, show me where the <i>Sunday Times</i> incites people against immigration. But if it does so, it is wrong, too. It seems to me that the <i>Vaderland,</i> in particular, takes delight in inciting people against immigration. Look at the harm it has been and is doing, this type of reporting, and the bitter remarks against immigration which followed on these things by way of letters in the Press. There are members of that side who are not to be exonerated either. There we have the hon. member for Primrose. He wrote an article in <i>Dagbreek,</i> in which he was also very critical about aspects of the immigration policy. We hope to hear more about that from him to-day. I want to repeat that, if the Government wants to undertake large-scale immigration, it should in the first place call its Press to account and enlist its services so that the Press may help it, and it should also go further. Instead of using the radio for party political propaganda, it should use the radio for a positive purpose, and that is to make people receptive to the immigration plan. Inform the people about the advantages of immigration and how they may help immigrants to feel at home here and to become South African. This is a good cause and nobody will have any objections to it. Let us remember this as far as immigrants are concerned. Nobody can do better work for South Africa than immigrants, because immigrants who are here, write thousands of letters to friends and relatives abroad. The letters they write can either be an advertisement for South Africa or an accusation. When I see the type of letter against immigrants to which prominence is given in the Government Press, I have very often wondered what our immigrants must think, because in one of the booklets the Government published, they say this fine thing to immigrants, and it is being distributed abroad&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africans are open-minded, sturdy and independent people, fond of outdoor life and sport, extremely hospitable and free and easy in ordinary social contact. The immigrant housewife, or the whole family for that matter, will therefore find no difficulty in making new friends.</block>

<p>That is fine and good, but what are these people to think when they come to South Africa with this booklet and they have to see the raging campaign in the Government Press which clouds the attitude to immigrants&#x003F;</p>

<p>But what physical preparation is being done by the Government&#x003F; And this is an important thing. Most of the objections people have against immigration, result from the terrible housing shortage. The position is critical. The position is that, if one brings immigrants here they have the right to expect to be provided with housing. But the established citizenry has as much right to expect not to be ousted from their homes. That is why I say that the Government is guilty of very serious neglect. There are shocking housing conditions. In my constituency I have a case where 19 people live in one three-roomed house, where sick children have to sleep on the floor and husbands and wives cannot share a room with each other. That is a shocking situation, and it is no exception. Listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The housing situation could make or break long-term organized immigration, and the shortage in South Africa is now serious.</block>

<p>This is Mr. G. H. Millman, of the 1820 Settlers Memorial Association. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Energetic steps should be taken without delay to remove this blot from our immigration image. We are at the stage where letters and articles are published overseas regarding emigrants&#x2019; experiences with housing here, which cancel out all the other incentives we can offer. <i>(Cape Argus,)</i> 10th May, 1967.)</block>

<p>The situation is critical. Here we have Mr. J. H. Liebenberg, Chairman of the Railways Staff Association. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the end of this year South Africa will be facing the biggest housing crisis in its history.</block>

<p>I say that the Government has a duty in this respect, because the main feeling against immigration results from the housing shortage. Therefore, if we want to make the public receptive to immigration, the Government should see to it that its rate of providing housing is accelerated so that the established population may not suffer and the immigrant&#x2019;s right to proper accommodation when he comes here, is also provided for.</p>

<p>That argument we have heard a hundred times. At present we build a hundred houses in one day. When the two of us were children, it took nine months to build one house. We are living in other times. That sort of comparison is ridiculous. Our fifth point is this. We believe that immigrants should not be subjected to undue pressure. One finds it upsetting to see with what rudeness immigrants are treated in certain circles. It is not easy to leave one&#x2019;s <span class="col_6621-6622" refersTo="page_0572"/>country and to settle in another. It is not easy to learn new languages, and that is why it is our duty to be tolerant. Our duty is to show understanding for these new people who come to South Africa. They enrich us intellectually and professionally, but as far as being South Africans is concerned, the greatest asset is not to be found in the immigrant himself, but in his children who are born in this country and in the children who are trained in our schools. There lies our greatest asset in the future. I think it is time for leaders on that side to say something about this matter. They ought to tell the country that we should not make undue and unreasonable demands on immigrants as far as language and customs are concerned. We must remember that those who do come here, have been invited by the Government and are immigrating to this country mostly at the instance of the Government. Our sixth point of policy is this. We believe that education for immigrant children should be designed in such a way that it must enable the immigrant to become a fully bilingual citizen. In other words, we should like to see that in view of the fact that we have a colossal long-term immigration policy, our school system should be designed in such a way that immigrants, also those who are English and Dutch-speaking, will in fact be permitted to choose the language which comes more easily to them, but from the very outset they should be afforded the opportunity of coming into contact with children of both language groups. If that avenue is not opened for them, they cannot be blamed later if they are not fully bilingual citizens. All sorts of wild ideas are cropping up, such as that of Senator Dr. Loock, who advocates that 65 per cent of our immigrants should be forced to go to Afrikaans schools. I am an Afrikaans-speaking person. I am not afraid of saying that it would give me pleasure if as many immigrants as possible associated themselves with the Afrikaans cultural group, but I cannot think of anything that will arouse amongst immigrants such an aversion to the Afrikaans cultural group than our trying to force them. That will be a mistake. I believe that such a thing will cause damage to the entire immigration effort. We should like to hear what the Government has to say about this attitude that was adopted by one of its prominent Senators. It will be a great disservice to the immigrant if we are to have a tug of war between the Afrikaans and English cultural groups about the question of immigration. The Afrikaans cultural group has not achieved its present position through force. It has achieved that position through its inherent attractiveness and through the depths of its roots in the soil of South Africa. There is no reason whatsoever to believe that that will not continue and will not hold good for the future as well, namely that it will grow and flourish. But then we must, amongst other things, put a stop to the practice which has arisen in the case of some Afrikaans newspapers, particularly those supporting the Government, that any Tom, Dick and Harry who makes a statement to the newspaper assumes to himself the right to do so in the name of Afrikanerdom. Lately there have been offensive examples of small-minded persons making insulting remarks about immigrants, and doing so in the name of Afrikanerdom. It is a mistake on the part of Government newspapers to make lesser lights and minor personalities appear to be great minds who have the right to speak on behalf of the Afrikaner. Such people have already caused the idea to take root amongst immigrants that the Afrikaner is a sort of Mother Grundy who is afraid of the world around her. The Government has the power to rectify these matters. We think that the best way of doing so is to follow an educational system which will bring the immigrant child into contact with both language groups, both the Afrikaans and the English cultural group.

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have just had an example of a spiteful, obstreperous and in general nonsensical speech by a small man who, in my humble opinion as far as politics is concerned, has mastered everything except how to be a good, successful, respectable politician. We are dealing this afternoon with a very important subject which ultimately concerns the future of the Whites very seriously. A little man&#x2014;I want to say it again&#x2014;stands up here and makes this obstreperous and spiteful speech which he made in this House this afternoon. I understand that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout received a letter the other day. The letter was addressed to &#x201C;Japie Basson, South Africa&#x201D;. The letter reached him. It was not only due to the skill of the postmaster that the letter reached him. I understand that on the back of the envelope the following words were written: &#x201C;Please keep your big mouth shut&#x201D;. This enabled the postmaster to deliver the letter. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the discourtesy with which immigrants were being treated in certain circles. I want to ask him whether he honestly thinks that it was not discourteous to refer in this House to immigrants as &#x201C;the importing of skin and bones, just because they are White&#x201D;. That came from the mouth of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I want to ask him: Was it not discourteous towards immigrants to say that&#x003F; He referred to immigrants as people who came into this country to eat our people&#x2019;s food, take our work away and oppress the Afrikaner [Interjections.] The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has just used these words. [Interjections.] The hon. member must first sweep before his own, and before the United Party&#x2019;s door before he makes this kind of allegation in the House.</p>

<p>I do not want to digress too far from my point now. In the first instance I would like to express very cordial appreciation and pay tribute to the Minister of Immigration for the particularly excellent way in which he has handled this difficult post of Immigration. His sacrifices and dedication, the exceptional dignity <span class="col_6623-6624" refersTo="page_0573"/>as well as the wisdom with which he is administering this post is not passing unnoticed. We just want to place on record that it is being appreciated very highly, that we are proud of him and that we wish him a speedy and full recovery.</p>

<p>In the second place, Sir, you will allow me also to express our gratitude and appreciation to the officials of the Department of Immigration and in particular to the Immigration Selection Board. They are people who undertake a very difficult task under very difficult circumstances with great dedication in the interests of our country and our nation. It is demanding work for which they often get curses for thanks. That is why we on this side would like to offer them our sincere thanks. We want to tell them that we notice what they are doing. It is being appreciated.</p>

<p>I believe that in regard to immigration the choice before South Africa is in truth a simple one. The choice is the following: Immigration or integration. Consequently we must do everything in our power to strengthen the Whites in South Africa as far as possible. It has been calculated that shortly before the year 2000 we in South Africa will have anything between 35 and 40 million non-Whites, as against approximately 6 or 6.5 million Whites. That is why I was not exactly enamoured of the speech which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made this afternoon. This matter has become such a vital one that it really is a choice between immigration or integration. We must all of us help to further immigration in South Africa, properly and on a good basis, and to make our people aware of the important choice facing our nation at this time. I want to point out that many members of the public have the wrong image of immigration. The public must be informed about this matter. For example, I want to point out that we get four types of foreigners from abroad in South Africa. Of these four only one group is actually an immigrant group. Of the four types we find there are in the first place illegal immigrants who enter the country by slipping across the border at night and who then try to make South Africa their home. But they are no immigrants. The Government is doing everything in its power to stop these people or to apprehend and expel them from the country. They are no immigrants. Many of those people do harm in this country and distort the image our immigration policy presents, while they are in reality no immigrants. But we also find a second group of people. Last year no less than 260,000 tourists visited South Africa. We welcome those tourists. Most of them are first-rate and very good people. But amongst those tourists there are people who do not possess all those excellent qualities. And when they make a blunder in South Africa it is calmly attributed to our immigrants. That is not right at all. In the third place we find a group of people, from the ranks of this tourist group who, after arriving in South Africa have discovered that it is a very beautiful and a fine country and who then try and establish themselves here by acquiring temporary residential permits. But they are not immigrants either. Most of them are also very good people but when any one of them does harm or commits a crime it is also attributed to the immigrants. Again that is not right. The immigrants in South Africa comprise the fourth group. It consists of those people who have been properly selected by the Immigration Selection Board and who have come to make a new home for themselves in South Africa. I believe, and I state it very emphatically here this afternoon, that South Africa, more than any other country in the world, has every reason to be proud of this fourth group, the real immigrant group. And they are not skin and bone just because they are white, as was alleged by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. In general they are good, first-rate people who are a real asset to South Africa. I just want to point out to you that the Afrikaner nation is made up of 37.5 per cent Dutch, 35 per cent German, 14 per cent French, 3 per cent Scandinavian and 9.5 per cent of what Dr. Pama and Prof. Con de Villiers describe as indeterminable. In addition I want to point out that the gain in immigrants over the past six years up to December 1966 was 144,000. As against that the natural increase of Afrikaans and English-speaking persons in South Africa over the same six-year period was 290,000. If one does a bit of simple arithmetic it appears that for every immigrant under the Immigration Scheme of the National Government over the period 1960 to 1966 two South Africans arrived in South Africa by the process of natural birth. Two to one therefore and of those 144,000 immigrants who entered the country no less than 6,000 were from Africa countries last year, namely persons who had been born in South Africa but who had returned as immigrants. In my opinion therefore immigration by no means constitutes a threat for any group in the country. That is why we must try and keep this matter outside party politics and allow it to remain outside party politics because it is of such cardinal importance to us. It is understandable that amongst some of us feelings may have been aroused against immigrants. It is a completely natural phenomenon. We do not take it amiss of people for trying to warn the Government to be careful in regard to the handling of this matter. After all, we are a nation which has just come through a difficult struggle in order to establish ourselves as far as our language, etc., is concerned. That is why we understand the sentiments and are very sympathetically disposed towards them. We can rely on the Government&#x2014;as is indicated by the figures which I have mentioned&#x2014;to continue to handle this matter with the utmost circumspection. But on the other hand we do just want to point out that it would perhaps be better to refrain from making rash statements in regard to immigration and immigrants if that were in some way or other to place this <span class="col_6625-6626" refersTo="page_0574"/>question in a bad light. That is something which could do us inestimable damage particularly in respect of the recruition of immigrants in our parent countries, which is so very important. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to spend much time on the remarks made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I should just like to make one remark in this regard, arising from what he said. I just want to say something in connection with the list of newspaper headlines he quoted from. I do not want to indemnify the Press for everything it does. But I also think that it has become a habit with the hon. member to quot; only such things as may suit his argument. The Press has on occasion, we may as well say this, in addition to all the errors which it has made, addressed timely warnings and given guidance for which we should rather be grateful. It is probably not wrong that, if there are people in the country who are concerned about our immigrant problem, they should utter warnings in regard to that problem. I agree that sometimes it is quite exaggerated, but the fact of the matter is that out of those exaggerated warnings a nucleus of good can arise and one must at least take notice of it. Since the hon. member quoted from the Afrikaans Press, which he called the Nationalist Press, and since he said in reply to an interjection that not one of the English newspapers had made any remarks about the matter, I would like to ask him whether he has forgotten what happened a week and a half or two weeks ago in this House. At that time the hon. the Prime Minister, arising out of a short debate which had been requested, said that newspapers had written about the outburst which took place at Hillbrow. Has the hon. member forgotten about that outburst&#x003F; An outburst against German immigrants&#x003F; Has the hon. member forgotten that the hon. the Prime Minister said that it was the Press which, to a large extent, had to be held responsible for that. It was definitely not the National Party Press which was held responsible for that.</p>

<p>But I do not want to waste my time by saying anything further about that matter. Apart from the Press which is not here to defend itself and has no voice in this House, I should like to ask the hon. member whether there is not something else which is having a detrimental effect on immigration&#x003F; And then I am addressing myself very cordially to the entire Opposition. Perhaps I should single out some of them and talk in particular to the hon. member for Houghton, but that I would not do cordially. Do you think that the image, which is being created abroad where our immigrants have to be recruited by statements in and sometimes outside this House, is conducive to drawing immigrants to South Africa&#x003F; And has the Opposition forgotten that they told people in South Africa to vote for the right to vote again&#x003F; Do they remember that they told the people that capital would flow out of the country&#x003F; Do you remember that they told South African citizens from one platform after another that they would no longer be able to make a living in this country and that they would have to leave&#x003F; Those speeches which the Opposition made were so marvellously effective that we even found emigrants who left the shores of South Africa on their insistence, because the Opposition had said: &#x201C;No hope for this country under a Nationalist Government.&#x201D; Do you still remember that&#x003F; Now I want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that before he blames the Press, before he blames other people for conditions which create unfavourable climates for immigrants&#x2014;things which of course sometimes do go hand in hand, I want to add&#x2014;he should first of all look for the fault amongst irresponsible statements made by people whom I, at any rate, regard as being responsible people.</p>

<p>But I want to come to something more positive. To the thanks which were expressed here by the hon. member for Primrose I would also like to add a few other votes of thanks. In the first instance there is a vote of thanks owing to the voluntary organizations which have not only said but have proved with deeds that they want to help to create that climate of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke, one which is necessary in order to make our immigrants feel at home in our country. In this connection I want to mention the names of three organizations in particular, namely the 1820 Memorial Settlers Association, the &#x201E;Maatskappy vir Europese Immigrasie&#x201D;, and the South Africa League, which has helped Whites from Kenya and East Africa to immigrate to this country. They are receiving a subsidy from the Government and are making it their task, in a first-rate fashion, to make new inhabitants of our fatherland feel at home here. Possibly it is known to the House that the 1820 Memorial Settlers Association, which carries on the ideals of the 1820 immigrants, is particularly active in regard to the immigrants from the United Kingdom. And let me now, as Afrikaans-speaking person and as a Nationalist and as somebody who loves my own language, say here that I believe that the immigrants which we obtained from the United Kingdom were an asset to our country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Before business was interrupted I had been afforded an opportunity of conveying thanks to the voluntary organizations which have helped to make immigrants coming to our country feel at home, and in this regard I referred to the 1820 Settlers Association. Mr. Chairman, when discussing this association I want to associate myself for a moment with one positive statement which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made, namely the one in respect of the <span class="col_6627-6628" refersTo="page_0575"/>language of the immigrants coming to our country. I do not think it would be fair of me to ask this of the hon. the Minister, who is officiating in the absence of the Minister of Immigration, but I nevertheless want to ask that we strive to achieve the ideal of making all citizens who come to South Africa bilingual as far as possible. Arising also from what the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs said recently in a debate, I think we are at least on common ground when I say that we should continue to strive to attain that ideal, which has to a large extent already been attained, i.e. the ideal that all South African citizens should be fully bilingual. I would therefore welcome it, as would the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and any other member, particularly the Afrikaans cultural organizations&#x2014;while Afrikaans cannot compete against English as a world language here&#x2014;if it were possible to apply every means to make immigrants fully bilingual. I, as an Afrikaans-speaking person, want to associate myself with the writers of the numerous letters which have appeared in the public Press, and with the appeals which have been made by people who love their language, requesting that South African citizens should also have a good grounding in Afrikaans.</p>

<p>There is probably nothing wrong with each one of us having a love for what is our own, and there is probably nothing wrong if I as Protestant also ask that the Protestant balance in our fatherland as it exists at present should not be disturbed by bringing immigrants to this country. I am not ashamed to say this, nor do I believe that anybody will take it amiss of me if I say that this is also the Government&#x2019;s policy, a policy which I welcome wholeheartedly. I want to quote here what the hon. the Minister said in the Other Place, and what was previously said by the former Minister of Immigration, in respect of the balance and the religious set-up of our country&#x2019;s population when it comes to immigration. He said (Senate Hansard, Col. 706) (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has always prided itself on the fact that freedom of religion is allowed within its borders. On the other hand we have never hesitated to let the world know that we are a Protestant country and that in this respect we will not allow any change to take place. That is why the Government has given an undertaking to the effect that its immigration policy will not be applied in such a way that it will lead to the disturbance of its population structure as far as religion, culture and general way of life is concerned.</block>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a statement which was made by the hon. Senator, who is sitting to the left of me, as Minister of Immigration and it still applies.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that we can at least concede to each member of our population the freedom to fight for those things which are dear to him, and if Afrikaans Protestant churches or English Protestant churches request that immigrants should, as far as possible, be drawn from Protestant countries then I do not know what fault we can find with that, just as I do not know what fault we can find if people of other religious persuasions also request that people subscribing to their points of view should come to this country, and endeavour to bring that about.

<p>Sir, in dealing with the remarks made here by the hon. member for Primrose let me just start off by saying this to him. He said that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had attacked the Afrikaans Press here for having made certain derogatory statements as far as immigrants were concerned, and he then went on to say that they were not here to defend themselves. I do not think the hon. member need be disturbed about the fact that members of the Press are not in this Chamber to defend themselves, because they are always capable of defending themselves anyhow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Primrose referred to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as &#x201C;daardie klein mannetjie&#x201D;. I think that was a very unfair statement to make; it was a case of stone-throwing by a man who lives in a glass house. If ever the saying &#x201C;keep your big mouth shut&#x201D; applied to anybody, it could apply to the hon. member for Primrose. Sir, we know that the followers of this Government ever since 1948 have stifled, stagnated and stopped immigration to such an extent that to-day the white population of this country is only 3* million people. Sir, do you know what has happened in Australia over the same period, in spite of the shortage of housing, the problem of inflation and all the other problems which they have had as far as their economy is concerned&#x003F; Since 1948 they have more than doubled their population, from 5* million to over 11 million. You know what has happened in Canada. Canada has also more than doubled her European population, and she has done so under the same set of circumstances, in spite of a housing shortage and in spite of economic problems. Do you know what happened in Brazil&#x003F; Brazil has trebled her European population over the same period under circumstances like ours. There too they have a preponderance of black people and they have the same sort of problems that we have. In spite of these problems Brazil trebled her European population. What does this Government do&#x003F; This Government has stifled immigration to such an extent that our white population of <i>2j</i> million in 1948 has now become <span class="col_6629-6630" refersTo="page_0576"/>only 3&#x00BC; million. Sir, this is the most staggering sin that has ever been committed against the white race of this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to get back to a statement made earlier on by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that our net gain as far as immigrants are concerned was 32,500. I think the hon. the Minister corrected that figure in the Other Place and said that our net gain was 38,000 and not 32,500. I have figures here showing the net gain in immigration. We got 48,000 immigrants and we lost 10,000 people who emigrated. To me it is a staggering thing that in a young virile country, sparsely populated as we are in this country, we can lose 10,000 people in one year. We did not lose them to the northern territories, as we have been doing during the period from 1948 to 1964; we lost them to other countries. Ten thousand people emigrated from this country in one year and we had a net gain of 38,000. To me this is a most disturbing thing that for some reason or another this country has become so unpopular that 3,200 of our citizens emigrated to the United Kingdom and quite a number to Europe. I should have thought that we would succeed in attracting immigrants to this country if we constantly emphasized to the outside world what a good country this was to live in. Sir, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s target was as far as immigration was concerned. In this connection I should like to quote briefly what the hon. the Minister said in the Other Place. He clearly said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I say that it is my policy to attract as many suitable and acceptable immigrants to our country as can be found and as can be absorbed in our economy, without disturbing our national set-up and our way of life, I feel sure that there will be general agreement.</block>

<p>Sir, I also feel sure that there will be general agreement with that statement. The one thing I do not understand is the Minister&#x2019;s reference to obtaining immigrants &#x201C;without disturbing our national set-up and our way of life&#x201D;. Then we find that another authority, in addressing a meeting in Durban, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless immigration was maintained at the present level South Africa would be faced with integration. It was immigration or integration.</block>

<p>Sir, that statement was made, according to the newspapers, by Dr. Piet Koornhof, National M.P. for Primrose. I presume that he was speaking there on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government was aiming at 40,000 immigrants a year, he told a crowd of 400, most of them immigrants. Dr. Koornhof said &#x201C;We need more people but not only by birth in South Africa but through immigration as well. The choice before South Africa is simply&#x2014;immigration or integration.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, I put a question to the hon. the Minister earlier on with regard to the housing shortage. In this connection the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that it was possible nowadays to erect hundreds of prefabricated houses in a few days. If we are serious in saying that the maintenance of white civilization in this country is dependent on building up the white population, then even the target of 40,000 is too small a target to aim at for this country where the non-Whites outnumber the Whites by 31 or four to one. We must set our sights a bit higher than that. Sir, we hear all this talk about a shortage of housing and about whether immigrants will be able to fit in to our economy and our national way of life. Sir, can we afford at this stage to be concerned about the language or the religion of white immigrants that we can bring to this country&#x003F;</p>

Where are the people to come from who are predominantly Protestants&#x003F; Sir, what is the most vital issue in this country as far as the maintenance of white civilization is concerned&#x003F; I maintain that the most vital issue and almost the only issue at this stage is to bring in people with white skins who can fit into our economy, regardless of whether they will become Afrikaans-speaking.

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) revealed himself here at the outset of his speech as a very great statistician, but I do not want to follow up on what he had to say in that regard. I shall, during the course of my speech, return to certain matters which he raised. But I would like to refer to something which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. I want to suggest this evening that the United Party has, in its immigration policy, had two clear ulterior motives. The first <span class="col_6631-6632" refersTo="page_0577"/>was that it wanted to throw the doors in South Africa wide open to immigrants without selection.</p>

<p>I told the hon. member by way of interjection when General Smuts made that speech in which he spoke about the good and the bad who were to be allowed to enter. General Smuts made that speech on 14th August, 1946, and another hon. member on this side will disclose the contents of that speech in a moment. I also want to say that a further objective of the United Party had been to undermine or to plough under the Afrikaans-speaking people; to put it mildly immigrants had to be brought in as voting cattle. A leading Minister on that side, Colonel Reitz, said so in the early 30&#x2019;s and so did other prominent members of the United Party, <i>inter alia,</i> one who was a front bencher for years, i.e. Dr. Louis Steenkamp. According to the <i>Vryheid Gazette</i> he said something similar. According to this newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The speaker, Dr. Steenkamp, spoke about the millions of natives in South Africa and more millions in Africa and said that when the United Party were returned to power they would introduce immigrants to the country not by the thousands but by the millions &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those are the same words used by General Smuts. Then the report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Afrikaner section of the nation will be overwhelmed, the section to which he himself (i.e. Dr. Steenkamp) belongs, but it would build a larger and greater nation in South Africa.</block>

<p>I leave it at that. The allegation made by the United Party last year to the effect that the National Party had taken over its policy is devoid of all truth. It is an assertion which has been ridden to death already and it has by now become such an obsession with the United Party that that Party itself believes it. The National Party did not take over the policy of any other party. It has its own National Party orientated policy. It is not a policy which was only drawn up after the National Party had come into power in 1948. On 25th February 1947 Dr. Malan, as Leader of the Opposition at that time, set out the immigration policy of the National Party in this House and that speech was based on the principles of the National Party, according to its programme of principles which had been drawn up in 1937. According to that programme of principles of 1937, the immigration policy of the National Party contained four basic requirements. Firstly, the strengthening of the white population with desirable persons who would not lower the moral standards of the white population; secondly, the recruiting of immigrants was to have remained under State control so that no undesirable persons could enter the country; thirdly, immigrants had to be restricted to elements which could be assimilated by the Afrikaner people; fourthly, the presence of immigrants was not to have constituted a threat to our own people on the labour market and in that way to have prejudiced the material standards of our people.</p>

<p>The motives of the Government in regard to immigration, as well as the methods and procedures which are being followed to-day, rest on precisely the same basis as that stated in 1937 and 1947, but the set-up has been broadened because circumstances have now changed. But the Government&#x2019;s policy remains basically the same and envisages the following: Firstly, to strengthen the white sector of the population with selected, suitable and acceptable immigrants; secondly, to help combat the shortage of workers which is being experienced because of the perennial economic growth; thirdly, to draw immigrants who will fit in with and adapt to the South African way of life.

<p>Fourthly, to make good South Africans of the immigrants who will in due course fit in with the South African pattern of life. What is being envisaged here is to make good citizens of the country of the immigrants, good full-blooded Republicans and not merely to use them as voting cattle. Immigrants can themselves subsequently decide to whom they are going to give their political allegiance. Fifthly, to allow only as many as can be absorbed by the economy and to assimilate them only in fields of labour where a shortage exists. Sixthly, to do so in such a way that it will not affect our way of life, and so that the balance of the indigenous population will not be disturbed in respect of its culture, its heritage and its religion. The methods which are being put into practice are to apply a strict selection scheme and recruit immigrants mainly from the parent countries. These parent countries are situated around the North Sea, that area which yielded 90 per cent of the immigrants who have come to this country over the years. I believe that as long as it is possible to draw immigrants from this source, it should be done, and I am entreating the hon. the Minister to make even greater efforts to draw immigrants from these countries which have in the past made the greatest contribution to our population structure. I am aware of the fact that in these countries such as Holland, Germany, and even Belgium, there is economic growth and economic boom at the moment, and I even know that those countries are compelled to draw workers from other countries. But nevertheless we must not, as a result of that, relax our recruiting attempts to draw immigrants from those countries. At the moment it would appear that there has <span class="col_6633-6634" refersTo="page_0578"/>been a slight relaxation in the economic growth of Holland and it may be that in a few years&#x2019; time there may be unemployment. We also know that the Dutch population is multiplying rapidly. It is calculated that even the most intensive utilization of its economic resources will not prevent unemployment there. In addition, Holland is a small country of approximately 16,000 square miles, a quarter the size of the Free State, and we know that these people will in due course not be able to make a proper living there. This will mean that quite a few people will in future emigrate from Holland we hope that when that happens the Republic of South Africa will be prepared to draw those immigrants to our country.</p>

<p>I should just like to avail myself of the opportunity of refuting the idea which exists amongst the hon. members of the Opposition that the Government took over the immigration policy from them. If there was ever a statement which was devoid of all truth then it is that specific statement. This Government did not take over any other party&#x2019;s immigration policy. This party acted according to sound political judgment, and not always according to what was popular, but it came forward only with what was in the interests of South Africa. This was, as has been mentioned by a colleague of mine who spoke previously, a separate National Party orientated immigration policy which in no way tried to interpret the policy of the United Party of that time, or even of hon. members on the opposite side. During the United Party&#x2019;s period of office, right up to 1948, they allowed immigrants to enter South Africa indiscriminately&#x2014;and this is a proven fact&#x2014;irrespective of whether there was prosperity in South Africa and irrespective of whether it was in the best interests of South Africa. My time is limited, but I just want to refer briefly to the statements made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout when he tried to refute the speech made by the late General Smuts on 14th August, 1946, in which the late General Smuts said <i>inter alia</i> that the gates of South Africa should be opened wide and that immigrants in their thousands must come to South Africa, irrespective of whether they were good or bad immigrants. I should like to refer to that speech made by the late General Smuts so that there can be no misunderstanding about it. I refer to an article in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 14th August 1946, with the headline, &#x201C;Union call for Immigrants. Smuts announces active policy&#x201D;. The article reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa&#x2019;s population remained small until the Kimberley diamonds were discovered. Then there was a big rush with a large increase in population. Later gold was discovered and another tremendous influx of people came. In those days the law allowed everybody to enter South Africa. All came, the good and the bad.</block>

<p>If the hon. member for Bezuidenhout now wants to tell me that the <i>Cape Argus,</i> as the United Party Press sometimes does, reported General Smuts incorrectly, then I should like to refer him to what the former Minister of Justice. Mr. Harry Lawrence, said in this House, and I am quoting from Hansard of 9th March, col 2225&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General Smuts made a speech in Pretoria in which he gave a blueprint of the ideas of the United Party, and he urged the country as a whole to accept a bold, visionary policy of immigration. It was an appeal to the country. Here let me say at once that in my view no full-scale immigration policy or scheme can be a complete success unless it has the support of all the political parties in the country as a whole. General Smuts was attempting to take the people into his confidence and made a speech in which he said: &#x201C;Let us open our doors; let them all come, the good and the bad.&#x201D;</block>

<p>If there was ever a blessing for South Africa then it was the fact that that party with an immigration policy like that lost control of the country in 1948. The immigration policy of the National Party is based on the principle that it must be in the interests of the country and its people. Then only is an immigrant welcome here. Another <span class="col_6635-6636" refersTo="page_0579"/>principle of our policy is that no immigrant must do any white person in South Africa out of his job. That was not the case when the Party on the opposite side of the House was governing this country. When we speak of an immigration policy then what we mean is a well thought out policy, a policy which is net aimed at disturbing the population structure of South Africa or in causing unemployment. That was what happened under the Government of the Party on the opposite side of the House. I think we all agree that the white sector of the population of South Africa must be strengthened more rapidly than natural increase is able to do. We need great numbers, not only to strengthen ourselves as a white nation at the southernmost point of Africa, but also because we need the manpower for our rapidly developing economy. The continual expansion of our industries, particularly in the technical field, makes it impossible for us to supply the necessary skilled manpower from our own resources. The fact that we have a shortage of manpower this afternoon and that we have to resort to immigrants would never have arisen if our own natural increase rate had been high enough. The positive step which we ought to take of course is to increase the birth rate amongst the whites in our country. Perhaps the time has been ripe for some time for a thorough investigation to be instituted on the part of the Government into every possibility which could facilitate the achievement of this ideal. We are aware of the fact that an investigation is at the moment being instituted into the payment of family allowances. We are also aware of the fact that our taxation system makes provision for certain concessions to large families. I am humbly suggesting that in my opinion these are only a few minor aspects of the entire problem. There are numerous other aspects which have to be investigated thoroughly. If we analyse the birth rate in South Africa then one outstanding essential fact emerges&#x2014;namely the essential need for us to formulate a thorough population policy with South Africa as soon as possible. For us and our survival such a policy, a method of increasing our families and developing as a white nation in South Africa, is as essential as our non-white policy is. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>We have seen here this evening a bunch of political Rip van Winkles who have suddenly woken up to the fact that they have allowed 20 years in the history of our country just to go by while they were fast asleep. Of the last two speakers the one still has a beard while the other one looks as if his beard has fallen off. I believe the people of South Africa are going to hold it for ever against the Nationalist Party that they allowed 20 years to go by like that. When the hon. member for Primrose was in England I am sure he saw, as I did, the queues of people outside Canada House, Australia House and New Zealand House&#x2014;some of the finest young people in Great Britain queuing up to get out of the country of shortages, of labour government and of restrictions resulting from the war. Out of 20 of my personal friends in London there are only two left today. These young people left Britain looking for a new life and a new challenge. Yet they were not allowed by this Government to come to South Africa. The reason for that was given by the hon. member for Koedoespoort&#x2014;that he and others feared for the future of Afrikanerdom. Will hon. members opposite tell me that they would have regretted it if the United Party had brought another million white people to this country under its immigration policy&#x003F; Would they tell me now in all seriousness that another million white people brought in during 1948 would have meant the ploughing under of the Afrikaner&#x003F; Would they tell me that that could not have led to the strengthening of the Afrikanervolk as part of the white group of this country&#x003F; Is it not as a result of what this Government has done that we live to-day on a razor&#x2019;s edge as far as our White existence is concerned&#x003F; Is that not so because this Government closed the door in the face of some of the finest people in Great Britain and in other countries of Europe, people who were living under similar conditions as most people in Germany when I passed through there during 1948-&#x2019;49&#x003F; They would have given anything to live in a garage in a back street of any city of South Africa because here at least they had a fair chance of getting food and to obtain some kind of employment. These people were living in D.P. camps, shut in behind barbed wire and kept there because there was nothing for them to do outside. These are the people who would have come to this country of ours&#x2014;the sort of people this Government is now chasing all over Europe to recruit, now that Europe is booming and when everything the people want is there at their doors. The Government is even making use of T.V., chasing and begging people in Europe to come here to South Africa to strengthen our white population. I think this is a scandalous thing. It will be visited upon this Government for many years to come. The hon. member for Queenstown a while ago interjected and said that it was a duty of this Government to maintain the balance in the country, the religious balance. Let me ask the hon. the Minister whether that is his policy&#x003F; Is that the policy of this Department&#x003F; Does he agree with the hon. member or does he not&#x003F; What the hon. member said is something he may live to regret. The hon. member for Primrose talked about integration and immigration. I believe this is a ploy on the part of the hon. member for Primrose. Concern in the ranks of the Nationalist Party about immigration is so great to-day that here we have the old classic tactics of the Nationalist Party of tying everything to the &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D;&#x2014;you can sell the people everything as long as it is tied to the &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D;. Therefore immigration is now being tied to the &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D;&#x2014;we must have immigration or integration. This is the cry hon. <span class="col_6637-6638" refersTo="page_0580"/>members opposite have been giving out from all corners of our country. They are serving notice on their own people, on their own voters that they must accept immigration, whether they like it or not. This is going to be used to smother all the unrest there is today in the ranks of the supporters of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>But I rose this evening to bring a specific matter to the notice of the hon. the Minister. This is a question concerning the immigration of people from Zambia. These people are in a peculiarly difficult position. The Government of Zambia regards itself I believe as being at war with the white countries to its south. For persons in Zambia wishing to leave the country, people of substance, the direct route south is not the shortest route. In fact, for them a detour via other countries is the only way in which they can get to South Africa. The case of one of my constituents was brought to my notice the other day. He came here from Zambia leaving his children and wife behind. He made a special plea to me in a letter in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the sake of those who come after, and I am sure there will be many, I would suggest that, if possible, the diplomatic mission in Salisbury should be a little less of a misinformed brick wall.</block>

<p>That is strong talk, Mr. Chairman. It is very strong talk indeed from a person wishing to immigrate. I believe this listening post we have, this diplomatic mission in Salisbury, is one of the most sensitive on the whole continent of Africa and where people who apply to come here for whatever purpose from Zambia have got to be treated with the utmost sympathy and understanding. In this particular case it was only with a considerable amount of difficulty that a visitor&#x2019;s permit was issued to come to South Africa so that they could make application for permanent residence. This is something which I believe will have to be done more and more in future because I believe there is a large potential of White people in Zambia who are looking south to us here in South Africa &#x2026; [Interjection.]</p>

<p>This particular constituent of mine also says in his letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My sole purpose in bringing this to your attention is to suggest that it may be useful to look at the Republic&#x2019;s immigration policy in the light of recent Zambian political thinking.</block>

<p>That also is my plea, Sir, to the hon. the Minister and to his Department. Special instructions should be issued if necessary&#x2014;if that is the necessary <i>via media</i> to go through &#x2014;to the mission in Salisbury to regard all people coming from Zambia with the utmost sympathy and to facilitate their exit from that country and their entry into South Africa with a view to their becoming future permanent citizens of South Africa. But may I go one step further with the hon. the Minister and his Department&#x003F; When we are looking for immigrants may I make an appeal to the hon. the Minister and his Department to look for the youth&#x003F; That is the way in which we could attract the attention of potential immigrants in countries overseas&#x2014;of people prepared to meet the tremendous challenges South Africa offers in leaving their own country and coming to a country such as ours where there are great challenges that have to be faced. Therefore I think we can easily fire the imagination of the youth of Europe with the many advantages we have to offer here in South Africa. If young people want to come here to marry and to raise families here, let them come. So, I should like to make this earnest plea to the Minister and to his Department that they should concentrate on the young people and bring them to South Africa, young people who whilst they will enjoy what we have to offer in South Africa will at the same time be prepared to meet the challenges posed by the problems we have to face here in South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Before replying to the various matters raised so far b&#x201D; hon. members, I want to make two general statements by way of introduction. The first relates to the attitude adopted by the United Party in this debate. You know, Mr. Chairman, whenever it suits them to do so, they claim our immigration policy as their own. Those of us who have listened carefully to <span class="col_6639-6640" refersTo="page_0581"/>the debate this afternoon will have noticed that it seems as if the United Party is extremely disappointed because we are having such great success in our efforts as far as immigration is concerned. I shall tell you where I noticed those signs of disappointment&#x2014;amongst others with the hon. member for East London (North), who referred to the losses which we are alleged to have suffered and which, according to him, are supposed to be so shocking.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to make the statement that one of the main tasks of any country which receives immigrants is to get those immigrants assimilated in its society within a reasonable space of time. This is the task of a large country such as America, which has received many immigrants, and the task of Australia. As a matter of fact, any country that receives immigrants regards this as one of its tasks. Then, too, it is a fact that no country would like to see immigrants permanently standing aloof from the pattern and way of life of its people. Any nation which receives immigrants wants to see that those newcomers should, as in the case of South Africa, become new South Africans or, as they call them in Australia, new Australians. One would like to see the immigrants identifying themselves with and becoming integrated in the country to which they immigrate.</p>

<p>The second aspect that is of importance to one is that one would like to see that the national pattern and character are maintained and that they are not disturbed by the entrance of new-comers or through immigration. In this respect South Africa and the Afrikaners quoted in this debate on the strength of newspaper reports do not differ in any way from the other nations of the world that also receive immigrants. That is our attitude, and basically it does not differ in any way from the attitude of those other countries and nations who receive immigrants.</p>

<p>As far as the Government is concerned, it is therefore our endeavour to maintain our existing religious and cultural pattern in this country and not to allow it to be disturbed as a result of new-comers entering the country. One can in fact say that this endeavour of ours, which is also characteristic of other nations, is basic to the Government&#x2019;s immigration policy. We do not want our religious and cultural pattern to be disturbed. As a matter of fact, such an attitude is an absolute requirement also as far as the integration of the immigrants with the society is concerned. Surely one cannot expect a nation such as ours to become enthusiastic about the integration of immigrants if they fear that these newcomers are going to affect our whole pattern adversely. One cannot then expect the indigenous, established population to become enthusiastic about the assimilation of the newcomers. For that reason we shall always have to try and the Government will always try to regulate the stream of immigrants to this country in such a way that the immigrants will be acceptable to South Africa and assimilable in South Africa.</p>

<p>Pleas were advanced here in connection with our parent-countries. As a matter of fact, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a plea here as if we had never thought of those countries before and that we should now concentrate on the parent-countries. This, too, was supposedly the policy of the United Party. Now, while admitting that that is so&#x2014;the hon. member for Koedoespoort also made a strong plea for that&#x2014;I do want to say that we need have no fears in this connection. The attitude adopted by the Government is that we should concentrate on the parent-countries for our immigrants. Hence the particular success we have achieved in the past few years in getting immigrants from our parent-countries. As far as the European continent is concerned, we obtained 1,800 immigrants from our European parent-countries in 1961. Last year the figure was increased to 7,000. That is surely proof of the zeal with which the Department of Immigration is concentrating on recruiting immigrants from our parent-countries, and in this case, to be specific, from our European parent-countries. We are expanding our recruiting activities in those parent-countries in spite of the fact that in the majority of these countries we are not allowed to undertake recruiting campaigns openly.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another aspect now, and that is in connection with what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout quoted here from newspaper reports, reports which allegedly criticized our attitude towards immigration and immigrants to this country. One must view this criticism from our own side against the background of this natural desire on the part of the established population that the newcomers should be integrated with our society. It is a natural desire on the part of our people in this country that the newcomers should not stand aloof, that they should identify themselves with our culture in its entirety and that they should therefore really become potential citizens of this country. A good deal of this citicism must be viewed against that background. Pleas were made by some Afrikaner cultural leaders that some form of forced bilingualism should be introduced. These pleas, too, must be viewed against the background of the desire on the part of the Afrikaans-speaking people&#x2014;who constitute 60 per cent or more of the Republic&#x2019;s population&#x2014;that the newcomers should understand the traditions and the way of life of the people of this country. What better way is there of understanding other people&#x2019;s way of life than by being able to speak their language and by having a feeling for it&#x003F; One must view this matter against that background. To my mind there is nothing wrong with having such a desire. Whether it should be given effect to in that way is a totally different matter. I also associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member for Witbank, who pleaded that every possible effort should be made to make the immigrants in this country bilingual. When speaking of &#x201C;making people bilingual&#x201D; we mean that we should provide the facilities, <span class="col_6641-6642" refersTo="page_0582"/>that we should give them the opportunities and that we should make it attractive for them to become bilingual. We should not use some kind of &#x201C;sledge-hammer tactics&#x201D;. It astounds one to see how much has been done during the past few years in this connection in order to give our immigrants the opportunity to become bilingual. I am just going to mention a few particulars in this regard.</p>

<p>Let us take the Transvaal, where we find the largest concentration of immigrants. The Provincial Education Department there specially set aside 62 teachers for the purpose of giving lessons to immigrants. A total number of 3,800 immigrant pupils are being taught the other language in special classes in 52 schools. This is only as far as the Transvaal is concerned.</p>

<p>In which language&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give you the particulars. There are 825 pupils at 13 English-medium high schools, 2,773 pupils at 35 English-medium primary schools, 134 pupils at two Afrikaans-medium high schools and 101 pupils at two Afrikaans-medium primary schools. They therefore receive instruction in both the official languages. I am now going to give the figures for the Cape Province. In 1966 extra classes were given to immigrants at 58 schools. The position in the Free State and Natal is the same. In addition, the technical colleges are doing a very great deal in giving lessons to immigrants by means of the language laboratories. As you know, the language laboratory is one of the modern methods of learning a language quickly. This kind of instruction is being provided at quite a number of technical colleges. I am not going to tabulate all the figures, but altogether 3,500 immigrants took courses in the Afrikaans and the English language at the technical colleges in 1966 alone. I am told that the number will be even higher this year than the 3,500 who took Afrikaans and/or English. A great deal is therefore being done. Consequently I am rather surprised that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the radio so sneeringly. He said that insufficient use was being made of the radio. Does the hon. member never listen to the radio&#x003F; He should ask the hon. member for Orange Grove to tell him of all the things that are being said over the radio. A very great deal is being done by means of the radio for the immigrants in this country. The programmes presented by the radio are commendable. These are programmes which stimulate the immigrants to show an interest in our culture and our history. The radio is one of the means which contribute to immigrants learning the two languages. On this occasion I should like to make an appeal to the immigrants on the one hand to continue to learn the two languages in this country. These newcomers will make contact with South Africa only if, in addition to English, they know Afrikaans as well; otherwise they will be unable to make contact with the heart of South Africa. In the interests of their own happiness in this country I therefore want to urge them to do so. At the same time I want to appeal to our own people to continue with their efforts to integrate immigrants in our society. We must not make reproaches in ten or 20 years&#x2019; time because the immigrants&#x2014;these newcomers who came here during these years&#x2014;are still keeping themselves aloof from us. I think this is our responsibility. It is the responsibility of our established population to take the necessary steps, by way of encouragement and otherwise, to draw the immigrants into our society and to encourage them so that it can be made easier for them to become South Africans. That is why I want to make this earnest appeal to our people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked among other things: What is the objective of the Government as far as immigration is concerned&#x003F; What is the figure we are aiming at&#x003F; What is our pattern&#x003F; We have never mentioned a specific figure we have to reach or to which we are restricted. The Government&#x2019;s immigration policy and the Government&#x2019;s immigration programme are aimed at attracting as many suitable, acceptable immigrants as our national economy can absorb. It is no use our getting more immigrants than our national economy can absorb, because then we will be looking for serious trouble. If we do that we will have unemployment and we will create a feeling against immigrants among the people of this country. That is the last thing we want. But, Sir, apart from the absorptive capacity in the economic field, we can only allow immigrants to come to this country provided they do not cause the composition of our people to change materially. For that reason I associate myself with those who made pleas in connection with the religious and cultural aspects. The Government regards the maintenance of the existing position as regards the religious and cultural aspects as basic to our whole attitude towards immigration. If we were to upset that proportion we would get an anti-immigration attitude among the established population in this country which will make the Government&#x2019;s task infinitely more difficult in future as far as immigration is concerned. In order to prevent that we must see to it that the stream of immigrants is regulated in various suitable ways so as to maintain that pattern and to ensure that a spirit of goodwill prevails among the established population as regards the number of immigrants we still have to find. The hon. member wanted to know whether it was a long-term policy and whether we were still going to get immigrants for a long time. I cannot tell you whether it will be for another ten or 20 years. In the light of the economic development which is taking place in this country and the enormous task we have in providing our non-Whites in this country with employment opportunities and guidance, it is very clear to me that we shall have to <span class="col_6643-6644" refersTo="page_0583"/>continue for a very long time to bring suitable and skilled artisans to this country. According to the economists one skilled artisan provides employment for three unskilled workers. On that basis it has been calculated that the economically active immigrants who came into the country during 1963, 1964 and 1965 provided employment opportunities to approximately 190,000 unskilled workers, therefore mainly non-white workers. This will be South Africa&#x2019;s task for many years to come. If you ask me, therefore, whether it is a long-term policy, I say that I am unable to say whether it will take another decade or two, but, according to the present needs, we will have to keep up this stream of immigrants for a long time. Because we have to continue with it, we have to see to it that the pattern in this country is not disturbed, so that our own people will not revolt against this stream which has to continue of necessity. The hon. member for East London (City) referred to the losses suffered in connection with immigrants and said that we lost 10,000 emigrants in 1966, which, according to him, was a terrible loss. Yes, 10,000 is a considerable number, but one must keep one&#x2019;s perspective, after all. Allow me to put matters in the right perspective on the basis of what has happened since 1960. In 1961 we obtained 16,309 immigrants, lost 14,903 emigrants. We had a gain of only 1,406 then. In 1966 we received 41,920 immigrants. We had an additional 6,128 from the other countries, giving a total of 48,048. Our loss amounted to 9,888, resulting in a net gain&#x2014; and this is significant&#x2014;of 38,160. This is the largest net gain ever recorded in the history of this country. Is this not something we should be proud of and for which we should be grateful&#x003F; It is nothing strange in immigration countries that people leave again after they have come to the country. That happens in all the countries, for example Australia and New Zealand. One continually reads reports of immigrants who are dissatisfied in Australia and New Zealand, the same as others feel dissatisfied in this country. This is a tendency one finds among immigrants. What counts is the actual net gain. If we consider the fact that our net gain has increased year after year, it is something we may be proud of. It is an achievement on the part of this Government that it is succeeding in integrating the immigrants in this country and making them feel happy to such an extent that we are able to keep them in this country in such large numbers.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to housing. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that housing was one of the main reasons for our people feeling unhappy. I concede that housing is a touchy subject in a developing country such as this one. It is true that we simply cannot keep up as far as providing adequate housing is concerned. But this is something we realize. The Government is fully aware of the position and it appreciates the necessity to provide housing, and it is at present engaged on as large and as energetic a housing programme as one may expect within the framework of our financial resources. The hon. member for Mooi River referred to Zambia. The hon. member need have no fear that we are not treating the Zambian immigrants with the necessary sympathy. From statistics alone he will be able to deduce that we are treating the people from Zambia with the utmost sympathy. Let me just tell you what the latest statistics are in respect of Zambia. In 1966 South Africa&#x2019;s gain in immigrants from Zambia totalled 4,139. That is the highest from all the African states. The country having the next highest figure is Rhodesia. The largest gain from all the countries in Africa we get from Zambia. I am sympathetically disposed towards this matter and hon. members should not hesitate to submit to me or my Department any specific complaints they have in this regard. You may rest assured that attention will be given to such complaints, because we should like to give those people who want to come to this country&#x2014;and as you know we do not undertake recruiting there&#x2014;the opportunity to do so, because people who know Africa are an asset to South Africa. That is how we regard those people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister started by alleging that the United Party claims that the Nationalist Party has taken over our immigration policy. That is not exactly what we say. What we say, is that we had an immigration policy which not only worked, but which was bringing to South Africa the cream of the white people of Europe and the Western world, that this Government came into power and stopped that scheme, and that after 14 years it was forced to accept that we had been right all along. All that this Government has accepted, is the principle; it has acknowledged that we were right and it is now trying to imitate and apply the policy which we applied so successfully.</p>

<p>But then the hon. the Minister went on to quote two tasks in respect of immigrants. The first is to absorb the immigrant into the community. Of course we agree with him. We agree with him completely. We believe that the way to absorb the immigrant into the community is to make him feel a part of South Africa, proud to be a South African and wanting to be a South African citizen, participating in and accepting his responsibilities in the affairs of South Africa. That was why we had a citizenship procedure which made acceptable immigrants from countries associated with South Africa, automatically citizens of our country, who thereby accepted the responsibilities of citizenship. I believe that one of the fields in which this Government is failing, is in trying to persuade, attract and encourage the immigrant to become a South African in every sense of the word, to accept citizenship and to play his part in every sense as a South African. They are seeking the immigrants and bringing them here. But how do they look <span class="col_6645-6646" refersTo="page_0584"/>after them a few months later&#x003F; Then they throw them to society and they lose interest. I believe more should be done to encourage the immigrants to South Africa to become South Africans in every sense of the word. I have no patience with people who come to South Africa, live here, enjoy the benefits of our country and are prepared to give nothing back to the country of their adoption. They give something back when they become South Africans. I believe that in this respect there is scope for this Government to improve its policy and its attitude towards immigration.</p>

<p>Then the other aspect is a very delicate one, but it cannot be left where the hon. the Minister left it. He said that we should not change our national character and that we must not upset our own South Africans. But then he went on to indicate that he was not, in fact, thinking of upsetting South Africans, but he was thinking of upsetting individual groups of South Africans. I think that is where we differ fundamentally with the Government and with the Nationalist Party. In the eyes of the United Party, whether he be a South African or an immigrant, we do not judge a man by the language he speaks. We do not judge him by the country from which he comes. We have one test in the United Party. We test a man by his loyalty, his devotion and his service to South Africa. We do not ask &#x201C;Where do you come from&#x003F;&#x201D; and we do not ask &#x201C;What language do you speak&#x003F;&#x201D;. We do not ask him when he gets here: &#x201C;Which little &#x2018;hokkie&#x2019;, which little kraal do you want to be shut up in&#x003F;&#x201D; We do not see the people of South Africa as isolated groups in their own kraals, shut away from each other. We see ourselves as one nation, one people, speaking different languages, with different habits, different backgrounds, but one people with one loyalty to one country. So, when we hear the hon. the Minister talk in terms of language groupings, of dividing our people into sections and upsetting the balance, then we realize how deep are the differences between the Nationalist Party and the United Party as regards our vision of the South Africa of to-morrow. We see the South Africa of to-morrow as a country populated by a white nation which has outgrown the divisions of the Anglo-Boer War, which has outgrown the bitterness and the hatred of history and which has grown into one solid unit. The hon. member for Primrose said: &#x201C;We want to have immigrants here who are assimilable&#x201D;. I think that on the 6th or the 10th of October of last year he stood up and attacked the integration of English and Afrikaans-speaking white people.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking nonsense. The hon. member opposed the integration of English and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. He said that that integration would lead to the downfall of the white man. That is the hon. member who has the nerve to gel up in this House and talk about unity. He verified the statement which was published in the <i>Transvaler,</i> but he denied the headlines. When I challenged him in this House, and I quoted sections and said: &#x201C;Did you say this&#x003F;&#x201D;, the hon. member acknowledged that he had said it. What he said was that he did not want to see integration between the Afrikaner and the Englishman in South Africa. I do not care whether the English-speaking section or the Afrikaans-speaking section comprises 5 or 10 per cent more or less. What matters, is that the South African nation should be strong. I hope that we can get away once and for all from this kraaling up of our people as if there were some strange unassimilable groups which can only assimilate if the one is prepared to bow the knee and to be absorbed by the other. We want no unity of absorption. We want the unity of equality.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank made a strange statement. He was not going to attack the Press, because they were not here to defend themselves. I hope that the Nationalist Party will listen to that new philosophy and accept it and that we will in future find that they will abide by that fair attitude of the hon. member for Witbank, but what I disagree with, is the fact that the hon. member for Witbank blamed the statements of the Opposition for keeping immigrants out of South Africa. I think it is necessary to state clearly and unequivocally that it is not what we say in the Opposition that people listen to; it is what this Government does. Every government and every newspaper in the world has its representatives in South Africa who are their ears. They do not report what the Opposition says. They report, if they are newspapers, what their correspondents say. If they are governments, they judge by what their consulates and embassies tell them. It is not what we as Opposition say, it is what this Government does which determines the image of South Africa in the rest of the world. If this Government wants to carry on behaving as it has been behaving for the last 19 years, if it wants to continue to put on the Statute Book legislation which is abhorrent to the thinking of most of the countries of the civilized world, then it is not the fault of the Opposition because we fight that legislation. The Government has itself to blame because it puts that legislation on the Statute Book. We did not make that legislation abhorrent to the world. It was so. All we did was attack it, not because the world did not like it, but because we did not like it, because it was opposed to our beliefs, our way of thinking, our way of seeing the future, our way of believing in the rights and the freedom of the individual. Therefore it is not the United Party or the Opposition but this Government in its own actions which is to blame for any difficulty in bringing immigrants to South Africa. But I hope that those difficulties will be overcome; that the people who will come here will be people who can be assimilated as South Africans, not as Afrikaners, not as &#x201C;Engelse&#x201D; but as South Africans, and it is in <span class="col_6647-6648" refersTo="page_0585"/>that spirit that we of the United Party believe that immigration is one of two factors which can help to build up and strengthen the future of this country and this nation; that plus the growth and the strengthening of our own population. That is why we believe in immigration but we want those immigrants to come here as South Africans and not as sections of the South African people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s choice of words here this afternoon when he referred to immigrants who are being brought here as the bringing out of skin and bones, was a very unfortunate one. But I do not find it strange that he should come forward with that choice of words because surely it is true that the skin and bones from Namib which the National Party threw away was snapped up by the United Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat once more made the charge that the National Party Government had for a very long time done nothing about immigration and that it did not actually form part of our policy to bring immigrants to South Africa. But in this regard let me remind the hon. member of a motion introduced in this House by the late Dr. Malan on 25th February, 1947, after he had already, in those years, set out the attitude of the National Party in respect of immigration very clearly. That motion read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House welcomes the strengthening of the European population of the Union by the immigration properly controlled by effective immigration laws, of suitable and assimilable elements from overseas.</block>

<p>To that he added that he rejected the then Prime Minister&#x2019;s announced large-scale and State-supported State immigration scheme as being a &#x201C;rash concept and disastrous in its consequences&#x201D;. Sir, I think that draws a very clear dividing line between the National and the United Party as far as this matter is concerned. It is of no avail the United Party coming here to-night and trying to don their fine sanctimonious mantle. The fact of the matter remains that, as was quoted earlier this afternoon, it has been the attitude of the United Party from those earliest years, that everybody, good or bad, should be able to enter the country, and here is the proof, which is not taken from Afrikaans newspapers which favour the Government, but from their own newspapers. I want to refer the hon. members of the Opposition to the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 14th August, 1946, in which the entire standpoint of the late General Smuts in this respect was stated very clearly.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Durban (Point) came forward with another point of view this evening, namely that they have never been much concerned about the language spoken by immigrants. But what are the facts&#x003F; If we look at the immigrants who came to this country in 1946 then we see that 7,400 came from Great Britain, in other words English-speaking persons; only 200 came from Holland, and from Belgium and Germany together, only 27. In 1947 there were 27,604 immigrants from Great Britain, a meagre 1,066 from Holland, 119 from Belgium and only 28 from Germany. But in 1948 this trend continued and 25,513 came from Great Britain. In other words, the previous year had not been an exception, and from Holland only 2,753 came; 300 from Belgium; and 12 from Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, then it is the United Party that informs us that it makes no difference to which language group immigrants belong. But here we have irrefutable proof that they only had one purpose in mind, and that was to bring those immigrants to South Africa who would support their point of view.</p>

<p>Earlier on reference was also made here to the negative role which the Afrikaans newspapers were supposed to have played. In support of this newspaper reports were quoted this evening, but I am also going to quote from newspaper headlines to prove the contrary, to prove that the newspapers which are favourably disposed towards this Government are making a contribution to educate our people outside to accept the immigrants. Here I have for example <i>Die Vaderland</i> of 17th August, 1956: &#x201C;Religion will not go under&#x201D;. That appeared in large banner headlines. Here I have <i>Die Burger</i> of 10th March, 1960: &#x201C;Industry guarantees work for extra immigrants&#x201D;. Then I quote from <i>Die Burger</i> of 20th February, 1951: &#x201C;Only the best for South Africa: The immigration policy of the Government&#x201D;. Here I have <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 3rd October, 1958: &#x201C;South Africa needs 10,000 immigrants per year: Can absorb 15,000.&#x201D;. Here I have <i>Die Burger</i> of 31st March, 1955: &#x201C;Propaganda and immigration&#x201D;, an article in which they contribute in a very positive way to creating the right climate for immigration. Sir, so I can continue and quote one example after another to indicate how the newspapers have in a very positive way made their contribution to prepare our people to receive immigrants. But the same cannot be said of the English Press. What is the role which is being played by the English Press&#x003F; Here it is: &#x201C;Nat. row over settlers. London on immigration&#x201D;. So the one after the other can be quoted. Here is a large banner headline: &#x201C;Basic Nationalist principle at stake.&#x201D;. This is done to sow suspicion. But, Mr. Chairman, the best one, the one which takes the cake, is probably this one: &#x201C;Through immigration each year a town the size of Kroonstad is being added to South Africa&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, what is the purpose of that&#x003F; It is being done for one purpose only, and that is to create the impression amongst our people that they are going to be deprived of their living if the Government should continue bringing immigrants into the country on the present scale. I want to say again, Mr. Chairman, that the people outside will take note of the attitude of the United <span class="col_6649-6650" refersTo="page_0586"/>Pary in regard to immigration over the years. They have never had good intentions in regard to this matter. If they were in favour of immigration&#x2014;and we do not deny it&#x2014;then it was only with one purpose in mind, namely to plough South Africa&#x2019;s traditional principles under by means of the people they wanted to bring in.</p>

<p>As regards the position of Afrikaans, I just want to say that it is after all true and it cannot be denied that if an immigrant wants to come to South Africa and he is at least mentally prepared beforehand to master Afrikaans, <i>inter alia</i> at a later stage, then his integration into our circumstances and into our people here will be so much easier. But associated with that is another matter which is of equal importance and that is if that prospective immigrant is spiritually prepared to despise Afrikaans, if he is mentally prepared to despise the Afrikaans-speaking person and wants to have nothing to do with him, then he comes here under the impression that he is superior to the Afrikaans-speaking person and in that way it will never be possible to create a co-existence which will be favourable to the immigrant. If such a situation has arisen or is arising the cause must be sought with the United Party and its Press. To ensure that I am not accused of generalizing I want to prove that what I have just said is correct and that this is the actual state of affairs. Here we have the proof of this in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 11th November, 1962. They say here that people are leaving South Africa on a large scale because they have a &#x201C;dislike for the Nationalist Government and the Nationalist policy&#x201D;, and because they fear for their future here. Mr. Chairman, I have never heard any member of the United Party subsequently say that what the newspaper wrote there was nonsense and that the United Party dissociated itself from what had been said.

<p>For all practical purposes it would have made no difference even if he had described them as being newspapers which kindly disposed towards the Government because the impression which is created in the outside world, while we are trying to draw good immigrants to South Africa, is that immigrants are unwelcome here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let us to-night, before we come to the question of how we must deal with the entry of immigrants, obtain clarity once and for all in regard to the question which has been raised in this debate, i.e. whether this Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of immigration is a slavish imitation of the old United Party policy&#x003F; Is it, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout put it, a radical change of policy, or is it a policy which is soberly attuned to the requirements of South Africa, taking into consideration the ability of the local population to absorb the immigrants coming here and making them feel at home in this country. Let us just go back to the time before this Government came into power. The hon. member for Mooi River also said here to-night that this Government had been asleep for 20 years and the hon. member for East London (City) said that the Government had deliberately put a stop to immigration.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; but that stimulates me to ask that hon. member what he had to say about immigration round about the year 1948. At that time the hon. member for East London (City), in the same way as hon. members on this side of the House felt that the policy of immigration, as announced by the Government of that day and as quoted here to-night by hon. members on this side of the House, was in the first place aimed at bringing immigrants out here who came for the most part from one of our parent countries; this has also been proved here to-night by means of figures. The intention was to bring immigrants mainly from one of our parent countries. In addition immigrants from that parent country could obtain the franchise after only two years in this country. This played a very great part in the objectives of the then United Party Government which realized that there was an emerging nationalistic movement here, specifically Afrikaner Nationalism, which they would have to oppose. Every clear-thinking person could do nothing else than to see in this a calculated attempt, as it was subsequently also expressed in words by members of the then United Party Government, to put a section of this nation out of action at the ballot box, and that is why it was obvious that the nation would reject that policy, as it in fact did.</p>

<p>But now we come to the policy in respect of immigration which the National Party Government has followed since 1948. The hon. member for Mooi River said we had been asleep and the hon. member for East London said that we had closed the door to immigration. That is not the truth. The National Party <span class="col_6651-6652" refersTo="page_0587"/>has always believed that our population must be supplemented by adaptable and assimilable immigrants, the best we could get, but we adopted the attitude that that mass immigration scheme which had been announced by the previous Government to allow immigrants to enter in their thousands and in their millions, subsidized by the State, was not a suitable one at that time. We said that those who wanted to come and who had been approved were welcome and they have been coming for years. If, in the opinion of hon. members on the opposite side, an insufficient number of immigrants entered the country during that time, they must remember how they presented the picture of South Africa under the Nationalist Government overseas. Then one is quite surprised that any people at all came during that period because it is no secret that during that time they succeeded in talking people into leaving the country, they talked them into fleeing to Australia and elsewhere, but those people discovered their error after a considerable time and returned to South Africa because they discovered that they had been misled by hon. members on the opposite side. I say that there was a policy here of &#x201C;let them come&#x201D;, and now the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is saying that there has been a radical change in the Government policy. But he himself has said that he prefers natural immigration, those who come without special encouragement by the State in terms of a scheme to those who come in terms of such schemes. But were we not reproached, during the years just subsequent to 1948, with having cancelled the subsidized scheme of the United Party and having said that those who wanted to come were welcome but that there should not at that stage be a subsidized scheme&#x003F; Hon. members have sung songs in praise of those whom we lost during that time and whom other countries gained. The hon. member for East London (City) may as well check his figures. He said that those countries doubled their population in a short period. That puts me in mind of what is sometimes said, that figures do not lie, and then what follows on that&#x003F; But I want to remind the hon. member of the fact that during the same time, while Australia was obtaining many immigrants who had been subsidized by their Government she also had many problems which were insurmountable, the reason for that being that they did at that time what the United Party tried to do here. They let the good and the bad come in. I say that even if the Government, at this stage, now that we need manpower, is intensifying our immigration policy and does in fact have a subsidized scheme, then we still adhere to the policy which we have always adhered to, by believing that we need the best and that we must open our doors only to the best and that they should come in in the numbers which we need.</p>

<p>As a member on the Government side I should like to say that we do have room for immigrants and that it behoves us and is in fact our duty to welcome them here. I speak as a person who has played an active part here in Cape Town over a number of years in one of these committees which were mentioned here to-night in welcoming immigrants. The hon. member here behind me is doing the same thing in Pretoria and over there sits the hon. member for Primrose, who was referred to sneeringly to-night, who is Chairman of the S.A. Kultuurakademie and who makes it his specific task to welcome immigrants and integrate them into our population. That example is there for everyone to follow. There are also people outside who are sometimes critical of the immigrants and who feel that it is their particular task to say something about immigrants. But here is a field waiting for us to-day, it is our task to draw immigrants and to do all that is necessary to make them feel welcome.</p>

<p>I have referred to those organizations. It is possible for them to do even more, and with the co-operation and support from the population I believe that they will be able to do even more, particularly to let immigrants feel, by means of national festivals, that they are welcome in South Africa. We want them here as citizens, and good use has been made of that over the past years. I should like to refer to the service which is being rendered by the Adult Education Division of the Department of Education, Arts and Science in making our immigrants aware of the need for becoming acquainted with both our languages, but tonight I want to plead, through this hon. the Minister and the hon. the Minister of Education, that even more be done in this regard. Our immigrants are concentrated mostly in the urban complexes and there it is possible for one to bring the immigrants together with less difficulty in order to make these amenities available to them.

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch made reference here to remarks I had made in connection with Australia, which has doubled its population since 1948. I want to challenge him to examine those figures. They have been more than doubled. The number in 1948 was less than 5 million. But I really want to deal with something else. It concerns the question of our countries of origin and that in the past we as the United Party were supposed not to have wanted immigrants from those countries. Where else would we have got them if not from our countries of origin&#x003F; Would we have got them from Britain, or is there another accusation against the United Party, namely that we did perhaps want to get them from Japan&#x003F; The hon. member for Springs said that we wanted to get immigrants who would undermine South Africa&#x2019;s traditional principles. I am asking you, Sir, whether we have a different sort of policy in connection with immigration to-day&#x003F; The hon. the Minister mentioned figures. I should like to mention them, too. Those 48,000 in 1966, where did they come from&#x003F; Of that number, 17,300 came <span class="col_6653-6654" refersTo="page_0588"/>from Great Britain and 8,700 from Portugal, and these already add up to 26,000 out of the total of 48,000. Are they our countries of origin&#x003F; Do the 9,000 Portuguese come from our mother country&#x003F; But it suits us to have immigrants from Portugal, and this side of the House has endorsed that step wholeheartedly &#x2014;irrespective of whether or not it is our mother country and irrespective of whether or not they are Roman Catholic&#x2014;because, as we debated earlier this evening, they have white skins. That is the only way to keep the white population in this country going, by immigrants and more immigrants and still more immigrants. I am not to be deterred by the argument concerning housing. The hon. member for Stellenbosch spoke of the problems Australia experienced in connection with their extensive immigration drive, when from 1950 to 1960 they received immigrants from Austria, West Germany, Spain and Italy. In the days when I still wandered about a great deal, I pleaded with the previous Minister of Immigration and said that there were 7 million Italians who wanted to immigrate, and I wanted to know whether we could not do something about it. The reply was always the same, namely that we would undermine Afrikaans traditions by having these people, because they are of a different religious persuasion. But what does the Government say now&#x003F; Listen to what the Minister of Defence said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Greater efforts should be made to bring to South Africa semi-schooled white families from our mother countries &#x2026; He said that as a result of the fact that a major shortage of farm labour and semi-schooled labour may develop in the Western Cape because of the Government&#x2019;s policy to remove the Bantu from this area, we should bring in semi-schooled labour from our mother countries.</block>

<p>We never even pleaded for semi-schooled labour, but this plea for semi-schooled labour to replace the Bantu here, is now being made by the Government. The Minister does not even mention that selective immigration should be applied. He goes much further than that. What did one of our great industrialists say&#x003F; He said that what made him sad was that those who were objecting to white immigration, were also objecting to brown clerks or Coloured postmen. That is what Dr. Anton Rupert said at the industrial exhibition in Port Elizabeth, and then he continued by arguing the necessity of also providing those people with employment, these citizens of the country who are here. But the fact remains that it is no use saying that this Government did its best for immigration from 1948 up to the fifties. They smothered this thing, deliberately, and they said that the Afrikaans traditions had to be established firmly first. But this thing has its fruits and in years to come we shall still be reaping its bitter fruits, now that the black man is being incited in this country and we are being threatened by this danger.</p>

<p>We shall never be able to make up that backlog again. It is a backlog that we shall have over the years.</p>

<p>I see no chance of our ever being able to change this ratio, unless we have an immigration programme which states whether the person should be able to speak English or Afrikaans within one year and of what religious persuasion the person has to be, as long as he is a citizen who can adapt himself to this country, as long as he can contribute socially to the Whites, as long as he has a white skin to reinforce the numbers&#x2014;50,000 a year, and in ten years&#x2019; time, 500,000, if we can keep it up. What is the increase in the non-white population in this country over the same period&#x003F; Is it something with which we can keep pace&#x003F; I say that the greatest possible rate of immigration that we can have, should be maintained, even if it does have the effect it had in Australia according to the hon. member for Stellenbosch. They had tremendous inflation. They did not have houses for these people. They have to live in wooden houses, but what is the result&#x003F; A population that has grown so large. They no longer have those problems to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to &#x201C;new Australians&#x201D;. Yes, they do have &#x201C;new Australians&#x201D;, and to-day they are going so far as to stipulate that an industry that applies to the State for a licence, may only be licensed &#x2014;in the case of one industry of which I know &#x2014;if it obtains 80 per cent of its technical labour by way of immigration. What did they do&#x003F; In the paint section of that factory, which I visited a short while ago, they have 93 per cent Italians, immigrants, otherwise they could not establish that factory. That was the condition the Government laid down because they had a manpower shortage. They are telling the people that they will only be licensed as an industry if they obtain a certain percentage of their technical staff abroad.</p>

<p>In that way they are building up their country by way of immigration, irrespective of what the person&#x2019;s religious persuasion is, just as long as he can adapt himself to the country. For heaven&#x2019;s sake, if a person can go to America and having lived there for two years, he is an American and nobody asks where he came from, and he is proud of being an American, then we should adopt the same attitude to our immigrants, all of us, Afrikaans and English-speaking people, not so&#x003F; It should not matter what church the immigrants belong to, but having lived here for a year or two, they should be able to be proud of the fact that they are South Africans and they should not say that they come from England or from Germany. The fact remains that we shall still get the major portion of our immigrants from Britain, but we hope that even they will become good South Africans within a short while.</p>

<p>I was still saying that we should be very careful in respect <span class="col_6655-6656" refersTo="page_0589"/>of immigration, especially here in South Africa, and I said that we should not forget that on the international level, as far as immigration is concerned, there is a well-organized council of which most countries are members and of which South Africa is a highly honoured and respected member. We ought to take note of that. The countries that are associated with that body pay very close attention to what is being said about immigration in the homelands, and if such statements are made they may not only embarrass our country with that body, but they may also have very awkward and even bad consequences for us, particularly in respect of the recruitment of immigrants in our mother countries, which is precisely what we should like to promote. Therefore we appeal for caution to be exercised in connection with statements on immigration in South Africa, and for use to be made of existing Government channels.</p>

<p>I want to point out that if one studies immigration closely, it is not at all as simple a matter as hon. members are trying to give out here. On the contrary, immigration can be a very complicated and awkward problem. In the 300 years of its existence America has received no fewer than 42 million immigrants, and with the aid of those immigrants the Americans have built up a nation of roughly 200 million at present. No less a person than the late President Kennedy made a very close study of immigration, and after his death a very interesting book that he had written on that subject. <i>A Nation of Immigrants,</i> was published. If one looks at immigration more closely, it will not be so easy simply to fling accusations to and fro in the way the United Party tried to do here this afternoon&#x2014;for instance, the accusation that at one stage the National Party allowed immigration to stagnate to such an extent that a multitude of horrors will be visited upon us in the future. Where immigration is concerned, matters such as the economic position of one&#x2019;s country and the absorptive power of one&#x2019;s population are topical matters and it will be the height of stupidity simply to ignore these aspects blindly.</p>

<p>I want to plead to-night for a new approach amongst us to immigration in general. This new approach must begin with the realization that immigration is a sphere of which a proper study should be made in the first place, not only by our members of the House of Assembly, but also by people outside this House. We must see this matter for what it is&#x2014;a matter with which we shall have to contend for many long years in the future. As we acquire more knowledge in this respect, we shall be able to pursue a dynamic immigration policy with more wisdom and insight, perhaps to a greater extent than has been the position in the past. I want to repeat that immigration is most decidedly not as easy as certain hon. members tried to give out here to-night. In Britain for instance, immigration cause far more problems at the moment than it does in this country. And I do not even want to mention America and the immigration problems they have had to cope with over the years.</p>

<p>Another point I want to emphasize is that it is not only the Government that has a duty towards immigrants&#x2014;it is also the bounden duty of the nation to see to it that the new South Africans we are bringing into this country are assimilated at all levels. Here I want to plead for a more positive approach amongst our people as regards assimilating new South Africans into our national life in general. Reference was made here to the Suid-Afrikaans Kultuurakademie. There we find&#x2014; and we have been engaged in doing that for a number of years&#x2014;that there are four simple, common levels into which these new South Africans can easily be assimilated and in which they can feel at home among both Afrikaans and English-speaking people. As a matter of fact, these four levels are so obvious that mentioning them is almost a platitude. These four levels are: folk-singing, folk-music, folk-dancing and folk-lore. There is a fifth, namely sport. But that can, of course, not be practised indoors. In July last year I conducted a course for immigrant leaders at Glenmore Beach. That course was attended by 180 children of whom 130 were immigrant children between the ages of 12 and 16. All of them were selected children. And do you know what we found there&#x003F; Those children did not ask us to be permitted to twist, for instance, or for those modern forms of amusement. But do you know what they asked for&#x003F; They asked for permission to do their own traditional folk-dancing, the folk-dancing they did in their countries of origin. That is a perfectly natural thing. I mention this to point out that these common levels are levels on which we can make good progress as regards the assimilation of immigrants into our national life. I am advocating more of this type of thing so that new South Africans may be assimilated into our national life. In America and in Great Britain it has been proved that as one succeeds in creating amongst new South Africans a climate, a spirit and an attitude which will make them desire to be South Africans in the first place and to be properly bilingual in the second place, our nation will become ripe for absorbing greater numbers of them. That is what we have to aspire to.</p>

<p>I want to admit that earlier in this debate I expressed myself sharply, and if I have been too sharp, I apologize. At any rate. I meant to be humorous rather than mean. But I was disappointed. I remember that last year when this Vote was discussed I also succeeded the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, as I am doing now. My words at the time were that it did not happen every day that we on this side of the House could agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Nevertheless, it gave me great pleasure to agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout on that occasion. At that stage we found that the Opposition was adopting a very sensible attitude to immigration. That is why I was all the more disappointed <span class="col_6657-6658" refersTo="page_0590"/>at the attitude they adopted this afternoon. Immigration is something which is very near to my heart, because after all is said and done, the future of our country and our people are at stake here. That is why I am pleading that we should not exploit this matter politically. Any child can do that, of course, because i is very simple. But I am telling you that in this respect we are dealing with people&#x2014;dear, fine people. After all, our nation was built up in that way.</p>

<p>I could be accused of many things, but there is one thing of which I cannot be accused: I view immigration in too serious a light and I hope that I shall not render myself guilty of making political capital out of it. Consider, for instance, the Bantu question in South Africa. It has become a political question, and generations in South Africa are paying for that. That is why I plead that we should not make immigration another political issue. We on this side of the House would not like to do so, and that is why we are courteously asking the Opposition to refrain from any politicking in this regard. We are not so blind that we cannot see how we may slant these things a little and exploit them politically. But we do not want to do so. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I could hardly believe my own ears when I heard what the hon. member for Primrose said at the end of his speech. He said, &#x201C;hy will die Opposisie mooi vra&#x201D; not to make a political issue out of immigration. Then he also said, &#x201C;Dit moet nie &#x2019;n politieke saak wees nie&#x201D;. It amazes me to hear words like that coming from this hon. member. Earlier on he said he might have appeared &#x201C;bitter&#x201D; in his earlier speech although he said he meant it in a &#x201C;grapperige&#x201D; way.</p>

<p>Yes, but the position is that when this hon. member realizes he said the wrong things he explains that he did not mean it that way. But everything he said in his first speech he meant and we realized he meant it. What is more, that is the way in which he has been talking right throughout his political career. Now to come and ask us not to make a political matter out of this &#x2026; What a shocking thing! [Interjection.] I do not know what remark the hon. Minister of Tourism passed to the hon. member. However, that hon. Minister will remember that in 1948-&#x2019;49 he sat on this side of the House. Therefore he will remember that the then Minister of the Interior, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, scrapped General Smuts&#x2019; immigration plan. How did the hon. the Minister of Tourism feel then&#x003F; He felt with us&#x2014;he damned what the Minister of the Interior did then, didn&#x2019;t he&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, now the hon. the Minister sits &#x201C;tjoepstil&#x201D;.</p>

<p>He sat with us then and agreed with every criticism we levelled against the Nationalist Party. But not only he sat with us then but also the present Minister of Immigration, Mr. Trollip. He also sat with us and agreed with everything we said. If the Minister of Tourism now says he did not agree with us when we attacked the Government&#x2019;s immigration policy in 1948 then he must have changed his policy because now he agrees with the policy we had in 1948 and in connection with which we criticized the Government for abandoning it. But he changes his mind so often that I doubt whether he knows where he is. At one stage in 1948 he was with us in criticizing the Government for scrapping General Smuts&#x2019; immigration policy; then he became a Nationalist and agreed with the Nationalist Party that we should not have immigration, but now that the Government is accepting General Smuts&#x2019; plan he goes back again. He is going this way and that way all the time.</p>

<p>I am talking about immigration&#x2014;a word that was hated by the Nationalist Party in 1948; a word they did not want to know. I doubt whether the hon. member for Koedoespoort, who asked me this question, supports the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to immigration as it is being applied at the present moment. I very much doubt that, especially when we remember what his attitude was before he came into Parliament and the opinions he then expressed. Then I wonder whether he is in favour of the present Minister&#x2019;s policy of bringing in more British immigrants than any others. I doubt whether he is so happy about that because I notice he is not smiling now. I am probably reminding him of a distasteful subject. But I want to remind the hon. the Minister of Tourism &#x2026;</p>

<p>I appeal to you, Sir, to allow a little bit of &#x201C;moeilikheid&#x201D;, because without &#x201C;moeilikheid&#x201D; there can be no debate. However, when Dr. Malan was still in opposition he moved a motion to the effect that this House welcomed the strengthening of the European population of this country by immigration properly controlled by effective immigration laws of suitable and assimilable elements from overseas. He, however, disapproved of large-scale State-aided immigration announced by the then Prime Minister as being &#x201C;imprudent in concept and disastrous in consequence&#x201D;. What, then, was this State-aided immigration policy of General Smuts&#x003F; You will remember, Sir, that he had come to an arrangement with Union Castle to set aside ships, I think two, to bring immigrants to South Africa. There was such a flow of immigrants to this country that there were no berths available for them on ships. So they could not come. General Smuts then arranged for two ships to be set aside solely for the conveyance of immigrants. He gave Union Castle the assurance that if those ships had to go back empty because there were not enough visitors going overseas the South African Government would pay for the empty berths.</p>

<p>When Dr. D&#x00F6;nges cancelled the Smuts agreement he thanked the Union Castle Company for allowing the agreement to be cancelled, because he said he did not agree with State-aided immigration; he did not agree with the South African government being prepared to pay the Union Castle Company in respect of empty berths. The Government objected to paying for the empty berths, not for the passage of the people coming to this country. General Smuts asked him whether he had had to pay for any, and he replied no, it did not cost the Government a penny. The crux of Dr. Malan&#x2019;s objection to immigration was that he was against state-aided immigration on a large scale. We read the other day that the Government hoped to get 40,000 immigrants a year&#x2014;that is what it was aiming at. We got 38,000 last year. I want to ask the Minister whether his Department has worked out how many immigrants we can absorb in a year. What plans have they got&#x003F; When we asked the present Minister of Immigration&#x2014;because the Minister now in charge of this Vote is only acting&#x2014;if this country could absorb the 50,000 per year which was said was required, he replied, &#x201C;I do not know&#x201D;. Now, what sort of planning is that&#x003F; What sort of planning is that when the Minister does not even know whether we can absorb 50,000 immigrants or not&#x003F; Is the department better equipped now&#x003F; Does it know how many we can absorb&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has attacked the Department and the Government&#x2014;not the Department so much, but the Government&#x2014; for not providing for these people, for not taking extra steps to see that houses are supplied for immigrants. What is this Department doing to cater for the immigrants that we are asking to come to this country&#x003F; I heard an hon. member saying just now that in getting immigrants, we must keep our national character. How are we keeping our national character&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has made any provision to get our immigrants from certain &#x201C;stamlande&#x201D; or not&#x003F; In Australia they kept their national character, because it is a British territory, by ensuring that over 50 per cent of their immigrants in any one year had to be from Britain. That is how they have kept their national character. I want to know, in view of the remarks made by a certain hon. member on the Government side whether this Government is taking any steps to see that we keep our national character. Are we seeing to it that we obtain the majority of our immigrants from our &#x201C;stamlande&#x201D;&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for East London (City) once again came with the reproach that this Government had deliberately smothered immigration in 1948. Normally I would not embark upon this purely political field, but I see that every single speaker on the United Party side is only too eager to give this matter a political complexion; therefore I think that as far as these allegations of smothering immigration are concerned, you might as well, just for a change, listen properly to our side of the matter.</p>

<p>It is true that after 1948 we did not have the immigration we have to-day. But there were sound reasons for that. There were three very important reasons, which I want to mention to you now. The first reason why this Government could not launch a large-scale immigration drive after 1948, was because of the attitude of our people in this country who were entirely antagonistic to immigration, owing to the United Party&#x2019;s statements on immigration. During its regime the United Party gave us to understand that if the National Party did not keep silent, it would plough the National Party under by way of immigration. These are the words the United Party used. [Interjections.] They said that time and again, and I have more than enough quotations in that regard to prove that it is so. General I. P. de Villiers, the then Chairman of the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board, said so; General Smuts said so; Colonel Deneys Reitz said so. I myself, in my capacity as a newspaperman, was present in the Boksburg Town Hall when Colonel Reitz used these words. On that evening the Nationalists became rebellious, and he pointed his finger at them and said: &#x201C;You Nationalists over there, we shall bring in immigrants to plough y9u under!&#x201D; That is what Colonel Deneys Reitz said in the Boksburg Town Hall on the evening when I as a newspaperman was there to report that meeting. That is why it is of no avail to come up with denials now. The leaders of the United Party at that time made out of immigration a political whip to be used against the Afrikaner, and when we came to power in 1948, we had to contend with our National-Afrikaner opinion which was anti-immigration. <span class="col_6661-6662" refersTo="page_0592"/>The attitude we adopted was anti-immigration because of the United Party&#x2019;s incitement in this regard for years. Consequently the Government could not launch an immigration plan overnight, not on the scale we have it at present.</p>

<p>There were also a second and a third reason. We could not bring immigrants to this country unless our economic development was such that it could absorb those immigrants. That links up with the question which the hon. member put a moment ago and to which I shall presently return, namely whether we have a plan in respect of immigrants. The economic absorptive power of the country must be such that we can have immigrants. There is also a third reason: We had to see to it that there was adequate housing in the country. We cannot allow people to come to our country if we do not have housing for them. If that were allowed, one would simply be creating for oneself a source of agitation against the regime and against the immigrants.</p>

<p>Because of these three factors the National Government could not launch a vigorous immigration scheme when it came to power in 1948. It took us years to put the minds of our people at ease, as it were, and to educate them in this regard, after the United Party had poisoned their whole realm of thought against immigration during the years they were in power.</p>

<p>Now we have fortunately overcome that difficulty, and we are glad that there is a different attitude amongst our people at present. I want to associate myself with the pleas the hon. member for Primrose made in this regard, a plea that as regards immigration there should be a more positive attitude in our country. We shall always have to make that plea in this country, year after year. One finds that in all countries. One can take all countries, be it America or Australia, but one will always find that there is amongst people a sort of natural resistance to a mass of newcomers from outside. Not to mention the position when people are incited, as the United Party did when it was in power! There is that natural resistance amongst people to a mass of foreigners, and for that reason we shall always have to bring this matter home to our people by way of guidance, persuasion and propaganda. We must bring that home.</p>

<p>What about the Press&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Press on all sides should act with the greatest measure of responsibility in this regard. That is why this question of the national character is of so much importance. The hon. member for Transkei referred to it once again as if it is something sinister, something national-sectional. In my explanation a moment ago I stated that it is the aim of this Government to retain our cultural and religious pattern and character, and that we always want to regulate our flow of immigrants so as to retain that national character. A national character is not something that one can describe in exact terms. The national character is something to which we in this country can testify as people who are living in this country. It is our way of life, our faith, our attitude to basic things. These things determine a national character. These are not matters which one can determine mathematically. That national character must be retained, and if one is going to have an inflow of so many people who, be it by way of numbers, be it by way of a different nature, will affect that character, then one finds that resistance mounts up amongst one&#x2019;s own people, resistance which may hamper the entire effort launched by a Government. That is why one must regulate this flow with constant understanding so that it may not disrupt the national character.</p>

<p>I should also like to support a further plea that was made by the hon. member for Primrose, namely that we should really make a study of the problems arising in connection with assimilating immigrants and the effects thereof in our country. This is a matter to which we do not have all the answers. The task of the State is to a large extent that of providing these people with employment. We must employ them here. Once they have been employed, the task of the State has actually been concluded. It is not the task of the State to maintain an after-care service for seeing to it that these new-comers are assimilated. That is beyond the power of a state. That is where local communities should do their share. The hon. member for Primrose is one of the people who does a tremendously great deal in this field. In spite of the disparaging remarks the hon. member for Transkei made about him. I can testify, as one who knows the work the hon. member is doing, that in this field he does a tremendously great deal to accustom immigrants and their children to our South African way of life, to acquaint them with that, to have them assimilated. This assimilation work is not a task that can be performed by one single body only. This process of integrating new citizens with our country, should be done by the public by means of the various organizations they have. We cannot only have one organization in Johannesburg or Cape Town to effect this assimilation. We as South Africans must really be immigrant-conscious and assimilation-conscious. But we should not only be conscious; we should also be prepared to do our share through the organizations to which we belong so as to draw and assimilate these people into our cultural life and our society. That is why I am making this appeal once again, because this is the surest method whereby we shall make good South Africans out of these people.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Transkei wants to know what our plans are in regard to immigration. Can we absorb 50,000&#x003F; To me that is indeed a very silly question. We have here the numbers I mentioned to you. Our net gain is 48,000. We shall not allow these people <span class="col_6663-6664" refersTo="page_0593"/>to come here to walk about in the streets, to laze about and to do nothing. The people who come here&#x2014;and hon. members ought to know that by now&#x2014;are selected people. They are skilled people. They come here to do work that we have for them. We do not wait until they have arrived here before we start seeking employment for them while they have to sit idle here for months. They come here because there is work for them in this country. That is why we need not ask what will happen to these people. Once we start recruiting unskilled persons in unlimited numbers, we may put that question. The people who come here, do so because we can absorb them, and we bring them here in such numbers as are in keeping with the absorptive power of this country. That is why hon. members need not be afraid that we shall proceed in such an unsystematic way that the numbers we have here will present us with a problem. Those numbers are being determined in accordance with our actual needs. The task that awaits us&#x2014;and with this I want to conclude&#x2014;is to make these people feel so at home and so happy in this country of ours that they will never want to go back, and that they and their children will become good South Africans in this country.</p>
