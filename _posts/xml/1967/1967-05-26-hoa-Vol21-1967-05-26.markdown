<heading>ATOMIC ENERGY BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The existing Atomic Energy Act, 1948 (Act No. 35 of 1948), was placed on the Statute Book approximately 20 years ago and since that time the Act has been amended no less than eight times. As it has once more become necessary to effect amendments&#x2014;mainly as a result of the progressive shift in emphasis from the purely military to the wider, industrial utilization of nuclear energy&#x2014;it has been decided to redraft the entire Act, incorporating the many amendments which have already been effected, and to substitute a new Act for the present one.</p>

<p>Therefore the Bill now before this House is not merely a consolidating but also an amending measure, and in the course of my speech I shall briefly indicate and elucidate the most important proposed amendments or changes.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words in regard to the background. Two decades ago world interest in uranium derived almost exclusively from the fact that it could be used as a source for an explosive in the manufacture of atomic bombs. Fear of the destructive potential of nuclear weapons was predominant and therefore we, as well as all the other principal uranium producing countries of the world, found it necessary to pass drastic legislation for the strict control of the source material. For understandable reasons, the Atomic Energy Act, which saw the light in that era and under those circumstances, is therefore of an extremely restrictive nature&#x2014;so much so that even the ownership in all uranium (or prescribed material) which has been mined vests in the Atomic Energy Board on behalf of the State in order to place the firmness of control beyond any doubt.</p>

<p>In addition it is provided that the sole right to prospect or mine for any prescribed material, or to deal with it in virtually any other respect, vests in the State and, except with special authority, private persons are prohibited to prospect or mine for or otherwise deal with any prescribed material.</p>

<p>Although military interest in nuclear energy naturally endures and nuclear weapons have unfortunately not been banned as yet, it is nevertheless true that since the conclusion of peace after World War II, the civilized world has begun applying itself industriously to the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and so much progress has been made in that direction that we at present find ourselves on the eve of the utilization of nuclear energy on a larger scale. In other words, at the moment a distinct shift from military to industrial development is taking place in the field of nuclear energy.</p>

<p>With the increasing development and utilization of nuclear energy, particularly for the generation of electricity, the demand for uranium is definitely increasing once more and according to recent estimates the world consumption of uranium&#x2014;for peaceful purposes only&#x2014;will amount to approximately 70,000 tons per annum by 1980. As a matter of fact, various persons in authority have already issued warnings that unless new deposits of this very important raw material are discovered and developed, there will be a world shortage of uranium before the end of this century. Some experts even speak of existing reserves being completely exhausted by the early eighties.</p>

<p>In its sources of uranium the Republic of South Africa has one of its most important national assets, one which has earned it more than R900 million in foreign exchange over the past 15 years, but our own known reserves are not inexhaustible either. It is in our interest to locate additional sources and to extend and develop our uranium industry in other respects as well, particularly with a view to the further processing in South Africa of the product we have been marketing up to now mainly in the form of uranium oxide. At present, however, progress in this direction is being hampered to a certain extent by the existing Act, and one of the principal objects of this Bill is therefore to delete or amend certain of the hampering provisions but without prejudice to South Africa&#x2019;s obligations or commitments in this connection with countries abroad and also with the retention of local control in so far as that is necessitated by the national interest and by the security of the country.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to say a few words in regard to the proposed changes. In the course of a Second Reading Speech it is from the nature of the case not possible for me to indicate and explain all the provisions of this Bill which differ from the provisions of the existing Act. Many of them are of an insignificant and minor nature and are, in any event, <span class="col_6745-6746" refersTo="page_0634"/>elucidated in a memorandum which I have caused the Department of Mines to draw up and which are available in both official languages to hon. members who are interested. I shall therefore confine myself to some of the more important proposed changes only.</p>

<p>As regards prospecting and mining (clause 5), I have already pointed out that it is necessary for us to prospect for additional sources of uranium. At present, however, there is no freedom to prospect for uranium or for &#x201C;source material&#x201D;, to use the terminology of the Bill. It appears that the expression &#x201C;source material&#x201D; is in use throughout the world and therefore we are also using it in this Bill. Furthermore, it is not possible to negotiate options to prospect for source material with the holders of rights to base minerals in the usual way, because under the present dispensation such holders do not have the necessary authority either. This state of affairs, as well as the provision to which I have already referred, namely that the ownership of all mined source material vests in the State, not only discourages prospecting but also hampers the acquisition by the mining industry of the large amount of capital required for the further development of our uranium industry&#x2014;particularly for the further local processing of the product we want to market.</p>

<p>Therefore the ownership in mined source material is now being transferred by the State, as has been done in Canada and the United States of America, and in this respect the legislation links up with the principles of our modern Mining Rights Act, which was passed at the beginning of this session, so that the ownership in the mined material may henceforth vest in the person who or the mining company which has mined such material.</p>

<p>In actual fact the present dispensation merely creates a fictitious ownership for the State &#x2014;it is important that hon. members take note of this&#x2014;without much merit or use, because in actual practice the mining companies themselves bear all the costs involved in the mining of source material and such material has always been mined by them without the State ever having taken physical possession of it. Over the past few years and at great expense the producers have therefore built up their own strong team, with the necessary skill and acumen, for promoting sales overseas.</p>

<p>The prospecting for and the mining of source material will henceforth, as in the case of any other base mineral, also take place in the Republic in accordance with the provisions of the Mining Rights Act, and in South West Africa, in accordance with the provisions of the Mining Ordinance in force in that territory, but with the proviso that in the case of source material additional written permission has to be obtained from the Minister of Mines. In practice, however, the latter requirement will not hamper prospecting as the Bill provides that such permission may be withheld only if the Minister is satisfied that the security of the State would be endangered by the issue of such permission to the applicant, and therefore the required permission will have to be issued freely in all but such cases.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that the essential control is being retained. As source material, and what may result from it, is of such great strategic importance that it is necessary, both in the national and international spheres, to guard against its irresponsible utilization, it has, however, remained a necessity to include certain measures of control in the Bill. In this way the production of nuclear or atomic energy, except under special authority, remains prohibited (clause 3).</p>

<p>The prospecting for and the mining of source material requires the additional written Ministerial permission to which I have already referred (clause 5). Written authority by the Minister, which he may grant only after consultation with the Atomic Energy Board, is required for the possession, disposal, enrichment, re-processing and export of source material and special nuclear material, etc. (clause 7). Control is being retained over the use of radio-active nuclides (isotopes) for both industrial and medical purposes, as well as over the discarding of radio-active waste (clause 8).</p>

<p>Then I come to clause 4, which deals with the generation of electricity. This clause contains a new provision, namely that if the Atomic Energy Board receives an application from a person for permission to produce nuclear energy for the exclusive purpose of generating electricity in an area in which the Electricity Supply Commission Escom has the right to undertake the supply of electricity, the application first has to be referred to Escom so that Escom may decide&#x2014;and it has to take the decision within six months&#x2014;whether it itself wants to undertake the supply of electricity by means of nuclear energy in the area concerned. If so, the authority to use nuclear energy as a means of generating electricity is granted to Escom and not to the applicant. If Escom is not interested and the authority is granted to the applicant, the generation of electricity by means of nuclear energy and its distribution by such a person will be subject to the provisions of the Electricity Act, 1958. In terms of other Acts, the aforementioned Electricity Act and the Water Act, as amended, Escom has the power to expropriate and take over conventional power stations&#x2014;naturally upon the payment of compensation&#x2014;and as far as nuclear energy stations are concerned it is also being granted powers of expropriation in this clause.</p>

<p>Then I come to clause 6, which deals with the acquisition of source material by the State. As has already been said, the State is now waiving the ownership in source material which has been mined. Clause 6, however, makes provision that the State may still, when the national interests so requires, acquire by purchase, release or expropriation any source material which has been mined. The Canadian legislation contains a similar provision and <span class="col_6747-6748" refersTo="page_0635"/>this is an important provision as it is essental that the State must be in a position to acquire this strategic material for purposes of its own safe-guarding in times of emergency, and even to take possession of all supplies which have already been mined if circumstances so require.</p>

<p>Now, as far as the Atomic Energy Board is concerned (clause 12), the constitution of the Atomic Energy Board is being changed to some degree. Under the existing Act the Minister of Mines is the Chairman of the Board and the Secretary for Mines and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs are members <i>ex officio.</i> In addition there are nine other members. Therefore the total membership of the Board, including the Minister, is 12, one or more of whom will represent the mining industry, commerce, industry, the C.S.I.R. and Escom, respectively. Henceforth the Board will also consist of not more than 12 members and all the aforesaid concerns will again be represented on the Board. The Minister of Mines, however, will no longer be a member or Chairman, but will appoint a Chairman for the term of office which he, the Minister, determines. In other words, I am now relieving myself of that obligation.</p>

<p>When the Atomic Energy Board was first established in 1948, there certainly were sound reasons for the Minister of Mines to be Chairman. Some definite direction had to be adopted and a way had to be cleared, and these had to be constantly checked against Government policy, and consequently initial negotiations with other powers in regard to the production, the disposal and the control of source material were conducted on the highest level possible.</p>

<p>At present we are sailing in more familiar waters and for many years it has not really been necessary for succeeding Ministers of Mines to preside at Board meetings. Therefore it is being proposed that the Minister shall no longer be Chairman of the Board but that he be authorized to appoint a Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>Then we come to the post of Director-General which is dealt with in clause 16 (1) (a). The post which the chief executive officer of the Atomic Energy Board occupies, has had the designation &#x201C;Director-General&#x201D; for a considerable period, and that is how we all know him. but now statutory provision is being made for the post. The Director-General has to perform such duties as the Board may from time to time determine and he is responsible to the Board, or to the Chairman of the Board, if the Board is not in session.</p>

<p>Provision is being made in clauses 32 and 33 for the protection or compensation of the staff of the Board. In terms of section 5 (1) of the Nuclear Installations Act, No. 43 of 1963, the staff of the Atomic Energy Board is covered against nuclear damage, and in clause 32 of the Bill provision is being made against special risks such as injuries or diseases suffered or contracted by a person engaged by the Board and which are attributable to ionizing radiation of any radio-active material, or to the inflammable, explosive, poisonous or special properties of such material. In addition the members of the staff of the Board who are classified as workmen under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, 1941, are covered by that Act, and for the rest the Board is responsible under the common law for its staff in respect of the ordinary, conventional industrial risks. In spite of this wide coverage there will probably still be certain risks in the relatively unfamiliar sphere of the nuclear industry which will still be uninsured and consequently provision is being made in clause 33 for such possible cases by means of general compensation provisions in terms of which it will be possible to award compensation in such cases on the recommendation of a committee of experts under the chairmanship of a Judge.</p>

<p>In general I may just say that the other aspects which are covered by the Bill are the training of scientists and engineers who are needed to continue research and to harness nuclear energy advantageously, whereas exhaustive provisions have again been included in the Bill in regard to dealing with patents relating to nuclear or atomic energy and associated matters. In the latter connection I may perhaps just refer to clauses 13 (1) (j) and 18 (1) (f) from which you will notice that it will lie possible for the Board to pay to contributors to the Board&#x2019;s research funds a portion of the moneys received by the Board from the licensing or sale of certain patents. It is hoped that this concession will encourage contributions to the research fund.</p>

<p>I trust that I have clarified the most important changes contemplated by the Bill to a sufficient extent and that hon. members who desire further information will find the more detailed summary of the Department useful.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House will support this Bill and I want to take the opportunity now of thanking the hon. the Minister for the memorandum he has prepared for us, which has made the interpretation of this Bill much easier. I also want to take the opportunity at this time of expressing my thanks and the thanks of this side of the House to the officials of his Department, who have always been very helpful to us and have always given our requests a courteous hearing and have done everything in their power to meet our representations.</p>

<p>The question we are dealing with to-day is one which depends on the production and the disposal of uranium, in the main. This is one of our minerals which we have been blessed with, but in contrast to the large amount of gold we have, where we produce approximately 70 per cent of the world&#x2019;s output, in regard to uranium our output is much less. It is said by the Agency for International Atomic Energy, which is based in Vienna, that 17 per cent of the world&#x2019;s uranium comes from Africa, and the three main countries in Africa supplying uranium are South Africa, Madagascar <span class="col_6749-6750" refersTo="page_0636"/>and Gabon. To give a picture of what is happening in the world of nuclear energy, countries such as Egypt and Tunisia have already begun nuclear energy projects and they are already using nuclear energy instead of electricity, and they are desalinating water through nuclear energy projects. We here are faced with the prospect of being able to mine a greater amount of uranium than we are doing at the moment. Some of our mines have taken it upon themselves already to develop for the future, like Harmony, Buffelsfontein, Vaal Reefs. They are taking the necessary steps to meet the demand. Virginia has entered into sales and option commitments to cover 90 per cent of their production, but against that picture we have to note that the existing demand for uranium is not anywhere near the production capacity, so that for the time being there can be no question of a stabilized world market price. In addition, it is known that the U.S.A. is prepared to sell partially enriched uranium at about eight dollars a lb. I do not think this figure is anything like the real cost of production, which I would say is much higher. The amounts of money that America is putting into development of uranium projects can be pictured if I tell the House that one enrichment plant for uranium has cost 1,000 million dollars, and I would say that that plant is part of their defence programme and they have probably already written off the cost. It is important to note that America has been stockpiling tremendous quantities of uranium, and particularly, I would say, this stockpiling of uranium and its by-products has been used for nuclear weapons. If they find that the demands by industry are such that they cannot meet them from their production, they will go to their stockpile, and this stockpile will probably carry them along for another ten years. So that for ten years at least we will have to be prepared here to compete with the outside world. I am particularly pleased to see that in this Bill there is a fair amount of relaxation of control in regard to the production and sale of uranium. We have to enter a competitive market and we have to allow private enterprise, under the guidance of the Minister, to see that the best possible use is made of our supplies of uranium and that it is diverted into the correct channels, and even if higher prices are offered by some countries which do not agree with us as far as our democratic way of life is concerned, we should withhold sales to those countries. That is a matter which I think this Government will give attention to. I want to say quite clearly that we should withhold the sale of uranium or any of its products from any of the communist countries. We may lose on the sales, but I think it would be better for our country in the long run. Because of our supply of uranium and because of the competitive market, I would say to the Minister that he should encourage by every means possible the introduction of industry in South Africa which can make use of our uranium deposits. It is a new type of industry. We have not many trained people to undertake the work. It is worthwhile now to start encouraging people to become familiar with the new techniques and the new materials used in producing nuclear energy.</p>

<p>How can we do this&#x003F; We can do it by, firstly&#x2014;and the Bill makes provision for it&#x2014; stimulating research. The Board should at all times encourage research work in its own laboratories and it should encourage research at the Universities. We have kept pace with the developments in regard to nuclear energy. Stellenbosch University particularly has been doing very good work in this direction and the Minister knows that they recently acquired a germanium cryostat, one of the few available in the world to-day, and they are making good use of it. But we are still scratching on the surface as far as our own original research is concerned. We are taking what is given out by other countries, but our own research is not up to international standards yet. I would say that that is probably due to the fact that we are not spending enough money on research on uranium in view of the fact that we have these deposits, and we should divert some of the profits derived from uranium sales to research. The Government can help in that direction. I would say that if it means a relaxation of taxation, so that the tax money can go towards research, it will be well worth our while and it will do the country much more good than taking that money and using it for other purposes. I want to say that in regard to Escom taking over the electricity produced from nuclear energy, that might be a good thing, but if it is going to come about that Escom is going to have this right, I would say to the Minister that in clause 12 he should include a representative of Escom on the Board. I think that is the obvious thing to do, but as the Board is constituted at the moment it does not give an opening for one of the Escom representatives to be included in this Board of Management. I would again impress upon the Minister that he must do one of two things. He must either have a new commission for the development and the distribution of nuclear energy, or if Escom is going to undertake to do this he should have a representative of Escom on the Board.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that we on this side are pleased that the Minister has taken the security measures that he has, and that in time of emergency or of apparent emergency he should take full control over the production and distribution of uranium and its products. We are pleased that this is in his hands.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned research, and again I would say that as far as this Bill is concerned I would like more emphasis placed on research. At the moment the emphasis is placed on production and trading. The Minister knows that for the past ten or 12 years we we have had a tremendous amount of brain drain from this country. Many of our best scientists have left the country, not because they do not like this country but because they do not have the facilities to stay and work here. The Minister knows how many South <span class="col_6751-6752" refersTo="page_0637"/>Africans are at present in England and at Oxford particularly, where they are doing research. He must encourage the research to take place here and he can only do that if he is prepared to stimulate the Cabinet to give more money for research. Let us keep our best brains here as far as possible. We can only do that if we give these people the tools with which to work, and let us have the privilege of saying that at least in one field of science we can take the lead. We have the opportunity here.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the Minister has introduced security measures as far as health is concerned, but in this field again he will have to be very careful. I do not think that enough medical men in our country to-day know sufficient about the use of isotopes or about disabilities that may come about through the maluse of isotopes. I do not think enough of our doctors know about the injuries which are sustained in atomic explosions and through fallout. The general practitioner in our country to-day is quite ignorant, on an average, about atomic energy release. I would suggest to the Minister&#x2014;he is probably thinking along these lines himself&#x2014;that our universities which have medical schools should have a course in this regard. It need not be a long course; this can be done in a matter of three or four weeks, but there should be such a course to emphasize the importance of nuclear damage to the human being. It is very important, and now is the time to start teaching these people.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I want to deal with. It concerns the question of patents and compensation for work done. The Minister will know that in all probability the Board will control and regulate the experimentation of those branches of science which include the use of uranium, but if he wants to encourage it, the bonuses which are provided for in the Bill should be very liberal. Those people who invent processes and make new discoveries should be adequately compensated. They are important to the welfare of our country, and I would say that when these bonuses are given and compensation is paid it should always be on the highest possible level and never niggardly. The Minister also has a sub board here to deal with injuries caused by atomic reaction, and in this regard he has specified that a Judge shall sit as chairman of this committee. I would say to the Minister that he should also include as one of the members a medical man who is well acquainted with the conditions which may arise in the course of injury.</p>

<p>I do not want to prolong the discussion. We wish this Bill well and again I want to tell the Minister that we on this side support it. There may be one or two small matters that we will deal with later in the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is a necessary Bill, and as my colleague has said, we on this side of the House will accept it, but I cannot commend it as a forward-looking Bill. We are a young nation and we should be a forward-looking nation, but this Bill in many respects looks backwards. It is now many years since the world realized that the splitting of the atom produced an immense force. But this is not the first time that a great force has been let loose in the world. It is only the first time that the devastation resulting therefrom happened during a war, and the first introduction the world had to the release of atomic energy was a violent, destructive and annihilating happening. It has left its mark on the thoughts of the world, that atomic energy must be associated with the atomic bomb. But that is not so, and we as a nation, particularly one rich in raw material which is at present used to produce atomic energy, should not have brought forward a Bill with the restrictions that this Bill contains. I am not disputing what the hon. the Minister has done in controlling source material or to control the prospecting for and the mining of source material, but I do believe that in trying to control it with a lay board&#x2014;because with one exception, it is a lay board which controls these matters&#x2014;he is looking backwards and has not faced up, as I think we should, to the future outlook on nuclear material and its use. I refer particularly to the clauses which restrict the use of the human brain working in this country. I regret to see that the Board is empowered&#x2014;this may have existed in previous Acts, but even if it did it should have been left out of this Act&#x2014; to take a pattern which an inventor in this country has discovered or invented and to seal it up and to lock it away. This is archaic. Imagine the other forces we have had in this world. Somebody discovered fire and they burnt coal. We have great resources of coal. That is a great force, and we saw what happened in Brussels a few days ago, but we did not have to have a special law to stop people from burning coal. Take the discovery of dynamite. It is true that it is controlled up to a point, but nobody stops a man discovering a new way of using dynamite, and nobody locks away such inventions. The use of crude petroleum is also dangerous. It is the source material of high octane spirit, but it does not need laws to deal with the position if somebody discovers a better spirit, nor does a lay board have the power to lock away such discoveries. The decision as to whether it should be locked away or not rests with a lay board, in the interests of the country. What about fusion&#x003F; At present atomic energy is derived from fission, the splitting of the atom, and it needs uranium. But what about fusion, the raw material of which is water&#x003F; There is plenty of it and you cannot control that. If some man discovers how to make the hydrogen bomb through fusion, is the Board going to lock that secret away&#x003F; How long can you keep it secret&#x003F; America tried to stop Russia having the atomic bomb. America, England and Russia tried to stop France having the bomb. America, England, France, Russia tried to stop China having the bomb, but I hear today that Tunisia has the bomb. All these were <span class="col_6753-6754" refersTo="page_0638"/>secrets that were locked up. America thought she had the only secret of how to develop the bomb, but how long did it last&#x003F; But here we have it in the Bill that a board of laymen can lock away such a secret and try to prevent the world knowing about it. But the board goes even further and here, to my mind, we have a terrible thing. It says that if a South African discovers something and tries to take it away into another country they can stop him and punish him. What is going to be the effect of such a clause&#x003F; The effect is going to be that the inventor will not tell South Africa and will leave the country in order to let somebody else develop his invention and the fruits of his brains. As I see it, we will not detain the brains&#x2014;we are going to drive the best ones out.</p>

<p>We must not drain the brains of the country away. The clauses in this Bill relating to patents should, I think, be carefully reconsidered. That he should have control over source materials, that he should have control over special nuclear material&#x2014; of that I cannot approve more. But that he should control the brains and the actions of the scientific people of this country, and perhaps lock up a genius or a secret that would bring the Sahara into flower, is something which should be carefully reconsidered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. member for Durban (Central) is particularly interested in and concerned about matters of health in general and in this case particularly about the horrible effects which may flow from the use of atomic energy. In this connection he specifically referred to the horrible event in 1945 when the first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima. However, he made the point that this was not a forward looking Bill. In this connection I should like to point out to the hon. member that where he has given us his views on the control of the prospecting, mining and stockpiling of uranium and has expressed the view that it is not correct for the board to be empowered to take away a patent and to be able to punish an individual taking such a patent to another country&#x2014;these aspects he interpreted as being backward looking. But may I tell him, with respect, that to my mind these particular aspects of the Bill are in fact the forward looking aspects. This is an attempt, an endeavour, to try and prevent an individual using the potentialities of his perhaps extraordinary brainpower to create devastation in the world. The hon. member referred to the fact that certain countries did their utmost to prevent certain other countries from obtaining atomic secrets. It is true that in this they were not successful. Here, however, we are dealing with South African citizens and not with a country or a citizen over whom we have no control. The hon. member also said that the board was a lay board. But may I point out to him, with respect again, that the director-general of the board and the other staff members are very highly qualified people&#x2014;in fact of world repute. Therefore, I do not think that what is being done by the board could be labelled as the work of a lay board because, as I said, these people are very highly qualified people. These scientists have undergone intensive specialized training which in a number of cases lasted a couple of years. I can assure the hon. member, therefore, that we have the very best qualified persons available. Furthermore, we are constantly doing what we can to make further training possible. May I also point out in connection with this matter that the Government is internationally bound, as are all other civilized states, to ensure as far as possible the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>In this Bill we are going very far to allow freedom but I say we should not relax up to a point where we shall be taking risks or where we shall lose the confidence of the western world, or shake the confidence of the western world in us&#x2014;which we might do if we relax these controls to such an extent that should the need arise we have only ineffective measures to control the effects of this material or inventions which could put that material to uses which are detrimental to mankind. As the hon. member knows, nuclear material is a commodity with qualities which call for exceptional safeguards, however reluctant we may be to interfere with its production and application. So, I should like to crave the hon. member&#x2019;s indulgence by requesting him to look at this matter again in order to convince himself that this is in fact a forward looking Bill as far as these aspects are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also spoke on this measure. May I thank these two hon. members for supporting this Bill. I too should like to express my thanks to the officials, of the Department as well as of the board, for their help and advice. As hon. members will realize, this is a very complicated subject and I do not profess to know very much about it. However, I have had the privilege of being advised by the officials of my Department and of the Atomic Energy Board. I should like to give hon. members, especially the hon. member for Rosettenville, the assurance that as far as research is concerned, we are certainly trying to keep pace with developments all over the world. In addition, we are doing a certain amount of research ourselves. For obvious reasons I cannot, of course, go into details of this. But we are doing research in this country which might&#x2014;and here I want to be very careful&#x2014;put South Africa on the map as never before. We are certainly giving a lead in the atomic energy field. I have personal <span class="col_6755-6756" refersTo="page_0639"/>knowledge of this based on the part played by the Director-General and other officials at international conferences. The hon. member will agree with me if I say that these officials are held in the highest esteem all over the world where people foregather from time to time to discuss matters relating to atomic energy.</p>

<p>The hon. member expressed the opinion that the demand may outstrip the supply. But what we are doing in this Bill is as much as we can do from the point of view of us as legislators to stimulate prospecting and mining of this material. The hon. member also referred to the question of stockpiling. Unfortunately I cannot give any figures in regard to stockpiling although I can give him some idea of the known uranium reserves, reserves which could be mined in the years to come. It is of course necessary to keep in mind the question, at what price uranium can be mined.</p>

<p>*Based on the present gold price of approximately R25 per ounce, and calculated on a recovery of 75 per cent at the various price levels, the uranium reserves of the Republic were&#x2014;i.e. at a price of R5.6 or 8 dollars&#x2014; 180,000 tons as at 1st January, 1965. An authoritative estimate puts the world supplies of uranium at 8 dollars per pound at between 550,000 and 700,000 short tons which will be reduced by stopping to between 425,000 and 475,000 tons by the end of 1970. Subsequent to that the supplies will decrease more and more rapidly, until they will be completely exhausted by the end of 1980. I also said that in my Second Reading Speech. According to estimates, however, the Republic still ought to have approximately one-half of the 180,000 tons in reserve by 1980, because the recovery thereof is linked to gold production. I have here a table of the estimated world reserves of uranium. I mention this in pursuance of the reference by the hon. member to other African states. According to this table the world reserves of uranium&#x2014;once again at a price of between 5 and 10 dollars&#x2014;are with a reasonable degree of certainty: Canada, 210,000 tons, the U.S.A. 155,000; South Africa, 190,000; France, 37,000; the rest of Europe 22,000; African states. 17,000; Argentine, 5,000: Australia 15,000. These are the particulars I have at my disposal. I think this will give the hon. member a very wide picture of what the position is.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also referred to the Electricity Supply Commission. In this connection I think I can put his mind at rest by telling him that the chairman of the E.S.C. is also a member of the Atomic Energy Board. The hon. member also said that we should keep our best brains in South Africa. As regards the making available of more funds, as I pointed out the other day when my Vote was discussed. I shall do my share as far as the Cabinet is concerned. In the final analysis, however, it is the Minister of Finance who has the say. The hon. member also suggested that a part of the taxes should be diverted to the training of scientists. But let me point out to the hon. member that in effect it is only 2&#x00BD;c. per lb. according to the figures I have here.</p>

<p>Yes, royalties. This is only 2&#x00BD;c. per lb. of uranium oxide. He also suggested that a course could perhaps be instituted at medical schools for doctors in the form of a post-graduate course or a seminar for two or three weeks. I shall look into this. There is at the moment very close co-operation between the Atomic Energy Board and the medical schools. However, I undertake to look into this particular suggestion.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. member strongly put forward his point of view that uranium should not be sold to communist countries or to other countries not friendly towards South Africa. In the context of the world to-day I do not think we should use the term &#x201C;not friendly towards South Africa&#x201D;. I cannot give the hon. member details of what we sell and to whom we sell. But I can give him the assurance that as far as the sale of uranium is concerned this country is a part of the free world and as such we intend playing our full part. This goes also for the supply of uranium.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Not counting the short title, three of the four clauses which go to make up this Bill, introduce concessions while only one clause is aimed at raising additional revenue for the State. I refer to clause 1, which gives effect to one of the taxation proposals adopted by this House. In terms of this clause the minimum amount of the company licence will be increased with effect from 1st January. 1968, from R2 to R10. This is an annual licence imposed by section 228 of the Companies Act, 1926, and the amount thereof is fixed at the rate of 50 cents for every R2,000 or part of R2,000 of a company&#x2019;s subscribed capital, subject, however, to a minimum licence duty of R2.</p>

<p>This minimum has remained unchanged for more than 40 years and it was felt that the time had arrived for it to be increased. The minimum amount of R10, which, as I have said, will become operative on 1st January, 1968, is regarded as reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="col_6757-6758" refersTo="page_0640"/>Clause 2 amends the Estate Duty Act in relation to the estates of persons dying on or after the 23rd March of this year and gives effect to the decision to increase the maximum exemption in respect of the proceeds from insurance policies and investments held by such persons in certain local registered stock, in certain local bonds and in debentures issued by the Land Bank from R15,000 to R25,000. This tax-free amount of R25,000 will be sufficient to cover the duty payable in every case where the net value of the estate, including the said insurance policy proceeds and investments, amount to R193,000 or less and the deceased is survived by his wife and two children.</p>

<p>Clauses 3 and 4 introduce amendments to the Stamp Duties Act with the object of extending the scope of exemptions which at present apply in respect of stocks or other securities issued by the Government, local authorities and certain other corporate bodies. The effect of the amendments introduced by these clauses will be to extend the exemptions to securities issued by any water board established in terms of section 108 of the Water Act, 1956. The exemption under clause 3 relates to the stamp duty on broker&#x2019;s notes in respect of the purchase and sale of any marketable security while that under clause 4 applies to the stamp duty payable in respect of the original issue or the registration of the transfer of marketable securities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the subject matter of this Bill was discussed during the Committee of Ways and Means. We on this side do not object to this Bill. As the Minister rightly says, this measure largely provides for concessions, and as far as the increase in the amount of company licences is concerned, that is probably necessary having regard to the extent to which the purchasing power of the rand has been eroded, particularly during the last 20 years whilst this Government has been in office.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to detain the House. I merely wish to ask a question. I am referring to clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill. The first deals with issues and the other with sales. As we know, these issues and these sales are always exempted from stamp duty because Government and public authorities issue and sell these securities, etc. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question but I do not expect a reply from him in this debate. I should like him to discuss it with the Minister of Finance. This Stamp Duties Act does not bring in a great deal of money. Therefore the exemptions are not really very important. But what does bring in money is the marketable securities tax, the M.S.T., and I should like him to ask the Minister of Finance whether he has considered that aspect of it.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>For the convenience of hon. members I intend dealing with this Bill in two sections. I think this will also serve to make the objectives of this legislation clearer. Furthermore, I also believe that this will serve to make the discussion which may ensue&#x2014;if there is a discussion&#x2014;considerably easier.</p>

<p>Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 9 (1) contain new provisions and deal mainly with the future zoning of land for industrial purposes, the subdivision of existing industrial land, as well as the establishment of new factories and the extension of existing factories, provided that such factories have in fact been drawn in by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i> The remainder of this measure, which comprises a total of 15 clauses, relates to the activities of the old Natural Resources Development Council, the old N.R.D.C., as it has been generally known for the past 20 years.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that after the discovery of gold in the forties an urgent need arose for co-ordinated planning of the anticipated development. The Government of the time saw fit to place the Development of Natural Resources Act, No. 51 of 1947, on the Statute Book. In 1955 this Act was amended by Act No. 30 of 1955. Both the old Act and the amendment provided, amongst other things, for the establishment of the Natural Resources Development Council and for the proclamation of controlled areas, by which a change in respect of the utilization of land, as well as the subdivision and the alienation of undivided shares in land, were placed under permit control. In this Bill it is now proposed to repeal both the old Act and the amending Act in their entirety, and replacing them by provisions adjusted to the changed circumstances.</p>

<p>Through the establishment of the Department of Planning in 1964 and the establishment of the Resources and Planning Advisory Council during December, 1965, the machinery for the co-ordinated physical planning which may be necessary was created within Government Departments. We now have the situation that the administrative work which at that time was done by the statutory council and its staff is now done by the Department. This new Resources and Planning Advisory Council advises the Minister on policy matters. In addition, the aid committees which came under the erstwhile N.R.D.C. are still used to perform continuation work.</p>

<p>In respect of this Resources and Planning Advisory Council, which is not a statutory body, the then Minister made certain observations <span class="col_6759-6760" refersTo="page_0641"/>on 9th December, 1965, with regard to the establishment and constitution of the council. At the first meeting of that council, on 10th March, 1966, he also set out the objectives, the status, the relative position and functions of the council. As this council will have to perform certain functions of the N.R.D.C., which will fall away upon the commencement of this Act, I deem it necessary to deal with certain aspects in connection with the advisory council on this occasion. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I am now actually dealing with the section of the Bill which does not contain many new provisions and powers.</p>

<p>The object of the establishment of this council is to advise me on the most effective utilization of our country&#x2019;s resources and on the formulation of the best physical development pattern for the Republic. The council is constituted as follows: Dr. P. S. Rautenbach, the Chief Director of Physical Planning in the Department of Planning, has been appointed Chairman of the council, and there are also the following members: Firstly, there are the heads of the following Government Departments: Bantu Administration and Development; Planning; Forestry; Finance; Community Development; Commerce and Industries; Agricultural Economics and Marketing; Agricultural Technical Services; Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure; Mines; Posts and Telegraphs; The South African Railways; Defence; Transport, and Water Affairs. The council is also served by the Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister; the Chairman of Escom; the Managing Director of the I.D.C., and representatives of the four provincial administrations and South West Africa, as nominated by the administrators. Members from the private sector are Mr. W. B. Boshoff; Professor D. C. Krogh; Professor E. W. M. Mellows; Professor J. H. Moolman; Mr. P. J. G. E. Pretorius; Professor F. P. du Toit Viljoen; Mr. Leon Rood!; Dr. John Phillips; Mr. L. C. M. Redgate; Professor S. P. Cilliers; Mr. A. Delport; Professor W. J. Pretorius and Professor R. Truter.</p>

<p>The Department of Planning stands on three legs, namely an economic, a scientific and a physical leg. As far as policy on a wider basis is concerned, the first-mentioned two divisions are served by two councils which were established under the Prime Minister before the Ministry of Planning came into being. While these two councils are advisory to the Prime Minister, there is in practice the closest liaison with my Ministry, and they also act in an advisory function to the Ministry of Planning. The Resources and Planning Advisory Council was therefore established on the same basis and with the same objectives as the two other advisory councils.</p>

<p>Our experience with the pattern of activities of the Economic Advisory Council, the Scientific Advisory Council and the Orange River Advisory Council has shown that these councils, which normally convene twice a year and then confine themselves mainly to discussions on policy, supply a great need. These councils make their recommendations, but they were not established to take decisions on the implementation of the tasks and plans of other concerns. They are advisory, and not executive councils, but they do enable executive bodies, in the knowledge of what other concerns are doing or contemplating, to integrate and link their own plans with that, with a view to the maximum benefit of the country at the minimum expense and energy.</p>

<p>From the foregoing, and having regard to the constitution of the Resources and Planning Advisory Council, it is therefore clear and should be clear to hon. members that the council&#x2019;s task is to co-ordinate action and certainly not to take over functions which are performed or which could be performed by other concerns.</p>

<p>I think I have said enough in connection with the repeal of the Natural Resources Development Act and the inclusion of certain clauses in this Bill. I should now like to discuss just briefly the control measures which are contained in Act No. 51 of 1947, as amended, and which are now included in this Bill. For the sake of convenience I shall refer to the 1947 Act and to the 1955 Amending Act as the old Act.</p>

<p>Clause 5 of this Bill provides for the establishment and disestablishment of controlled areas. This is section 14 of the old Act. Clauses 6 and 8&#x2014;I take them together&#x2014;deal with restrictions and certain exceptions in controlled areas, and also provide for exemption by way of permits. In this measure a new element is added, and this is an extension of the exemptions in order that the areas proclaimed in terms of the Group Areas Act may now also be included. The principle involved herein and the relevant provisions are contained in section 15 of the old Act.</p>

<p>Clause 7 substitutes section 17 of the old Act and is aimed at giving exemptions in particular cases over and above those which are provided for in clause 6 (2).</p>

<p>These are the clauses which were taken over from the old N.R.D.C. Act. Clauses 10 and 12 contain no new principles either, but are merely improvements which ensue from the experience of the past and are aimed exclusively at preventing delay by eliminating cumbersome procedures.</p>

<p>Clause 11 contains penal provisions which are exactly the same as those contained in section 24 of the old Act. Clause 13 specifically excludes Bantu homelands from any provisions of this Bill. Finally, just to complete the picture in respect of the &#x201C;old&#x201D; provisions&#x2014;if I may call them that&#x2014;in this Bill, there is clause 14, which repeals Act No. 51 of 1947 and Act No. 55 of 1950. It also ensures, however, that anything done in terms of those measures shall be deemed to have been done under the corresponding provisions of this Bill. This means that the control in existing proclaimed <span class="col_6761-6762" refersTo="page_0642"/>areas may be maintained. In other words, it is merely a continuation of what has been done under the old Act. So much for the old section. I now come to the new.</p>

<p>Here we have to do with clauses 2, 3, 4 and 9 (1). Clause 4 now authorizes the Minister to cause an investigation to be made into the manner in which the resources of the Republic may best be utilized. It also contains a further provision to the effect that after such an investigation an area cannot only be reserved and proclaimed a controlled area, but that it can also be reserved for a specific purpose. The clause therefore relates to the investigation which may be made and the best utilization of certain of our resources, and it also provides that such an area may be reserved for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>After the investigation&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, after the investigation. Now that the hon. member mentions the investigation, I want to give the assurance that in terms of this provision the investigation will be very thorough. At the Committee Stage it is also my intention to take this clause into review and possibly to add the words &#x201C;consultation with an administrator or administrators, according to the circumstances&#x201D;. I think it will be an improvement to the clause.</p>

<p>Hon. members may perhaps be interested to hear in what cases this clause may possibly be invoked. For example, there are very valuable deposits of glass-sand here on the Cape Flats, and it is quite probably necessary to preserve these for posterity. After a very thorough investigation it will then be possible to have these deposits proclaimed and reserved for a specific purpose. Furthermore, there is also very valuable agricultural land which is of great value. I am now thinking, for example, of a place close to Cape Town where there is certain agricultural land which at certain times of the year supply up to 70 per cent of Cape Town&#x2019;s fresh vegetable requirements. It will be possible, after thorough investigation to reserve such land for a specific purpose. I also have in mind the investigations which have already been made in connection with a recreation resort for the Rand on the Suikerbosrand. I am not saying that this is going to be done&#x2014;I want hon. members to understand this very well, because I have not even looked at the report yet&#x2014;but in terms of clause 4 it will be possible to reserve such an area, or a part thereof, for the specific purpose of recreation. I think this is a necessary power which the Minister should have.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that it will be used very sparingly. I should like to emphasize that after such a stretch of land has been reserved, it will nevertheless be possible in terms of this clause, by way of permit, to have it used temporarily for some other purpose. If such a stretch of land is reserved by proclamation for the specific purpose of recreation, it cannot be developed immediately, of course. It will be possible to grant temporary permission by way of permit to the effect that it may be used temporarily for agricultural or any other purposes.</p>

<p>Then there are clauses 2 and 3. I should like hon. members to read these two clauses in conjunction with clause 9 (1). In terms of clause 9 (1) the Minister may delegate his powers, and in co-operation with the representatives of other Government Departments &#x2014;seven in number&#x2014;these clauses, namely 2 and 3, may be given effect to.</p>

<p>Let me first deal with clause 2. This clause relates to the zoning and subdivision of land for industrial purposes. Under this clause the Minister has to grant written approval if additional land is zoned for industrial purposes. I have placed an amendment on the Order Paper. Clause 2 (1) will then read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Without the prior written approval of the Minister&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) no town-planning scheme or any amendment thereof which provides for the zoning for industrial purposes of land not zoned for such purposes may be approved;</li>

<li>(b) no land zoned for industrial purposes may be subdivided; and</li>

<li>(c) no industrial township may be established.</li>

</ol>

<p>An industrial township is added here because the establishment of an industrial township is also only the subdivision of land; it is another method of subdividing land.</p>

<p>In other words, the Minister is here taking the power of having to give his written consent for the zoning of new, additional land for industrial purposes. Furthermore, the Minister may also lay down certain conditions, and such conditions shall be included in the title or conditions of establishment of such industrial township or land. I want to make it very clear, however, that the provision which is made here will be put into effect only&#x2014; and I shall later come to that&#x2014;by the committee provided for in clause 9 (1).</p>

<p>Let us just consider clause 3 for a moment. I shall afterwards come back to the related clauses 2, 3 and 9 (1). Clause 3 deals with the establishment and extension of factories. In terms of this clause it will be necessary to obtain the written consent of the Minister for the establishment of any new factory or the extension of an existing factory. Subsection (2) of clause 3 is a fairly complex provision&#x2014; in any event, I find it complex&#x2014;and it contains a very wide definition. But the definition is so wide for the very purpose of making it possible to exclude as many factories as possible, if so desired, and to facilitate the smooth <span class="col_6763-6764" refersTo="page_0643"/>functioning of this clause. That is actually the object of this wide definition. It also draws in the establishment of factories; this will now also be subject to the written approval of the Minister. As in the previous case, the Minister may here impose certain conditions in granting permission for the establishment of a new factory or the extension of an existing factory. I also want hon. members to note that this will not apply to all factories in South Africa. It will not apply to the establishment of new factories throughout the Republic, nor to existing factories throughout the Republic. Clause 3 (2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare subsection (1) to apply with reference to the establishment or extension of &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then refers to certain areas, certain factories or certain classes of factories. I repeat, this wide, complex definition is in fact intended to facilitate the administration as far as possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it does, in clause 3 (2) (a)&#x2014;a factory or a class of factory.</p>

<p>In respect of both clauses 2 and 3 I have amendments on to-day&#x2019;s Order Paper. These relate to clauses 2 (2) and 3 (3). They are intended merely to make the relevant provisions easier to read and easier to understand. The clauses will then read as follows. Clause 2 (2) will read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may in his discretion withhold or grant his approval referred to in subsection (1) and if he grants it, he may impose such conditions as he may deem fit, including conditions in connection with labour, housing, the consumption of water, or any other matter which in his opinion is relevant.</block>

<p>Essentially the amendment corresponds to the clause in the Bill, but it merely sets out the position somewhat more clearly. The same applies to clause 3 (3).</p>

<p>Clause 9 (1) provides&#x2014;and I said we should read this subsection and clauses 2 and 3 in conjunction&#x2014;for the delegation of powers by the Minister, and it is contemplated, and is in fact stated here, that the Minister may delegate his powers to a person with a rank not lower than that of under-secretary, and that such an officer shall form a committee in consultation with six other Government Departments, namely Labour, Bantu Administration and Development, Economic Affairs, Coloured Affairs, Indian Affairs and Water Affairs. I foresee that this will be a standing inter-departmental committee which will be in very close liaison with the standing committee which comes under the Minister of Economic Affairs. Hon. members will note, furthermore, that provision is made here for an appeal to the Minister if a person is not satisfied with the decision of the committee. I envisage that this committee will be a positive, active committee, because no delays and unnecessary red tape will be allowed in this case. Secondly, I also envisage that this committee will function very quickly and will be able to lend guidance and respond to inquiries. It will not be necessary to make application immediately in all cases where zoning of land or subdivision of land for industrial purposes takes place, but if necessary it will be possible to get a reply by telephone from this committee if inquiries are made regarding the relevant circumstances. In other words, I want this committee to be a guiding committee; secondly, that it should be freely possible to make inquiries. Moreover, I want to say that this committee will quite probably have to lay down certain norms and certain formulae in respect of certain factories or certain classes of factories. I do not want to go into the details now, and I am not going to be side-tracked into talking about norms or formulae or various types of factories at this stage.</p>

<p>If only the hon. member for Durban (Point) would have some patience, he would see which provisions are going to apply in this regard. The hon. member&#x2019;s problem is that he does not read the Bill. He should just give me a chance, because he is interrupting me now; I do not have all this on paper, I am trying to formulate it. Before this measure is put into operation, this committee will have to consult all interested parties, and I foresee that the Federated Chamber of Industries, the Provincial Administrations and also individual industrialists and other interested parties will have to be consulted, and I want it to be so, because we want to cooperate in this regard; we do not want to force things on to industrialists, and I also believe that we shall receive very effective and highly appreciated assistance in this connection. Secondly, I foresee that after the commencement of this measure the committee will maintain periodic liaison with concerns which have a strong interest in this, and I now want to invite all concerns to co-operate with us in this regard. This committee will therefore consist of seven members who will be persons with a rank not lower than that of undersecretary of a Department. All the administrative work will naturally be done by the Department of Planning. There is also this further advantage that there will now be only one channel through which interested parties will be able to sound the opinion and the attitude and the policy of the central Government in <span class="col_6765-6766" refersTo="page_0644"/>respect of the zoning of additional industrial land, in respect of the subdivision of land, in any way whatsoever, and in respect of the establishment of new factories and the extension of existing factories in certain reserved areas. I may tell hon. members that the fact that in the past provincial administrations had to consult various Government Departments presented them with major problems. I am grateful for the co-operation which existed in the past between the Central Government and the provincial administrations in connection with the zoning of land, for example, but in the nature of matters, as I have already said, it was necessary for them to consult different Government Departments. Each of these different Government Departments gave a reply on its own&#x2014;it was a cumbersome process&#x2014; and it was left to the individual concerned&#x2014; the Provincial authority, the local authority or the individual&#x2014;to decide for himself what the collective attitude of the Central Government was. Here we now have one channel, one committee, which acts by authority of the Minister. The committee can take decisions only if the members are <i>ad idem</i> on a matter, otherwise it becomes a matter for the Cabinet. In other words, the matter is then referred to the highest authority. I believe this will be conducive to smooth functioning and satisfaction, and it is certainly a matter which is welcomed by the provincial administrations and the Administrators, by name. I shall later come to the views of the Administrators and the provincial administrations.</p>

<p>To summarize, I just want to give hon. members a table of the powers conferred here. Altogether 21 powers are here conferred on the Minister. Of these the first ten are new powers and the remaining 11 are existing or slightly amended powers. Central control is now assumed over (1) further zoining of land for industrial purposes; (2) further subdivision of land for industrial purposes, whether by way of pure subdivision or through the establishment of industrial townships; (3) the imposition of conditions upon approval of zoning or subdivision of land for industrial purposes; (4) the registration of such conditions as have been imposed. Then the power is also taken to exercise control where it may become necessary over the establishment of new factories; this is No. 5. Sixthly, the increase in the number of Bantu employees at existing factories. Hon. members will note, if they look at to-day&#x2019;s Order Paper, that in clause 3 (4) paragraph (a) is now omitted. Clause 3 (4) will now read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> For the purposes of subsection (1) an extension of a factory means any increase in the number of employees employed in such factory.</block>

<p>That is significant.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The seventh new power is the imposition of conditions in respect of the establishment or extension of controlled factories. The eighth power which is taken is to cause investigations to be made into the manner in which resources may best be exploited. developed and utilized; the ninth is the reservation of the use of land for a specific purpose, and the tenth is the suspension of title restrictions where these come into conflict with reservation for a specific purpose. These are the ten new powers which are taken in this Bill.</p>

<p>I then come to the old powers: (11) the establishment of controlled areas where control may be exercised over the subdivision of land, granting the right to an undivided share in land and a change in the use of land, except land included in a town-planning scheme or land which is used for agricultural, forestry, road or railway purposes; (12) the disestablishment of controlled areas where control is no longer necessary; (13) exemption from certain restrictions in controlled areas; (14) issuing permits; (15) the delegation of powers (clause 9); (16) the withdrawal and amendment of proclamation and notices; (17) penalties to ensure enforcement of conditions and compliance with restrictions; (18) proof of certain facts; (19) the exclusion of Bantu areas; (20) the repeal of the Natural Resources Development Act, Act No. 51 of 1947, and Act No. 50 of 1965, and (21) the retention of the controlled areas established in terms of the above-mentioned Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think this is a factual summary and exposition of the provisions of this Bill. Hon. members may rightly ask me how these new provisions will function. In connection with clause 4 I have already indicated that such an investigation will be made very thoroughly; secondly, that there will be very wide consultation, and in the nature of matters that we are here concerned mainly with land and with what is on it&#x2014;deposits or whatever it may be&#x2014;with a view to its preservation for posterity. I do not think I need say anything more about this. Hon. members may also rightly ask me how clauses 2 and 3 will be administered in practice and to what extent these things will be implemented by the inter-departmental committee to which I have referred and which is to be established in terms of clause 9 (1). During all discussions in the Department and outside I emphasized that there should be no delay as regards the performance of the functions of the committee; that the smooth functioning of the administration should be ensured. I asked this assurance from my Department and it was given to me, because I am fully aware of the fact that when one deals with industrialists and the establishment of a new factory and in particular with the extension of an existing factory, delays could only have a hampering effect, and in this case this must not happen.</p>

<p>I also foresee that there will be no great difficulties, because the constitution of this inter-departmental committee is such that they will be able to fulfil these functions. Once they have deliberated and come to certain policy <span class="col_6767-6768" refersTo="page_0645"/>decisions, which will have to be ratified by the Minister and the Cabinet, they will indeed be able to function and will be a great boon to the industrialists of this country. The doors of this committee will be open at all times to any industrialist, whether he wants to pay a personal visit to the office of the committee or whether he wants to contact them by telephone. I believe that in the vast majority of cases it will not be necessary to apply for advice, but that it will be possible to obtain the advice courteously and properly long before the application is made. Hon. members will now ask me what the practical position will be in respect of the subdivision of land or the zoning of industrial land. To some extent I have already outlined the practical position and this is, namely, that the provinces, which exercise control over the zoning of industrial land or the subdivision of existing industrial land, or town-layout schemes, or town planning schemes, to use the terms which are used in the various provinces, did in fact consult the different Government Departments in the past. All the work undertaken by the provinces in this regard will continue just as previously, with this exception, that the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; channels in respect of the zoning of additional industrial land or the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; in respect of subdivision of industrial land or an industrial township will now rest with the Minister and no longer with the provinces.</p>

<p>In respect of clause 3: When we deal with new factories, and particularly with the extension of existing factories&#x2014;the clause now provides that any increase in the number of Bantu employees shall constitute an extension to an existing factory&#x2014;I want to tell hon. members that it is our intention, wherever possible, at least to freeze the number of Bantu employees in industries, and in due course to reduce it. I appreciate, however, that industry has certain features which one has to take into consideration. We shall have to consider them very carefully. I want to give hon. members the assurance that we shall not deal with these special circumstances in an off-hand fashion if they exist. I fully appreciate that for the small man, and also for larger industries, there are certain seasonal fluctuations in the number of workers, and then he has to go and ask for a permit. Practically I think it is quite possible to give an indication and to grant permission for that fluctuation, in order that he need not apply every time. Secondly, I also appreciate fully that this problem may also arise where an existing factory is under engaged at a given moment. It is particularly true of the small industrialists, of whom there are thousands in the country and who are mostly on the Witwatersrand, that in such a case one finds the situation that the factory is just at a stage where its turnover enables it to meet its expenditure, and that the extension of that factory and the full engagement of its existing operational space will now make it possible for that factory to become profitable.</p>

<p>We know that there is a certain turnover notch on which a factory is not profitable, and a certain notch on which it does become profitable. I am fully aware of this, the question of the small man and of the under-engaged factory and the question of the seasonal fluctuation. In this connection hon. members on this side of the House have consulted me and have pointed out these problems. I may assure hon. members that I am not unsympathetic in this regard, and I shall therefore be prepared to consider possible amendments in respect of clause 3 (4) at the Committee Stage, not to dismantle what we want to achieve in this respect, but in order not to hamper the administration of the Act. If we can effect an improvement in this respect, I shall be prepared to consider such an amendment from hon. members on my side of the House who have already discussed it with me. For example, I have in mind something to the effect that for the purposes of subsection (1) an extension to a factory shall mean an extension to the building complex on the premises of that factory which will also bring about an increase in the number of Bantu employees of that factory, or something of this nature. But I repeat, we may not dismantle or water down the objectives.</p>

<p>Then there is just a further point in connection with the practical administration. Hon. members should not raise imaginary objections here and say that these things cannot be done. They can be done quite easily. But I want to say that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development will be represented on this inter-departmental committee. The Labour Bureaux of that Department have a card for every factory. They know exactly who is working in that factory; they have the names. Furthermore, I may also say that if building complexes or sites are involved it will not create problems either, because there will also be a high official of the Department of Labour on this Committee, and the Department of Labour have plans of all factories at their disposal every day, because amongst other things they have to implement the provision that there must be at least 25 square feet of open space per worker. Therefore, also with reference to this control which is already in existence, I am prepared to consider an improvement to clause 3 (4) if it is necessary.</p>

<p>I think I have now given hon. members a reasonable exposition of what the provisions are and of how we envisage their functioning in practice. But now I also owe hon. members an explanation of and the motivation for the introduction of this Bill. I see this specific legislation as the most positive legislation in the entire industrial history of South Africa. I expect, as we have read, that in this case, as with other legislation, we shall also meet with a considerable deal of opposition, but I also anticipate that as in the case of other legislations through the years, it will be accepted by even the most violent opponents once it functions and brings about prosperity and <span class="col_6769-6770" refersTo="page_0646"/>progress. I say it is the most positive legislation in our industrial history, because there is not only one way of making the best use of the resources of the Republic. There is not only one group of people who can lay claim to all knowledge as far as doing so is concerned. The time has come that we should have coordinated planning from a central point, and by this I mean the Central Government. We may not see the Republic as anything but an entity, and in speaking of an entity I am not referring to the white Republic only, but then we should also see Southern Africa as an entity of different nations and different countries, just as we see North Africa and West Africa and East Africa. In the context of Southern Africa I regard the Bantu homelands as a natural resource just as much as the others available to us, and it is a resource particularly in respect of a home for the Bantu nation that belongs there. For that reason we may not allow certain areas, certain individuals or certain concerns to develop independently of each other. Therefore, in my entire motivation for this Bill, our thinking is national and our action and planning should take place from a national point of view. By coincidence it has always been the case in the past that it has also been seen as such from a National Party point of view.</p>

<p>When one deals with industries the economic considerations are of course of the utmost importance, and the record of this Government shows that it has always had very thorough regard to the economic considerations. What we see in South Africa to-day is the fruit of planning carried out on these benches in the past 19 years. But inherent in that recognition of the utmost importance of economic considerations, the short-term economic growth has never been allowed and never will be allowed to play a decisive role in the South African national economy. Nor do I lose sight of the economic factors in my thinking and in my motivation. In fact, as I have said, we have always lent very high priority to those, but in addition full regard should be had to the social considerations, as in other countries, and I think it is even more true in South Africa that the social considerations become of cardinal importance if we consider the different nations and the different countries here at the southern tip of Africa. Throughout my reasoning I am therefore going to place the emphasis on the socioeconomic considerations, and not only on the economic and not only on the social ones. This will be the theme of my entire plea and of the motivation I shall furnish you in the following minutes.</p>

<p>Just like water provision, housing, transport, labour and the establishment of the various population groups, the provision of industrial land and the establishment of industrial concerns are also of national importance. The development and establishment of industries influence the implementation of social policy. The decision on the location of a factory in a private-enterprise system such as ours in South Africa frequently has indirect social and financial results which are not taken into account in the costs or motives of the entrepreneur, but which are of great importance to the general public and Government concerns. Such a decision by a single undertaking, or by a few of them, which is taken purely on economic grounds, may either cause the regression of an area or may increase the population and activities in another area to such an extent that large and sometimes phenominal expenditure has to be incurred on housing and other public services. It may also result in unemployment in one place or among one population group while a labour shortage prevails somewhere else. It may also upset and disrupt the relationship between town and rural areas with no consideration on the part of the entrepreneur for the profit or loss of the country as a whole or the problems which may arise from such an action. The Government holds the view that if an industry can be established in alternative places, always having regard to the economic consideration, the Central Government should have the power, taking into consideration the wider socioeconomic factors, to decide where such an undertaking will fit in best. Provinces and local authorities may act competitively, and for that reason the final say in the provision of industrial land cannot be left exclusively in their hands. The economic policy of the Government is attuned to promoting the welfare of the nation in general. If the industrial sector needs a basis for broadening the structure in a specific field, the Government itself acts as an entrepreneur in isolated cases, if necessary. We have the examples of Sasol, Iscor, etc. For social, economic, physical and other reasons some regions develop more rapidly than others, and the pattern which comes into being is not always in the interests of the country. The development of certain development concentrations has a snowball effect and the tempo is faster than in certain other parts of the country. This pattern does not change automatically. Government action is necessary to guide development in a certain direction and to direct the development of the country in such a way that it develops harmoniously within the socio-economic framework and for the benefit of all population groups. In order to bring this about, the Government must not only encourage the private sector in particular areas, but must also of its own accord undertake national projects such as the Orange River project. Because the establishment of industries plays such an important part in the development of the country, it goes without saying that it is absolutely essential to successful and effective planning that the Government should also have a say in that regard. In overseas countries experience has taught that in order to achieve success in decentralization, it is essential to supplement the incentives in the underdeveloped areas by means of restrictive measures against development in the overdeveloped regions. Thus, for example, both the establishment of industries and the <span class="col_6771-6772" refersTo="page_0647"/>erection of office buildings in the Paris area in France are controlled by permits which are strictly enforced. In Paris permission is granted only in the case of essential services, and even as regards moving premises within the area, a <i>quid, pro quo</i> has to be provided by opening a branch of the undertaking concerned in a depressed area. In England permission to build must be obtained throughout the country. The freedom with which permits are granted, however, depends on the area and the extent to which the Government wishes to develop that area; while permits for the erection of factories and buildings are granted readily in the under-developed areas, it is only by exception, for example when there is greater automation and fewer workers are employed, that they are issued in London and Birmingham. The same approach and procedure are adopted in Athens, in Greece. In the case of countries where over-concentration in the large cities gives rise to concern, there is the warning that this danger should be guarded against timeously to try to prevent it rather than to try to solve the problem once it has got out of hand. I think that as ours is a young country and prevention is still possible in certain areas, this is a very strong obligation which rests on us and which we may not evade. In the above-mentioned countries there are therefore definite legal measures against new undertakings and also against the extension of existing undertakings in certain urban complexes. Nor is this principle of legislation against the establishment of industries in certain areas new to South Africa. There has never been absolute freedom as regards the siting of industries in the Republic. In terms of the Water Act of 1956 a permit is required for a daily consumption of more than 50,000 gallons, and the Minister of Water Affairs must consult the Minister of Economic Affairs with a view to decentralization before granting such a permit. This is why I say that there has never been absolute freedom. In addition there is control by the provincial administrations, local authorities, the Department of Labour and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>Basically the reasons for decentralization, or rather curbing centralized development, are the same everywhere and may be summarized as follows: Firstly, there are social considerations. Here one has to consider the disruption of labour in rural areas and the concomitant cultural problems. Secondly, there is the high incidence of crime and social aberrations in large cities. Here I want to draw the attention of hon. members to a report which appeared last week on the crime position in a city like New York. Thirdly, there is the labour increase and the labour exhaustion as a result of the over-taxing or over-exertion of manpower. By this I mean, amongst other things, the long distances from work, the longer hours, slum conditions, and so forth. Fourthly, social considerations include the health hazards and also the possibility of epidemics.</p>

<p>As regards the economic considerations, considerations which apply throughout the world, there are the following aspects: Firstly, The high <i>per capita</i> cost of labour which accompanies over-concentration is a vital problem here in South Africa, too. This is a source of great concern to the Government and the taxpayers, but one which is not shared by the industrialist. A survey in Italy revealed that if one compares the cost <i>per capita</i> for essential services in a population concentration of 30,000 souls with the cost <i>per capita</i> in a population concentration of 200,000, the cost in the former case is three times as high as in the latter. This is a survey which was very thoroughly carried out. A similar survey in Belgium, in Ghent, produced corresponding results. This goes without saying, if one merely considers the high cost of express-ways in large cities, bringing water over long distances and providing housing on highly expensive land. I understand that the express-ways in Johannesburg, that is, only the roads which are built on concrete pillars, are estimated to cost approximately R500 million. By now it is something like R660 million. I do not have the exact figure. [Interjections.] I am not certain of my figures. I shall get them for you. But the point I want to illustrate is this: The estimates framed for these expenditures are always inadequate. The expenditure is always much higher than estimated.</p>

<p>The next economic consideration is the high wage-structure which results largely from the high cost-structure, due, amongst other things, to high transportation and accommodation costs. Thirdly, there is the risk to service undertakings, for example power failures and transport strikes, of which we see many examples in other parts of the world. Fortunately we do not experience them in South Africa. Fourthly, there is the more effective utilization of a country&#x2019;s resources. That is, seen from an economic point of view. Fifthly, there is the over-engagement of communications, for example the road systems, which result in delay in the transportation of people and goods, as well as the over-engagement of telephone services, and so forth.</p>

<p>The benefits of decentralized development lie in the obverse of the above-mentioned aspects plus the advantages contained in the more even distribution of incomes and opportunities for all citizens of the country, that is, for those in the depressed areas as well. This approach, to cause all communities to share in the national prosperity to a larger extent, is at present the accepted policy in virtually all countries. I shall later make some further observations on our rural areas.</p>

<p>In South Africa all these considerations obtain, plus the following: Firstly, the heterogeneous population composition of our country, with the concomitant cultural differences and other needs; secondly, the largest potential labour sources are found in our Bantu homelands; thirdly, the prevalence of important resources at the Bantu homelands, for <span class="col_6773-6774" refersTo="page_0648"/>example water, agriculture, forestry and minerals; fourthly, factors such as the relative scarcity of water sources near the large urban areas (this is the obverse of the third aspect which I mentioned a moment ago); and, fifthly, the need of a more balanced utilization of our communication system in an extensive country with only a few developed spots. I am always surprised, looking at South Africa, to think that we have such an extensive and effective communication system although we have such a small population. In other densely populated small countries the communication system is still very poorly developed.</p>

<p>Control over Bantu labour is already in existence in various sectors of the South African way of life. In terms of section 29 of the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, as substituted by section 25 of Act No. 42 of 1964, the number of Bantu workers on farms may be controlled and even reduced. In the cities there is not such a direct measure, but the availability of Bantu labour is controlled by indirect measures such as influx control and restrictions on residence. Hon. members know that the number of domestic servants who are allowed to live on the premises is controlled &#x2014;also in respect of hotels, hospitals, etc. The ultimate effect of this is that there are fewer Bantu in the white residential areas. There is therefore this kind of control, which we are now also introducing in respect of industries. It is not as though we are simply singling out industry as a scapegoat, because this is the very last thing we have in mind in this connection. If it is taken into consideration that at present there are 166,000 Bantu in residential areas in Pretoria, one million on the Witwatersrand and 160,000 in the Vaal triangle (this gives a total of 1,300,000 Bantu in the P.W.V. area), it will be appreciated how essential it is to supplement these measures with direct measures through which the number of Bantu employees at factories, particularly in the metropolitan areas, can be controlled and restricted. According to an interim report by the City Engineer and the director of non-White Affairs in Johannesburg on the forward planning for the Bantu population in the existing residential area of Soweto&#x2014;this is in Soweto alone&#x2014;the population, which at present totals 360,000, will increase to more than 500,000 in 1980, through the natural increase alone. The officials state to accommodate this number another residential area of at least six square miles will have to be added to the existing 21 square miles. This is in respect of Soweto alone. However, the area will still be too restricted, and flat buildings at fairly high building costs will have to be erected for the Bantu and subsidized by the State to keep the rentals within the means of the Bantu labourers. The officials calculate that to transport this labour force to and from their places of employment new railway, overhead railway and express bus services will have to be established on a large scale; again, of course, with the assistance of State subsidies. As regards educational facilities, there will have to be considerable extensions in order to keep the rapidly growing number of Bantu children at school. This is merely&#x2014;and I want hon. members to take note of this&#x2014;an estimate for Soweto alone, where at present there are 360,000 Bantu. If one now considers the 1,300,000 Bantu in the P.W.V. area on the basis of Soweto, and hon. members are still not convinced of the gravity of the situation, then I do not know what further proof I must advance.</p>

<p>The efforts made by the Government in the past number of years to develop border industrial areas and the Bantu homelands, are known to all hon. members. All these efforts to decentralize industries and thus take the employment to the areas where our greatest labour resources are available, are negated by the fact that the Government, apart from the restriction on the use of water, has no power by which an industrialist may be prohibited from settling on any farmland or land zoned for industrial purposes. There are thousands of morgen of land in the Republic which have already been zoned for industrial purposes but have not yet been developed. I mention only a few examples. On the Witwatersrand there are approximately 2,000 morgen. In the Cape Peninsula there are more than 1,000 morgen. In the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex there are approximately 500 morgen. If this industrial land is allowed to be developed arbitrarily on the present pattern, it may have the result that in these three metropolitan areas alone more than 12,000 morgen will have to be found for the accommodation of the Bantu employees alone. The Government cannot and will not allow these conditions to continue unchecked any longer, and deems it essential in the interests of the country that with a view to effective long-term planning and the development of our country it should also have the say in the provision of industrial land and the establishment of industries. I could hardly state or summarize this more succinctly than it was stated in an editorial in <i>Die Burger</i> this morning. <i>Die Burger</i> said the following, and I would make only one small change to this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is supplementary to the direct and indirect means which the authorities have at present to direct and decentralize industrial development, and to bring it into line with the demands of separate development.</block>

<p>As I have said, I would insert only one word here, namely &#x201C;socio-economic&#x201D;, and the last part of the paragraph would then read: &#x201C;&#x2026; with the socio-economic demands of separate development.&#x201D; I have now given you an exposition of the motives for taking these measures. But I do want to mention some more examples which we may not ignore. It is estimated that if the available industrial land on the Witwatersrand is developed in accordance with the labour pattern in the past ten years, at least another 750,000 Bantu would be added. This estimate does not allow for the ordinary <span class="col_6775-6776" refersTo="page_0649"/>natural increase and for influx. I say that this has been the pattern over the past ten years. We know that one morgen of industrial land requires at least three morgen for dwelling purposes. In other words, if this were allowed, an additional 6,000 morgen of land would be needed for Bantu residential areas on the Witwatersrand alone. This is additional. And you must also bear in mind that at the moment there is not adequate land available for the proper resettlement of the Bantu who are already employed in industry and who have not yet been resettled. There is a second point I want to mention, and I know that in this I will enjoy the support of my hon. colleague the Minister of Water Affairs, and this is the question of water. It so happens that at the moment there are certain control measures. As I mentioned previously, any factory which wants to use 50,000 gallons of water or more must obtain permission. But have you ever considered what would happen on the Witwaters rand if the water in the Vaal Dam sank to the bottom&#x003F; What happens to a complex such as the Witwatersrand if for one hour&#x2014; I am not speaking of 24 hours&#x2014;it is waterless&#x003F; I do not want to dramatize the position, but in London I felt distressed every time I read what was happening to our water in South Africa. Can you conceive what will happen to a city and a complex such as the P.W.V. area if it is left waterless for one hour&#x003F; Now you should also remember that the water does not peter out gradually. If the supply of water runs out, the stoppage is immediate. And has the time not come that over and above the existing control measures we should take further measures, as we are now taking, and that everyone should become spiritually attuned to them&#x003F; Let us move away from this overconcentration, particularly of Bantu employees, in the large metropolitan areas. I want to mention a second point, namely the question of transport. As you know it is the responsibility of the State to defray all costs in respect of transport from and to resettlement areas over and above R22 per month <i>per capita.</i> I have gone into this to some extent, and there are good reasons for it. It was only a step along the road to separate development. It was done in order that the Bantu may now be settled in the one or two large areas where they are at present. I have no fault to find with that. But I cannot see it as anything but merely a step along the road to the ultimate realization of the full implications of separate development. But the fact of the matter is, and this affects the taxpayer, that since 1957&#x2014;this system has now been in operation for ten years &#x2014;an amount of R46,690,539, say R47 million, has been paid over to the Railways Administration from the Treasury. And in respect of this year, according to figures furnished to me by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Transport, the figure is estimated at R10,800,000, and quite probably R12 million. We shall have to take a very serious look at these things. One of the methods of dealing with it is by way of the powers incorporated in this legislation. And anyone who opposes this legislation should first come and tell me what alternative powers we should take or where we are to find the money to meet the expenses which are increasing apace every year. In the second place I want to mention the question of housing. And here I want to say that our farmers provide housing for their Bantu. It is fairly good housing, and I would not claim that it is as desired everywhere. I spoke to a farmer the other day, and I think that this may be regarded as a fairly good general example. He has a stretch of land of approximately 1,000 morgen somewhere in South Africa, a fairly intensive farm. He has approximately 50 Bantu employees on his farm. And do you know that during the past 15 or 20 years&#x2014; he showed me the statements&#x2014;he has spent, in addition to what there was originally, R17,000 on housing for his employees. I say this to demonstrate that in certain sectors in South Africa there are persons who pay from their own pockets for the housing of their Bantu employees or other non-Whites.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are certain Government concerns, for example the Railways, and certain semi-Government concerns, Iscor and others, which also provide from their own funds for their Bantu employees. The mines do so on a very large scale, in a somewhat different form. But the fact of the matter is that they do in fact do so. There are also certain large industries, for example the Union Steel Corporation at Vereeniging, and others. I am also fully aware of the fact that industrialists and dealers in certain towns pay a services levy, but this is in respect of electricity, water, sewage and roads, and not for houses as such. In other words, the industrialist in South Africa has no financial obligation in respect of the hundreds and thousands and millions of Bantu who have to be housed. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have mentioned these few additional points in respect of the motivation for this legislation. Now I just want to say a word in respect of the rural areas. I think that as far as overall or national planning is concerned we may not forget the rural areas. Nor may we forget the areas where former activities have come to an end, for example in mining. In other words, in this entire approach, the socio-economic approach to the whole problem, we have in mind not only border industries and homeland industries. <span class="col_6777-6778" refersTo="page_0650"/>We also have in mind the interests of the rural areas, of the less developed areas and those areas where activities come to an end for some reason or other. In other words, decentralization in general. Or to put it more correctly, the objective of curbing centralized development. And that is why in this legislation we are now taking powers with a view to one objective, namely the development of border industries and homeland industries and the rural areas, in so far as this is possible, but also for the other objective, namely to make the draw-card for the Bantu in the large metropolitan areas as small as possible, and ever smaller. I want to place the emphasis on this. I want to emphasize the advantages inherent in a more even distribution of incomes and opportunities for all citizens of the country, that is, also in rural and depressed areas. And, in fact, we may never lose sight of this. This, then, as regards some of the reasons why this legislation has become essential. I say some of the reasons, because I know that there are several others which could be added. I think I have now said enough in respect of motivation. However, I now want to address a word or two to several concerns. Firstly, to those persons or organizations who are attempting or who attempted to raise n storm of protest over this legislation. In the second place I want to address a word to the provincial administrations. In the third place I want to address a word to the Bantu, because they are very important in this legislation. This includes all Bantu in South Africa. In the fourth place I want to address myself to those persons who have been placed here as legislators, and finally I have a word for the Opposition.</p>

Because it is my experience with the hon. the Leader and the Opposition that they are so slow in learning. And I know that we shall not manage that to-day. One has to lay the foundation well, however, because one thing is certain, and that is that ultimately they do learn. Just consider what the members used to say and what they are now saying about border industry development. But I leave it at that. [Interjections.] I must say, the House is now making me feel more at home. It is once again becoming as I used to know it. [Interjections.] I want to say the following to those people who made attempts to raise a storm of protest over this legislation. The Opposition inside and outside Parliament against the proposed legislation, the statutory planning and utilization of the country&#x2019;s resources, must be ascribed to general negation and ignorance, amongst other things, the following five considerations. And I am now saying these things with reference to the document we received. I must say, I do not hold it against the Federated Chamber of Industries. They treated me courteously. I received the document last Tuesday. It took me only five minutes to read through it. That is why I say that there is negation and ignorance of the following five considerations.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.Speaker, when the House adjourned for lunch I was just beginning to address a few words to the concerns who attempted to raise a storm of protest over this Bill. In my view the opposition to this Bill inside and outside Parliament should be attributed to general negation and ignorance of, amongst other things, the following five considerations. Firstly, the structural change in the industrial development throughout the world, to which the industrial structure in the Republic will have to adjust itself. Secondly, the changed economic conditions in the Republic as a result of the gradual exhaustion of the gold-mines. Thirdly, the fact that South Africa has Bantu homelands and Bantu labour which can be utilized to the greatest advantage, both in the interests of the Bantu and of the country, provided that the homeland is used as the place of residence of the worker. Fourthly, the enormously increased expenditure in respect of the worker for basic services, which is defrayed by the State and other concerns, and not by the factory owner, once a certain population concentration has been reached, as has in fact happened in our metropolitan areas. Fifthly, the fact that basically the proposed legislation is no more and no less than an extension of the planning of the country&#x2019;s industrial structure which has taken place in the course of the past half-century, and in particular after the commencement of the industrial policy as formulated in 1925 through the establishment of the Board of Trade and Industries. What I want to emphasize most pertinently is that the Government desires just as strongly, if not more strongly, to have the metropolitan areas in general and the Witwatersrand complex in particular develop to their highest potential. We disagree with the Opposition and organized commerce and industry in that we do not accept that the utilization of the various available resources, and particularly the skilled manpower, is to the greatest advantage of the country in the kind of industries in which they are at present utilized. The majority of the labour-intensive industries which are established in the metropolitan areas and particularly on the Witwatersrand at present, and which are directed mainly towards the inland markets, can at present be established much more advantageously elsewhere where the cost of establishment and labour is not so high. [Interjections.] I am not saying necessarily in the border areas, but also in the rural areas where a considerable deal of white labour is <span class="col_6779-6780" refersTo="page_0651"/>available, and particularly female labour, which is pre-eminently suited to industries of this nature. The phenominal development of the country&#x2019;s factory industries in the course of the past 40 years is attributable to the strict but sympathetic guidance of the various Government concerns, such as the Board of Trade and Industries, the Department of Customs and Excise and the Department of Labour, assisted by the Wage Board and by the Industrial Tribunal. It is a feature of this policy, as implemented by the various concerns mentioned above, that the interests of the country&#x2019;s industrial development have always been put first. Nor is there any reason whatsoever to assume that the essentials of the above-mentioned policy will be deviated from in planning in terms of this new legislation, which contemplates nothing but a further rationalization in the application and utilization of our resources to the greatest advantage of our country as a whole. As a result of increasing international competition, which will now be further intensified by the large-scale reduction of tariffs as a result of the Kennedy talks, it is essential that there should be the closest planned co-operation between the State and our industrialists. This is what my Department and I as the Minister will seek at all times.</p>

<p>Now I should like to say something specifically in connection with the industrialists and to the industrialists and also to the Federated Chamber of Industries and the Kamer van Koophandel. The history of the matter is as follows. Last year it was brought to the notice of organized industry that legislation of this nature would follow and that powers of this nature were to be taken. The matter was also discussed in the Economic Advisory Council. The Government and I are aware of the fact that in the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister there was opposition to the principle of this Bill. I myself did not consult organized commerce and industry very much. I did have an interview with them the day this Bill was introduced, and also several days ago. I told the Federated Chamber of Industries, and I want to say this in the House to-day, and I accept full responsibility for it, that I deliberately and with open eyes did not consult them, because we were aware of the fact that they were opposed to the principle of the Bill. I also said that the Government did not discuss the principle with them because we knew that they were opposed to it, but that the Government would accept full responsibility for the principles contained in the Bill. Furthermore, in an interview last Tuesday, I again discussed the matter fairly fully with a representative number of members of the Chamber of Industries. There we discussed the matter in a good spirit on both sides and with mutual understanding, and in summary their leader also said that they were still opposed to the principle. This bears out what I said at the beginning, namely that in view of the fact that they are opposed to the principle, the Government is fully responsible and a discussion on the principle would serve absolutely no purpose. Let me also say, furthermore, that the industrialist should understand very clearly that this is not the licensing of factories in South Africa. I am not going to elaborate on this, because the licensing of factories has a different meaning altogether and functions in a different way. I also want to tell the industrialists that the Government is absolutely serious as far as this matter is concerned. Let there be no misunderstanding in South Africa on this point. It is a matter of absolutely serious concern to us that there should be the best utilization of our resources and specifically also the resource of Bantu labour. South Africa cannot service industry; industry can serve South Africa. Furthermore, we should approach this matter in its full socio-economic context. This is not an endeavour to bring about compulsory movement of Bantu labour. It is not in the least intended to implement this legislation in such a way that industries will be compelled by force to go to the border areas or to other decentralized places. But when I say this, industry should also understand the following: This legislation and what I have said in respect of a higher concentration of labour-intensive industries in the large metropolitan complexes is the confession of faith of the Government and of me as Minister, and we are going to carry it through. I want to say that it is construed as the strongest guidance that can emanate from the Central Government, namely that there must be progress in and that a success should be made of the reduced utilization of Bantu workers in white South Africa. [Interjection.] If I have my way, it will happen long before 1978. It was made clear from the outset that 1978 would be the very latest date by which to bring this about. Let the hon. member have no misconception about this. That is why I am being frank. The Opposition and industry, the white man, the black man, the brown man and the yellow man in South Africa will not escape this course of policy. This will be the pattern in South Africa. If we fail to do this, we do not appreciate our responsibility to posterity. In all seriousness I want to ask every industrialist in South Africa to do two things. They can do this. The first is that organized industry should meet and see what they can do of their own accord to make it succeed, for their own sake. Secondly, every manager of a factory, small or large, and every director, should sit down at the board table from to-morrow and see what they can do for their part to make it succeed. There has as yet been too little thinking. There has as yet been too little deliberation in the board rooms of our industries. In saying this I am not suggesting that nothing has been done, but as yet too little has been done to make these things take place.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am not going to be drawn into norms. I am not going to be drawn into fixing certain formula. I undertook to negotiate with industry and the individual industrialist before a final decision is taken on it. Let me also tell the highly capitalized industries and the highly mechanized industries that this is the green light for that kind of industry. Provided that the water and power supplies are there, their way is clear to establish themselves and build the great industrial future of South Africa anywhere in the Republic. This is not hampering legislation. It is positive legislation. Let me also mention to the industrialists another point which coincides with this, because this matter does not relate to border industries only. Let me tell the industrialists what large numbers of people are needed in the engineering industry. People who come from the marginal mines and the mines which must inevitably be worked out, are excellently suited to the various engineering industries. They could help us absorb those people, in view of the fact that their former livelihood is no longer available. Then there is a final point I want to mention to the industrialists. I say this in the utmost sincerity. I hope it will be spread far and wide in South Africa. The industrialists in South Africa have opposed many things done by the National Party Government, but they were not always correct. Having regard to this, I want to extend the invitation to the industrialists to build South Africa in such a way that there may be a secure and happy future for all its people of all colours.</p>

<p>Then I want to say a word in connection with the provinces. I have also had consultations with the provinces. It is to-day exactly a year ago that detailed consultations were held with all four provinces. Certain objections were then raised. We have met some of the objections. I have already dealt with these, but one thing the provinces told me unequivocally, also at a consultation which was held as recently as the day before yesterday, and that was that in principle the provinces supported the Central Government in that it should have this control.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That Province of Natal is in a much better state to-day, under the present administrator, than formerly. But I do not want to quarrel with that hon. member, because at heart he and I think almost alike. The trouble is just that he is still sitting there. The hon. member for South Coast, who is now interrupting me, is the greatest enforcer of apartheid on the entire Natal South Coast. He is the apartheid king of the Natal South Coast. He does not say it to the Bantu in English or in Afrikaans either. He says it to them in Zulu, and they understand it. I understand him, too. I am making the point that apart from the consultations which were held, I wrote the provinces a letter on 11th May. Amongst other things I told them (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cabinet has decided that it is imperative that the Central Government should have the power to exercise effective control over the provision of any further land for industrial purposes and the establishment or extension of factories in specific areas. This principle was accepted by the representatives of the provinces during the consultations on 26th May, 1966. The attitude of the provinces is appreciated and I therefore trust that no objection will be raised to clauses 2 and 3.</block>

<p>I would be misleading you if I said that no objections were raised to clauses 2 and 3 on Wednesday, but the objection which was in fact raised is the one we always hear from the provinces, namely that their powers are being curtailed. Now I say this candidly: In this legislation the powers of the provinces in respect of the zoning of additional industrial land and the subdivision of existing industrial land are curtailed. We do so with open eyes. We do so deliberately, because it is a national responsibility which belongs with the Central Government. But in respect of their practical problems we have gone a long way, and I have also met them through certain amendments which are contained in this Bill and which are still to be effected. Furthermore, I want to give the provinces the assurance that their functions, as far as clause 2 is concerned, in respect of the zoning of industrial land and the subdivision of industrial land will continue <span class="col_6783-6784" refersTo="page_0653"/>just as in the past, save that the final decision will now rest with this Government. Furthermore, we have no interest in town planning schemes. This is no more than right, for if the provinces are to perform their functions properly, they must fight for their own province. They must then place the interests of their own province first. That is how we would like to see it. It is their task, but then they must also accept that the Central Government, after hearing all this, decides what is in the interests of the whole South Africa, and not only of that one province. I say that I have given the provinces a full hearing, and we have gone a long way. There was also a request that the provinces should be able to take the initiative in respect of drawing up plans for development. But unfortunately that ties up with the Financial Relations Bill, and not with this one. In clause 4 I shall in fact provide for consultation with the provinces. The provinces are not excluded from these things. They serve specifically on the Resources and Planning Advisory Council, and the argument that it is now no longer a statutory body but an advisory council to the Department does not actually hold water, because even the statutory body was subject to the decision of the Minister. In actual fact there is therefore a different designation, but the work continues uninterrupted, and all four provinces are drawn into this. For this reason I also want to ask for the co-operation of the provinces, just as I asked for the cooperation of industry. We want to effect liaison with the provinces; we want to consult them. In fact, we neither wish to, nor could we easily undertake the planning of South Africa without full consultation with the administrators in most of these matters.</p>

<p>I should now like to address a word to the Bantu of South Africa, because they are involved in this.</p>

The hinterland of the financially strong Bantu is his homeland. Let him take his money&#x2014;R10, R10,000 or R1,000, and let him initiate the development of home industries in his homeland. Let him take with him some Bantu who have already been trained to a certain extent here in the metropolitan area, and go there and build not merely a home industry but a home nation which can bring about its national self-determination in its own milieu.

There is not one Bantu homeland of which one cannot point out the borders exactly nowadays. One could go there on foot or on horseback and point out the borders to anybody who wanted to know. The borders need not be defined. Let me also say this to the Bantu: The fact of the matter is that in his own homeland a better job will be available to him; there will be greater opportunities for him. The Bantu in South Africa must realize that his greatest benefit lies within his own national context, and for that reason, just as I asked the industries to help us to implement this legislation, I also say to the Bantu of South Africa that this measure is in his and in our interests. Here in South Africa, under the policy of separate development, there will be a place, as there is at present, for every man, irrespective of his colour, but it will not be in a society of integration such as that sought by the United Party; it will be a society of separate development and peace.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we shall carry through this policy, even if we have to drag the United Party along, and it is becoming easier to drag them along. When I left for London there were 53 of them; to-day there are only 39, and after the next election there will be even fewer of them, because the policy of separate development is a success and because it is accepted more and more. Now that I have addressed a word to the industrialists and also to the Bantu, I also want to address a word to the people who have been placed to act as legislators. We see the road very clearly. We are not under-estimating the problem of the establishment of border industries and home industries, but we are not getting cold feet. It can be done and it will be done. And do you know what will happen&#x003F; Some days ago those hon. members boasted that the Good Hope factory, which is not a border industry, was theirs, and in exactly the same way they will boast of this policy of ours in future. We shall pursue this policy of separate development to its full consequences, white man&#x2019;s country and black man&#x2019;s countries, here <span class="col_6787-6788" refersTo="page_0655"/>in Southern Africa, and let me just tell hon. members this: Perhaps they do not realize it, but by coincidence to-day is the 26th of May, and 19 years ago this National Party came into power. I just want to place this legislation in its correct perspective. On 26th May, 1948, the hon. member for Umlazi was still a &#x201C;royalist&#x201D;, but to-day I am grateful to say that he accepts the Republic as we all accept it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As the National Party accepts it, it is also accepted by the United Party, and we are grateful that they are doing so. But 19 years ago this Government came into power. [Interjection.] Under the leadership of Dr. Malan apartheid was then made an actuality, but that was not enough. There was apartheid on our stations and in our trains, things which are now called petty apartheid by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, and to-day we have no points of friction in that respect. Afterwards, under the leadership of the late Advocate Strijdom, political apartheid came into being, and then the hon. member said that we had driven the Bantu representatives from this House.</p>

<p>I now want to ask him whether he wants those representatives back. That was the road we followed, and then Dr. Verwoerd came and brought separate development to reality. Separate development is not an experiment, and this legislation before the House is not an experiment. It is an accomplished fact in South Africa and it must be expanded. Dr. Verwoerd made separate development an accomplished fact and to-day the present Prime Minister has given the green light to this legislation. Whether we want to know it or not, we young ones, with the influence of the older ones, will go much further along this road of separate development than ever before. Let there be no doubt about that. Whether it is industry which is involved or politics, and whether it is farm labour or anything else, there is only one end and that is the full consequences of separate development. We shall not shirk that, and because we do not shirk it the numbers on this side of the House will become larger and the hon. members on the opposite side will become fewer and fewer. The writing is on the wall. Your numbers may perhaps not shrink as much as they did in the past, because something which is tiny cannot become much smaller. But because we have to go further along this road, I want to add that even more will be asked. Other concerns will be asked to make their contributions. I want to say this to-day. If we find that the Bantu labour of not only industry but also other concerns in the metropolitan areas must be reduced, it will be done for the sake of the implementation of our policy of separate development. Furthermore, if it is necessary, and I foresee that it is going to become necessary, that we should do more in respect of the encouragement of border industries, then it will have to be done in the interests of the entire South Africa. The fact of the matter is that we must necessarily meet the demands of the times here in South Africa, and those demands are to find a home here in Southern Africa for the many nations here, on the principle of separate development. We shall do that.</p>

<p>Finally I just want to address one word to the Opposition. I think it is the duty of the Opposition to help us build and not to obstruct us.</p>

But it is also true that the editor of the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> and the people who work there must inevitably, as a result of their physical presence, drink at the fountain of history. They live in that border area, that area which in the past was used for negotiations to preserve peace between Black and White, and that area which we are now going to use not only for negotiations but for the establishment of industries, in order that white man and black man may live side by side in peace. In an editorial this newspaper says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6789-6790" refersTo="page_0656"/>The people of the Border, Black and White, ask nothing more to-day than that the Government accept an historic responsibility. Irrespective of the ideological persuasion of different Governments, this responsibility has always existed and it is no fault of the Nationalist Government that progress has been so slow. But this Government&#x2019;s insistence on separate development demands that it acts now. It would be seriously at fault if it does not. The choice is peace and plenty and a chance of success in its partition plans, or hunger and hatred and catastrophic failure.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we started off by considering the terms of this Bill but ever since lunch we have been listening to a speech while not being quite sure whether it came from the Minister of Planning, or the Minister of Bantu Administration or the Prime Minister. [Interjections.] It is common knowledge, Sir, that where a man does not have a good case to present he ranges as widely as possible so as to obscure the real weakness of the case he is putting up. As far as this is concerned, I do not think anybody could have covered as wide a field with as much eloquence as the hon. the Minister did this morning and this afternoon. The Minister in this House a day or two ago said that somebody told him in London that I did not smile very often. Well, that may be so, but I certainly cannot find anything to smile about either in this Bill or in the case which the Minister has put up in connection with it. The hon. the Minister has used some extraordinary phrases to-day. He repeatedly said that he was proud of this particular piece of legislation and that he considered it to be the most positive piece of industrial legislation ever brought into this House. Well, if one considers that this Government has been in power for nearly 20 years, it seems to me to be rather a reflection on his Government when he says that this is the first piece of positive industrial legislation they have brought forward. I suppose what he really meant was that he wondered why he was not put into the Cabinet 20 years ago. The main theme of the speech of the hon. the Minister, if you divest it from its divergencies, was the necessity for proper economic planning for the country. All the arguments he used flow from that. But about that there is no difference of opinion at all&#x2014;neither is there any difference of opinion, having regard to the very rapid development that has taken place since the war, that this particular problem is more difficult than it would have been had that development taken place under normal conditions. What we have got to consider this afternoon is this Bill and the question whether this Bill is going to assist and improve that planning. This Bill is called the Physical and Utilization of Resources Bill. By the way, I have always found myself rather puzzled by the titles given by this Government to its Bills. Very often I find them to be extremely misleading. Well, the title of this particular Bill is one of the most misleading titles. I think a better title would have been &#x201C;a Bill for the coercion of industry&#x201D;. The Minister made no bones about it that industry was going to do in future what it was told to do&#x2014;for the good of the country of course, or of what the Minister thinks is the good of the country.</p>

<p>In the light of the Minister&#x2019;s enthusiasm for this Bill and in the light of the good intentions he expressed towards industry&#x2014;because he said that industry was a necessary part of the economy and appealed for its co-operation, which in actual fact means &#x201C;to do what they are told&#x201D;&#x2014;I wonder why he did not call this Bill a &#x201C;Bill to free the economy of the country from the shackles of free enterprise&#x201D;. [Interjections.] We have listened to the Minister putting up his case but we have listened in vain for any indication that the policies he adumbrated were really leading this country towards the goal which he so ardently desired. The only conclusion we can come to in regard to this Bill is that after all the speeches that have been made it really boils down to an attempt to bolster up the Government&#x2019;s racial policy, a policy with which we, of course, do not agree. Having read the Bill very carefully and having studied it and after having listened to the hon. the Minister I still think this is a bad Bill. Furthermore, I think it is still not going to achieve its object even with the incredibly able assistance of the administration of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. [Interjections.] In attempting to make this succeed, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration may very well wreck the entire economy of the country. Mr. Speaker, I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Bill because it. <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) seeks to place in the hands of the Minister complete and unfettered control of the use of land, labour and industrial development in the country;</li>

<li>(2) destroys the established machinery in Act 51 of 1947 as amended by Act 30 of 1955, which provides for full consultation with the various authorities and the concurrence of the Administrators concerned in the establishment of controlled areas; and</li>

<li>(3) places further unnecessary restrictionson the normal economic development of the country&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_6791-6792" refersTo="page_0657"/>Sir, the Minister was quite frank in his speech in saying that this Bill was the only way, in his opinion, to deal with this particular problem and that this Bill gave him a number of new powers&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I think he said ten new powers and 11 old ones, most of them under the Natural Resources Development Act, under which the Minister, whilst having residuary power, was by no means unrestricted. As far as the tendency is concerned let us just have a look at the powers which the hon. the Minister is seeking. The key word in this Bill is compulsion, although the word compulsion is never actually used. Right throughout the Bill the Minister may act within his discretion, he may act as he thinks fit and he has unfettered powers. That is the position despite repeated assurances which were given by that side of the House, by the late Prime Minister, by other Ministers, prior to the arrival on the scene of the present one, namely that industry would not be subject to compulsion by this Government. I am not sure, and I am speaking subject to correction, whether the hon. the Deputy Minister had not also given some assurance to that effect too in his time. It is important to bear that in mind because the Minister on several occasions this morning and this afternoon has given more assurances. And in view of those repeated assurances which we had on this particular subject and the fact that we are now faced with this Bill, surely the hon. the Minister will agree that the wealth of assurances coming from that side of the House means precisely nothing.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has been a member of this House long enough to know that I am not being personal. Now let us look at these clauses to which the hon. the Minister referred very gently. Let us take clause 2, which deals with the question of town planning. In future no town plan may be approved without the written approval of the Minister if it has an industrial area. And that, for practical purposes, means all town planning. These days all town planning of any size has a corner for industrial development. No subdivision may any longer be made and no industrial townships may be established. When we go to clause 3 we see that no person may establish a factory, either in a proclaimed area or outside of it without the written permission of the Minister. And if such permission is given it can be given by way of a permit as the hon. the Minister has said. I want to give him his due that he has not tried to conceal anything. The permit probably will be a conditional permit saying how big the factory could be, what it can make and how many people it could employ. It can also lay down the class of factory.</p>

<p>And there will be no extension.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, certainly, because you might want to sell the factory and then somebody else may want to make something else. He will then have to get another permit. And that will be refused. Clause 4 prescribes the specific purpose for which land can be used. That means land anywhere. In other words, the hon. the Minister will have power to lay down the use of land which then may not be used for any purpose other than what he says. Clause 5 deals with the controlled areas. Here the Minister has conceded that he will consult with the Administrator of the province concerned. But once the area is controlled there can be no subdivision and no use can be made of any land within that area other than the use empowered by the proclamation, unless the Minister approved of it. Then of course there are exemptions as mentioned by the Minister. The Minister has all these unfettered powers, except in the one case where he has to consult with the Administrator. And we know what consultation means.</p>

<p>In the next clause we have the power of exemption, so that the hon. the Minister, whoever he happens to be, having laid down all these conditions, and having placed all these restrictions, could exempt anybody he pleases at any time for any reason. What is even worse, he could delegate those powers to officials of his Department all over the country, and they can then act on his behalf. This seems to me to be a most dangerous thing to do because one may get a variety of decisions all over the country. In any case, these enormous powers may be delegated by the Minister to various officials throughout the country. In other words, this Bill, which the hon. the Minister says is quite essential for the future safeguarding of white civilization in South Africa, is really proclaiming something very much like martial law in the economic life of the country with the hon. the Minister as field-marshal-in-chief or the general dictator. Is it any wonder that industry and commerce and other interests concerned such as local authorities were alarmed&#x003F; What became of this talk of free enterprise&#x003F; The hon. the Minister who used to be Minister of Planning and who now sits in front of the present Minister, spoke about free enterprise, that we had a free economy and that this Government believes in a system of free enterprise. Nobody used to say it, but that is what he says now. And what is left of free enterprise when a Minister is going to have the powers which are going to be handed over to this Minister in this Bill&#x003F; Now we come to the repeal of Act No. 51 of 1947 in clause 14, to which the hon. the Minister referred. I was surprised that the hon. the Minister made no reference at all to any work which has been done during the last 20 years under that Act. Because, as a matter of fact, apart from the officials concerned under the terms of that Act, there has been an enormous amount of voluntary work done by people all over the country helping to implement that Act. I think that the Act has done extremely useful work&#x2014;not that I would <span class="col_6793-6794" refersTo="page_0658"/>like to suggest that it is a perfect piece of legislation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>My predecessor did so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minster&#x2019;s predecessor did not repeal the Act. I will come in a minute to what has been done since. That Act aimed at the decentralization of industry by developing various areas in the country as economic units, whether it be industrial areas or agricultural areas. As far as possible it aimed at the development of economic units and included primary, secondary and tertiary industries as well, after full examination of the area. There was a council of nine, one appointed by each Administrator and five by the Government on account of their business ability and their knowledge of regional planning. Their function was to advise the Minister after full consultation with all the many authorities concerned, and to consider the development of the scheme. There have been schemes under that system which I think have worked extremely well. In addition to that, subsidiary committees could be appointed. There were also regional committees for each controlled area, one to be appointed by the Administrator concerned and four by the Minister. The whole approach of the 1947 Act to this question of decentralizing, and developing undeveloped areas on an economic scale, was by consultation, co-operation, and agreement with all concerned. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that in those negotiations co-operation was obtained. The machinery existed for it. Now in this Bill all that is swept away. What is left of the Act is administered by the Department. What will remain of consultation will be at the discretion of the hon. the Minister. Everything will be vested in the Minister himself. It will depend entirely on him what consultation and what measure of co-operation there will be and in how far the whole matter will be undertaken in unison by all those concerned. I do not think that anything can highlight more clearly the difference in approach between us and the Government than this Bill. On the one hand we have the democratic method of consultation, co-operation and agreement, which might be a little slower than dictatorship, but we believe that it would be a much healthier foundation on which to build a sound economy.</p>

<p>I am not insinuating anything. I am making a statement. On the other hand with the method of the side on which that hon. member sits, far from the democratic method, we simply have regimentation by the State and direction and dictation from Pretoria. I do not think that anything highlights that difference of approach more clearly than the repealing of this Act and the introduction of the system which the hon. the Minister now wishes to start in regard to this matter. The hon. the Minister put up a case which I did not find at all convincing in regard to the consultation which had taken place on this Bill. I am not satisfied, from what the hon. the Minister said, that organized industry or organized commerce or the Social and Economic Planning Council, which is the senior body in the country advising the Government on these matters, or the Administrators, for that matter, had a full opportunity of examining this Bill or its implications and putting forward their views, and discussing it with their own people. They may have been shown the Bill. I am sure that they have been shown the Bill now, but I think most of them probably only saw the Bill recently, or they may have heard rumblings about it. They certainly had more than rumblings. They had blarings from the hon. the Deputy Minister that legislation was coming, and so on and so forth. As far as the actual terms of the Bill were concerned, and the actual intentions of the Government, I do not believe that full consultation really took place with the people most concerned and most affected by it. The question arises: Are these restrictions really necessary or desirable&#x003F; I am not prepared to say now that some restrictions are not necessary, but if they are, is this the right way to go about it&#x003F; It is quite clear, and it became more and more clear the longer the hon. the Minister spoke, that the object of this Bill is primarily not physical planning, but the furtherance of the Government&#x2019;s race policy and the pursuit of the development of the border areas and the border industries. Why it should be necessary is not quite clear, because in the reports of the Permanent Committee on the Location of Industries, the reports of the Industrial Development Corporation and the speeches which have been made by the junior Ministers on that side of the House connected with the Department of Bantu Administration, we are told that the development of the border areas is going ahead apace. It is a great success and is one of the most successful things that this Government has done. If that is the case, it is not very clear why it is necessary to bring in this devastating Bill, giving these powers to the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister is not satisfied with his own success. On that I agree with him. I fully agree with the Government and the hon. Minister, that the hon. the Minister was fully entitled, although I do not know whether it was the right occasion to do it, to have the strongest views on the race policies to be followed. The Government is fully entitled to further that policy. They have a mandate from the country to pursue that policy. Let us concede that. But that does not mean that this Bill is <span class="col_6795-6796" refersTo="page_0659"/>necessarily right. Let us consider what we are doing here. The hon. the Minister talked about decentralization, not only as far as the Bantu are concerned, but as far as the platteland is concerned. It is needed to repopulate the depopulated areas, and to open up new areas. But decentralization is taking place. The hon. the Minister talks as if decentralization is a new idea. The 1947 Act started decentralization and it has been going on ever since. It may not have been going as fast as we would have liked, but it is going on. The machinery exists. The physical planning and development exist. We are opening up new industrial areas. The Government has very wide powers. Goodness knows the concessions which are being made to attract the industries to the border areas are wide enough. The Industrial Development Corporation, which has invested many millions of rands in border industries, and the Act which we are at present being asked to repeal, have very wide powers indeed. If they are not sufficient, let us improve them by all means, and let us supplement them. Let us make them as perfect as we can. I do not think that the hon. the Minister in his enthusiasm for his race policies really conceives of the importance of the factors with which he is dealing. He is dealing here with secondary industry.</p>

<p>Sir, there have been speeches made on that side of the House during this Session, repeatedly, emphasizing that secondary industry must be geared up, that it must be helped and encouraged to take the place eventually of the gold-mining industry which will eventually dwindle and no longer hold the place in our economy that it did before, in order to be the mainstay of the country&#x2019;s economy and to develop a large export trade. That has been said in speeches made on that and this side of the House from time to time. To-day secondary industry is the second most important pillar of our economic life. The time will come when it will be the most important pillar. When we remember the statements which have been made in this House and which were very nearly repeated by the hon. the Minister to-day to the effect that if economic laws clash with ideology then they must be bent and even broken, is it any wonder that secondary industry is alarmed&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>That statement was made by the hon. the Minister sitting in front of him, the Minister of Finance. Sir, considering the importance and the future importance of secondary industry to this country, surely before action of this sort is taken, action which affects them so closely&#x2014;the fact that it does affect them closely is reflected in the explanation which the hon. the Minister quite rightly felt obliged to give&#x2014;they were entitled to be consulted and to be asked to discuss the question. The hon. the Minister this afternoon made an appeal to industry to help. To my mind that appeal should have been made before, instead of which industry in this Bill is being presented with a big stick. I think it is being treated with scant consideration and almost with contempt. Sir, that is not the way to get co-operation as the hon. the Minister will find not only in this instance but generally as he goes on. Industry and the local authorities have always co-operated with the Government of the day. They have raised objections from time to time but on broad lines they have always been prepared to co-operate with the Government of the day in the national interest and there is no reason to suppose that they will not be prepared to co-operate now. I believe that this Bill is fundamentally the wrong approach to get that co-operation and assistance which the Minister must have if his ideas are going to succeed. As it is, Sir, this Bill has been introduced at very short notice. It is being pushed through the House without proper consultation or consideration of its possible effects. In my opinion it has been drafted by officials who quite rightly and quite naturally were interested in implementing the Government&#x2019;s race policies, without considering the wider issue that it is going to disturb industry very seriously and that it is going to shake the confidence of overseas investors in our economy, especially as this Bill contains such draconian new principles.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<p>I think that when this Bill is studied by people who are thinking of investing money in industry in this country it will make them think very seriously as to whether they can safely do so. In my opinion this Bill is hasty; I think it is wrong and unsound in principle, and considering the importance of the subject, I think it has been drafted without having any regard to the much wider issues involved, and I believe that the hon. the Minister, if he were wise, would withdraw this Bill for much further consideration and much more intensive and complete examination, calling in all the people who are interested on the basis that this is what the Government wants to do, invoking their assistance and working out a thorough plan for the whole country, a plan which will fall into line with the basic ideas of the Government. I think that is much more likely to achieve the Minister&#x2019;s objectives than this Bill, which I foresee will fail in its objectives, will cause great trouble in industry and will end up by failing to achieve the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s objectives, and the end will be worse than the beginning.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, before I deal with the Bill, would you permit me to express my thanks and appreciation this afternoon to those industries in South Africa which have for the last few decades had so much confidence in the country and in the policy of the Government that, without asking questions, they continued to manufacture in this country articles for which there was a great need in South Africa. Those industries have undoubtedly been a major asset to the entire economy of our country, and not only do they deserve the gratitude of the Government, but also that of the nation as a whole, because up to the time South Africa started developing industrially, it was a very poor country. If we take into account what is being manufactured in South Africa, at present, not only for local use but also for export, then we can only pay homage to those particular industrialists. I wish we could say that about all manufacturers and all bodies in South Africa which have been concerned with the economy of our country. However, unfortunately we cannot say that about all of them, and that is one of the major reasons for our having to introduce a Bill of this nature to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I take as much pride in this Bill as does the hon. the Minister. I think that in the course of time the whole country will realize fully that this Bill was one of the most important measures the Government was called upon to place on the Statute Book. On a few occasions in our country there has been a tremendous rush in the economic sphere, and at present we are once again experiencing a terrible rush. If we take into consideration what is being said abroad and what is being planned in this country, we must prepare ourselves for a tremendous new rush, particularly in the sphere of industry. It is because we are aware of that major rush that we consider a measure such as this one to be imperative. When we develop industrially and employ labour from our neighbouring states, we must also accept this fact once and for all, namely that South Africa should display a form of proportionality to the various Bantu neighbouring states which are still being governed under our trusteeship to-day. We must cause justice and fairness to be done to them. If we do not apply this measure, it may happen that some of the Bantu homelands are given more preference by certain industrialists, with the result that thousands are employed in certain industries, but that other Bantu who are just as dependent upon work, are neglected. That is one of the things we must face.</p>

<p>When I talk about this rush, I want to point out two major rushes we have had in this country in the economic field. In passing I am thinking of the rush in connection with the diggings at Lichtenburg in 1926. There was no control and within a short while the whole place was swamped. There were no fewer than 105,000 diggers, with the result that the greatest chaos prevailed and major disruption took place. We had another rush in the days when diamonds were discovered at Kimberley, and since there was no planning you should have seen the way Kimberley looked when the mining magnates had finished with it. At present it is once again being rebuilt as a model city, but the burden of rebuilding that city has been placed on the shoulders of the taxpayers and the Government. At present there are indications of another tremendous rush. We see that abroad. We heard what Mr. Johnson said in England the other day, and that man is not a supporter of the Government, but as a result of what he said, we shall now have the greatest rush of industrialists and capitalists in South Africa, greater than the greatest optimist in the world could ever have imagined. But that is not all. When one observes the industrial development in South Africa over the past few decades, and when one listens to what is being said by certain people abroad, not as Government agents but as people who have gained experience of South African conditions concerning industries, then we must prepare ourselves for a rush that will surpass everything we have experienced in the past. That is why I think that we need hardly confine ourselves to the clauses of the Bill to prove the necessity thereof. We can only confine ourselves, as the Minister did, to the motivation thereof, and when one talks about the motivation one can, in spite of the excellent speech the hon. the Minister has made, continue talking until to-morrow in pointing out how essential this measure is. But before I go any further, Sir, I shall, with your permission, deal with some of the arguments that are being used by people who are trying to tell the Opposition how they should act, who are calling the tune and telling the Opposition how to dance to it. I must say that the Opposition is very faithfully trying to dance to the tune that is being called. I have here the document which came into the possession of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry yesterday, and I should like to make the acquaintance of the schoolboy who drafted it, because if one were to examine the arguments that are to be found in it, one finds that it is nothing but purely the work of a schoolboy conducting an ordinary debate. Look at paragraph 3. There they refer to what the hon. the Prime Minister is supposed to have said, and I am just quoting what they quoted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Experience has shown that the process of decentralization must make provision for the establishment of industrial development centres &#x2026; rather than trying to scatter industries over too wide an area.</block>

<p>Here they are quoting these words to substantiate their own arguments, but if one takes these quoted words, one must in fact warn against the danger that any factory cannot <span class="col_6799-6800" refersTo="page_0661"/>merely be established in any part of the country, because it will not be desirable. They conclude by saying that no coercive measures will be applied so as to force industrialists to establish themselves in the border areas. But of course not, and the Minister said so very clearly, and the Government, too, has repeatedly said that they will not be forced, just as little as one can force a horse to drink when one takes him to the water. But when the opportunities offered there are made favourable for border industries, there will be no need for coercive measures to be taken so as to get industrialists to establish themselves there. They will be lured by the favourable conditions that will be created there. Therefore we are simply emphasizing once again that no coercive measures will be taken, because it will be absolutely unnecessary to do so. Do you think that an industrialist will allow his money to go to waste if he sees that there are favourable opportunities for him, as well as the labour about which they are always so concerned&#x003F; Do you think that he will then refuse to do so&#x003F; If a person is hungry, he will eat, and that is simply the policy; there will be no need for us to force them. Then, in paragraph (a) of their White Paper, their plea continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill is an enabling measure with extensive terms of reference and powers, and does not make any provision for criteria whereby entrepreneurs may be given guidance in their decisions on matters of policy &#x2026; No provision is being made for detailed investigations in which practical businessmen may participate.</block>

<p>But that is refuted by clause 4 of the Bill. As the hon. the Minister said very explicitly today, this is not only the object of clause 4, but it is also the object that there will be the closest co-operation, that there will be the greatest measure of guidance and that there will be the greatest measure of advice and reciprocal consultation, but here the hon. gentlemen come along and claim that no provision is being made for detailed investigations. These hon. gentlemen are talking about detailed investigations, but the things they want to know are things that are already known. The Government has every possible aspect at its finger tips and can furnish them with all the necessary information. But the hon. gentlemen proceeded so amateurishly that one wonders whether one should take any notice of this document. Sometimes it appears to me that this is nothing but leg-pulling. In paragraph (c) of their White Paper they refer to what they want to learn from other national economies, from other countries. The document says&#x2014;&#x201C;Experience in other national economies shows that high rates of growth go hand in hand with maximum economic freedom.&#x201D; I repeat: &#x2026; go hand in hand with maximum economic freedom&#x201D;. Here they are taught a lesson by other economies, but they forget about it later, because in section 6 we find them saying, &#x201C;No, the Government is making a mistake, the Minister is making a mistake, because &#x2018;sometimes justification for the proposed Bill is sought in other countries where it has been found necessary to apply a system of licensing&#x2019;.&#x201D; There they forget what they wrote earlier on. First they say that one learns this and that and the following in countries abroad, but later on, as I am pointing out, they blame the Government by saying that it should not put into practice what it has learned from countries abroad, because that is supposed to be wrong. Can it be taken amiss of me if I say that the hon. gentlemen who drafted this little document, were probably not very serious&#x003F; Years ago the then Leader of the Opposition said that the late Minister Havenga was under the influence of new wine when he made certain statements during the Budget debate. But it seems to me as though in this respect somebody is under the influence of new wine&#x2014;the Chamber of Commerce is impressed by this [Interjections.] That was the Leader of the Opposition, and I am merely repeating the words he used in respect of a previous Minister of Finance. Not one point was made here, nor was there any attempt at making such a point, to which the hon. the Minister has not replied in anticipation to-day. I want to quote another point from this document. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be in keeping with the opinion expressed by the commission of inquiry into the policy relating to the protection of industries, namely that the development of the modern economy requires that in general there should be no dispute between private undertakings and the public policy.</block>

<p>Who causes the dispute&#x003F; If the Minister and the Government have up to now acted with the greatest measure of consultation and leniency towards them at all times, who then is looking for a dispute&#x003F; Who is looking for a dispute if they are already making a public protest in anticipation&#x003F; Who is looking for a dispute if the Leader of the Opposition is conditioned into making certain remarks about this measure, such as he made in the newspaper the other day when, of course, he made his usual hash of things instead of confining himself to the significance of this Bill&#x003F; Who is looking for a dispute&#x003F; Let me address a few words to the industrialists. I emphasize and endorse every word the hon. the Minister said in this regard, when he said that this practice among industrialists of looking for disputes with the Government was absolutely unnecessary. Industrialists should not regard themselves as agents for certain political parties in this country, because the Government has consistently acted as impartially towards industrialists as one could only wish for. Now the industrialists allow themselves to be used by certain political bodies to object to a measure such as this one. I am very sorry to have to say this, but I have never encountered such a measure of organized political opposition <span class="col_6801-6802" refersTo="page_0662"/>that resulted in a fiasco, as the opposition we have been experiencing in connection with this so-called protest. I think that if the friendly words of the Minister were to fall on the ears of favourably disposed industrialists, then they would realize that this measure ought to be the greatest blessing for them. I agree with the hon. the Minister that this is the first absolutely positive step taken in South Africa to set a definite course for our future industrial development. What does the hon. member for Constantia propose&#x003F; What do the industrialists propose&#x003F; When one drives a car at a reasonable speed, one would be very eager to maintain that speed. That is the object of this Bill. The Bill seeks to maintain a consistent rate of industrial development. We should not&#x2014;as the Opposition and the said industrialists are advocating&#x2014;let go of the steering wheel and simply accelerate, because how long will one last then&#x003F; How long will South Africa be able to maintain its prosperity&#x003F; How long will we be able to maintain this sound industrial prosperity if, for example, we simply let go of the wheel and accelerate&#x003F; That will inevitably lead to an uncontrollable situation. I say that if we do not intervene, conditions in our metropolitan areas will become absolutely uncontrollable, not only for the Central Government, but also for the local authorities, because industrialists are driving city councils mad in those areas. Let me give an example. Last year, in one of the rapidly developing areas on the Witwatersrand, a certain industrialist told the town clerk in question that he wanted to establish a factory in that area. The town clerk then expressed his pleasure. Subsequent to that the industrialist told him that he would require 400 Bantu labourers and 100 white workers. Consequently the town clerk asked him where the 400 Bantu, whom he wanted next morning, were to come from. And what was his reply&#x003F; &#x201C;Oh, I thought you had them here!&#x201D; Then the town clerk asked, &#x201C;Who is supposed to supply them to you&#x003F; Where are they supposed to live&#x003F;&#x201D; Only then did the industrialist start giving thought to the matter. Then he realized that he was making his calculations quite one-sidedly: In making his calculations, he did not take into account what would happen to other bodies, how they would fit in with his plans; no, he thinks in terms of himself only.</p>

<p>If the Government did perhaps make a mistake in the past, then it is that the Government made the situation too favourable because it left industrialists under the impression that everything, yes, the entire nation, the taxpayers, everybody, had to be laid on the altar just for them. Those people only thought in terms of the factory itself. That is why I say that in the past the Government was perhaps somewhat at fault in this respect&#x2014;I am saying this openly and nobody can take it amiss of me. The Government provided large numbers of houses instead of telling them at that stage already that they had to provide their own accommodation for the labourers. They should have been told to provide their own houses, and then&#x2014;as the hon. the Deputy Minister pointed out here the other day&#x2014;they would have said &#x201C;No, I do not need as much Bantu labour as I thought!&#x201D; Because then they wake up for the first time. When there is talk of expansion, the town councils in question should be consulted in respect of Bantu labour, white labour, housing, water, transport and all those things. If there is no planning in respect of all these aspects, it must lead to chaos. It is one of the wonders of our time that it has not already led to more extensive disruption. That is why I think that within a few years, after this measure has been enacted, when it will be viewed in its right perspective, when the town councils and the Government Departments will be able to give guidance as to where what industries may develop, we shall have a pattern in South Africa which will enable us to keep the rate of our industrial development even and consistent. This development should not be allowed to take place at such a rate that it will inevitably lead to a frenzy or the total ruin of our industries and a collapse of the civilized conditions we are enjoying in South Africa at present. If we do not accept this measure, and we are already making provision for Bantu from foreign states to work in our mining industry, and if we allow this tremendous industrial potential to develop without our controlling these matters, then, when we want to control them eventually, it may be too late. For instance, I am thinking back to the time, years ago, when Dr. Verwoerd intervened when the industrialists acted irresponsibly. I think that that is the greatest argument we can bring in against them. At that time they established factories and more factories, and they did not care two hoots about where those people had to live. Then we found those shanty towns. Were they concerned about it then&#x003F; Did they tell the Government, &#x201C;We shall solve those problems ourselves,&#x201D; as they are trying to suggest now&#x003F; No, they aggravated them so that they were almost insurmountable. If we were to continue in future as we are at present, it would simply mean that, in spite of anti-inflationary measures, we should merely have to continue with that terrible rush and sacrifice everything and simply continue to build houses to allow the industrialists to increase that rate further. Can one tolerate such a thing without being exposed to a serious accusation from the country&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister also emphasized this matter of how, in spite of any possible criticism and any contradiction, we are intent on controlling our economy in South Africa in such a way that it may serve the purposes of the welfare of the nation. This was said here one day by no less a person than the late Mr. Strijdom in his capacity as Prime Minister. We shall always emphasize and reply to that with a positive &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. All measures relating to industrial development must function within the framework of national prosperity. We should not create the slightest opportunity for national prosperity to be laid upon the altar and to be sacrificed for <span class="col_6803-6804" refersTo="page_0663"/>the sake of one group, namely the industrialists. There was a time when it was said that industries could not develop in South Africa. There was a time in the past when it was said that South Africa would not develop into an industrial country. To-day we have to hear, as I read out to you a moment ago from what Mr. Johnson said, that the development which is taking place here is unparalleled in our times and that it is still the most attractive to-day. When one deals with this absolute gem and this unique position of South Africa, it will be a sin which will even affect generations to come if the Government did not concentrate on making sure that matters developed and were controlled correctly from the very start. That is why I think that at this stage the Opposition should not lend itself, as it did in the past, to objecting to a measure which they know only too well to be one that cannot be anything but a major blessing for South Africa. They are trying to break it and to have it withdrawn, as they say in their amendment, because it grants too much control. If one keeps on asking the Opposition, they will tell one that they are in favour of control over this and that, but they are always in favour of control over certain things only, which is not adequate. They are always in favour of such control over matters as suits them. But when we want to apply control measures in such a way that it will enable the Government to achieve the objects of its policy, they are opposed to them. That is why I think that in his speech this afternoon and in the way he set it out, the hon. the Minister led us once again to new horizons in regard to the application of the policy of separate development. Let industrialists learn once and for all, and let the Opposition learn once and for all, that the attitude we adopt is that the dividing line will gradually be drawn deeper and broader. We shall gradually promote the separation. As we are able to carry this out systematically, the Bantu will gradually be removed to their homelands, when those homelands will afford them a means of livelihood, when those homelands will be in a position to carry them, and once South Africa has developed industrially to such an extent that it can provide the major part of its white labourers with employment. Only on that basis shall we succeed in designing here a pattern for the future, and in allowing a pattern to develop here, a pattern which will be of such a nature &#x2026;</p>

For instance, if one wants to reach Johannesburg at a certain time, one knows how far one still has to travel, and then one knows how fast one should drive. If one is behind schedule, one knows that one has to drive a little faster, and then one increases one&#x2019;s speed a little.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think we need take the hon. member for Krugersdorp very seriously. In 1947 the hon. member for Constantia, in his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs, introduced the Natural Resources Development Bill. The hon. member for Krugersdorp was one of those who spoke against it. This is what he said (Hansard, volume 61, column 5315):</p>

<block name="quote">I will fight this tendency of the Government to create more and more boards and grant more and more powers to bureaucrats. Especially when we are dealing with the property of citizens, even though I may be the last man in the House to do so. I am not prepared to leave this in the hands of boards on which the people themselves may have no say. I want to give the people the right to appeal to the Assembly and to appear before the Select Committee so that they may say whether they have any objections or not.</block>

<p>The hon. member said this on the 22nd May, 1947, just over 20 years ago. This Bill is a confession of failure on the part of the Government. In 1948 this Government was returned to rule in this country. They said they were going to turn back the tide of Blacks in the cities and send them back to the farms and the reserves. Later they introduced inducements to border industries. These inducements failed. Now they are applying compulsory measures to place industry in a strait jacket. This measure will fail too. The hon. member for Constantia has called this Bill the coercion of industry. But I think he could as well have called it the Bill for the Regimentation of Bantu Labour Units. That is its objective. It is negative in its approach and this is the great weakness of the Bill. When it is negative in its approach, one cannot calculate the cost. When it is positive in approach, it is possible to calculate it. Had it offered inducements to industries staying in certain areas, one could have measured the cost. But this is negative in its approach. The whole object of this Bill, despite the talk about planning, is to ensure that the Bantu go back to the reserves. The Minister in his opening remarks dealt with the 1947 legislation. The Natural Resources Development Bill which was introduced by the member for Constantia had as its objective the planning ideal. In principle, we agree with planning on a basis of consultation as set out in the Bill of 1947. But times have changed since then. In March of this year the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration addressed the Federated Chamber of Industries, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="col_6805-6806" refersTo="page_0664"/>He did not particularly want to talk politics, but the fact remained that this was a political question. Industry could not divorce itself from the political setup in South Africa and carry on in a vacuum of its own. This would be very dangerous. The political fact to-day was that the white population were the political bosses in the Republic today, and they would not allow the overconcentration of Bantu in urban areas. Was it thought possible to keep the Bantu in these areas forever without giving them political rights&#x003F;</p>

<p>This is the minutes of the meeting when he addressed the Chamber of Industries:</p>

<p>It was essential to look at wider issues than just the interests of industry. The present Government did not look upon the Republic as a multi-racial nation, but as a multi-national nation. Eventually the Bantu would have to have political rights, and it was therefore desirable to undertake long-term planning for 50-100 years hence, so as to lay down a foundation where the Bantu could have their own political rights. That was the direction in which the Government was working. The Deputy Minister said that decentralization could not be done only on a voluntary basis. It had not been possible to do it on a voluntary basis in England, France and Italy.</p>

<p>I shall come to that later on. But he went on:</p>

<p>Industrialists should not fear that any intending legislation would work like a &#x201C;bull in a china shop&#x201D;. Although his department had pressed for such legislation, in fact it was being handled by the Department of Planning.</p>

<p>Obviously he was regarded as &#x201C;the bull in the china shop&#x201D; and it was handed over to the Minister of Planning to handle it instead. The minutes continued:</p>

<p>He had been unable to give the meeting details of this legislation, as at this stage he was not in possession of all the details. The Deputy Minister said he wanted to assure the meeting that such legislation would be implemented in consultation with organized industry.</p>

<p>But there has been no consultation as regards the Bill. The Prime Minister promised consultation. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, arising from the meeting of the Economic Advisory Council in July, 1960, said that the objects of the Government were to&#x2014;</p>

<p>He went on:</p>

<p>Finally it should be emphasized that the Government&#x2019;s endeavours are directed towards a reconciliation of what is politicosocially desirable with what is economically feasible.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister promised that there would be no prohibition. Instead of prohibition, this Bill is introducing the permit system. The Minister has the right to decide where a factory is going to be situated. The Minister has the right of issuing permits and the factory is defined in the Factory, Machinery and Building Works Act, and that definition is very wide, indeed. Any little industry in any village cannot increase its Bantu staff by one beyond the permit number without a permit from the Minister. Any company coming into South Africa, whatever district they may choose for their factory, whatever negotiations they may have with the local authorities, will not be able to establish that factory until such time as they get Ministerial approval. The permit system is compulsory for every single factory operating. Now look how wide the factory definition is. [Interjections.] Yes, every single factory. Let us examine what factory operations include&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The making of any article or part of any article; the altering, repairing, renovating, ornamenting, painting, sewing, polishing, finishing, cleaning, dyeing, washing, or breaking up of any article.</block>

<p><span class="col_6807-6808" refersTo="page_0665"/>If a little laundry or a garage is established, a permit has to be obtained from Pretoria. A permit from Pretoria is needed for every single activity. Whereas to-day the industrialist chooses his site, purchases his land, makes the arrangements with the local authorities, now there is added the permit system from Pretoria, with all the delays and all the expenses. It means additional costs for establishing industry. If hon. members have any doubt about it, they could make the inquiries and ascertain what the position is to-day, even with building control. If one wants a permit for a building, just see how long it takes to get a building permit. We are going to have the same delays and bureaucratic red tape when applying for a permit, whereas the position to-day is that the industrialists can apply to the local authorities. To-day, in addition, the further application to Pretoria is required. It would have been much easier, of course, if one could get a Nationalist Party member to accompany the industrialist to Pretoria to sort out his difficulties. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This is where the Minister has been ill advised in not consulting the industry. The definition of &#x201C;factory&#x201D; is so wide that virtually every factory, every industrial occupation with more than three persons is covered under the ambit of this Bill. Any occupation which involves the change in form or processing of any article in all parts of South Africa is covered. It is going to stifle industrial development and has the tendency towards increasing industrial costs. There is no opportunity for an industry to present its case. I will come in a moment to the various factors which industry has brought to the notice of the Minister in the memorandum. Surely the Minister must realize that when organized industry and commerce arranged to have a special meeting in Cape Town to discuss this matter, they must have been seriously perturbed. This Bill has been introduced at the last moment at short notice without consultation, and as a result industry fears that it will be placed in a straitjacket. As I say, this is an entirely negative approach and it is going to place industry in a straitjacket. If industry is to grow it must have stability. It must feel that it can develop and change direction without too many obstacles being placed in its way. A permit given to a factory can be withdrawn as easily as it can be given. The opportunity of disposing of a factory and moving elsewhere in order to take advantage of better communications and better markets is also a factor which is going to inhibit the development of industry under this legislation. Sir, the basic fault in the Government&#x2019;s reasoning is that they regard the question of Bantu labour as the dominating factor in the establishment of industry; the other factors are not taken into account. The hon. the Minister read out to us an impressive list of people who will serve on this committee of his, but however impressive that list may be, surely the people who are best qualified to decide where an industry is to be placed, are the industrialists themselves, who have the expert knowledge plus the profit-motive. An industrialist is not going to establish his industry in a place where he is going to lose money. He is going to establish it in a place where it can produce goods at the cheapest cost to ensure that he gets his fair share of the market. That has been the history of the development of industry ever since industries were first established in South Africa. Can you imagine what would have happened if 50 or 60 years ago the permit system had been applied for the establishment of all industries in this country&#x003F; The fact that we have had such great industrial development hitherto, is due mainly to the initiative of the private industrialist, to his capacity to site his factory in the right place, to his capacity to train his labour and to his capacity to ensure that he gets a market not only in this country but a market overseas. Sir, the Government claims the credit for all the industrial development that we have seen right up to the present day; it boasts of the progress that industry has made over the last 20 years. Whenever we find figures of improved industrial development the Government claims the credit for it. Surely if the Government claims the credit for this industrial development, it is adequate proof that this development has been possible without this legislation. What the Government now wants to do is to turn the tide back again. The Government will decide what is good labour; the Government will decide which employees are most suitable.</p>

<p>I do not see the point of the hon. member&#x2019;s stupid question. Hon. members opposite have claimed that this control of industry applies in other parts of the world. I do not think the hon. the Minister was being entirely fair to the House in claiming <span class="col_6809-6810" refersTo="page_0666"/>that there was similar industrial control overseas. He gave the impression&#x2014;and I am afraid it was the wrong impression&#x2014;that the control overseas was the same as that provided for in this Bill. Let us examine what has taken place overseas. I have with me a report from the Ministry of Information Services upon industry in Britain, and this is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A framework of longer term economic planning and consultation has been evolved in recent years within which the aim is for increases in productivity, industrial efficiency, and real incomes to be reconciled with a high and stable level of employment, a favourable balance of payment and the promotion of social justice. As mentioned above, the Department of Economic Affairs has been given the responsibility of framing and supervising the plan for economic development and for the general coordination of action to implement the plan, including, in particular, policies for industry, the regions, incomes and prices, and economic growth. It works with representatives of both sides of industry directly and through the National Economic Development Council.</block>

<p>There is consultation at all levels. There is consultation provided for in the Act. There is no consultation provided for in this Bill, none whatsoever. We have the Ministers&#x2019; assurances but what are they worth&#x003F; We had an assurance from the hon. the Prime Minister that no compulsion was going to be brought to bear on industries to go to the reserves. These assurances have been given in the past, Sir. We like assurances to be written into the Bill. Assurances were provided for very clearly in the 1947 Act. The New Towns Act of 1947 of Great Britain gave the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland power &#x201C;to make an order designating any area of land (which may include any existing town or other centre of population) as the site of a proposed new town, and in 1965 the same power was given to the Secretary of State for Wales&#x201D;. It then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The appropriate Minister must consult the local authorities in and around the area about the proposal. Once the site has been designated, the Minister appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman, a deputy-chairman and up to seven other members) to be responsible for the development of the new town. The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for Wales) to acquire, by agreement or compulsory purchase, land or property within the designated areas, or, in some cases, land near to or outside those areas, and they may provide houses, flats, commercial and industrial premises, estate roads, etc.</block>

<p>They are designated in consultation with the local authorities. Consultation is provided for in the Statutes. That is an entirely different position from the provisions in this Bill. In the case of this Bill we only have the assurance of the hon. the Minister of Planning that there is going to be consultation. In Britain the Act provides for consultation. The Minister there is obliged to consult the local authorities. The same principle applied in our Statutes in 1947. It provided for the principle of consultation. Provision was made for consultation between the Minister, the board that was established and the various local authorities. If the Minister will refer to the 1947 Act which dealt with natural industrial resources he will find that it made adequate provision for consultation, but apart from that it went further; the concurrence of the Administrators had to be obtained. The hon. the Minister, in reply to an interjection by the hon. member for South Coast to-day, referred to the regional planning commission in Natal. Provision was made there for consultation, not only at national level, but for consultation at local level. This Bill denies any consultation at all. It is true that the hon. the Minister stated in the course of his speech that there would be consultation.</p>

<p>The Minister in this Bill is going to introduce the compulsory permit system which, despite all the fine talk about planning, is mainly and basically concerned with the drafting of Bantu labour units back to the reserves. The Minister talked somewhat dramatically about the position on the Reef. He talked about the position in the Transvaal and how the position in ten years&#x2019; time could be very embarrassing indeed. He referred to the question of housing in the Transvaal and gave the illustration of labour on farms. I do not know what the relevance of it was, but he referred to the housing provided by farmers and how much it cost them. But does the Minister realize that although the farmer paid for that, he got it off as a full allowance for income-tax purposes&#x003F; Let me <span class="col_6811-6812" refersTo="page_0667"/>put this question to the Minister. Supposing that instead of having this compulsive attitude he had a permissive attitude and said to the industrialist: &#x201C;You provide the housing to approved Government standards,&#x201D; I wonder how far that would have taken them over the past 19 years&#x003F; I wonder how many industrialists would have been prepared to provide adequate housing inside the Native townships on the same terms as farmers, so that it would be allowed as a rebate for income-tax purposes. He used the farmers as an example, but he did not put it on a proper basis. Supposing industrialists had had the opportunity over the past 20 years to have all the housing they provided deducted from income-tax, I do not think there would have been any housing troubles to-day. There would have been no shortage of housing. The industrialists would have seen to that. There were many industrialists in 1948 who came to the then United Party Government and asked to be allowed to provide a housing scheme. There was one particular company, which I do not want to name, but it was a company which had many thousands of pounds invested in this country and which said that they were prepared to invest in one of the municipal townships; that they would build the houses and take the houses on lease for 25 or 30 years, but they did not stipulate that there should be reduction for income-tax purposes. But had allowances been made on that basis, the problem would have been vastly different.</p>

<p>This Government believes after 19 years of office, apparently, that the only way to get anything done is to do it by compulsion. It has tried inducements in regard to border industries and, as the hon. member for Krugersdorp said, that did not bring results fast enough. The Government is impatient. It realizes that its plans and its promises are failing and therefore it is determined to have compulsory development by means of the permit system, at all costs, irrespective of what it may cost industry and irrespective of what it may cost the economy, and irrespective of the possible damage it may do to South Africa&#x2019;s image overseas in regard to encouraging capital to the country. It is not concerned so long as the Government ideal of development of the black areas and the removal of Bantu from the towns to the Reserves can be expedited. They see the black man as a danger to the future of the white man and that is the whole basis of Nationalist Party policy. It is based upon fear, no matter in what language they may dress it up. They fear that unless they can force the black man to go back to the Reserves and deplete the white areas of as many Bantu as possible, they are not fulfilling their function. Of course that message has to be put in other words when one speaks in London. We had an object lesson to-day of the way in which the message is put across in London as contrasted with the way it is put across in South Africa. The earlier portion of the Minister&#x2019;s speech was the London approach, but he got carried away by his enthusiasm and then we had the old South African approach again. [Interjections.]</p>

For the Minister to believe that by this legislation he can turn the tide back and send all the black men back to the Reserves, is denying the further hypothesis of the late Dr. Verwoerd, who said that the South African economy must be developed as a common market. How can he develop South Africa as a common market if he is going to have black and white states, unless of course there are no tariff barriers; and if there are no tariff barriers, what is going to happen if they have a wage rate lower than in the white area&#x003F; Will not the ultimate result be that the black economy will undercut the white economy, and that the white economy is going to collapse&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown started using the old tactics of the United Party once again, namely that of trying to wreck any matter by always seeing a bogeyman or a spectre, and this afternoon they thought up the &#x201C;bogeyman compulsion&#x201D; so as to cast suspicion on this matter and to arouse fears. They started in the year 1948 by saying that the banks would go bankrupt. Subsequent to that we heard the story that the flow of capital into South Africa would cease, but then capital flowed in despite the suspicions they had cast. This was followed by the phenomenal growth of our industries, which was not to their liking either and which was constantly disparaged by them. They did the same in connection with the border industries. They cast suspicion in that regard all the time, and this afternoon they are once again engaged in a process of casting suspicion in order to discourage people by saying that we want to give industry in general a slap in the face by applying force. They come with all these stories of red tape and delays in connection with permits, and with this mean accusation and insinuation the hon. member has made &#x2026;</p>

<p>I withdraw it and I say that the hon. member made a reprehensible insinuation, namely that permits would only be issued if a National Party M.P. accompanied such a person. I think that it was really reprehensible to have made such a statement in this House, and I think the hon. member owes this side of the House an apology. I do not want to waste my time on the hon. member for Pinetown, who carried on in this way. I think that this matter merits a much more serious and illuminating argument than the one the hon. member raised here.</p>

<p>What is the object of this legislation&#x003F; It has been set out very explicitly in the long title of this measure, namely &#x201C;to promote coordinated physical planning and the utilization of the Republic&#x2019;s resources &#x2026;&#x201D; The hon. member for Constantia said that there was no difference of opinion in that regard. There cannot be any difference of opinion either, because in 1947 this was also the object of the old Natural Resources Act. Let me read out to you what the long title of that Act was: &#x201C;Act to promote the better and more effectively coordinated exploitation, development and use of the natural resources of the Union&#x201D;&#x2014;almost word for word the same idea. It is the same object that was pursued by the old United Party Government in 1947, in Act No. 51 of 1947. Let us see what the evil was the United Party wanted to combat at that time, what the problem was it wanted to solve. You will recall that that 1947 Act was preceded by an inquiry, two inquiries in fact, undertaken by that Government&#x2019;s Social and Economic Planning Council, to which its fifth and ninth reports refer. At the time it was called the Social-Economic Planning Council&#x2014;the Social and Economic Planning Council. The problem was set out very clearly in those reports on which the 1947 legislation was based.</p>

<p>What was the problem, what was the evil they wanted to combat&#x003F; In paragraph 105 of the fifth report I find a summary of this, and it reads as follows: &#x201C;&#x2026; undesirable features in the pattern of the economy and the way in which the population is distributed over the country.&#x201D; That is a summary of it. This problem is set out very clearly in paragraph 85 of the fifth report of the then Social-Economic Planning Council. Paragraph 85 says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no merit in concentrating huge proportions of the Union&#x2019;s population in a few small areas of this large country since various other parts are suitable for more intensive settlement and development so that the economies of concentration can be achieved there. For years the tendencies have been different.</block>

<p>That is the problem, that is the evil to which the then Social-Economic Planning Council referred. I shall read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This results in badly balanced and inadequately diversified regional economies, and induces economic instability. It results in considerable migration of Natives &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to emphasize that this is what that Planning Council found&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It results in considerable migration of Natives, both permanent and temporary, to European areas, which could in part be prevented by initiating a programme for the full development of the resources of all regions in accordance with their productive capacity.</block>

<p>That was the evil they wanted to combat.</p>

<p>I want to go further than that. I do not only stand by the fifth report of that council of the United Party of that time, but I also want to refer to report No. 9 which deals with &#x201C;The Native Reserves and their Place in the Economy of the Union of South Africa&#x201D;. What is said in paragraph 256 of that report&#x003F; That paragraph is printed in bold, black type because it is in actual fact the conclusion at which that council of the United Party arrived and on which the latter based its 1947 legislation. Paragraph 256 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the need for industrial development is so great and because the responsibility must rest with the State &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is not the responsibility of the private sector&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6815-6816" refersTo="page_0669"/>&#x2026; to initiate such development in the Reserves, the Council recommends that the Government should explore the possibilities of assisting in the establishment of a number of selected industries catering for the more immediate needs of the Natives in or near the Native Areas with the object of promoting the development of these areas.</block>

<p>All of this is emphasized in bold type. I shall repeat the last few words: &#x201C;&#x2026; near the Native areas with the object of promoting the development of these areas.&#x201D; The report does not only refer to &#x201C;near the Native areas&#x201D;; it goes as far as to say what places are &#x201C;near the Native Areas&#x201D;. Just listen to what they said. That side will presently say that we have stolen our border industries policy from them! Paragraph 256 reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Centres which suggest themselves as likely to be suitable are Pietermaritzburg &#x2026;</block>

<p>I wonder what the &#x201C;Botterhui&#x201D; has to say to this&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Port Shepstone &#x2026;</block>

<p>What does the hon. member for South Coast have to say to this&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Eshowe, Empangeni, Umtata, Stutterheim, King William&#x2019;s Town, East London and Vryburg.</block>

<p>Those are the places where we have now placed the border industries. Therefore, what was said in these reports at the time&#x2014;and what was said in them still holds good&#x2014;is that in this respect we are pre-eminently concerned with a problem of population pressure being exerted by the Bantu, in the first place, in our metropolitan areas. This is the evil the 1947 legislation wanted to combat&#x2014;no more and no less. It sought to combat the population pressure on the metropolitan areas. What was that council&#x2019;s objects concerning the solution to this problem&#x003F; In this respect I want to quote paragraph 93 of report No. 5, and I want to say that I agree with this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A colossal mistake may be made if steps are not taken in advance to orientate the physical pattern of the economy so that an orderly development of the nation&#x2019;s resources occurs, based on the relative productivity of different regions and occupations. Only then can we prevent the expansion of our cities beyond what is in each instance the feasible limit, promote the urbanization of Reserve Natives in or near the Native Areas to the extent that the relative advantage in production of any such centre permits, and gradually minimize any unnecessary dependence on migrant labour from the Reserves and the farms. The heterogeneous composition of the Union&#x2019;s population and the very impoverished state of large communities make it especially urgent to progress in these directions.</block>

<p>That is what they said. Their attitude is crystal-clear. I cannot help saying that this entire premise is elaborated even further, and that is done in paragraph 85 of that report, where we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it would promote the desirable object of bringing the place of work nearer to the place of residence.</block>

<p>That was the object of that legislation; that is what the 1947 legislation sought to achieve, namely &#x201C;bringing the place of work nearer to the place of residence&#x201D;. In the ninth report of the Planning Council the matter is explained more fully. It is for that reason that decentralization took place. Surely, the fact that this problem is still the same to-day&#x2014;even more extensive than at that time&#x2014;is decisive proof to the fact that the measures taken by the United Party in that respect in Act No. 51 of 1947, namely the Natural Resources Development Act, were inadequate. Those measures did not relieve the population pressure, although it was the object of that legislation. Therefore I say that the measures they took, were not adequate. Why not&#x003F; I studied this matter carefully and found the answer to be that the remedy the 1947 legislation had taken up, was only the control of land&#x2014;no more, only the control of land. At that stage the slogan in the country was &#x201C;Regional planning&#x201D;. Therefore they sought to remedy this matter by way of regional plannning. But it has been proved clearly that the population pressure could not be relieved by way of regional planning only. That is why we must now take up other remedies as well.</p>

<p>This Bill actually applies two remedies. It will still apply the old remedy, that is the control over land. But a second remedy is added to that, namely control over the establishment and extension of factories. The hon. member for Pinetown tried to make out that this legislation was aimed against existing industries. That is not true, because it is aimed at the establishment of new industries and the extension of existing industries. No coercion if brought to bear on existing industries&#x2014;it only concerns the establishment of new industries and the extension of existing industries. But the objections that were raised against regional planning at that time, are the same as those the Opposition raised here this afternoon. As a matter of fact, the arguments they raised this afternoon had already been refuted entirely by their report of 1947. As far back as in its report of 1944 the Social and Economic Planning Council furnished a reply to the arguments hon. members of the Opposition advanced here this afternoon. I shall read it to the House. But just before I do so, I also want to refer to an editorial which appeared in <i>The Argus</i> and which was also quoted by the hon. member for Constantia. I am <span class="col_6817-6818" refersTo="page_0670"/>merely doing so to show what the United Party&#x2019;s objection is. The paragraph in this editorial which I shall now quote, was also used, word for word, by the hon. member for Pinetown. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An industry is established in order to make profits by supply and service in the form of goods. When an industrialist is planning an industry, he takes into account the source of his raw materials, his market, the cost of transport, the power that is available, water and labour. Labour includes managers, scientists as well as unskilled labour. If in considering all these factors he believes he can make a profit he invests his money.</block>

<p>This is the yardstick the hon. member for Pinetown used this afternoon to assess this legislation. Let us see what the Social and Economic Planning Council said in this regard in its report of 1944 (U.G. 34-1944). Paragraph 106 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But for the presence of migrant labour, the distribution of the Union&#x2019;s population is a function of the way in which the country is used for farms, mines, factories, transport routes, homes and recreation. This largely depends on how remunerative it is to do the one thing rather than the other, and rather in the one area than the other. On this account it may be held that in a system of private enterprise the pattern of the economy and the consequent population distribution will, from an economic point of view, tend towards the ideal &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the argument they raised this afternoon. But this very same report replies to that argument. Paragraph 107 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But it must not be forgotten that the facts of history also have a strong influence.</block>

<p>In this respect I just want to say that in his speech the hon. the Minister also referred to the historic basis&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Union it should, for example, not be overlooked that the magnets were the diamond and gold-fields and that thousands of square miles of undeveloped territory were crossed to get to the focal points. Therefore, sooner or later we shall have to retrace earlier steps if full and balanced use is to be made of the national resources.</block>

<p>Paragraph 110 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The numerous business decisions that mainly determine the over-all results are not arbitrary. They are definitely intended to yield the largest return to those who take them. But this does not mean that they necessarily best serve the public interest for the reason that business decisions are based on economic considerations, and tend to take account only of factors which affect the costs and revenue of the firm in question. Values not expressible in money terms generally do not count.</block>

<p>Then again the following is said in paragraph 111&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is seen that while the over-all pattern of the economy ultimately is of vital concern to everybody, at present it is the specific concern of no one. The State must, therefore, actively interest itself in the matter. In view of the considerable urban expansion and the far-reaching structural adjustments that are imminent in the Union, there now is a degree of urgency that has been partly absent in the past.</block>

<p>Therefore in 1944 there was already a degree of urgency, and I maintain that this urgency is much greater at present. And we must bear in mind that the urgency of 1944 existed before extensive industrial development took place, development which has taken place under this Government over the past decade. If there was a degree of urgency in 1944 already, how much more would there not be to-day&#x003F; And how much more is it not essential for the State to take an active part in this to-day&#x003F; The steps the United Party Government had taken, showed that they were either not suitable or not adequate. That is why we are justified in taking up further remedies so as to cope with this problem of population pressure. As far as South Africa is concerned, it is purely a problem of population pressure in our metropolitan areas. Therefore I adopt the attitude that the United Party is morally obliged to support this legislation we have before us to-day. After all, it is their commission that found the position to be such as I outlined in my quotations. If the United Party does not support this legislation, they are unfaithful to themselves because it was their commission which stated that they had to introduce legislation to control it. They introduced legislation, but apparently that legislation was inadequate. That is why we are introducing further legislation at this stage. If the United Party still supports that object wholeheartedly, they must vote for this legislation. But I want to make the statement that they are not concerned about this problem&#x2014; their only concern is that of making political capital in this debate. All they are concerned with, is to make political capital out of this. They want to pull the wool over our eyes. They see now that we are going to solve the problem of population pressure and that we are going to do so by means of our policy of separate development. Because they realize that, if we solve this problem, we shall do so by way of separate development, and that we shall succeed with that policy, they do not want us to continue with this legislation. If we had called it &#x201C;regional planning&#x201D; as they did in 1947, then it would have been fine.</p>

<p><span class="col_6819-6820" refersTo="page_0671"/>What we must not say is that it is separate development. As a matter of fact, that report of theirs indicated the points for border development, points where development should take place, development in which we are in fact engaged at the moment. As &#x201C;regional planning&#x201D; it would have been acceptable to them. It is not acceptable now, because it also gives effect to separate development at the same time. Let us look at this remedy which we are taking up now, namely the control of factories. Why do we choose factories&#x003F; Let me refer to that report of theirs once again. In paragraph 104 of that report we read why factories should be selected. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mining and farming set a practically unalterable pattern of population distribution. Manufacturing and tertiary industries, however, are relatively mobile. That they often observe very definite locational rules, is true enough. Nevertheless there is greater or lesser room for choice in many cases. Mobility has been further enhanced by the advent of motor transport and by the possibility of the supply of electrical power over long distances. All these developments clearly make it far more possible than it has ever been to open up distant resources, to diversify regional economies, to avoid over-expansion of cities and to promote urbanization in the reserves.</block>

<p>That is why we are taking up this remedy. It is because the secondary industries are mobile. That is said in that report of the United Party&#x2019;s own commission. Because they are mobile they can be moved within the framework of the economy. Why those hon. members now want to pretend that we want to disrupt the secondary industries in South Africa completely, is beyond my comprehension. Apparently there are a great many objections to clause 3 <i>(4),</i> because it mentions the sort of labour against which we are directing ourselves, namely Bantu labour. As this report of the United Party&#x2019;s own Planning Council indicates, the Bantu is the problem. That is why mention is made of Bantu employees. As I am saying, we are killing two birds with one stone. We are implementing the policy of separate development, but at the same time we are arranging it in such a way that we may decentralize our industries in South Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion I also want to make the observation that this legislation should not be regarded as replacing measures we have taken previously. It does not replace measures we have taken, for instance, in order to encourage industries to go to the border areas. That legislation and those processes will remain in force. This measure is in fact supplementary. It is not a coercive measure. It is, in the first place, a measure to advise people so that they may avoid past mistakes. A certain measure of prohibition attaches itself to this, but prohibition is still not coercion. If I tell a person that he may not enter the Debating Chamber, then it is not necessarily coercion. However, if I take him by the neck and force him into the Debating Chamber, only then does it amount to coercion. No industries are being taken by the neck and forced to go to a certain place. What they are being told here is where it will be desirable for them to establish their industries in the general interest of the country. If we view the matter in that light, instead of arousing suspicions, as the hon. member for Pinetown did this afternoon, then we shall make much more progress with the development of South Africa in the future. I want to emphasize again that this side of the House is very much in earnest about achieving balanced development in South Africa as far as our industries are concerned. Amongst other things I want to mention that my town, the town of Heilbron, which is situated far from the Bantu areas, has also been classified as being entitled to border industries benefits, because we want development at Heilbron for the Coloureds who are living there. In that way we can mention several examples where the development of areas bordering on Bantu homelands is not our only aim, but where it is also our concern to develop other parts of our country. In this way it will probably be recommended in other parts of our country &#x2014;where there is no Coloured labour, but Indian labour, which will also have to be taken into account&#x2014;that factories should go to those places so that we may bring about that balanced development in South Africa. I think it would be foolish of us not to continue with this measure and to place it on our Statute Book.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Heilbron has alleged that the legislation before the House contains no coercive elements. He states that an industrialist will not be seized by his neck and sent packing in a specific direction. All that will happen is that he will be recommended to go to a specific area. Now I want to know from the hon. member for Heilbron whether it is not coercion if one were, for example, to say to an industrialist in Port Elizabeth: &#x201C;Your factory has developed to such and such an extent. After this legislation has been passed we are afraid that you cannot have any further expansion here. We want you to go to Queenstown or East London.&#x201D; Now I want to ask the hon. member whether that is not a form of coercion, i.e. when an industrialist is told: &#x201C;so far and no further.&#x201D; It is merely coercion under any other name which the hon. member chooses to give it. The hon. member for Heilbron also said that what the Government wants is a balanced industrial development in South Africa. That is an entirely acceptable point of view. It is a point of view with which, to my mind, no hon. members in this House can quarrel, but the hon. member wants the industries to go to the borders of the reserves, he wants expansion in our present metropolitan areas to be restricted to a large <span class="col_6821-6822" refersTo="page_0672"/>extent, he wants it to remain more or less as it is at present and he does not want any additional labour to be brought in.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>And subsequently less, yes. I am glad the hon. member made that point. In other words, the industrialist of South Africa must realize that he will not always be able to expand on the basis of Bantu labour. In other words, a stage can be reached when, according to this Government&#x2019;s policy, it will be possible for stagnation to set in in the present metropolitan areas, it must come.</p>

<p>I want to return to the hon. member for Heilbron. He said that they wanted a balanced development. In order to have development along the borders of the reserves, expansion must be restrained and come to a halt in specific white areas. I want to ask the hon. member the following question: Will he only have non-Whites in his employ in those industries&#x003F; Of course not. The industries will again go through precisely the same process of development which they went through in Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage, on the Witwatersrand, or in Durban-Pinetown. Precisely the same development will take place 150 or 200 miles further away. In other words, he is dissatisfied at the creation of one metropolitan area, but he is also prepared to see precisely the same area being created elsewhere. If the hon. member for Heilbron wants balanced development in South Africa, must the balanced development be in the so-called white area only&#x003F; He knows that the development of border industries is taking place in the white areas only. If he wants a balanced development in South Africa then he must have the development in the Bantu areas themselves, and this Bill does not make provision for that.</p>

<p>Therefore the hon. the Minister cannot adopt the attitude that this Bill will further his policy of separate development. This Bill will merely result in further development of another white area which will be situated a little closer to a Bantu area. If he wants balanced development then this development must take place in the Bantu areas themselves, and that will not happen under this Bill. Nor will this Bill in any way further his policy of separate development. We must have clarity on this point. It is of course the attitude which the hon. the Minister will adopt: He will come forward here with propaganda to the effect that this Bill is being introduced in order to further the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. That is by no means the position. Mr. Speaker, about 130 years ago we had a migration on the part of the white man into the interior. He approached closer to the black man. In the past 30 years we have had a migration on the part of the black man towards the area of the white man, and as a result of this measure we are going to have a third migration. We are going to find that the white man is once more approaching closer to the black man. That is what is being envisaged in this Bill.</p>

<p>It is being stated so glibly that the manufacturing industry is the industry which is responsible for the tremendous increase in the number of Bantu in our white areas, but what are the facts&#x003F; The facts of the matter are that according to the 1960 census there were approximately 3,900,000 economically active Bantu in South Africa, of whom almost 1,400,000 were employed in agriculture. Slightly more than half a million Bantu were employed on the mines. But in the manufacturing industry there were only approximately 308,000 Bantu. The argument is now being put forward that it is industrial development which is brining this tremendous concentration of Bantu to our white cities. If hon. members were to glance at the figures in respect of the Witwatersrand and the industrial development taking place there they would find that the ratio between white and black there is one of the most favourable in the country seen from the point of view of the white man. The ratio is approximately one to one. Let us glance at what the position is in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex which has to draw a large percentage of its labour from the Bantu areas. The following statement is so readily made: &#x201C;You have New Brighton and Kwasi Kila; there are thousands and thousands of black people there.&#x201D; But what is the position in the factories of the industrialists, the so-called bogeymen, who according to hon. members on that side are hammering nails into the coffin of the white man in South Africa&#x003F; In 1961 we had 1,279 registered factories in that area which employed approximately 60,000 people, of whom 19,000 or 32 per cent were white, 15,000 or 26.3 per cent were Coloured and 24,000 or 41 per cent were black. Let us glance now at what the position was in September 1966. The number of Bantu had by then increased from 24,000 in 1960 to 32,000 an increase of 8,000. But the percentage of Bantu who were active in the manufacturing industry in that major complex had decreased from 41 per cent to 38.5 per cent. We learn from members on that side that these people are supposed to constitute such a grave danger to South Africa. We cannot have a complex such as the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex, because the more we expand the greater the danger becomes.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall bring evidence to prove to the hon. the Minister that the former Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, Mr. De Wet Nel, said this as far back as 1959. Then it was not irresponsible, but now that I am saying it, it suddenly becomes an irresponsible thing to say. Hon. members on that side of the House say that they do not want to compel industries to go to the borders of the reserves. The hon. member for Heilbron quoted from one report after the other to indicate that we should support this Bill. He pointed out that the 1947 legislation had been placed on the Statute Book by the United Party Government. Quite correct. That legislation was placed on the Statute Book by the then United Party Government. We saw in it a means of bringing about the decentralization of industries in South Africa. The hon. member omitted to mention to us what the good points of that legislation were. For example he omitted to tell us what is provided in section 4 of the 1947 legislation, i.e. that on each occasion there should be consultation with the leading bodies in the country which are concerned in the development of our natural resources. Why is that section, in which the objectives of the Natural Resources Development Council were defined, not included in this Bill&#x003F; No, it was not included in this Bill because the hon. the Minister knows that economic development has up to now taken place contrary to the race policy which the Government has been following up to now.</p>

<p>I was absolutely amazed to read in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Die Burger</i> that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education said last night at Stellenbosch that this Government&#x2019;s policy of border industries had been so successful that the Government had in the past six years prevented more than 450,000 black people from coming to the white areas. That was how they had succeeded in their policy of keeping the Bantu in the homelands. So they really do not need legislation. Those are the propaganda stories of the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. the Minister knows that the Government&#x2019;s policy has not been a success and now he wants the power in his hands to be able to say to the industrialists of Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Cape Town and Pinetown: &#x201C;Thus far and no further. If you want to develop further then you will have to go and establish your factories on the borders of the reserves.&#x201D; But I want to go so far as to say that I do not think the Minister is very interested in economic development. That is not his primary objective. His primary objective is to give the voting public and particularly his own Nationalist supporters the impression that they are putting apartheid into practice. They are being criticized at every congress. Their own people are telling them that they have been in power for 20 years and that an increasing number of black people are continually entering the white areas. This is the only thing they will be able to tell those people: &#x201C;Here we have passed legislation now. Just watch us from here on in and you will see that scores of factories on the borders of the homelands will be supplying work for the Bantu.&#x201D; But at the same time they know that it can only be on the borders of the reserves because they are too afraid to enter the reserves. They want, at the same time, to be able to show the white voters that this development is not only for the sake of the black man.</p>

<p>The Whites are also deriving great benefit from it. That is the gist of that party&#x2019;s attitude. Now the hon. the Minister stands up here and tells us that the choice is either apartheid or integration; it is either separate development, or the brown and black children will be playing in the ruins of the Union Buildings. By (he way, the hon. the Minister made a very interesting speech. He put me in mind of a man and his wife who went to bioscope thinking that they would see a wonderful film. The film turned out to be a very brief one but the supporting programme was quite good. [Laughter.]<span class="col_6825-6826" refersTo="page_0674"/>The hon. Minister explained his legislation very briefly and then he gave a long summary of separate development. [Interjections,] The hon. member for Heilbron quoted from many reports, but I want to refer him to only one report. That is the report of the Commission on the Protective Policy for Industries, of which Mr. Du Toit Viljoen was the chairman. In paragraph 4 he states the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The economic life of the Union has developed on the basis of private initiative and there is no legislation which can compel industrialists to establish their factories in any specific vicinity. In order to adhere faithfully to this principle, it is being recommended that while no pressure or persuasion is applied to them, prospective industrialists should be influenced as far as possible by means of positive measures in respect of the establishment of undertakings as long as that does not involve uneconomic considerations.</block>

<p>This paragraph in question is quite a mouthful, but what it amounts to is this, that nobody will be compelled to go to a specific area. Draw them in other ways. But why must the industrialists of my area be told that they can develop so far and no further&#x003F; Why does the hon. the Minister want that power&#x003F; Why must my area be restricted because he wants to develop another area&#x003F; Why cannot he leave that area alone, so that it can be developed by private initiative as far as it can possibly go, and at the same time give any other areas along the borders of the homelands all the attractions&#x003F; That is what he can do and if the hon. the Minister wants to do that then nobody will have any objection to the steps he wants to take. It would be unfair because if one were against those steps one would in reality be against private initiative and against the decentralization of industries, and then one is in reality opposed to a balanced economic development taking place in one&#x2019;s country. That is why nobody is against that. But I want to tell the Minister the following. This legislation which we are going to pass here to-day &#x2026; [Interjections.] I am certain a few hon. members opposite will still come to their senses and help us. [Interjections.] I want to tell the hon. the Minister that as far as all the industrialists of Port Elizabeth are concerned, there is not one of them who will like this legislation, for the simple reason that most industrialists are being so inundated nowadays by increasing quantities of administrative regulations that this legislation will only mean that for the slightest expansion which they want to make, whenever they want to employ more Bantu, they will have to go to the Minister or to his Committee to obtain permission to be able to do so. All that it will mean is that they will be burdened with more and more administrative duties, and furthermore it will only mean that the production costs of many of those industries will be pushed up even further. I want to make a plea to-day on behalf of those people. An orderly community which has thousands of thousands of white people, has built up that industrial area through white iniative. We made use of the Coloured and of the black man. Any one of those pillars which you want to remove to-day will simply mean that you will confine the development of that region. I want to entreat the hon. the Minister to leave our existing industrial areas as they are to-day and afford those people every opportunity of developing, and to refrain from taking steps which will reduce their labour strength. If they want to make any expansions the Minister must afford them the opportunity of doing so. If he does not want to do so he will be dealing a heavy blow against healthy industrial development in the Eastern Cape, of which Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage are the best examples. I am entreating the hon. the Minister to look after the interests of those people and ensure that industrial development takes its normal course as it has done for the past 20 years.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened at length, attentively and with much patience to what three Opposition speakers have had to say in regard to this very important piece of legislation which we have before us to-day. However, if one has to listen for an half hour to the kind of speeches which we have heard here then one begins to wonder where the hon. Opposition is going to. The hon. member for Newton Park alleged here that the Government was creating conditions which would result in a third Great Trek in South Africa. The first had been the migration of the farmers out of the Eastern Cape to the north, and then there had been the migration of the black man to the white areas. According to the hon. member the Government wanted to create conditions to draw the white man to the borders of the black man&#x2019;s territory. The hon. member then went on to say that what the Government now wanted to do was to transfer the conditions which were at present prevailing in the metropolitan areas of South Africa to the borders of the reserves.</p>

<p>The mistake which the Opposition is making, is this: They regard every Bill as a separate item because they themselves do not have a great plan for South Africa, because they themselves do not have that universal view. That is why they deal with each Bill which comes before this House in its context only. On the other hand we on this side of the House have a great vision, a great plan for the prosperity and the safety of all the nations of South Africa. Cannot the hon. member for Newton Park realize that we are affording each one of these nations every opportunity of realizing themselves to the full in their own areas. That is why we are creating the conditions adjoining the reserves so that that black labour can reside and live in its own area and can have its sphere of activity just outside its own area. That is the major difference between the creation of conditions in the metropolitan <span class="col_6827-6828" refersTo="page_0675"/>areas and the creation of those conditions on the borders of the reserves.</p>

<p>It is because the Opposition does not have that broad view, because they do not have a great plan for the welfare, the prosperity and the safety of all the nations of South Africa, that they see nothing but problems in every Bill which is dealt with here without discerning the underlying objectives. All that they see are the problems. After having listened very patiently to the hon. members of the Opposition this afternoon, I can only say that history undoubtedly repeats itself, and quite often too. During the past week I have done a little research in order to discover what the attitude of the Opposition had been in respect of every Bill which this Government brought before Parliament during the past 19 years, legislation to ensure the safety and the prosperity of all the nations of South Africa. What has the attitude of the Opposition been&#x003F; While I was paging through old editions of Hansard I read about precisely the same things which I saw again here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the Group Areas Act of 1950. Do you know what I read about that in Hansard&#x003F; On 29th May, 1950, the then Acting Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Strauss, stated very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill has already had a very prejudicial effect on the property market.</block>

<p>In Column 7472 of the same date we find the following words spoken by Mr. Strauss&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are many people who are deeply perturbed about the repercussions which might result from this Bill.</block>

<p>During the Third Reading Mr. Strauss said something which is very interesting because it corresponds exactly to what hon. members on that side said here this afternoon. Mr. Strauss quoted from a letter which he had received from the Chamber of Industries (Hansard, Column 8775)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; The Bill when it becomes law, cannot fail but to create an economic disturbance in the industrial sphere, the volume and extent of which it is difficult to foresee.</block>

<p>Does that not remind you of the last portion of the amendment moved here this afternoon by the hon. member for Constantia&#x003F; It implies precisely the same attitude. The attitude on that side is always that, &#x201C;this new step of the Government is going to cause disruption, a disruption the extent of which it is difficult to foresee&#x201D;, etc.</p>

<p>On each occasion the Opposition have seen bogeymen, and they are also seeing them now, bogeymen which have assumed exaggerated proportions in their eyes. Why do they see these bogeymen&#x003F; Because&#x2014;as I have said before&#x2014;they do not have a plan for South Africa, because they do not have a great purpose. That is why all that they are constantly doing is seeing spectres. That is why they never recognized planned development, they are always seeing spectres, and in this case as well it is the old story all over again. How has the lie not been given to those pessimistic predictions of the then Opposition under the Acting Leader, Mr. Strauss! I read in the documents submitted to us by the Federated Chamber of Industries and the Chamber of Commerce that they are making equally gloomy predictions if this measure were to be placed on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>Let us state this very clearly now for the umpteenth time: This Government recognizes a free enterprise economy, and if the hon. gentlemen of the Chamber of Industries and the Chambers of Commerce want to intimidate us by stating that we should not interfere in the economy and in free enterprise in South Africa, then we want to give them the assurance once more that this Government adheres strictly to the principle of free enterprise. None of them need teach us a lesson in the economics of free enterprise. They certainly do not have a monopoly of economic knowledge. They do not have a monopoly of wisdom as far as free economy is concerned. I want to state very clearly and unequivocally that this Government adheres to the tenets of free economy, of free enterprise. But it must very definitely be established within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s intentions concerning the safety and survival of all the nations in South Africa. That is the only condition we impose. There is no question now of our wanting to restrict the liberty of economy, or of our wanting to regiment everything. Surely the hon. the Minister made it very clear that it will still be possible for industries to develop in the metropolitan areas provided that development takes place within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s plans for the safety of all the nations in the Republic.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are beginning to get sick and tired of the condescending attitude of the Opposition and the economically pious gentlemen of the Chambers of Industry and the Chambers of Commerce, people who are always trying to prescribe to the Government not to interfere in free economy, not to regiment in any way, because, so they say, only free enterprise&#x2014;as they see it and as they interpret the matter&#x2014;can bring prosperity to all in South Africa. We have the greatest respect for what the industrialist has established in South Africa. We are grateful for what those gentlemen of the Chamber of Industries have established. But everything in their garden has not always been moonshine and roses. May I ask them where they were when there was an urgent need here in South Africa for a steel industry to be established here&#x003F; Did they on that occasion come forward with their so-called free enterprise to establish that essential industry for South Africa&#x003F; Where were they when we had to establish a basic industry such as the steel industry in South <span class="col_6829-6830" refersTo="page_0676"/>Africa&#x003F; In their memorandum the Chamber of Industries have stated that it is essential that the basic considerations should be investigated thoroughly before drastic steps for the sake of decentralization are taken. That is their attitude again in respect of this Bill. But that was also their attitude at that time when South Africa had a pressing need for a basic steel industry. At that time they were so concerned, together with the then United Party, with basic considerations, that they were never able to proceed to do something tangible. Their concern with basic considerations was merely in order to waste time, and that for a specific purpose. While they were still busy wasting time, the then National Party Government under General Hertzog proceeded to erect a steel factory. To-day they are once again asking us not to proceed with this legislation, at least not before certain basic considerations have been investigated. Did not the same thing happen in the case of Sasol&#x003F; There much-vaunted free enterprisers would not and could not establish a Sasol, and yet it is to-day the nucleus, the focal point of a large number of industries which grew up around that primary industry. Where were these much-vaunted free enterprisers then&#x003F; Even to-day hon. members on the opposite side are still being disparaging in regard to the establishment of that industry which is to-day the basis of a large chemical industry in South Africa. Is it necessary for me to remind them of Foskor as well, a basic industry which is today the focal point of a growing industrial complex at Phalaborwa&#x003F; Where were they when we experienced great difficulties after Sharpeville&#x003F; Did they then display confidence in South Africa and expand their factories&#x003F; Where were these much-vaunted free enterprisers then&#x003F; Was the then Minister of Finance not then literally forced to toady to them by means of taxation concessions to get them to expand their factories and get our economy going again&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Finance literally had to toady to them. But even that did not help. The then Minister of Justice, who is to-day Prime Minister, first had to introduce drastic measures to create a safe climate before these much-vaunted gentlemen were willing to expand their industries further and in that way get the economy of South Africa going again. This side of the House and the public outside are sick and tired of this economically sanctimonious prattle of the hon. gentlemen of the Chamber of Industries and of Assocom and of their champions here in this House.</p>

<p>Let us remind ourselves again of certain basic economic facts. Let us consider what these hon. gentlemen who are pleading here to such an extent for free enterprise and a free economy and who want to pretend that they have a monopoly of knowledge are saying (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To prevent any possible damage to the economic growth of the Republic, a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of matters of this nature is absolutely essential.</block>

<p>What do they want to imply with those words, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; That only they have that knowledge&#x003F; That this side of the House has no knowledge of our economy&#x003F; Let me present them with a few basic facts. Most of our industries, the property of these economically sacrosanct gentlemen, owe their existence and survival to the protective policy of successive national governments. Where would they have been if it had not been for the protective policy of the National Party Government, a policy which has often been violently opposed by hon. members of the Opposition&#x003F; Where would they have been if successive National Party Governments had not protected them&#x003F; And who paid for that protection&#x003F; I am speaking here of basic economic facts, which these hon. gentlemen discuss so derogatively, implying that this side of the House is entirely ignorant of the matter. Who must pay for that protection now&#x003F; The man in the street must do so, because he has to pay more for his shirt, his socks, his trousers and his jacket. All because industries are being protected. I have no fault to find with industries being protected. It is necessary. But I am asking, where would these hon. gentlemen have been if this National Party Government and former National Party Governments had not applied a policy of protecting industries&#x003F; As I have said, the man in the street must pay for it. Does this man in the street, for whom hon. members opposite plead both in season and out, not also have the right to lay claim to protection for himself&#x003F; All these years he has been paying for the establishment and continued existence of these factories with a smile.</p>

<p>Does he not also have the right to claim that his survival, his safety, should be guaranteed&#x003F; Does he not have the right to ask this Government, a Government which he has kept in office for 19 years now, to take steps to guarantee and perpetuate his safety and survival in this fine country of ours&#x003F; The man in the street, the man who brought this Government into office will contribute his share. The Government will consider it its duty to guard against the development of conditions in and around our major cities, conditions affecting the safety of John Citizen and his wife and we shall not allow ourselves to be dictated to by the sacrosanct gentlemen of the Chamber of Industries and of Assocom, nor by the hon. Opposition. That is to say, if we want to guarantee and perpetuate the survival of all population groups in South Africa. I want to warn hon. members of the Opposition and the hon. gentlemen of the Chamber of Industries and of Assocom to see to it that John Citizen does not reproach them with being concerned only with their own prosperity and not caring what becomes of the safety of John Citizen and his children. Do not let John Citizen reproach you with having been concerned only with your own profits. That is the ugliest, the worst and the most reprehensible aspect of our capitalistic system. Let us root it out. Let us become altruistic and <span class="col_6831-6832" refersTo="page_0677"/>not only look after our own profits. Let us rather ensure prosperity within the framework of safety for all. Of what avail is all the wealth and all the riches if we lose that safety&#x003F; That is why this Government will continue working for the prosperity and the safety of all the nations of South Africa. It will see to that.</p>

<p>I have spoken harshly to the Opposition and with F.C.I. and Assocom. You will agree with me that it is very necessary, after what we heard this afternoon from hon. members of the Opposition. I want to place it very clearly on record that we on this side of the House are very grateful that the opinions set out in this pamphlet are not the opinions of all industrialists. We want to state very clearly that there are many other businessmen in South Africa&#x2014;industrialists as well as merchants&#x2014; who do not need these warnings and these reprimands, because they are altruistic enough not to place prosperity above safety for all in their planning. We realize only too well that this legislation will create problems, formidable problems, particularly in the initial stages. But were formidable problems in the past not in fact an incentive to progress&#x003F; Was the solution of these formidable problems in the past not a challenge and an incentive to us all to find new ways and means of solving those problems&#x003F; The hon. member for Newton Park was very concerned about the fact that the Bantu have to be removed from his industries in Port Elizabeth. He wanted to know why they are being penalized now, and how they are expected to manage. He asked that even after the hon. the Minister had stated so emphatically that it was not our purpose to chase away and transfer.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Has that hon. member never heard of plans to get along with fewer labourers&#x003F; Let me mention one specific example to him. In the Cape Town docks a problem arose during the past deciduous fruit season as a result of the tremendous harvest which had to be handled. It became very clear that we would have to import more labourers to load all the cases of export fruit on to the trucks, etc. Did the Railways then go to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, or to the Deputy Minister and say: We want more and more Bantu to off-load those cases from the trucks&#x003F; No, Sir. As befits a responsible body, they made plans to get along with less labour. I understand that they succeeded in evolving a system which amounts to this: Where formerly it had taken six to eight labourers two hours to off-load such a truck, they would now, with one white operator, be able to off-load that same truck in 11 minutes. In 11 minutes one white operator would now do the work which six to eight Bantu labourers had formerly done in two hours. I am mentioning this one example to show the hon. member for Newton Park that where there is a will, there is a way. Since we have set ourselves the task of ensuring the safety and survival of all the nations of South Africa, we will make plans and we will find a way out for ourselves, because where there is a will there is a way.</p>

<p>Then there is the example which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration used last night at Stellenbosch of an industrial concern at Bellville which increased its production by more than 300 per cent after it had reduced its number of Bantu labourers from 440 to 48. This Bill before the House is just another step in the implementation of this great plan for South Africa. The enemies of our nation want to destroy our safety. They do not hesitate to dangle before us the bait of prosperity and riches all the time. But this side of the House will not be deceived into taking the bait. This side of the House has always stood firm in its struggle against the enemies of our people. But where was the Opposition during this struggle against the enemies of our nation&#x003F; Did they come and thrust their heads into the scrum to help us shove when the enemies of our nation want to push us away&#x003F; No, they stood on the sidelines. Besides that, do you know what they were shouting&#x003F; They were shouting: &#x201C;The National Party is playing a dirty game; give them a good hiding&#x201D;. That was their share in this struggle for the establishment of our safety. That was their share. But the people of South Africa who were sitting there in the pavilion saw all this. The people of South Africa are not blind. They saw that while we on this side of the House were fighting for the safety of South Africa the Opposition were adding their voices to those of the enemies of South Africa. That is why the voting public has kept this Government in power now for 19 years. If this Opposition does not come to its senses, then I easily predict that a further 19 years lie ahead for this Government. That is why I want to make an appeal to the hon. Opposition and ask them to come to their senses because just as in 1950 they issued a warning to the effect that the economy of this country would go under, just as the hon. member for Pinetown issued the warning this very afternoon that if we had to compete with the cheap labour of the border industries and the Bantu areas, then the White economy would collapse, so the future will once again prove that this is mere scaremongering and we will not allow ourselves to be intimidated by scaremongering.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Had the purpose of this Bill been the decentralization of industry, as it is normally understood, then my comment would perhaps have been limited to saying that the hon. the Minister has put the cart before the horse, because if you examine the methods followed for the re-allocation of industry in other countries of the world such as Great Britain, France and Italy, you will find that first growth points are established and thereafter, and only thereafter, restrictions are placed on the free movement of industry in the great metropolitan areas, or the conurbations or megalopolizes, as they are called. This Bill does everything in reverse. First, the Minister takes the right to freeze the establishment of new factories, or if there is additional Bantu labour to be employed, the extension of factories, and then presumably, and only presumably, at some future date, he will establish the growth points which are required and to which industries can go. But, of course, the intention of the Bill is something entirely different. The hon. the Minister has told us that its purpose is not economic, but that it is socio-economic, and the hon. the Minister went to great lengths to explain this. But you see, Sir, &#x201C;socio-economics&#x201D; to the hon. the Minister simply means one thing: Get the Bantu out of the white areas at any cost. This kind of thinking does not surprise anybody. After all, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration has been beating this drum for some time. This was the crux of his address to the executive of the F.C.I. on the 7th of March last. The hon. member for Pinetown quoted an extract from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech where he said that decentralization could not be done on a voluntary basis; that it had not been possible to do so in England or France or Italy, so how could we expect it here. The hon. the Minister also said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not only is it the duty of individual industrialists to establish new undertakings or extensions in the border areas, wherever possible, but those remaining or locating in the rest of the country must seriously endeavour to limit their employment of Bantu to the absolute minimum. It is incumbent upon industry to find the necessary formulae for this purpose. If they cannot, it will be the duty of the Government, even if it means legislating for it.</block>

<p>So the purpose has been quite clear, Sir, and the hon. the Minister in his speech on Friday confirmed that his attitude was that industry must bow the knee to Government policy. But this is a comparatively new line of thinking because at the F.C.I. council meeting in March, Mr. Klopper, on behalf of the Transvaal Chamber of Industries, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our attitude to decentralization is in line with the statements made in 1956 by the late Prime Minister, the hon. Dr. H. Verwoerd, then Minister of Native Affairs, when he assured industry in speeches and by letter, firstly, that decentralization must be on a voluntary basis; secondly, that it is not the intention of the Government to create two competing industrial complexes.</block>

<p>In June, 1960, the late Prime Minister issued what was called an exposition on the establishment of border industries for consideration by the Economic Advisory Council. At page 7 <span class="col_6835-6836" refersTo="page_0679"/>the exposition contained this statement under the heading &#x201C;The Co-operation of Private Enterprise&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the establishment of industries and the production of goods and services, are basically the task of private enterprise, the cooperation and participation of private enterprise are of decisive importance to ensure a successful policy of decentralization.</block>

<p>It went on to say this at page 10&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As has already been mentioned, the cooperation of all interested parties is of the greatest importance for the successful implementation of the policy of industrial decentralization. For this reason the Government deemed is desirable that an exchange of views should take place with these parties on the means that will have to be employed for the implementation of this policy. With this end in view, a meeting of the Economic Advisory Council will be held in July.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what has happened to all this talk of co-operation with private enterprise&#x003F; We all know that the F.C.I. and Assocom are totally opposed to this Bill. But the hon. the Minister is unconcerned. This is the way he wants it and this is the way it is going to be. And what has happened to the Economic Advisory Council&#x003F; After all, this council was appointed by the Government to advise it at the highest possible level, to advise the Prime Minister personally on economic affairs. After the publication of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s exposition in June, 1960, the Economic Advisory Council met in July of that year, and I am going to read to the House the advice which that council gave to the Prime Minister. This is what the council said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After consideration of all views expressed at the meeting, the Government has now decided to proceed with the encouragement of industries in Border areas &#x2026; No compulsory measures will be applied to force intending industrialists to establish themselves in border areas &#x2026; finally it should be emphasized that the Government&#x2019;s endeavours are directed towards a reconciliation of what is political-socially desirable with what is economically feasible.</block>

<p>This is the advice given to the hon. the Prime Minister, and on Friday&#x2014;the hon. the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;I understood him to say that the Economic Advisory Council was still against this measure, that it did not like compulsion and that it did not like the Bill. The Government first of all calls into being a body consisting of the top brains in the country on economic matters and then ignores its advice.</p>

<p>It was only advice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we are therefore faced with this question: Why has there been this change from co-operation to coercion&#x003F; Why is the advice of the Economic Advisory Council being ignored&#x003F; The answer is not very difficult to find. You see, hon. Ministers, and hon. members opposite, have for a long time now been telling us of the wonderful success they have achieved with border industries; we have heard this <i>ad nauseam.</i> I think it is fair to say that the facts show that they spoke more with emphasis than with conviction. I think it is also fair to say that what they had to say was closer to what their supporters wanted to hear than to the reality of the situation. But, Sir, this is the awkward moment of truth, when reality has to be faced, and the reality of the situation is simply that the whole structure of Government policy has failed. The development of border industries has been too slow and too limited to make any impact on the number of Bantu in the urban areas. The flow of the Bantu has been into the towns and not out of the towns. The refusal of the Government to allow white capital and white skill into the reserves has effectively closed the one door that might have provided mass employment for the Bantu in his homelands. The Minister is a gentleman in a hurry: 1978 is too far ahead for him. He wants the reversal to start, as he said, long before that date. So we get the Bill which the Minister says he must have at all costs. But the question I want to ask is: Has the Minister counted the cost&#x003F;</p>

<p>To achieve development in the border areas, development must be restricted in the metropolitan areas, for this is the whole purpose of the Bill, and if industrial development is not shifted from the developed areas to the border areas then the Government will have failed to achieve its objective. Industrial development of the border areas must of necessity be much slower than development in the established urban areas; growth-points have to be determined and the infra-structure has to be provided. Established organizations will find it far easier to expand in the present industrial areas than they will find it to expand in the border areas, because after all, all they have to do where they are situated at the moment is to add an additional wing or an additional floor to existing facilities and they have expanded their business. But if they go to the border areas, a whole new process must commence.</p>

<p>The individual with limited means will find it almost impossible to establish himself in a border area; the problems are much too complex. You see, what happens in practice is this. In the cities a person wanting to start a new business hires a few square feet of working space, buys or hires one or two machines, and he is on his way. This Bill controls the smallest factory and spells doom for the small man who, in the past, with little more than courage and hard work, established what today are some of our largest factories. The Minister would do well to remember that the establishment of new, large factories is the <span class="col_6837-6838" refersTo="page_0680"/>exception and not the rule. What happens in a system of free enterprise is that from small beginnings big things grow. Some of our largest organizations started from nothing. I was interested in a company which started in Johannesburg 20 years ago in an old bicycle shed; to-day its turnover runs into millions of rand and it exports to many countries in the world. I am no longer associated with it&#x2014;I entered politics, unfortunately.</p>

<p>No. Organized commerce and industry have stated quite clearly that if the Minister proceeds with this measure it could lead to, &#x201C;irreparable harm being done to manufacturing activities, and could result in most serious economic distortions&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Minister really knows what a gamble he is taking&#x003F; You see, continued economic expansion is an absolute essential for South Africa. We need continued industrial expansion to maintain our balance of payments position, particularly after 1971 when it is expected our gold production will decline. We need a peak of industrial efficiency and productivity to halt and beat inflation; we need to produce cheap and quality goods. The Government is well aware of this and the relaxation of import control and the statement by the Prime Minister in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday night last that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government does not intend increasing import control easily again, even if our reserves drop to such a level that we have to avail ourselves of our international monetary fund facilities,</block>

<p>are desiged to achieve just this: Maximum efficiency of production. There is another point: We need continued industrial development to achieve exactly what the Minister wants, namely to build up industry in the border areas or in the homelands. The exposition in June, 1960. of the late Prime Minister to which I referred said this quite explicitly, and I quote from page 8&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot be over-stressed, however, that the development of these centres can succeed only in a climate of general industrial development in South Africa.</block>

<p>The Minister needs it, but most important of all, we need industrial development to increase the standard of living of all the peoples of South Africa, and particularly of the non-Europeans. The tranquility of the Republic, often referred to by hon. Ministers opposite, is perhaps primarily due to the higher standards of living that the non-European has been able to achieve in the last few years. Sir Roy Welensky was right when he said that, &#x201C;poverty, not the vote, is the problem of Africa&#x201D;. As long as our people are progressing economically, we can at least hope for peaceful evolution. But if we should have a recession with attendant unemployment, we can run into a packet of trouble. Empty stomachs make angry and reckless people.</p>

<p>No, Sir, the hazards of this Bill are far too great. We on this side of the House are not prepared to gamble with the whole future of the Republic. It is industry that has to deliver the goods. They can help the Minister. The burden of industrial expansion falls on individual industrialists, and we must get away from this concept of enormous organizations putting millions of rand into the border areas: It just does not work that way. Industry has warned the Government quite clearly and quite unequivocally of what the results of this Bill might well be. I do not think we are impressed by the answer of the Minister that he and a committee of his departmental heads will in effect make the decisions for industry.</p>

<p>This Bill is dynamite; it is premature, illogical and ill-conceived. But I am not surprised, because it follows the usual pattern of legislation of this Government. This Government when it plans so often forgets to look at the picture as a whole: It stabs a little here and it stabs a little there, trying to make the unworkable workable. It takes no account of essential basic considerations, such as those set out by the F.C.I. and ASSOCOM statements. Also, it takes no account of ultimate effects. This is something about which we on this side have been hammering this Government for years, namely that when they do something they should try and work out the logical effects. It is the old story of cause and effect.</p>

<p>The Minister said that the Bill in effect is merely enabling legislation. It will enable him to do certain things. He has said that he will implement it in close and continuous consultation with industry by himself and his standing committee. But this is not the point. If the Minister wants decentralization in industry, his job is to investigate the problem properly and plan properly, in co-operation with his economic advisory council and with industry. If he were to do that, it might well be that he would get our support. But he will certainly not get our support for this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, over the years hon. members opposite have been reproaching us on this side of the House with not making any progress in regard to the ratio between White and non-White in South Africa. The hon. members have reproached us with there still being an influx of Bantu to our urban areas and they have reproached us with not having been able in recent years to prevent the number of Bantu in the metropolitan areas from still showing an increase. Lately they have been reproaching us in a mocking tone by saying that we were apparently not succeeding in reversing the stream. What we <span class="col_6839-6840" refersTo="page_0681"/>on this side of the House said, was that the programme to effect a change in the situation was one which extended over a long period and was one which had to be planned in advance and that it was indeed the plan and the intention of the Government to effect such a reversal of the stream.</p>

<p>Hon. members did not believe us at that time. What we experienced on Friday and what we are experiencing to-day is actually annoyance on the part of hon. members, annoyance which stems from the fact that with this legislation we are indeed doing what we have always said we would do. That is what we are experiencing. With this legislation we are paying the next installment for effecting this process which forms part of the policy of the National Party. Therefore I am very grateful that the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, as his personal statement of policy, that he would like to see the policy of separate development being implemented as soon as possible. We are grateful to him for also having said that he would always make his contribution to that. That in point of fact constitutes a confirmation of the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>I just want to remind hon. members of what the hon. the Prime Minister said when he addressed the nation for the first time. He said that we in this country would solve our own problems. By &#x201C;we&#x201D; he meant the White, the Bantu, the Indian and the Coloured. That is what is happening now.</p>

<p>However, there is a marked difference between the Opposition and us as far as the whole approach to this problem is concerned, as a matter of fact, as far as all the long-term problems with which we are faced are concerned. That difference is to be found in the fact that hon. members of the Opposition are only living for the present. They regard a problem as being a problem for the present generation only. They are not prepared to see any problem in its entirety also as far as the future is concerned. In the past hon. members of the Opposition were not prepared to cooperate with us in evolving a long-term plan for South Africa. That is the trouble with hon. members opposite. That is why they do not have a policy, because if a person merely lives from day to day and regards all problems as problems for the present generation, he cannot draw up a plan for the future of a country. In that case he cannot have any faith in the future either. Consequently the electorate too has no faith in those hon. members as far as a long-term plan for South Africa is concerned.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House adopt a different attitude. We hold the view that we are part of this country and also of the future of this country. If there are economic and social trends which threaten to heighten problems for South Africa in the future, we adopt the attitude that we cannot live for the present only but that we can and must make them take a turn; as a matter of fact, we adopt the attitude that it is the task of the Government to try to give direction to trends so as to determine the future, and not to leave the future to itself to take whatever course it likes. We know that in the past when hon. members of the Opposition were in power they simply allowed economic and social trends in South Africa to take their own course. Consequently it was necessary for this Government to combat the bad results of such trends. I now have one example in mind. I have in mind the policy of let things simply take their own course which was followed in regard to the large black spots which developed in the urban areas because hon. members of the Opposition did not wish to exercise any influence on the trend of that time. As a result of their failure to do so they have saddled the present Government with the task of clearing up the results of those wrong trends. Therefore I say that there is a difference of approach between hon. members opposite and hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>I want to concede to hon. members of the Opposition that the development of our large urban areas followed the same pattern as that which was followed in the rest of the world. The powers of development are always on the side of centralization. We want to concede that to hon. members. Those powers work against decentralization. There are good reasons for that. An important reason is that in any economic development production always seeks a market. Because the markets are concentrated in the large urban areas the trend is to enlarge what is already large. That is the line of least resistance. That is what has happened in South Africa. That is what is happening in the rest of the world too. There is an ever-increasing extent of centralization unless the Government of the day steps in and checks those powers. There is also another reason and that is precisely the one which was mentioned by the hon. member who has just sat down. That reason is that the private sector, which is co-responsible for economic development, does not concern itself about the results of centralization just as hon. members of the Opposition have never concerned themselves about the results of centralization in South Africa. Therefore it is our task to step in and to check these powers of centralization. I want to remind hon. members that this problem is identical to that with which other countries are struggling at present. The only difference between those countries and this country is that they do not have the large numbers of non-White labour we do have. Apart from that circumstances are identical. It is an economic law that something which is already large becomes even larger unless a government of the day steps in. Then I also want to tell hon. members that the reason why we are stepping in in South Africa is not that we want to be so much different to the rest of the world. We are doing so for the same reasons as those for which England, Germany, France and all Western countries have stepped in to prevent the centralization of large industries within a <span class="col_6841-6842" refersTo="page_0682"/>few areas. In other words, what we are doing here, is exactly the same thing as has been done by other countries of the world. That is being done for a specific reason. The economic advantages of greater centralization are outweighed by the social disadvantages which result from such centralization. This is what is at the bottom of this. We cannot simply allow something which is already large to become even larger without taking into account the social disadvantages involved. It is an economic law of the times in which we are living that the powers of development in all countries are on the side of centralization. Therefore the Government has stated that it is its policy to do something about this and to check this trend, and this legislation forms part of that plan.</p>

<p>The underlying principle of the Bill is to create a pattern in all further development in South Africa which will create order and balance in the socio-economic development of South Africa. That is the object of this legislation. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Minister stressed this point and made it very clear. Production factors and the factors of development, the most important of which are labour and water, have to be diverted in a specific direction in their flow. Just as we have to prevent labour from flowing to one single point, we have to prevent other factors of production being conveyed and taken at great expense to large centres whereby they will be made even larger with all the social implications involved.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go further and I want to say to hon. members that precisely because industry is involved in this matter and plays the biggest part in this process, this measure is one which must affect industry most strongly. The hon. the Minister of Planning is concerned in this and has the responsibility of introducing this Bill. It is in point of fact the planning of the future. A Government is responsible for planning and for a policy. It is the task of the Government to see to it that a country develops on a basis that will create maximum prosperity in the future. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty to do so. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty to accept this responsibility because financial provision must also be made by the State. It is very clear from Firday&#x2019;s debate that some hon. members adopt the attitude that economic development must be allowed to take its own course and that no steps must be taken against wrong trends as the industrialist has the right to establish his industries wherever he likes. That is not correct. The highest right is the right of a community to ensure order and security for the future. The economic law is not the most important one. The most important law is the social well-being of the entire community as a whole. That is the most important law. That is what hon. members opposite are overlooking.</p>

<p>That is the basis of this Bill but the hon. member who has just sat down said that as far as the Government&#x2019;s future planning was concerned the Government was not having regard to factors to which regard had to be had. According to them we were not having regard to economic development nor to the interests of the industrialists.</p>

<p>If we go further and make a projection of the present position in South Africa to the year 2000, we shall find the following. At present there is a gross national product of approximately R8,000 million. In the year 2000 the gross national product of South Africa will be in the vicinity of R36,000 million or more, in other words, a five-fold development of the present position. Now the important question is this: If the gross national product of South Africa has to grow to five times its present size in the next 35 years or so, and if that is to be the extent of development, the question arises whether this additional growth of the gross national product has to take place in the Vaal Triangle, in Cape Town and in Durban. Do we have to accept that the influx of people, Black and White, in the next 35 years to develop this gross national product still has to take place in these three areas&#x003F; If that has to happen and the entire South African nation, White and non-White, has to participate; that in point of fact will mean that the entire population of South Africa will have to congregate at these three points if they want to earn a living and develop and if the gross national product has to be earned at these three points in South Africa. A situation like this is unthinkable. We know that there is a trend which is in favour of the flow of labour to the larger centres. The world population is increasing at a rate of 2 per cent per annum but urbanization is taking place at a rate of 4 per cent per annum. This is a very clear trend towards the depopulation of rural areas and the development of a few urban areas. That is what we have to foresee now. We must foresee that this development either is going to take place at three points which are already large, with the result that they will become even larger and more seriously congested, or will have to be spread over the whole of South Africa whereby the labour and capital factors of production will be spread over the entire country. That is the choice we have, but hon. members opposite are confused about the alternatives. They think the alternatives are that development has to take place either in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg or not at all. That is wrong. The alternatives are not that it must take place either in Cape Town, Durban or Johannesburg or not at all; the alternatives are in point of fact either that development must take place in the large urban areas we have to-day with their increasing problems and a higher cost per unit and the development of more serious bottlenecks or that even greater development must take place, spread over the whole of South Africa. These are the alternatives we have. If one says that no development is the alternative to development taking place where there already is development at the present time, one is confusing the issue before this <span class="col_6843-6844" refersTo="page_0683"/>House. Therefore I say to hon. members that in regard to this matter they based their entire argument on the supposition that we would not go as far as doing what we had planned to do and that they adopted the attitude that we would hold back when the day arrived when we had to take action. They are confusing the entire issue by putting wrong alternatives to the nation. That is what it all amounts to.</p>

<p>That is quite true. However, there is something else which is also concerned in this. The development which has to take place in South Africa will not only mean the extension of existing industries. Many industries are still going to enter the field, industries which have not taken an uncompromising stand as regards their location, because if a visitor from abroad decides to establish a large factory in South Africa he has the entire country to choose from, including the growth points which have already been created plus those that will be created within the next few years. There will be no loss to him provided his factory is located at a place which is economically viable and established so that he may be able to do business on the best economic principles and may continue to do so. Now I just want to remind hon. members that if we are to have a gross national product which will continue growing&#x2014;and we know that in the future South Africa will not be restricted to local consumption only but will also become an export country to an increasing extent&#x2014;another, and an important, factor enters the picture and that is the growth of these industries at the growth points which have been created and which will be created closer to our coastal areas and closer to the existing harbours and others to be built.</p>

<p>On the east coast of Natal there is the present harbour of Durban. Richards&#x2019; Bay is being planned at present. However, if one looks at a map, one sees that these two harbours have such an important and favourable situation from a strategic point of view for any industrialist who wants to export, that there is no sense, in terms of future development, to foresee the development of industries in Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg only. Therefore I say that our industrial development in years to come will include a large number of new industries. Therefore it is out of the question that an industry will be prejudiced because it will be situated at a certain place. These will be industries which can choose to be strategically situated so that they may make an existence, because all the growth points which have been created and those that will be created, have been and will be created on the basis of proper economic reasons, ones which can be justified from an economic point of view, namely the availability of wafer, labour, transport, as a matter of fact, the presence of the entire infrastructure. Hon. members need not concern themselves about the creation of the infrastructure. The Government has never created a single growth point unless it has also been prepared to create the infrastructure required to ensure a good existence for the industry that wants to establish itself there. In other words, as far as all future development is concerned, it is unthinkable that South Africa will be able to develop on a sound basis if it has to develop on the basis of the few large cities which are already too large at the present moment. It holds greater economic advantages for South Africa to spread its development over a larger area.</p>

<p>I want to make a next point in this connection. There will be more opportunity for rapid and large-scale development in South Africa if there is to be decentralization instead of centralization. In other words, we have to see the future as a development of the entire country, development not only at the few known growth points but all over South Africa, where all the economic production factors are already to be found together and where the Government will supplement them by its spending and by the future creation of the infrastructure. If we undertake further development in the future, we shall be doing so with less social disruption and fewer difficulties when such development is undertaken at 30 or 40 points than when that is undertaken at two or three points.</p>

<p>That is what it will amount to. Hon. members adopted the attitude that there would be compulsion or force to force industries to a certain point but that is out of the question. The legislation contains provision in this regard and the hon. the Minister said very clearly that no established industry would be forced to move from a point where it was already developing. However, we have to take into consideration that if South Africa is to develop to its full potential, it will mean that White and non-White will have to be brought to the highest level of productivity; in other words, that there will hardly be any limit in the economic development of South Africa if 32 million people are going to be integrated with our development by the year 2000. Then there will be no limit to the economic development of the country. However, there is no obligation for an industry to move from where it is. The legislation provides that there will be a choice as regards further development, and we trust that there will be cooperation on the part of industrialists to carry through the plan with which the Government is concerned in this legislation. However, the hon. member for Constantia gave a r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of the fears and reproaches expressed by the English Press as well as by hon. members opposite. He said this legislation was &#x201C;hasty and wrong, unsound in principle, and has no regard for the much wider issues involved&#x201D;. This legislation has not been presented hastily. The policy which is now being implemented is one which was announced in 1948 and throughout the years it has been the policy <span class="col_6845-6846" refersTo="page_0684"/>of the Government to accomplish separate development in South Africa, and there has always been timeous warning from the Government to industry to tell industrialists that development will not continue to take place as they thought in the past it would, namely according to a policy of let things take their own course. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration also gave a clear indication to industry by saying that development in South Africa could no longer proceed as it did and that we intended taking a hand in matters. Therefore the reproach that we are over-hasty with this legislation is an unfair reproach. What is more, if the hon. member maintained that this legislation is &#x201C;unsound in principle&#x201D;, I ask myself what principle that is involved in this matter is an unsound principle, because the principle underlying this legislation is that there will be greater planning in the economic and industrial development of South Africa. When the hon. member said that &#x201C;the law has no regard for much wider issues involved&#x201D;, he did not define that more closely, because what issues are involved other than that there will be planned organization and that the various groups in the country will be employed in areas and parts where they can develop to the full and where they can share in the economic development of the country.</p>

<p>As regards the implementation of this legislation there is another very important aspect and that is the Bantu himself. In his Second Reading speech the Minister also had a message for the Bantu. The most important trend in recent years has been the breakthrough to the Bantu in regard to their acceptance of Government policy, and if those hon. members think that the Bantu is satisfied and will remain satisfied with merely being drawn into and herded together in the large metropolitan areas where they are subject to restrictions, they are very wide of the mark. In this the Bantu sees the possibility of bringing industry closer to himself to a place where he may participate in the economic development of South Africa without being drawn to a place where his ties with his own tribal system are severed. Years ago hon. members opposite still had the support of the Bantu for the implementation of their policy, but at present the Bantu wholeheartedly support the implementation of this legislation to the extent to which a breakthrough has been made to the Bantu himself, and to the extent to which he has the prospect that he will be able to participate in economic development in the future without his life being disrupted and without having to be herded together with others in a few industrial centres. If there are people who are grateful for the new prospects which are being created, they are the Bantu.</p>

<p>In respect of the attitude of industry itself, the opinion was expressed that industry did not support the Government in the implementation of this legislation. However. I just want to say this. If there are people who ought to be grateful for the protection and the assistance which they received in the past as far as the development of their own industries was concerned, they are the industrialists of South Africa. There is no other sector which has received more protection and encouragement than the industrial sector. If industries are asked to co-operate and to develop at designated points which will be created, then it is that sector that will be compensated for its co-operation. Industry is indeed being compensated for its co-operation. It is so that other countries also compensate their industries which are in the process of decentralizing, but the fact remains that the industrialists of South Africa are being compensated for their co-operation to establish their industries in these growth points in the expectation that these growth points will be strong and large enough to develop their own momentum and that the disadvantages which there still are at present will change into advantages for themselves. Therefore, if there is one sector which ought to co-operate with the Government in its appeal, that sector is the industrialists of South Africa, because they have enjoyed a great deal of protection in the past; they have received encouragement and tax benefits and they have received assistance from the State few industrialists in the world have received. Therefore we think we may expect, and we also hope, that the industrialists of South Africa will give their loyal cooperation in the implementation of this legislation. After all, the successful completion of the policy of separate development in South Africa is not something which will assist the Bantu only, but is indeed something which will have the effect that the industries in South Africa will be protected to an increasing extent.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that it is not merely labour which is an important factor in this legislation. What is extremely important is water, because water provision can be as much of a difficulty as labour can be. These two things go hand in hand. It is unthinkable that one has to concentrate millions more at a few points and then has to introduce the other production factors, including water, at these points at enormous expense. If Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban have to grow to four times their present size during the next number of years, there will not only be labour problems but also the difficulty of water which will hamper this development. Therefore this is not a measure which we must see as one which is concerned with the distribution of labour alone: it is a measure which has been introduced in good time to combat other difficulties. We have to take warning from other countries. There they are engaged in decentralization at much higher cost than that at which we will decentralize because it used to be a world trend simply to allow large economic concentrations and the next, generation had to undo those things which had been done incorrectly. Therefore I think that we may expect the industrialists of South Africa to co-operate so as to enable <span class="col_6847-6848" refersTo="page_0685"/>us as a young country to decentralize in good time and to prevent our having to try to solve virtually insurmountable problems at very high costs in the future if we have an excessive number of people concentrated at a few points in a small area.

<p>A great deal of what the hon. member for Soutpansberg has said I shall reply to in the course of my speech but there are one or two things I want to say immediately. He told us about the main areas of centralized industry and he said that it was, of course, unthinkable that industrial development in the future should be concentrated only in those areas. I do not know why the hon. member thinks that anybody believes that industry should be concentrated only in the areas of the Cape, the Natal coastal area and the Witwatersrand-Vereeniging triangle. We have had decentralization of industry in South Africa over all these years. Wherever there have been natural growth points, decentralization has taken place. Industrialists realize perfectly well that there are areas which they pan develop economically and which are not only the main existing industrial areas of South Africa. May I point out to the hon. member that in years gone by when industry moved to Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark, that in itself was considered decentralization, away from the Witwatersrand. We are having decentralization on an economic basis right now in an area like Phalaborwa. [Interjections.] It was not planned by the Government <i>per se.</i></p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I listened to the hon. member and I hope he will extend me the same courtesy. The Vanderbijlpark-Vereeniging area developed because of the natural resources there, because of proximity to the existing market, to the mining area, because of the proximity to coal, iron ore, water and power, and therefore this was a natural growth point. Phalaborwa too is a natural growth point, not because there happens to be a Native Reserve right next door to it, but because that is where the copper deposit is and that is why this great, vast town is developing around Phalaborwa. The hon. member's argument therefore is nonsensical. What one is against is forced decentralization on an uneconomic basis. The hon. member also talks about what is being done in other countries. He is perfectly right in saying that certain steps are being taken. In Great Britain, for example, steps are being taken in an effort to stop the further development of industry or even the erection of office buildings in areas like London and Birmingham, but I would like to point out that the whole of Britain is a developed country. The infrastructure that is needed for industry exists within easy reach of all the areas where decentralization is taking place. May I also point out that the market is within easy reach. You cannot possibly consider, on the same basis, decentralization in a huge country like South Africa, with its specific growth points, and decentralization in Great Britain where, as I have already said, the infrastructure exists practically everywhere. The two countries are simply not comparable. In America there are depressed areas in the south; there is the old coal mining area which has been worked out and which is a depressed area, and attempts are being made to bring about decentralization, by means of exemptions from tax, by means of loans at low rates of interest, etc.&#x2014;the sort of inducements which this Government was sensibly giving before it went in for this compulsory move.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have just told the hon. the Minister. Britain in any case is concentrated to a far greater degree than Johannesburg or Cape Town or Durban. You cannot compare Greater London with Johannesburg or the Witwatersrand; it is ludicrous. You have a concentration of 10 million people in Greater London and you have a population of just over one million in Johannesburg, and that is why you cannot compare the two. In America there are in fact no compulsory measures whatsoever to bring about the decentralization of industry. In Italy there are attempts being made to induce industrialists to shift from the industrial north to the underdeveloped south. Those attempts have taken the form of laws on the one hand to try to prevent further building the existing industrial areas in the north, and inducements to industrialists on the other hand, but this has by no means been an unqualified success. All that is happening is that certain branches are being opened in the south and those industries which have shifted happen in fact to be capital-intensive industries, not labour-intensive industries at all. The Italian example, therefore, is not a good example. In France efforts have been made since the war to try to persuade industrialists to leave the Paris area and to develop industries in the south. All that has happened there is that northern France has developed in the areas almost immediately outside the perimeter of the centralized areas. That is all that has happened. They have not been able to persuade or to induce or to compel industrialists to move to the southern areas which are, of course, the most depressed areas. Sir, it is not so easy; the hon. member should not think it is and nor should the hon. the Minister think that it is easy, with a wave of the wand, to persuade or induce or compel industrialists to move their factories from where they are or to stop expansion where they are or, if they are to open new factories, to get them to establish those factories exactly where hon. members opposite want them to be established; they will not do so; they go to the natural growth points, and the inducements have to be very great indeed to off-set the natural advantages that go with those economic <span class="col_6849-6850" refersTo="page_0686"/>growth points in any country. Perhaps even more important than what I have been saying is this: The differences between South Africa and other countries where these attempts have been made at decentralization are very important. Other Governments are not taking people already in employment and moving them to other areas as this Government is trying to do. Other Governments attempt to provide for the unemployed sections of the population. We are not only attempting to persuade industry to go to the reserves where there are unemployed people; we are going much further. We know what the policy of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education is, and the new Minister of Planning, swept away by enthusiasm, is going to do even better than the Deputy Minister because he is going to put forward the date which was set down originally for the turn of the tide back to the Bantu areas. This Government is going to take out of employment people already employed and move them elsewhere. There is quite a different basis for this sort of plan, if one can describe it in such a grand term, from the basis of the plans for decentralization which have been operating in other countries. I would point out also that the plan in other countries applies to industry as a corporate whole. It does not apply to one racial section of labour employed in industry. Nobody would think of moving industry from Greater London in order to accommodate Pakistani or Jamaicans. The plans apply to industry as a whole; they are not based on racial considerations at all.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s plan is practically entirely a plan based on the Government&#x2019;s ideological desire to move Africans out of the existing urban concentrations in South Africa. I say at once, and I think most people who study modern economics will agree with me, that in every country, whether it be a country based on free enterprise or whether it be a social welfare state, there is always a degree of planning involved in the economy of the country; I think that is accepted by everybody. South Africa&#x2019;s economy happens to be based on a free enterprise system and I presume that there is nobody in this House who wishes to change that. Well, if that is so, then I for one accept that a certain degree of planning is necessary, but it should be planning that is done with the full co-operation of the people concerned. In England, where there were plans for decentralization on the double-pronged basis of inducements as well as compulsion, and in America where there were plans for decentralization only on the voluntary, inducement basis, there was wide and lengthy planning and co-operation between all branches of industry and commerce and the Government. It was not simply a case of the Government or the hon. the Minister granting people interviews, as the hon. the Minister granted the Federated Chamber of Industries a long interview the other day. He said that he knew perfectly well that they were going to object anyway and therefore there was no point really in going into the matter in any great depth. This is very different from what has happened in other countries, because in other countries it is realized that prosperity and the future, with which we are all concerned, are based on maintaining the rate of expansion. The hon. member here, and I think the hon. member for Paarl who spoke on Friday, talked as if industry should be deeply grateful to this Government for all that it has done for industry.

<p>Oh, it has. Well, let me tell the hon. the Deputy Minister that it has been getting back tenfold what it has handed out, because if he bothered to study the tax returns over the last 20 years he will see that the contribution of industry and commerce to the coffers of this Government which is putting this plan into operation is ten, twenty times greater, for instance, than that of agriculture, which apparently is complaining that it does not get the same benefits. The position is nonsensical. We have given protection over a certain period in order to try and build up industries in this country, not in order to put money into the pockets of the industrialists, but in order to benefit the economy of South Africa as a whole; in order to provide employment for our growing population; in order to enable wages and salaries to rise commensurate with a decent standard of living. Those are the reasons why industry has been given certain protection as far as tariffs are concerned, and not because the Government wishes to do industry a good turn. So let us not be silly about this. As I say, anything that the Government has given to industrialists it has had back tenfold. I would say this lack of consultation, this complete lack of any attempt to obtain the co-operation of industry is a poor reward for everything that industry has done to build up South Africa since World War II in particular.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The principle unfortunately is the only important guide-line that we have: It is the one and only guide-line that we have, and in fact the Government itself has done no real investigation in depth before it decided on this haphazard idea. There has been no real investigation into the regional planning of industry since, I think, 1958, when the Viljoen Commission reported. There has not been an investigation in depth, so I do not know where the consultation or co-operation has come in. The Government has decided on a principle. I think it is a very bad principle anyway, but at least let it back up its principle with a proper investigation as to where it is going to persuade people to go, what infrastructure exists, what are the socio-economic costs of this plan, what are we going to lose by it, as well as gain by it. We have had nothing like that. We do not even have any criteria to know what is going to motivate the Minister&#x2019;s under-secretary when the captains of industry, who have built up the industrial structure of this country, come queuing up cap-in-hand, asking whether they may have permission to build on an extra room at their factory or to employ another five African workers. There just is no guide-line, no criterion at all. I think the Minister has been living in an euphoric atmosphere over the last few years and has quite forgotten the meaning of red tape. He rang the bells at South Africa House and everybody jumped it. But it is very different here, let me tell him. He is back home now and the same old system still applies: There are the same long delays, the same ensnaring red tape. Letters go unanswered. [Interjections.] Very pleasant it was indeed, in London, but then the Minister was not full of red tape in those days, but he is going to be from now on. He thinks all that is required is a telephone call. He said so when he made his Second Reading speech. He said all that will be required will be a telephone call from an industrialist to an under-secretary and&#x2014;there we are, it will be granted immediately. Well, well. The Minister has forgotten how civil servants work in this country. They are frightened to take decisions, for one thing, because they know perfectly well that breathing down the back of their necks is a superior who may not agree with a particular decision taken, and breathing down his neck is the Minister of Planning. He may not like the decision taken. So there are going to be interminable delays and there is going to be the most interminable frustration for anybody who wants to go in for any expansion. As I say, the Minister has forgotten how things are in real life: he has been living in a happy dream world of his own.</p>

<p>That was a dream too; that was part of the dream. So it is not going to be as easy as the Minister thinks. There are going to be frustrations and delays, and in the end, let me tell the Minister, industrialists are going to decide not to invest at all. I know the Government is relying on the fact that this is a closed economy and that industrialists have got no option but to invest their money in South Africa. There is an option, of course: They do not need to invest at all. Then they will put their money into property or into equities of some kind, and there will be inflation as a result because there will not be a productive result to any of this type of investment. So that is going to be one result of his measure. Overseas investors will not look here at all. They, fortunately for themselves, have other fields where they can invest, and they will invest elsewhere. They will not come to a country where they cannot employ one single additional worker, if his skin happens to be black, without the permission of the Minister&#x2019;s Department.</p>

<p>Why do they invest in Hammarsdale&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because Hammarsdale also happens to be a growth point. It is between two industrial areas. The Deputy Minister has got Hammarsdale on the brain. Hammarsdale lies between Pietermaritzburg and Durban, thus it is a natural growth point. Moreover, it has infrastructure, although I must say that certain of the amenities are not what I believe even the Deputy Minister would desire them to be. Rosslyn is also a natural growth point because it is near Pretoria. I cannot get it into the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s mind that there are growth points in South Africa that are natural, good, economic propositions where industrialists will go without any inducements from the Deputy Minister and where they will go without compulsion. But that is not what this Bill is about. This Bill is about compelling people to leave certain areas, or not to expand in existing areas, and this Bill is about ideology. This Bill is not about natural growth points. This is the thing that I have to stress over and over again.</p>

<p>What I want to know&#x2014;and I hope that the Minister will perhaps be able to tell me&#x2014;is this: What exactly does the Government hope to achieve in the ultimate by this Bill&#x003F; What does it hope to achieve&#x003F; I know that he talks about ideal ratios. Somebody cooked up this idea of an ideal ratio between Black and White. I understand it is practically 1:1. That is considered the ideal ratio. I pointed out earlier in this Session that there is in fact one area, and only one in South Africa, where the ideal ratio is nearest to attainment, and that, funnily enough, is in exactly the area that the Minister is trying to decentralize, namely the Witwatersrand industrial area. It is the triangle between Pretoria, Vereeniging and the Witwatersrand. I will now quote what no less a pundit than the Deputy Minister of Bantu <span class="col_6853-6854" refersTo="page_0688"/>Administration and Education said when he gave certain figures at a F.C.I. congress in Cape Town not long ago. He told us on the central Rand the ratio was 1 White to 1.9 Blacks; on the West Rand it was 1:2.4; on the East Rand it was 1:3.9, and in Vanderbijl&#x2014; naturally, because it is the area to which the hon. the Deputy Minister lives closest&#x2014;it was 1:1. So the ideal ratio in fact exists in the very area where hon. members on that side consider decentralization should take place. In the whole of the Transvaal the ratio is far less favourable: It is 32 Whites to 100 Blacks. In the whole of the Witwatersrand-Pretoria-Vereeniging triangle it is 62 to 100. In the rural areas of course it is most unfavourable of all: It is 9 Whites to 100 Blacks. That is in the white rural areas of the Transvaal. The Minister gave us the example of a friend of his. I think he said that he had 1,000 morgen of land and he employed 50 Bantu. He said he built them fine houses. Is this the ideal ratio&#x003F; Is it the ideal to have one farmer to 50 Bantu&#x003F; Does this satisfy hon. members on that side&#x003F; But this does not matter. As long as it is in a rural area, it does not matter at all. Then we do not need an ideal, and then apparently in the white rural areas the whole danger that has been worrying members, namely the future and the political demands of Africans, does not seem to exist. Why not&#x003F; Why when the ratio of White to Black is at its most unfavourable in the white rural area, does this danger not exist&#x003F; Why does it not worry hon. members if there are 3&#x00BD; million Africans on white farms&#x003F; Why does this unfavourable ratio not worry them&#x003F; Why is there no great political danger in having this huge number of Africans in the white rural areas&#x003F; Is it because they are scattered about&#x003F;</p>

I deny it because if we were really worried about it and if this argument we are using was an economic one, and not an ideological or political one, we would simply cut down the water supply to the Vaalharts irrigation scheme in order to solve the water problems of the Witwatersrand triangle overnight. But you see, Sir, hon. members wouldn&#x2019;t like to see water being taken away from farmers but to take it away from industrialists&#x2014; that is okay by them. Why&#x003F; Is it because of the voting situation&#x003F; It cannot be an economic argument. The Vaalharts irrigation scheme produces between R3 million and R4 million worth of crops per annum and for that they use more water than all the industries, all the commerce, all the mines, the S.A. Railways and all domestic users on the whole of the Witwatersrand. [Interjections.] So, if it is water from an economic point of view we are worried about, the solution is a very easy one.</p>

<p>If you are prepared to take it away from industrialists on the basis of an economic argument, then you must also be prepared to take it away from the Vaalharts irrigation scheme. In fact, there are alternative sources of water which can be brought to the Witwatersrand and with which I believe the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs is very busy just now. He is not going to wait for another drought period, I presume, before he does anything about increasing the water supply. So this argument about water is an argument which, if I may make a very bad pun, holds no water. It is absolute nonsense to use that argument. The Vaalharts irrigation scheme uses more water than everybody else combined in the whole of the Pretoria-Witwatersrand area. So, that is no argument at all.</p>

<p>I now want to point to some of the effects this legislation is going to have. As it is, we already have some vastly inflationary expenditure in our budget. We already have it. We have a vast defence bill which is unproductive and, therefore, inflationary. In addition to that a good deal, though not all, of the Bantustan expenditure is also inflationary because it is non-productive. Some of it&#x2014;that part devoted to the promotion of agricultural production in the reserves&#x2014;is productive and therefore non-inflationary. But a great deal of this expenditure on Bantustans&#x2014;for instance, the huge amount spent on housing the families of migrant labourers in the reserves&#x2014;is in fact an inflationary item. And now we have another piece of legislation which is going to reduce productivity in South Africa. The minute you start tampering with your labour set-up you are <i>per se</i> introducing a form of inhibition on the proper use of labour. That in itself is inflationary. We are going to enhance the scarcity value of white skilled and semi-skilled I labour by this measure. This is a further important <span class="col_6855-6856" refersTo="page_0689"/>effect which this Bill is going to have &#x2014;we are going to increase the inflationary spiral in South Africa. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, as well as the Minister himself when he introduced the Bill, talked about automation, as if that was going to be a solution to our problem. Sir, automation is possible only when you have a vast market for your products. Only when you have a huge market for your product does it become economically feasible&#x2014;otherwise not. The hon. the Minister talked about capital intensive industries being allowed in the existing areas of concentration. But it is not always easy just to have capital intensive industries. There are labour intensive industries which have also got to be established near your markets, near your sources of raw material, near power and near transport. But apparently the Government thinks that it can, merely by putting a Bill on the Statute Book, steer the whole of the industrial development of this country in any direction it wishes. Well, I should like to say that I think this is a Bill which is going to have very serious economic effects, if it is implemented. We are often told that when job reservation was introduced there was a tremendous outcry. We are repeatedly being told that when job reservation was introduced the Opposition said it was going to ruin the industrial structure in South Africa and that we would all be reduced to poverty. At the same time we are told by hon. members opposite that despite those prophecies there has been tremendous economic growth. But the true position is that the Government does not implement job reservation&#x2014;that is the real answer. It has become a system of permits and exemptions and, therefore, job reservation has not had the effect which was predicted. Whether or not the Government is serious about implementing this Pill I do not know. I can only say that I hope the Government is not serious about implementing this Bill. If it just wants a political talking point, I cannot care less. But what I care about very much is the actual implementation. Well, if it is implemented I think we are in for very serious economic consequences.</p>

<p>Well, then I say we are in for very serious repercussions in this country, at a time when we should be doing our best to build up industry on the most efficient. the most economic and the most competitive basis possible in order to offset the slow decline in our gold-mining industry. Because gold as an earner of foreign exchange is on the decline, or will be in future unless new goldfields are discovered or unless there is a rise in the price of gold. But other things being equal, the gold-mining industry cannot be expected to field the same amount either in revenue for the Government or as an earner of foreign exchange. So, it should be now that we should be doing our very best to nut industry on the most competitive basis possible in order to sustain our future population at an increased standard of living or even at the existing standard of living. It is not only the hon. member for Soutpansberg and his party who are concerned about the future of this country&#x2014;other people are too. I believe this Bill is going to have a critical effect on our industrial development, if it is implemented. The late Prime Minister used to talk about the choice before South Africa being either rich and mixed or poor and white. He said that if this choice were put before us. South Africa would choose rather to be poor and white. Well, up to now we have not had to make this choice, but if we do have to make it, thinking persons would, I think, prefer to be rich and mixed. But if this Government goes ahead and implements this Bill, the interesting thing is that we won&#x2019;t end up by being poor and white but by being poor and mixed because nothing, absolutely nothing, is going to be able to change the major pattern of population movements in this country, which are similar to the population movements in all other industrializing countries.</p>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. G. J. KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think we can say that we saw the hon. member for Houghton parading in her best clothes here this afternoon. We are appreciative of her as a person, but the political course she has adopted is a blind alley as far as South Africa is concerned. This afternoon we saw the hon. member here in the robes of a prophetess, a prophetess of doom. She spoke about &#x201C;serious economic consequences which will flow from this Bill&#x201D;. I differ from her diametrically and I shall indicate why later on in my speech. I think precisely the opposite&#x2014;this Bill is in fact going to stimulate economic development and will result in outstanding economic results for South Africa, i.e. precisely the opposite to what the hon. member thinks to see in it.</p>

<p>I differ from her completely in regard to another point which she made towards the end of her speech, i.e. that this Bill will have the tendency &#x201C;to increase the inflationary spiral&#x201D; in South Africa. I think that if this Bill has any effect on inflation, it will have precisely the opposite effect. It will help to combat inflation in South Africa. Therefore I differ from her completely in that respect as well. She also made the point that one could not compare greater London with Johannesburg or the Witwatersrand. There is, of course, a certain amount of truth in that. But after all, that is not what we are doing. What she has failed to realize is that all world authorities in the field of major urban development have warned that one must begin to combat overconcentration of populations in time. That is what we are doing in South Africa. We do not want to compare ourselves with larger countries. We do not want to compare ourselves with places such as New York. We want to be one step ahead of the rest of the world. We want to set an example in Africa by beginning in time and learning from the errors which other countries have made in regard to this <span class="col_6857-6858" refersTo="page_0690"/>process and against which they have warned us. There I also differ completely from the hon. member. I do not want to spend much time on the hon. member but she also said that the hon. the Minister did not understand what the red tape position in our public service was like and that this legislation would result in the industrialist not being able to manage in that regard. I want to content myself with saying that the hon. the Minister has given the assurance that everything will be done to prevent any delay in regard to industrial development. As far as this Bill has a bearing on that, any other delays will also be prevented. She ought to accept that assurance. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I also want to raise a point which the hon. member for Parktown brought up here. I do not think it can be allowed to pass unnoticed. The point is that he said: &#x2018;This Bill spells doom for the small man&#x201D;. He added: &#x201C;Border area development does not cater for the small man because it is too complicated&#x201D;, etc. Have I repeated what the hon. member said correctly here&#x003F; The truth of the matter is in the first instance that it is incorrect to bruit the story abroad that this Bill &#x201C;spells doom for the small man&#x201D;. Surely that is not the case. I shall elaborate on that later on. The opposite side of the matter, i.e. to say that the small man is not interested in border industry development or has made a practical living out of it, is equally unfair and incorrect. What is the truth of the matter, Sir&#x003F; The truth of the matter is that quite a few small men have over the past six years found a very good means of subsistence in border industry development in South Africa. For example, I want to refer to Mrs. Grimm, of Pietersburg, who began her concern with less than 20 Bantu. During recent years she has built up that concern to such an extent that there are already more than 70 Bantu employed in that concern. So I can mention various other examples. The Industrial Development Corporation makes building complexes available at some of these border industry development projects, more or less as one would equip flats, for prospective small border area development industrialists. That building or complex of buildings can be rented from the I.D.C. by one, two or more persons. One who is small makes provision for a so-called small man who is interested in border industry development. So I can go on and show the hon. member that his statement that &#x201C;this Bill spells doom for the small man&#x201D;, to which he added that in border industry development there was no room for the small man, is completely false and devoid of all truth. That is why I should like to root it out. I want to say that he is not doing his country a favour by making that allegation. In future, before making such a serious allegation, one should at least get one&#x2019;s facts straight.</p>

<p>In the first instance I want to say that with this measure the National Party Government is erecting another milestone along the road South Africa is taking. It is erecting this mile stone in full view of the hon. member for Houghton and in full view of the hon. Opposition. In this way we have erected most of the milestones in South Africa in full view of the Opposition. If there was ever a need for a measure in South Africa, then it is for this measure which is at present before the House. The principle which we adhere to is a very simple one and I want to state it very thoroughly and candidly to the Opposition here this afternoon. The principle we adhere to is this. The Government must see to it that the increasing number of Bantu in our white areas and particularly in our white metropolitan complexes is reduced. We are committed to that. We are also committed to that through the statement made by the former Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, who even went so far as to mention a date, i.e. 1978. I want to state this here this afternoon with all the emphasis at my disposal. I am myself a young man and the hon. the Minister is also a young man and I want to associate myself with what he has said by also stating this afternoon that we as the younger generation are determined to carry that policy of the National Party Government into effect. Let the Opposition or anybody else have not the slightest doubt about that. We shall carry it into effect and we are going to carry it into effect. How are we setting about accomplishing this&#x003F;</p>

<p>The National Party Government has very carefully tried out every method of accomplishing this. Let us admit candidly to one another that the implementation of this policy has been tried out very successfully over the past 20 years. What do we now find in practice&#x003F; The faster the Government tried to reduce the Bantu in the white areas the faster the creators of Bantu labour, i.e. the industrialists in the industries and particularly in the resultant businesses which have arisen as a result of the industrial development, are bringing Bantu to our white areas. Greater numbers of new Bantu are being brought in because an insatiable demand for Bantu labour in our white areas has apparently developed in South Africa. It has become almost like a bottomless pit. In the meantime the white metropolitan areas are becoming Black. We see this to an ever-increasing extent, particularly in the Witwatersrand complex. Bantu on demand has simply become the fashion in South Africa amongst our industrialists.</p>

<p>What we have also seen with the introduction of this Bill was a very interesting phenomenon, namely that industrialists even want to go further, and I am not being critical of this fact, I only want to state it here in all fairness: They not only want Bantu on demand, they also regard it as their right to obtain Bantu on demand. Where does that come from&#x003F; Surely that is not correct. Surely we cannot allow that in South Africa under our circumstances. In practice we now have the situation that we have almost begun to get a &#x201C;two-way traffic&#x201D; here. On the one hand the Government is keeping out the Bantu and on <span class="col_6859-6860" refersTo="page_0691"/>the other hand the creators of Bantu labour are literally drawing Bantu labour into the large metropolitan areas as if with a vacuum, pump. The result of that is that the Government&#x2019;s policy cannot under those circumstances be carried out in all fairness and honesty. Now it must be realized that this is not a new discovery which has just been made. The National Party Government has been aware of this since 1948 when the National Party Government came into power. As far back as 1951 the National Party Government was ready to introduce a Bill which was almost the same as this one now before the House. However, it was then decided to settle the matter between the interested parties by way of a &#x201C;gentleman&#x2019;s agreement&#x201D; and to see how things would shape in subsequent years. That measure, which is now being introduced in this House almost 16 years later, was then temporarily abandoned. What happened&#x003F; In the interim, in spite of the fact that all parties concerned in that agreement did their best to adhere to it and that the trouble therefore does not lie there, South Africa developed so rapidly that although they all tried honestly and sincerely to honour that &#x201C;gentleman&#x2019;s agreement&#x201D;, the position was that as a result of this rapid economic development in South Africa and the pressure arising from the growth in the population in the metropolitan areas, particularly on the Witwatersrand, such a &#x201C;gentleman&#x2019;s agreement&#x201D; was simply no longer practicable. That is all. That is why hon. members are now being forced to face up to this Bill as a positive measure. We must do something about the position, and that is why this measure has, under the present circumstances in South Africa, become an absolute <i>sine qua non.</i></p>

<p>I want to emphasize very strongly that this measure is not aimed at factory or industrial development at any place in South Africa. It is not even aimed against industrial expansion on the Witwatersrand. The United Party and the hon. member for Houghton tried to drop a few hints along those lines, but that is not correct. The Opposition speakers wanted to create the impression here that this legislation is going to fetter industrial development. Nothing is further from the truth. This legislation is in no way aimed at industrial expansion. But it is in fact aimed at the wrong type of industrial expansion. What is the wrong type of expansion&#x003F; Bantu labour intensive industrial expansion in a place like the great metropolis, the Witwatersrand, where one is already sitting with more than one million Bantu, is the wrong type of expansion within the white area. The sole aim of this Bill is to take certain steps in respect of that wrong type of expansion. That is why I associate myself fully with the hon. member for Heilbron when he states that the Opposition have come forward here with the &#x201C;bogey of compulsion.&#x201D; We maintain that this legislation is not aimed at combating industrial expansion. On the other hand it is also not aimed at forcing any form of &#x201C;compulsion&#x201D; upon industry to establish its factories in border areas, or anywhere else for that matter. There is no such thing, and that is why I am emphasizing now that clause 3 (4) makes this point very clear. It states that in the application of subsection (1) the expansion of a factory&#x2014;and you will note that (a) in the Bill is now being deleted&#x2014;means an increase in the number of Bantu workers employed by that factory. Thus the consent of the Minister through the Inter-departmental Committee has to be obtained for that type of factory expansion only. This Bill has nothing to do with the extension of buildings, or with expansion through Coloured, or Indian, or white labour, nor with any other forms of expansion. It only deals with an expansion in the number of Bantu workers. That must be stated very clearly. The intention, in the national interest, is to send industrial development in South Africa in the direction where Bantu intensive industries will be most necessary and where they will really be able to serve South Africa to the greatest benefit of our country and all population groups.</p>

<p>Let me state as emphatically as possible that South Africa has more reason to decentralize than any other country in the world which I know of. In addition to all the other reasons for decentralization which apply elsewhere&#x2014; and the hon. members opposite know as well as we on this side do that decentralization today is one of the most vital economic problems in the entire Western world, something with which the major countries are concerning themselves with every day&#x2014;in addition to all these reasons for decentralization, which I do not have time to go into at the moment, South Africa also has a very special additional reason, a predominating reason, a compelling reason, which is that we in South Africa are also doing this for the sake of the survival of our white nation, and we are also doing it in order to promote the welfare of the non-White nations in our country. That is why I say: Who can argue against that&#x003F; The Opposition cannot argue successfully against that. Let me say this. A leopard does not lick his white spots only; he licks his black spots as well. That is what we in South Africa are doing. We are looking after all the sectors of our population and all our peoples in South Africa, and not one section only. In this connection one finds ineptitudes like this one, in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 25th May. Listen to this argument, upon which a major part of the Opposition&#x2019;s arguments were based. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it were not for the Government&#x2019;s intentions of using the proposed legislation to further the implementation of apartheid, a revised and curtailed Bill for the decentralization of industry in the country could have served a useful purpose.</block>

<p>What next! They are therefore in favour of decentralization, but because this Bill is actually farthering the implementation of apartheid, <span class="col_6861-6862" refersTo="page_0692"/>they are against it. Can the United Party not yet realize that the possibilities of the fair implementation of the policy of separate development for the Bantu and for the non-Whites in South Africa is not only offering, but has brought stability, happiness, peace and prosperity, and that these things have been brought to them because it is the only honest, moral and humane way in which the mutual inter-relationships in South Africa can be regulated so as to bring happiness and prosperity to all sections&#x003F;</p>

<p>Do they not see the results of this policy, and do they not hear what the chiefs of the Bantu people themselves are saying&#x003F; Since they are at present stating that we are dealing here with ideological legislation, and that if it had not been for the ideological aspect of this legislation, they would have supported it, I just want to say that I have never heard of such nonsense. Has the United Party not yet learnt that the so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; has been a total failure in Africa&#x003F; Why was it a failure&#x003F; I know what the Bantu are saying. I sat around the beer pots with them in Zululand for nine months. Do you know who they are jeering at there&#x003F; I am saying this in all fairness and not in any derogatory sense. They are jeering at the liberalists and the progressives in South Africa because they say that those people are not honest, because the rate for the job means that, seen from the Bantu point of view, the white liberal European sets the rate and the black Bantu gets the job. That is why it is doomed to failure and it will always remain a failure. That is why the Bantu, not only in South Africa, are to an ever increasing extent accepting that separate development offers them real and actual opportunities for development because it is based on the human, moral and honest standpoint that what one demands for oneself what one is prepared to give to the other man without any strings attached to it. That is what we are doing. That is why I say that when the United Party states that if it had not been for the ideological aspect of the Bill they would have supported it, then that is the greatest nonsense I have heard for a very long time.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Newton Park, who made a very pleasant speech hem which we all enjoyed, especially when he said, &#x201C;Watch us now&#x201D;, came along and stated that the industries were not the greatest offender as far as drawing Bantu to the metropolitan complexes was concerned. But the mistake he made is one many of us make on the golf course. He did not follow through properly on his swing and that is why he sliced the ball. He did not follow up his argument properly. For what are the facts&#x003F; He completely missed the fact that industries have a catalytic effect. Why does the hon. member for Newton Park want the third Iscor in Port Elizabeth for example&#x003F; Why does every member of the House of Assembly want the third Iscor in their areas&#x003F; The reply is quite simple. The reply is that a third Iscor, or any industry, has a catalytic effect and the catalytic effect is due to the fact that it attracts other businesses and industries, and in that way economic development takes place. In that way one finds a concentration of population to begin with and eventually one finds an over-concentration of population. Therefore his argument that the industry is not the greatest offender is, to a certain extent, a fine-sounding argument, is even perhaps half true, but it is not the full truth because it is the catalytic agent&#x2014;and this is a very important argument because it forms the whole of the essential point of the legislation before us&#x2014;that is why it is essential that a proper limit be placed on business undertakings which arise as a result of the industrial development, which is the catalytic agent. That is precisely what this measure is doing.</p>

<p>Throughout the world, in science as well as in practice, the over-concentration of what is called &#x201C;men, mortar and machines&#x201D; is being viewed as a comprehensive problem, in regard to which timely warnings must be issued and which must also be avoided in time. That is what we on this side of the House are honestly and sincerely doing to the benefit of future generations. All factors, as the hon. member for Soutpansberg correctly stated, range themselves on the side of centralization and therefore, if you do not take balanced measures to stabilize that thing, then you are really letting things take their own course. That is an art which the United Party was fully conversant with, and still are; we on this side of the House do not intend following their bad example in this regard. That is why we as Government are being compelled to take the necessary steps and apply the necessary means to counter an over-concentration of population. I do not have time now to go into this matter, but you yourself know, Sir, that there are negative measures, such as control, etc., and that there are positive measures such as increasing the rate of growth of towns and cities, as we are doing with the border industries. But I want to confine myself to the third means and that is inducement to decentralize economic activities and particularly industrial establishment, and here I would like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Houghton said. She was quite correct when she said that it was not simple to draw industries out of Johannesburg or out of the Witwatersrand, and persuade industrialists to establish their industries elsewhere. I agree with her wholeheartedly; we know that it is not so easy. That is why I want to make a plea here this afternoon and say that we in South Africa should do more to work out a dynamic programme which is based on inducement to decentralize our industries even further, quite apart from this measure.</p>

<p>Since our circumstances in South Africa are so exceptional I should like to see South Africa serve as an example to the rest of the world so that South African Members of Parliament or our information officers or ambassador there, will be able to say: South Africa is <span class="col_6863-6864" refersTo="page_0693"/>doing this, that and the other by means of inducements to encourage the decentralization of industries. I can quote to you this afternoon what happened at the Shannon airport in Ireland, which was for the most part useless land. There they even went so far as to apply the following inducement to encourage industrial development in that area. Firstly, they granted industrialists tax exemptions for 18 years; secondly, they exempted all raw materials used by industries from customs duty; thirdly, they made interest free loans available to industrialists for the erection of industries, loans which in some cases amounted to more than half the capital investment; fourthly, they made factory buildings and industrial units available at nominal rents; and fifthly, they supplied them with all the necessary services such as power, water, roads, and housing. There are other examples from Poland and Italy which one could mention. I want to advocate that we should in future pay more attention to these positive inducements. I do not doubt that this will in fact be the case.</p>

<p>Then in conclusion I want to come to what I think is an important point, a point which is not as yet receiving the recognition, consideration or evaluation it deserves in South Africa. I am referring to a point to which Dr. T. S. Rautenbach referred, in a brilliant paper delivered on 16th September, 1966. I think that he, as far as the theory of science, as well as in practice, is concerned, has made a very valuable contribution in this respect. I am speaking of his reference to the identification of the cultural factor as a production and an establishment factor in the economy. Mr. Speaker, we in this country, and particularly those overseas, should realize this more thoroughly in respect of South Africa, and I think that particularly the Opposition must realize what this cultural factor in our industrial development in South Africa really implies. Let me mention the following example. There was gold on the Highveld 150 years ago, but the fact that the mineral, the resource had been there 150 years prior to that did not induce the Bushmen to begin mining the gold. Their cultural background is such that they were not able to do so, and that is why they did not do so. It was only 150 or more years afterwards that the white South Africans began to mine the gold there. That is what the cultural factor implies.</p>

<p>In this regard I also want to mention the following example. In England a Lapp woman was recently thrown out of an industry. They found that in the British industry she was a complete failure, but in Lapland she was the best milker of reindeer there, which in the culture of Lapland is of primary importance, just as skill in the industry in London is of primary importance. Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to be funny but I am convinced that if some of the sophisticated ladies from certain parts of Johannesburg or some of our other large cities had to build a fire with wet kind ling behind a tiny windbreak in the Transkei then this would probably have taken place to the great amusement of the chiefs and the other people watching it. Why&#x003F; In the culture of the Xhosa women it is an entirely normal thing to build a fire with wet kindling or to have to go and look for the goats in the veld on a rainy afternoon and then come and milk them yourself. But for a lady from Houghton it would be an unpleasant experience. Mr. Speaker, the cultural factor is a very important factor. I now want to mention another example in which the hon. member for Houghton will be very interested. Rosenthal, as you know, made very fine vases. His great-grandson has now established a vase industry here in Rosslyn and do you know what his experience has been&#x003F; It is very interesting. He found that after three to four months a Bantu girl became as proficient in that vase decoration work&#x2014;painting the golden bands on that beautiful Rosenthal vase&#x2014;as a German lady with three to four years&#x2019; experience. It took the Bantu girl only three to four months to develop that skill and craftmanship, whereas it took a German girl three years. Why&#x003F; Because the Bantu are born for that kind of thing. The Bantu girl imbibed it with her mother&#x2019;s milk. That is the cultural factor in one&#x2019;s industrial development and establishments.</p>

<p>Since we in South Africa, particularly in respect of our industrial development, have to deal with this cultural factor, a factor which is of very vital and particular concern to us, the Opposition must realize that a great service is being done to the Bantu in particular by means of this measure which affords practical recognition to the cultural factor of the Bantu in order to enable the Bantu to bring out the best in himself, not there in the dirty and terribly over-populated Johannesburg where it is more difficult for him to adjust himself and open up and beat out a path for himself than it is for the white man. Surely it is much easier for him if he is able to do so near his home than it is for him to do so under conditions which are strange to him. In this way one would be making the best use in one&#x2019;s industrial development of the cultural factor. Mr. Speaker, I see that I have very little time left. I just want to tell you that Professor Hobart Houghton, a celebrated South African economist, defined &#x201C;hell&#x201D; very effectively the other day: &#x201C;The definition of hell is to spend eternity on a suburban commuter train.&#x201D; There is a great deal of truth in that statement. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Primrose, who has just sat down, stated earlier in his address that it was fundamental to this legislation that the increase in the number of Bantu in our white urban areas must be checked and that the number of Bantu in those areas must be reduced. Other hon. members have said that it is fundamental to this legislation that it is intended to make the cities whiter.</p>

<p><span class="col_6865-6866" refersTo="page_0694"/>Now, I want to ask the hon. member for Primrose what is going to be the position in the large industrial areas that are now to be created under this scheme of decentralization, in the border areas. Surely these new areas will have a ratio of Whites to non-Whites even more unfavourable in the light of the test which is applied by hon. members opposite. Where will they exist&#x003F; These new, large industrial areas will exist in white South Africa, and instead of having an adverse ratio&#x2014;as hon. members opposite look at it&#x2014;of white to black at Point &#x201C;A&#x201D; in white South Africa, we will after a period of Nationalist Government and the fulfillment of Nationalist policy have the same ratio at point &#x201C;B&#x201D; in white South Africa. Every hon. member who is really concerned with the reduction of the number of Bantu in white South Africa should advocate the extension, the building up and the establishment of industry within the Bantu areas so that the Bantu stay there and do not come out, so that they are removed from white South Africa, because it seems to me that immediately independence is acquired by these black areas, those industries will grow within the Bantu areas. They will grow when there is freedom within those areas to invite entrepreneurs to start industries in the Bantu areas, and our decentralized industries sited on the borders at the end of what is much worse than a suburban railway line which the black workers will use to come out of the Bantu areas and to work in our border industries, will be in a less competitive position, because industrial employment will be offered to the Bantu within their own homelands.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a second claim as far as this Bill is concerned and that was that this Bill will stimulate economic development. I do not think there is a single hon. member in this House who is not concerned with and would not like to do all that he can to stimulate economic development. But is the hon. member correct in assuming that that stimulation will be found in this Bill&#x003F; I want to test that against one or two fundamental truisms. [Interjections.] The hon. member is wagering again. I do not want to take on wagers with the hon. member. I think it is a truism that commercial and industrial development is advanced or is retarded according to the extent which normal recognized economic considerations can be taken into account and permitted to play their part in economic and industrial life. The establishment of industries is motivated in South Africa, which is a capitalist country, by the profit potential of the investment that has to be made by the industrialist. That is the difference between our country&#x2019;s approach to industrial development and that of the socialist or communist states. In turn that profit potential is assessed on the basis of the demand for the commodity to be manufactured and the existing facilities to meet that demand.</p>

<p>It has been correctly said by the hon. members for Primrose and for Houghton that where the demand exists, then the question of where the industry shall be located is determined firstly, by the existence of the infrastructure&#x2014; the housing, the services, the light, the water &#x2014;secondly, by labour resources, and thirdly, by the situation which is conducive to easy handling and easy marketing. Those are factors which are taken into account. If any of those factors is unfavourable then, as the Government has found already, there must be some compensation for the industrialist. The compensation so far has been in the form of inducements which have been offered to industrialists as regards tax concessions and certain railage benefits to establish their industries in the border areas.</p>

<p>That being so, let me hasten to say immediately that there has been no objection by industrialists, and there is no objection by this side of the House to decentralization as a basis of planning for the future of this country. There is no objection whatsoever. In fact, the attitude of the F.C.I. is made clear in a statement which was made at a conference attended I think by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our attitude to decentralization is in line with the statement made in 1956 by the late Prime Minister, the hon. Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, then Minister of Native Affairs, when he assured industry in speeches and by letter (1) that decentralization would be on a voluntary basis, (2) that it is not the intention of the Government to create two competing industrial complexes, and (3) that it was the intention to put new industries or industries particularly suitable for Native labour in these areas.</block>

<p>In the Republic, with its surfeit of available labour we are faced with a particular problem, namely that there is an excess of labour for the industrial and commercial demands in our cities. For that reason we of the United Party have always supported a measure of influx control so that we do not have the industrialized areas swamped by Bantu who are unemployable or for whom there is no employment. We have supported that. I come now to the Bill before us. Whilst we on this side agree that decentralization can have merit and value for the development of this country, and whilst we agree that there should be a certain measure of influx control, we disagree on the application by the Departments concerned of these two methods to attain the objects set out in the legislation which is before us now.</p>

<p>Influx control at the present moment should result in demands for employment in Bantu areas, or near Bantu areas. Similarly the Government has in its power the ability to stimulate localities which can develop into growth-points to which industries will be attracted by the availability of land, the availability of services, and of housing for their employees.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister&#x2019;s advisory committee was certainly correct in its advice which it gave <span class="col_6867-6868" refersTo="page_0695"/>to the Prime Minister and which was attached to his statement when he referred to the encouragement of decentralization of industries to the border areas. This is what the Advisory Committee said:</p>

<p>It cannot be overstressed, however, that the development of these centres can succeed only in a climate of general industrial development in South Africa. A programme which merely involves the large-scale transfer of existing factories from the present industrial centres to centres in the border areas will have none of the stimulating and cumulative effects associated with economic development. What is envisaged is that a larger proportion of the new factories should be located and a larger share of the increased output be produced, not in the already over-populated urban areas, but rather in the border areas.</p>

<p>So far we agree wholeheartedly. Now we come to the departure which this Government and this Bill is making from this advice. This advice continues:</p>

<p>Special inducements will therefore have to be directed at those industries which supplement the present production in a growing market, and which are in a position to utilize fully the Bantu labour and raw materials that are freely available in or near the border areas.</p>

<p>In other words, here is a question of inducement for the establishment of these industries. That policy of inducement, according to the report of the planning committee on border areas, has had a measure of success. I see that after 6&#x00BD; years, according to page 4 of the report, and with an investment of approximately R220 million, it has been possible to find additional employment for 57,100 persons. That is what has happened under the regime of the present Government. The report reads as follows:</p>

<p>Over the past 6&#x00BD; years Government assistance in one form or another has led to the establishment of 98 new industries. The corresponding figure for expansions of existing undertakings in border areas is 61.</p>

<p>The permanent committee is aware of a further 90 new undertakings and expansions of existing undertakings which have been launched in border areas since 1960 without assistance. It is clear that having created confidence in the border areas, Government expenditure and other assistance have resulted in considerable investment by the private sector in those areas.</p>

<p>Why is it now necessary, if that report is correct and it is for the year 1966, for this Government to depart entirely from its policy of inducement and not compulsion&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am very happy to deal with the question of the hon. the Minister; I take it that the purpose of the hon. the Minister is that he will utilize this Bill. Unless it is going to be a showpiece for talking purposes, it must be applied to some area in the Republic. Once it is applied there is a complete freezing of what is then there. An industrialist who comes to South Africa and says that he would like to open a factory in Cape Town for example, will be advised that Cape Town is now a closed area. The Government has laid down that he shall not open a factory there but he may ask the Government for permission to do so. They may give him permission to do so.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am having some difficulty because of the discussion which is going on across the floor. I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that if he can find no evidence of decentralization by compulsion, when he prohibits expansion in one area and permits it in another, then I cannot argue with him about the meaning of the word compulsion. Let me go further. This is where the ill-effects of this measure on the country come into play. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to this view which has been expressed by others and not only by me, namely that if he refuses the establishment of an industry which is proposed for area A, he has no assurance whatever that that industrialist is going to start his industry in area B. He may well leave this country. He may well find that his prospects in Rhodesia, Lesotho or Botswana are far better than here. He may even wait for the independence of the Transkei to open his industry there and get the full benefits of working away from our present centralized areas. I believe that this is important because this Bill has only one reason for its appearance. It is not to stimulate industrial development. It is as the hon. member for Primrose said: &#x201C;We want to stop the Blacks coming into the cities&#x201D;, or as <i>Dagbreek</i> said: We want to make the cities whiter.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I have said repeatedly that I am against this Bill. This Bill has one purpose and one purpose only. It is to give <span class="col_6869-6870" refersTo="page_0696"/>some air of realism to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. It is interesting if we look at this measure against the background of the past 19 years. This Government started off with apartheid which is the separation of White from non-White. Having started with apartheid it found that it was not enough. It was not solving anything in this country. It then proceeded to the next stage, which was separate freedom. It then found that separate freedom was achieving nothing and solving no problems. Now we have come to this Bill, which is to compel separate development not by inducement but by the controls which the Minister is now to take for himself in terms of this Bill. I think it is time that the country took account of the cost which it is now going to be asked to bear to implement this course which the Government has set upon, namely separate development&#x2014;to estimate the cost to our standing as a country in the economic and the industrial world, when industrialists must know that if they come to South Africa they may establish their industries or develop existing industries only by the grace and favour of the Minister who is entrusted with this Bill. Industry sees that it is now in the hands of the Government. There are many industries of which the hon. the Minister will be aware which have established themselves for the purpose of staged development&#x2014;which is not an unknown plan in industry&#x2014;and which are now told that their future is in the hands of the Minister in terms of this Bill. When one looks at the cost of the removal of these industries and the attempt to provide the infra-structure of which we hear so much, one finds that to provide for 57,000 employees, an amount of R220 million had to be invested by the industrialists concerned&#x2014;and we still have to hear the cost to the country&#x2014;for providing the services and the housing in those new areas. In considering the cost there are two aspects which must be taken into account. The first is whether economic development in South Africa will be stimulated by this Bill. I think that we have had the answer to that. You cannot stimulate development in a country where there is no freedom for the industrialist to take into account normal factors as to when and how and where he shall establish his industries. Secondly, will enough employment be provided by these border industries to make separation a working reality&#x003F; Surely 57,000 employees over 6&#x00BD; years is a mere drop in the ocean of Bantu for whom employment must be found in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The clauses which the hon. the Minister has taken from the 1947 Act are quite good. Let us look at the conditions under which this Bill is being introduced. There are to be inducements. There are supposed to be inducements, which will now lead to the stimulation of our economic growth. What is the hon. the Minister of Transport doing at the present moment&#x003F; What is he doing with his freight charges on manufactured and raw materials&#x003F; Is there any correlation between this Minister and the Minister of Transport&#x003F; The Minister of Transport does not encourage decentralization, even at the place where the raw materials are to be found, because of the rail tariffs which he applies. It is cheaper, as the hon. the Minister will know, to remove raw materials to the Witwatersrand and to work them there, than to transport the manufactured article to the Witwatersrand, because of the rail tariffs which are applied. I hope that the hon. the Minister of Planning, who is new to this position, will be frank enough, as the hon. the Deputy Minister for Bantu Administration was, to say to us that he too is not satisfied with the creation of the infra-structure in a place like Rosslyn, for instance. It is no inducement to industrialists, when one finds now that it is only at this stage that power and rail facilities are being brought in for the extensions at Rosslyn. That is a created border area, in close proximity to Johannesburg. When the hon. the Minister quoted the <i>Daily Dispatch,</i> he quoted it as being an approval of his policy. I think he should read that article again, because the problem in the East London area and in the Ciskei is that the Deputy Minister to the right of him is sending the Bantu out of the Cape. The housing at Mdantsane and the other places is not yet complete. The local locations are crowded and filled to the brim. One only has to go to a municipal congress to hear the difficulties of the municipalities. What the <i>Dispatch</i> said is: For heaven&#x2019;s sake, get on with something. Give these people a job before they become a danger and a source of unrest in our midst. That is what the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> said to this Minister. If he finds comfort in that report in the <i>Daily Dispatch,</i> I am very glad, but it is a problem which is growing, because of what is being done by the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of compulsion. I want to say that if this Government wishes decentralization to succeed, it must have regard to the Advisory Committee. I want to suggest that the Advisory Committee was quite correct in its views when it dealt with the question of co-operation with private <span class="col_6871-6872" refersTo="page_0697"/>enterprise. The Committee, in paragraph (a) (1) of section 4 of its report, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the establishment of industries and the production of goods and services are basically the task of private enterprise, the cooperation and participation of private enterprise are of decisive importance to ensure a successful policy of decentralization.</block>

<block name="quote"> If one could divorce politics from industry, we would agree with every word that has been said so far at this meeting.</block>

<p>That was in regard to the question of cooperation in dealing with this matter.

<p>The hon. member for Green Point has said something to which I should like to reply. He said: Let us presume this measure is a success; then one would find that where at present there is a certain Bantu White ratio as point A, a new ratio will simply develop at point B. Presuming it so happens that this measure is not a success, then the question occurs to me: What would be the Bantu-White ratio at that point A in the course of years&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Establish the industries inside the homelands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>That argument of his holds no water. What will in fact happen, and the hon. member cannot dispute this, is that the White-Bantu ratio will decrease, because a very large section of the Bantu will go and live in another area in course of time, and in that area the White-Bantu ratio will not be so high, because the Bantu will live in their own homelands; and they will live there with their own families. But now the hon. member says, and he repeated this by way of interjection, that we should take the industries to the <span class="col_6873-6874" refersTo="page_0698"/>Bantu homelands. Apparently the hon. member will then support it. But it will take place in due course on the basis announced by the hon. the Minister earlier in the debate. Now I want to say that industries in the white areas adjoining Bantu homelands will naturally engender industries inside the Bantu areas. It will be the preparatory work in order that industries may arise there as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point quoted from the report of the Standing Committee to demonstrate how much success has been achieved through voluntary incentive measures. This is the first time I have heard the Opposition support decentralization in border industries by way of incentive measures. This is the first time I have heard the Opposition support the Government&#x2019;s border industry policy, founded on going there voluntarily, merely by making concessions. This is the first time I have seen the hon. member praise that and use it as an argument, because in the past they have always merely disparaged it. In fact, somewhat later in his speech that hon. member contradicted himself and again disparaged it, and he asked what we had actually achieved; we had created only 57,000 jobs in the course of 6&#x00BD; years. But no matter what one undertakes, one cannot have success immediately. The entire undertaking must first get into its stride. But let us take these 57,000 jobs that have been created. It has been established that for every man working in the factory there are two working outside the factory on roads or on construction, etc. [Interjections.] The man operates the machine in the factory but outside there is a lorry that has to be driven, and surely roads have to be built&#x003F; It has been proved scientifically that at least two persons are employed in addition to the one working in the factory. These 57,000 workers engender jobs for 171,000 people in that complex. If the hon. member will not believe me. he should read the report. It is also stated there that according to the 1962 census 35 per cent of the Bantu population were economically active; that is, 35 people in employment provide food to 100 people. That means that approximately three times 171,000 make 510,000 people who were provided with a living by those 57,000 workers. Can any hon. member dispute that&#x003F; If this had not happened under the policy of that hon. member, these half million people would have gone to point A to disrupt the White-Bantu ratio incalculably. They would have gone there in terms of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy to have land registered in their names and build houses and keep their family there. That is my reply to the hon. member.</p>

<p>If one studies this Bill, there are two points on which one should be quite clear. The first point I want to get quite clear is that this National Party Government has through the years always been the friend of the industrialist in South Africa. In 1924 it was a National Party Government which initiated the protection policy for industry in South Africa. It was this Government which through the tariff policy enabled an industry to stand in this country on young legs and to develop to take its full place in our economy. Other people then opposed it, the forerunners of the hon. members on the opposite side. They wanted us to produce only food. The countries of the Commonwealth were to produce only food and basic materials and Britain was to be the manufacturing country. That was their policy. This Government said that South Africa should have its own industries. We went further and said, &#x201C;Buy South African&#x201D;, but there were other people in South Africa who raised the cry in the city councils and in the public sector and in the private sector and who said, &#x201C;Buy British&#x201D;. It was a choir, and if we forget what the sopranos and the altos and the tenors and the basses in that choir looked like, we need only look at the opposite side, where those hon. members are sitting. This Government introduced import control to protect our currency, and everybody knows that import control was used to protect our industries. We need not argue about this. We need not convince the industrialist that this is the case. The industrialist knows this. The National Party took the lead and performed pioneering work in fields in which other people were not prepared to do it, in the form of an Iscor and a Sasol. Thus we established mighty industrial complexes in this country. The way for the entire chemical industry was cleared by the National Party Government. There is no doubt about this. There can be no argument about this. We may tell the country and industry that in this Government they have had a friend through the years, not in words but in actions, for more than 30 years. [Interjections.] Now the hon. member makes interjections and asks: &#x201C;What about the private undertaking&#x003F;&#x201D; How was this industrial development brought about&#x003F; The Government encouraged it and handed it over to the private undertaking, that it may make profits from it for its shareholders. The I.D.C. initiated development and as soon as it was possible, it handed it back to the private undertakings. This Government convinced the country through words and actions, and this will be the case in the future as well, that it lends high priority to the principle of private enterprise in our industry. I therefore submit that the Government is introducing this Bill with a clean conscience in respect of industry. Having said these two things, I should like to ask two questions.</p>

<p>The first question I want to ask is: What is the role of industry in our national economy&#x003F; And the second is: What is the role of the Government in our national economy&#x003F; The role of industry in our national economy is complex. It is to produce goods and to create wealth and to help to provide jobs for our growing population, and to strengthen commerce in South Africa, locally and abroad. All these comprise the role of industry, but that is not all there is to it. Industry in South Africa is not industry in Japan or industry in the <span class="col_6875-6876" refersTo="page_0699"/>U.S.A. It is industry in South Africa, and in being able to work for itself and to earn profits, and in having all the freedom in the world, it is ultimately, as all sectors of our economy, engaged in rendering a service to the fatherland, and it has to render that service. It may be granted all the freedom in the world, but one freedom it cannot and may not get, and that is to develop in a direction which is not in the interests of the fatherland. Here I come to the second question: What is the role of the Government in the national economy&#x003F; I think it is obvious that the role of the Government is to take care of the development and the prosperity and the security and the survival of the country and its people, in the short term and in the long term. For that reason it is a decisive role, a predominant role. Because both industry and the Government have these extremely important tasks to fulfil, it goes without saying that they must cooperate, as they co-operated in the past and as I want to say to-day that they will co-operate in future.</p>

<p>But I want to discuss the Government&#x2019;s task briefly from three viewpoints. The first is from a social viewpoint. I am glad that the hon. member for Newton Park is in the House. In the interests of its country the Government cannot allow 95 per cent of the people to occupy 5 per cent of the land, or 5 per cent of the people to occupy 95 per cent of the land. In this Session, only 14 days ago, the hon. member for Newton Park charged us with the depopulation of the rural areas. He blamed the Government for that. To-day we are introducing a measure which will help to return people to certain parts of the rural areas at least, which will seek to correct the very thing they complained about 14 days ago. But now the Opposition is opposing this Bill. The hon. member for Rosettenville is so to speak brimming over with it. The rural areas look to this Bill for a glimmer of hope. It offers them a modicum of hope, because the entire economic process throughout the world is against them, but here they find a modicum of hope. But in the light of the Opposition&#x2019;s reaction to this Bill, the rural areas can come to only one conclusion. The embrace of 14 days ago was nothing but the kiss of Judas. It was only so many words. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>But the Government is also playing an economic role in the national economy. I do not want to dwell on this at length. With the best will in the world I cannot see how industry can claim for itself that freedom and say that it is going to expand as much as it likes and that it is not going to care where its power and the water and the transport and the communications come from. Surely it is in the discretion of the Government to say: &#x201C;So far I can provide it, and beyond this point I will not, cannot, and am not going to provide it.&#x201D; Have hon. members on the opposite side forgotten last year&#x2019;s water crisis&#x003F; If we just consider that, is it not enough justification for a measure such as this&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the third place I want to say that part of the Government&#x2019;s task is also a field which the Opposition calls an ideological objective. Have the Opposition not also an ideal&#x003F; Have they no ideals whatsoever&#x003F; I want to make it very clear to them that this Government is prepared, that it is committed and that it is its irrevocable intention to safeguard and to guarantee the survival of the white nation in South Africa, and in that process we shall do full justice to the other population groups in our country.</p>

<p>This Bill is an instrument which we can also use in order to realize this ideal of ours. Sir, I want to tell the Opposition that it will be an evil day for South Africa if South Africa&#x2019;s present and future should be seen solely from a materialistic point of view; it will be an evil day for South Africa if the freedom, on which hon. members on the opposite side have so much to say, should be exercised in such a way that there will no longer be room for ideals in the policy of South Africa.</p>

<p>Now that I have said these things, Mr. Speaker you will ask me: &#x201C;What, then, is the solution&#x003F;&#x201D; I repeat&#x2014;and I hold to this&#x2014;that the solution lies in co-operation, co-operation between the industry of South Africa and the Government as the over-arching factor. I am not going to talk about agriculture now, because agriculture is not affected by this. I say the solution to the problem lies in co-operation between industry and the Government. I just want to add that co-operation must have a basis; that there must be a framework of cooperation, and in this Bill we have the framework before us.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>On this basis and within this framework co-operation may come into being. The implementation of this Bill will preferably take place on a basis of co-operation. Hon. members on the opposite side may perhaps point out to me that this Bill provides for strong powers or measures. Let us presume that is true; let us presume that for argument&#x2019;s sake. I do not concede that, but let us place that on one side of the scale. Against that, on the opposite side of the scale, we have this picture which I outlined at the beginning of my speech, a picture of a Government which over a period of more than 30 years has proved its goodwill and its good faith in respect of industry in South Africa. If I do this, the scale balances completely. Are hon. members really thinking that we on this side of the House would seek to hamper the industrial development in the country&#x003F; That we would seek to impede it, that we would make it impossible&#x003F; Our problems and their solution in South Africa demand that we should maintain <span class="col_6877-6878" refersTo="page_0700"/>a strong and growing economy; they demand that we should try continually to increase the standard of living of all our people; our position in the world demands that. Would the Government mischievously break down the industry&#x003F; Of course not. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine what a wonderful thing it would be for South Africa if we could have all this development and if we could have it balanced, systematic and evenly distributed, and if in that very process we could also ameliorate our problems&#x003F;</p>

<p>You will permit me, before I conclude, to tell you why I personally support this Bill. I also support it because I think that it could be an instrument by means of which we are going to get industrial development in Queenstown, in King William&#x2019;s Town and in East London. Not only will we get industrial development in those places, but in terms of this Bill we could also get industrial development in Upington, De Aar and Graaff-Reinet; under certain circumstances we could get it in any town in the country. By way of special incentive measures we could also get industrial development in a place such as Upington; it has already been designated as a development area. This Bill will help us to get industrial development in areas where we need it very much. It could help us to get industrial development in the border area, from Queenstown down to East London, an area which will carry a very large population in future, where one of the focal points of the population concentration in the Cape will lie. Sir, I welcome this Bill because I see in it an instrument by means of which those areas are in future going to be developed into large industrial complexes. I should like to know whether the hon. member for East London (City) is going to help me; I should like to know whether the hon. member for East London (North) is going to help me; I should like to know whether the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town is going to help me, or whether they are going to have themselves taken in tow. I look forward with great interest but with little hope to their response in this debate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me, in conclusion, to address a humble word to industry. I want to tell industry that I think they are performing a wonderful task in South Africa. I think industry should accept this Bill and should come and tell the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Very well, we are going to co-operate with you.&#x201D; In that way they can again take the initiative within the framework of this Bill. Development in the country will not come to a standstill as from to-morrow; development will still continue, but in this way industry could render the greatest national service it has ever rendered. It could enrich itself, and at the same time it could do a very great service to South Africa and her people. In my humble fashion I make this appeal to industry in South Africa to-night, and I appeal to the Opposition also to help us to develop South Africa more systematically in future, in the way envisaged here and in the interests of all her people, in order that we may hand over a better country to posterity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown, to my mind, introduced one new argument. He indicated that this Bill was being introduced to stop the depopulation of the platteland. I do not know whether he was referring to white or to non-white labour. I think it extremely unlikely that white labour will go to the platteland and the rural areas. In any case, where would they go to; where would they get the capital from to invest in farming&#x003F; It seems even more unlikely that non-white labour will go there, even if they did so they would immediately fall foul of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education who has just indicated that an important purpose is to get them away from the platteland.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman also made the point that he wanted industry to co-operate in this matter. Sir, I think under many circumstances in the past industry has in fact co-operated, but they view this legislation in a totally different light, and you do not expect people to co-operate willingly towards their own destruction, and that is what is involved here as they see it.</p>

<p>This debate has now been running for about half the time set aside for it. I think that the general pattern has emerged, and I think it is appropriate to try to give a summary now of the main arguments that have been advanced in favour of this particular legislation. I think they are all really contained in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech. All that has followed since then from the Government side has been variations of the same theme.</p>

<p>Sir, what has been put before this House&#x003F; It was indicated to us in the first instance that this is important legislation. This we all readily accept. Indeed, we have the firm conviction that perhaps this legislation is so important that there is no clear recognition on the part of the Government of the tremendous and far-reaching repercussions which will follow in the wake of its introduction. We feel also that this is legislation that was hastily introduced. We feel that it is legislation that was introduced without the prior consultation which legislation of this kind warrants, and certainly without the degree of consensus of view which will ensure its effective implementation. Indeed, the hon. the Minister has indicated to us that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Council was divided on this issue. Sir, one could not expect otherwise because we have serving on this council the top economists of this country. The hon. the Minister says that they are merely advisory but why have an advisory council then&#x003F; Do you only accept their advice when it suits you and when it does not suit you, then you discard <span class="col_6879-6880" refersTo="page_0701"/>it&#x003F; Quite obviously these gentlemen would be opposed to legislation of this kind. Judging by their utterances in the past they have been most outspoken on this score. I refer to Professor Hobart Houghton, probably one of the best informed economists in this country, who, when he talked recently about Government control and Government pressure to bring about decentralization which might put industry in a position where it will not enjoy maximum locational advantages, had this to say:</p>

<block name="quote">These factories will forever be burdened with additional costs which would reduce their efficiency, hinder the expansion of exports and be a perpetual burden on the economy.</block>

<p>Sir, this is as severe an indictment as we conceivably could get.</p>

<p>We also want to know from the hon. the Minister whether the effects of this legislation have been determined on the projected growth figures of our real income&#x003F; It is known that we have set ourselves a target of a real growth rate of more than 5 per cent a year. This is based on a number of assumptions, not the least of which is that there will be an average annual improvement of about 3 per cent in productivity. We see nothing in this legislation which will increase productivity and we see a lot that could detract from it. Sir, the hon. the Minister himself has reservations; that is why in his introductory speech he said rather airily that we must not be guided by short term economic advantages, but as the hon. member for Parktown pointed out, this is a crucial issue in South Africa&#x2019;s development at the moment. We must increase our domestic purchasing power. Exports will for a long time be thwarted by boycotts and by severe competition from the outside world, and it is important to remember that we will have to lean heavily on a growing and expanding domestic market. But the hon. member quite rightly also pointed out that what is essential is that the standard of living of all our people, particularly that of the non-Whites, should be advanced as rapidly as possible. Those of us who are concerned with the non-Whites all know that there is a small margin within which you can operate here, that if your unemployment figures get beyond certain limits then you are in for very real trouble, and that what we must not have at this stage in South Africa is unemployment of this kind. But we must also take up the slack which is created by a declining gold mining industry; we must also pay for our defence commitments which at this stage are heavy and might become heavier still. We therefore say that it is of paramount importance that the rate of economic development of South Africa should not be allowed to slacken off and that nothing must be introduced to impede that development, and this legislation, as we see it, will do precisely that.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let us look at the principles involved here. Let us first of all see whether this is a planning Bill. Sir, nobody opposes planning. But have we really any idea of what is involved in industrial planning&#x003F; In sitting one particular industry you have sometimes 20 or more variables determining its size, its shape, its type, its location&#x2014;indeed, it becomes so involved that a modern company often has to computerize the information because they cannot work it out. It becomes unmanageable and, therefore, they have to get a computer to help them. And what is happening here now&#x003F; The Government is going to do it on a national scale. By one stroke of the pen the hon. the Minister now assumes unto himself the right to decide the optimum location for a range of factories which might differ from turning out toys on the one hand to making locomotives on the other hand. If you do this planning on an individual industrial basis and you make the wrong decision no great harm will be done because the effects will be localized. But if you try to do this on a national level and you make a mistake you will be faced with economic calamity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this legislation says that there must be planning of our economic resources. This is important and we all accept it. The hon. the Minister in his introduction of this Bill said he saw South Africa as an economic entity, as one. But then having said that, in terms of clause 13 of this Bill he expressly excludes the Bantu areas which he has indicated have important resources in terms of labour, water and all sorts of things. By this token these areas can build up economic systems which will clash directly with our own. If ever there was a contradiction in purpose and objective then that can be found in this particular clause.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that we must decentralize. Well, nobody is against decentralization as such. However, as we have indicated in the past there must be judicious decentralization and it must not conflict with established economic laws. Let us now look at the various industries which could conceivably be moved from the areas where they are at present. Obviously they will not go voluntarily to these new areas. If they did so there would be no need for this legislation. They must now be diverted, deflected, to these new areas. For the purposes of this discussion I daresay one could say there are three types of industry. First of all there are those that are supply orientated. They are based on a raw material, like a mine, and you cannot move it. It must stay where it is because it can function only in that particular spot. The second type of industry is demand or consumer orientated. Here one thinks for example of a beer brewery. You would not site a beer brewery in the Northern Cape when the demand is in Johannesburg and if you did so nevertheless you would probably be bankrupt within a year.</p>

<p>I want to follow my argument through. We are left with the third type of industry, that which economists call foot-loose industries where locational factors are not of very great importance and therefore they could be moved within limits. But let me ask the Minister, how many of these foot-loose industries are there and how many people do they employ&#x003F; How many of them are there, in fact, which could be dispersed in this particular way&#x003F; We suggest that there are very few.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to talk about Paris and London. But the hon. the Minister has introduced another term, a term which sounds more impressive than it is helpful&#x2014;the term &#x201C;labour intensive industry&#x201D;. When he talks about an industry being labour intensive he obviously means Bantu labour intensive. But let me ask the hon. the Minister which are these so-called labour intensive industries&#x003F; Mention them to us. If you exclude the mines and agriculture as falling within the category of industries that cannot be moved and if you look at the factories and manufacturing industries that are left and look at their salary and wage figures, you will find that in general this works out at roundabout 10 per cent. So, to talk about labour intensive industries is, as I have said, more impressive sounding than useful.</p>

<p>The Minister also referred to the research which was done in Italy and he told us that there they determined that the additional cost, the social cost of housing a worker, rose steeply as the number of people in a particular city increased.</p>

<p>Well, the social costs of accommodating the worker rise steeply. We accept that. But everybody knows that these advantages are greatly outweighed by the economic advantages which follow from a greater degree of centralization. Let me put the following to the hon. the Minister. He had mentioned Italy as an example. Now, the southern areas of Italy have been depressed for many years. There they have had schemes for many years to industrialize this area but with what success&#x003F; A minimal degree of success because the conditions in southern Italy are not suited to this type of development.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has had two hours to introduce the Bill and he could have another two hours to reply to the debate if he wanted to&#x2014;in all, eight times the time I have got. So let me continue. The hon. the Minister then introduced another argument. He indicated that all that industry wanted to do was to go and plonk itself down, site itself and then the State must provide the infra-structure and all the other services that are needed. But the hon. member for Houghton has quite rightly pointed out that the State does not generate its own capital; it is not the State&#x2019;s own money that is used&#x2014; for this purpose it is money it gets from industry and commerce. I do not know precisely what contribution they make in terms of revenue and direct and indirect taxes but as far as the real national product in this country is concerned industry and commerce contribute approximately 70 per cent. So, they pay for it in any case&#x2014;where else would the money come from&#x003F;</p>

<p>With a view to justifying this particular legislation the Minister then quoted certain examples. He referred particularly to London, Paris and Athens. This is what the hon. member for Primrose is so anxious to hear about. Let us examine this in a little more detail. To begin with, he was talking about cities and not countries. But let us leave it at that. His example of Greece and Athens one can dismiss right away because we all know that the greatest single source of foreign revenue in Greece happens to be tourism&#x2014;people go there not because of the present but because of the past; they go there not to look at the factories but to look at the monuments. The Minister then referred to the United Kingdom, especially to London. But here the situation is totally different. Here we are dealing with a mature economic country with a population density probably 40 times our own. But why quote Britain as an example&#x003F; Everyday hon. members sneer at and decry the socialist state which exists in Britain. But tell me just this one thing: Will the hon. the Minister even though Britain has a socialist state indicate to us one single government agency in the United Kingdom that has the economic power he takes unto himself in this particular Bill&#x003F; Why in any case quote Britain as an example to us when we all know that its rate of economic development at the moment is only half of what it is in many other continental countries&#x003F; Most people who are familiar with Britain&#x2019;s position give as one of the reasons for this the undue controls that exist there.</p>

<p>Then we come to France. But here the situation is different. The hon. the Minister is not informed on what is happening there. The French decry the idea of trying to plan the total economy, because they say it is not possible. All that the State there tries to do, is to withhold and grant, the emphasis being on the granting, certain marginal facilities. Indeed the whole basis of their system is taken up in their concept, which they call <i>&#x00E9;conomie concert&#x00E9;e.</i> It means that it is a voluntary system, where they decide on certain broad plans of development. The system works because everybody must agree with it. To illustrate this, I can only quote from the Frenchman Gruson <span class="col_6883-6884" refersTo="page_0703"/>who is probably the greatest authority on the French system., who writes:</p>

<block name="quote">A planned economy is an economy where development is assured, not by constraint, as in an authoritative plan, but by the free adhesion to a communal view of forecast patterns of development.</block>

<p>Give that to our industry and they will be very happy. Give them a forecast of patterns of development and there will not be a single one who would not be happy with it. But that is not what they get in this particular Bill.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister turned to some interesting demographic figures. He indicated that if the present, industrial areas were further developed, it would mean more Black people and it would be necessary not only to accommodate them industrially, but also as far as living space is concerned. The total number of Bantu people in the so-called urban areas in 1960 was estimated at 3.7 million. Experts predict that by the end of 1980, there will be 6 million. What is the meaning of this&#x003F; It means that over this period there will come onto the labour market 600,000 Bantu males who would be seeking employment. It means that every year more than 30,000 of them will come to the market, purely from the urban areas, in other words purely those who are born there. What does the hon. the Minister want to do with them&#x003F; He surely will not suggest that he is going to send them back to the Bantustans. That would be chasing the end of the rainbow. What would they do if they got to the Bantustans&#x003F; Tomlinson mentioned that in the Bantustans themselves 50,000 people would be seeking jobs every year. Germishuyzen and others estimated it even higher, at 70,000. It is easy to talk about stopping the tide and turning it back, but is it really meaningful to the people who use these words&#x003F; Do they really know what is involved&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also seems to shy away from urbanization. He painted a picture of an idyllic sort of pastoral scene. People must not come to the cities, because then they have long distances to travel and health figures become worse. It might be so but industrialization is synonymous with urbanization. One does not get the one without the other. Everybody like Rostov who has written on this subject throughout the years, has shown that this is what creates the spur to industrialization. Urbanization is there. We just cannot depart from it. The hon. the Minister says he wants to remove and reduce the &#x201C;trekpleister&#x201D; in the urban areas. That is not the way to go about it. If one wants to siphon off people, one must put the &#x201C;trekpleister&#x201D; somewhere else. It is the only worth-while argument that was followed by the hon. member for Primrose. He is quite correct the &#x201C;trekpleister&#x201D; must be put somewhere else. We see no provision in this Bill for any &#x201C;trekpleisters&#x201D; of any kind.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it is the greatest positive measure that has emerged during the last 20 years in the economic field in South Africa. It is a positive measure, but it embodies a negative method. A plus and a minus, we learnt in mathematics many years ago, always give one a negative result. What we want is a system that would be voluntary. This one is mandatory. What we want is a system that would be indicative. This one is imperative. What we want is a system of planning that would be based on natural resources. This Bill, as we see it, is based on a system of planning which centres around racial ratios. What we want is a system which would provide for fiscal inducements for industry to go to certain areas. What do we have in this particular Bill&#x003F; It is a system of controls. This Bill means industrialization through the permit system. But what is more, it introduces a system of economic bureaucracy, such as probably does not exist in any of the free countries of the world. With this system of economic bureaucracy will also come very many evils, because it might well initiate an era of consent by advantage or favour. These are some of the many problems the Government will have to face.</p>

<p>This particular legislation makes no provision whatsoever for developments in business, for phenomena, such as business cycles, which require keen anticipation, shrewd judgment and dynamic and immediate reaction to developments. This Bill seems to suggest that one could have industry <i>in vacuo,</i> that one could pick up the phone and ask for new labour and then wait a few weeks before it is assigned to you. The hon. the Minister in introducing this legislation said it was a socioeconomic measure. But then he himself went on immediately, and he tied and related it to, the Government&#x2019;s separate freedoms plan. Every speaker who has spoken on the Government side has reinforced that particular line. That is why we see this Bill not as a socioeconomic measure; we see it as a political measure. We see it as just one further brick in the ideological wall that the Government is trying to build in South Africa. We have it even from somebody who is as well placed, as the Minister of Finance, who said earlier this Session that his was the Government of ideology. He said he was pleased about it, because ideology stems from the word &#x201C;idea&#x201D;, and it therefore meant that his Government was one which had an idea.</p>

<p>It is exactly the same as the word discipline which stems from the word disciple. But what the hon. member does not tell us is that in colloquial speech, an ideology does not mean an idea, it means an obsession with an idea. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What is suggested here by hon. members is that industry could grow in a sort of pepper pot fashion. One could merely scatter it all over the place. Industry, however, is like a plant. It needs very careful conditioning. Under certain <span class="col_6885-6886" refersTo="page_0704"/>conditions it will thrive; under others it will wither and die. Our whole economic system is based on what economists call nodes of development or growth points, certain centralizations, clusters of economic development. These have a vital role in the whole economic growth pattern, because they provide concentration of supply and demand, and hence they reduce unit costs. They also facilitate management. They provide the ancillary services that are needed. But more important than this&#x2014; they provide certain foci of purchasing power, and this is one of the fundamentals of economic development.</p>

<p>Whenever we raise any of these issues, whenever we draw attention to this, what response do we get from the Government&#x003F; They tell us that they have majority electoral support. This is the new era of the dogma of the vote. It does not impress anyone to say that the majority of the voters vote for certain things. It does not prove that that particular point of view or measure is right. The majority of Germans voted for Hitler and the majority of Italians voted for Mussolini. Does that prove that they were right&#x003F; What has happened to those countries to-day&#x003F; And what has happened to those leaders who thought they were right&#x003F; Look at the heritage that they have left. Look at the monument they have created through their own pride and conceit. All that has happened in this country is that the voters have been sold a pup. For 18 years they have been promised apartheid. Where is that apartheid&#x003F; They have not got it now, and they will never get it. This we must remember. You could fool some of the people all the time, you could fool all of them some of the time, but never all of them all the time. One day it will become clear to the voters of South Africa that they have been buying something, that they have been voting for something which they will never get. When that day dawns, and when that realization occurs, the retribution will be swift and severe.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are three aspects to this important measure. The first is the principle it contains, the second is its details, and the third relates to the implementation of the Bill. I straight away want to concede and agree with other hon. members of this House, including hon. members on the opposite side, who say that the implementation of this measure will play a very important part as regards the measure of success that will be achieved. Now, it is appropriate to say at the beginning of my speech that the M mister has given important assurances to this House, to industry and to the country that should not be lost sight of. The Minister said that he would see to it that no unreasonable delays would occur when he had to take decisions and in the implementation of those decisions. He said that this measure would not disrupt industrial development, and that it would be applied within the framework of normal economic fluctuations&#x2014;which form part of a system based on private initiative&#x2014; in such a way that it would not prejudice our position of economic prosperity and progress. He also said that, in spite of what the hon. member for Hillbrow had said, he was giving attention to the question of positive concessions and to what could be done to make the inducements that already exist stronger and more attractive. I think industry can and will to a large extent be satisfied with those assurances given by the hon. the Minister. Mention has been made here of the question of cooperation. The Minister said that he was seeking consultation with industry, and not in connection with the principle involved, but in connection with the implementation of the measure. That is important. I think that is a very important point that the Minister made, because we all accept that we need the cooperation of industry in order to apply this measure successfully in practice. I want to say to-day that I believe, as I know industry, that they accept the laws of the land, and that once this measure has been placed on the Statute Book, they will lend their co-operation in order that it may be successfully implemented. The industrial sector is not disloyal; industry is not unpatriotic.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the principle of this Bill. The Western world is deeply concerned to-day about the widening gap between the rich and the poor nations. That gap is still widening, and it is doing so at a rate of approximately 25 per cent per annum. But the Western world is not only concerned about this widening gap&#x2014;they are also concerned about the widening gap among the various sections within each country itself. That is a source of deep concern. I have here a report entitled <i>Economic Development Assistance</i> which was issued by the Research and Policy Committee of the Committee for Economic Development, and in this report three reasons are given why attention should be given to this question of increasing poverty. The first is for the sake of their national security. On page 10 of the report we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Deeply resented poverty and a frustrated desire for progress are not conditions in which stability, peace and independence can be expected to grow.</block>

<p>That is the positive aspect of this measure. A great deal of emphasis has been placed here on the negative aspect of the Bill. Well, the measure does have a negative aspect, and we on this side do not deny that. But it is negative only to be positive. I shall come to that later. The second reason by the report is to increase international trade and to increase the riches of not only the developed countries, but also the undeveloped countries. The third reason that is mentioned is the humanitarian one.</p>

<p>The world is trying to tackle this problem in mainly three ways. One is to check the overdevelopment of certain areas: That is a negative way. Another way is to infuse greater life into the so-called stagnant areas&#x2014;stagnant as far as their riches and their resources are concerned. <span class="col_6887-6888" refersTo="page_0705"/>The last way is to develop the co-called undeveloped areas. Basically these three measures which are being applied by the world are equally applicable to South Africa. We are primarily concerned with the problem of over-concentration; 81 per cent of our total industrial output is produced by four industrial centres, which, on the basis of the magisterial districts into which they are divided up, comprise only 2.2 per cent of our total area. Now I want to ask you, Sir, whether there is any other country in the world in which a higher concentration ratio than that is found. Can hon. members opposite name any such country&#x003F; Can the hon. the Opposition name any industrial country worth mentioning that can equal this&#x003F; It is a high concentration by any standard that one can apply.</p>

<p>Now the question occurs to one: What is the reason for this great industrial concentration&#x003F; In 1966 a very interesting report entitled <i>Industrial Location</i> was published by the Economic Division of the U.N. It is a report by experts, and they say in it that this high concentration is attributable to what they call &#x201C;consistent over-estimation of the external economies of an enterprise and consistent underestimation of growing social costs of infrastructure investment in such an area&#x201D;. A consistent over-estimation of the external economy of a private undertaking and a constant underestimation of the social costs as far as infrastructure is concerned&#x2014;that, says the report, is the reason for the over-concentration in certain areas. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Choices of location by entrepreneurs are based solely on private costs while the social costs which arise in connection with the concentration of population in a rather small area are not considered by them at all.</block>

<p>Do hon. members see the difference in the interests of the two concerns&#x003F; The one has the broad interest and the other has its own interest which has to be taken into account. The report goes further and states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The trend in the world, however, seems to be not the private or sectoral approach, but a more comprehensive approach, characterized by determined efforts to develop and implement national programmes of the regional economic development of the whole territory of the country.</block>

<p>That is of importance.</p>

<p>Mention has also been made here of the high costs that will have to be incurred and the large amounts that the Government will have to pay in order to bring about this decentralization and development in the border areas. Seeing that hon. members on that side do not believe us when we make certain statements from this side. I want to quote to them what is said by experts attached to the University of the Witwatersrand. This is what Dr. Van Waasdyk says, and I hope the Opposition accepts what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the larger urban centres the process of industrialization brought in its wake a heavy expenditure on health, housing and public services generally, as well as a concentration of Bantu and other non-Whites in urban areas &#x2026; Since the cost &#x2026;</block>

<p>and this is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of providing an urban community with services is much higher <i>per capita</i> than that in a rural area, this concentration movement must add to the real cost of government. This will also place the finances of local authorities and provincial authorities under severe strain during the decade ahead.</block>

<p>We already have those problems to-day, and every year the hon. members object to the increasing expenditure by the Government, and if the Government takes measures to reduce it, they fight those measures tooth and nail.</p>

<p>But I want to say something else. I say that industry is an important factor which has to be taken into account by any Government because it produces wealth and creates opportunities of employment. I want to make the statement to-day that this legislation is as much in the interests of the industrialist as it is in the interests of the State. I want to take examples from other countries of the world. When selecting sites for the location of their factories, industrialists&#x2014;not all of them, but a large percentage of them&#x2014;are inclined to pay too much attention to the short term economic advantages and too little attention to the medium and long term advantages. I can mention numerous examples of industrialists who only discovered in later years that they had established themselves in the wrong place, in the cities. Do you know why&#x003F; Experience has shown that labour plays the most important single role in the location of industries to-day. A study has been made in both England and America, and it has been found that labour is the most important of all the location factors, and not only that, but it is still increasing in importance. Our industrial decentralization is aimed precisely at taking that factor into proper account. Industry frequently makes the mistake of not looking far enough into the future to see where the labour is and what the cost of the labour is. I therefore say that this legislation, properly applied, will play a very important part in helping to guide an industry, not to exert compulsion upon it, in deciding upon the best location for it in the Republic. The word &#x201C;compulsion&#x201D; which is being used is a misnomer. If you tell a man where he has to go, it is compulsion, but it is not compulsion if you tell him that he is not allowed to go to a certain place. That is what the hon. members on the opposite side cannot realize, i.e. that there is a difference between the two. We on this side do not believe in telling a man that he must go and establish himself there. The furthest we want to go is to tell him that he may not establish <span class="col_6889-6890" refersTo="page_0706"/>himself here. And that is not compulsion. They must now stop using that word incorrectly, because it is as misleading as can be.</p>

<p>But I want to mention something else which is of interest and which is stated in that U.N. report. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Physical planners made an important contribution to the education of reckless, antisocially minded industrialists, and in recognition of the fact that industrial location is not only the problem of a given enterprise, but also the problem of the local, regional and national communities.</block>

<p>That is what is affirmed by this legislation. The Government does not say that it has all the say in regard to where industries are to be located. That would be unfair and unreasonable and unpracticable and foolish. But in terms of this legislation the Government says that in the interests of the country and of society it should also have a say, particularly in certain parts of the country, and that is what is confirmed by this international report.</p>

<p>Permit me to mention a third reason why I think that this legislation is in the interests of the industrialist as well. I want to quote from an article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 21st May, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;South Africa is one of the safest places in the world in which to invest&#x201D;, said a leading New York stockbroker &#x2026;</block>

<p>This legislation will have the effect of maintaining that safety which is mentioned here. What has our experience been in Africa where that safety has disappeared&#x003F; The economy collapsed. Do you not accept either that the policy of separate development has brought about economic stability&#x003F; That is what is accepted by the world, and this legislation will play an extremely important part in providing confirmation of that important point which industries and investors take into account.</p>

<p>Now hon. members may ask, but why such strong legislation, if I may use the word &#x201C;strong&#x201D;&#x003F; I want to give a few reasons for that. We know from experience that voluntary measures only work up to a point. Inducement only works up to a point, but in the case of the problems with which we are faced in this country, political problems, yes, but also economic problems, the poverty in the border areas and in the reserves, one cannot apply voluntary measures only. One has to use stronger measures. But there is a second factor that we have to take into account. Experience has also shown that when an industrialist moves out of an area, voluntarily, a number of other factories always shoot up like mushrooms to employ those labourers, because skilled labour is available there. While one is going to the border areas as a larger undertaking, a vacuum is being created and it is being used by other factories of the same kind which should never have been there. They establish themselves there and they defeat and neutralize the policy of reducing the number of Bantu in the white areas. We cannot allow that to happen. On the one hand one is taking positive measures and on the other hand you are allowing those measures to be neutralized. That cannot be allowed to happen.</p>

<p>Permit me to mention a third and extremely important point, and in this regard I also want to quote an international authority. A certain Mr. Hoover of the U.S.A. is quoted in that international report, and he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development of a region, like that of a nation, encounters from time to time crucial situations in which the future hangs in the balance, and can be influenced only by major planning decisions. Unless something really drastic happens, stagnation in the underdeveloped areas will go on indefinitely.</block>

<p>In terms of this statement by Mr. Hoover, we need strong legislation and strong planning to help solve the problems with which most countries of the world are faced. I say that this quotation confirms the justness and the reasonableness of this legislation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me come back to the United Party. I am interested to see what the United Party has said over the years in regard to border areas development. I just want to read a few examples. I first want to read what was said by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in 1960 that expansion in the white areas would come to a standstill (i.e. as a result of the development of the border areas) and that the white population would have to accept a low standard of living. Sir, what has been the position&#x003F; Since 1960 the standard of living, the real income per capita, has increased by 28 per cent, which is a fantastic increase in relation to any other criteria that one may apply. There has been no decrease, but a tremendous increase. The then member for Benoni said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the hon. the Prime Minister &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the then Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; no one on the Government side has any intention of proceeding with this fantastic experiment. I go further and say that this vision is not only hampering but is stifling the country&#x2019;s economy</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>The United Party described border industries as a pipe-dream and said that they would never develop; they called them Hong Kong industries. They said <span class="col_6891-6892" refersTo="page_0707"/>that our industries would move to the Federation and that towns such as Germiston would die; those are the words that they used. Sir, Germiston is more virile and larger to-day than ever before. On a later occasion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the following in the course of a speech in, I think, Klerksdorp&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He warned the industrialists of South Africa not to allow themselves to be misled by the inducements offered by the Government to the border industries, because if they came into power they would withdraw many of those inducements.</block>

<p>Sir, just consider what a disfavour the Leader of the Opposition did both industry and South Africa in making that speech, because there are industrialists who take notice of what he says. Is the United Party then not an accessory to the fact that the Government has been obliged to introduce a strong measure such as this&#x003F; If they had lent their co-operation from the outset, we would have progressed farther along the road. They could then have used their influence and have said to the industrialists, &#x201C;This is the right policy; this is the policy that will prove to be the right one in the long run; support it,&#x201D; but instead of doing that, they ran it down and slandered it and said that they would repeal it. I say that they have to accept joint responsibility for this Bill and if the industrialists are dissatisfied at this Bill they must also be dissatisfied at the attitude adopted by the Opposition at that time. The industrialists as such supported industrial decentralization in the border areas in principle.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to two remarks which in my opinion were misleading and particularly one remark which is doing a very great deal of harm, which is doing unnecessary harm and which unnecessarily casts a reflection on this Bill and its effect. I am referring to a statement made by the hon. member for Yeoville; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we are concerned about is that the Government is using, amongst other things, industries in the border areas in order to escape industrial agreements and to lower the standards of wages applicable in certain occupations.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is the position&#x003F; Do hon. members of the Opposition not know that they were the first to circumvent an existing industrial agreement&#x003F; What happened to Good Hope Textiles&#x003F; Do they not remember what happened when the Industrial Development Corporation wanted to establish Good Hope Textiles at Zwelitsha&#x003F; When the blanket manufacturing industry threatened to engulf them, the I.D.C. said, &#x201C;If the Government allows that industrial agreement to be made applicable to us, then we cannot establish our factory,&#x201D; and after a long struggle the United Party Government eventually gave its permission for special wages to be paid by Good Hope Textiles. Hon. members on that side must not accuse this Government; if that is wrong, then they themselves did it. The hon. member went further and said that the Government was using border industries &#x201C;to lower the standards of wages&#x201D;, and he mentioned a figure of 27&#x00BD; per cent. Sir, I have three examples here of wage determinations made by the United Party Government. Let me give you the percentages: In the case of the cement industry there was a difference of 25 per cent between the wages determined for workers in the rural areas and the wages determined in the urban areas. In the case of the milling industry there was a difference of 51 per cent as far as screen men were concerned, and in the case of the food canning industry there was a difference of 73 per cent in respect of labourers. Hon. members on that side level accusations of this nature at this side of the House, and I say that they were &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; of misleading people in the worst possible degree that one can imagine, because the differences under their r&#x00E9;gime were much larger than what they are to-day. Why do they mislead the public in this way&#x003F; Why do they try to mislead this House&#x003F;</p>

<p>Finally I just want to refer to a speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The Opposition is so concerned about the effects of this Bill. Sir, do you know what the Leader of the Opposition said in September last year with reference to a speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe there are vast stretches in our rural areas where the essential services are available and where there is a far greater demand for industry, and to which industries could be decentralized very favourably and with enormous economic advantage to South Africa, without the expenditure which is being embarked upon as the result of ideological issues.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that he is right, but I do say that if he is right, then, since this Bill is only intended to apply to certain areas, highly concentrated areas, hon. members of the Opposition should take note of what was said here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and then, surely, they must believe that there is no cause for concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is an important measure. I concede that it is a drastic Bill, but I say that we cannot solve this problem of the poverty of those of our areas that have lagged behind and that we cannot solve this problem of the ratio of non-Whites to Whites in our country unless we take strong measures. The people and industry and the business-men will eventually appreciate that; the people already appreciate it, and they will praise this Government for the strong measures it is taking to eradicate the poverty existing in many parts of the country, which relates mainly to the Bantu, and to establish our white civilization in this country for all time.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from><span class="col_6893-6894" refersTo="page_0708"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Florida has made many points here in support of this Bill. I think we are convinced that he does support the Minister on the introduction of this particular measure. Sir, I would like to tell the hon. member that industry in this country has always played its part, and that it has always supported the country as a whole. At the same time industry has always been consulted in the past whenever major changes have been made in our laws affecting them. This time, however, they are being asked to toe the line without their consent. There have been consultations but the Government has not been prepared to alter the principles of this Bill. Sir, this Bill, judging by its title, seems to be a very innocent little Bill. As a matter of fact, it contains many provisions which we have on our Statutes. It repeals the Natural Resources Development Act. We have had these measures with us for a very long time, and they worked very well. The hon. member for Hillbrow said that as the debate proceeds one finds that it is not so much the planning of the natural resources and industry of the country, but that it is aimed at the removal of the Bantu to the border areas. The hon. the Minister went to great lengths in proving that his Bill was sound. It has been said that we on this side have always supported decentralization of industry. We have had it and we do have it. It was pointed out by other speakers on this side how decentralization has taken place. We have the evidence in Witwatersrand and the Vereeniging complex. If you go to any part of this country you will find a measure of decentralization. This particular Bill however is decentralization on a master plan. We have sensed in this House as members of the Opposition over a long time, that the Government was anxious in some way to implement &#x2014;I will not use the word force&#x2014;industry to the border areas. It had great difficulty in finding a vehicle by which to carry out the political and economic plan. They have now produced this Bill and they are using the hon. the Minister of Planning to do that job for them. The Government has been blinded by the Utopian idea of one white state and a number of black states with no economic integration. The Government will not accept the fact that this is a multi-racial state and that it will be so for quite a long time, unless they are successful in driving all the blacks into the sea. As I have said, when you cut away the trimmings from the Minister&#x2019;s speech and the Bill what remains of it is the compulsory location of industry on a colour basis and the power to implement the border industrial concept.</p>

<p>That is licensing. That is the normal thing if you open a shop. But in regard to this Bill the Minister says there is no compulsion. But there is. What we are creating by this Bill is border industry development&#x2014;this fringe development&#x2014;what is known to-day as a number of Ghaza strips. These border industries will not be entirely black. There will be a large measure of Whites and white know-how who will have to travel to these decentralized areas on the border strips. And you will have these Ghaza strips as the black nations become independent which could be a great danger to our country. That is one aspect. Much has been said about this Bill but I think the hon. the Minister knows&#x2014;but he has not told us&#x2014;that he has all this power indirectly. The Government has this power indirectly. They could do just what they intend doing under this Bill. We have seen it so often, as for example in the Education Bill, that if the Government is desirous of centralizing control in one spot, it brings a Bill to this House, as is being done with this Bill at the present moment. The Minister knows that in regional planning and town planning all plans are sent by the Administrators to their respective Townships Boards. The Townships Board does not approve of the plan until these plans are confirmed <span class="col_6895-6896" refersTo="page_0709"/>by the Government departments concerned. And that includes the Department of Bantu Administration. We have a case here in the Cape concerning the development of Epping No. 1 and Epping No. 2. These townships were established only with the consent of the Department of Bantu Administration. The Minister therefore has the power. He has the power in the Cape and he has the power elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, it is compulsion. They compelled the city council of Cape Town to make it a condition that when these two townships are built up, that industrialists were not allowed to employ Bantu labour. There was no concession made. If they want to sell a strip of land for industrial development in Epping No. 2 they have to give an undertaking that no Bantu labour will be employed. Is that not compulsion&#x003F; We know of the disabilities of centralized control, the red tape and the difficulties that you have in so far as the lines of communication are concerned, notwithstanding the fact that the hon. the Minister has told us that he is setting up his committee to iron out the troubles that may arise as a result of this control. Now, what is going to be the effect of this Bill&#x003F; It will probably not all be felt immediately. The Minister will probably find as we have found in so far as the Group Areas Bill and a lot of other Bills were concerned, that he will have to grant exemptions. He will find himself in the embarrassing position of not being able to implement the full results of his Bill. Therefore there will probably have to be exemptions.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>No. I am not going to make a Third Reading Speech. The effect on the Western Cape we know already. We know what has happened here. The Government must realize that the growth of industry in South Africa has been built up on a basis of white know-how and of the labour, skilled and semi-skilled, which in this country happened to be black. The hon. the Minister has been throwing a lot of questions across the floor of the House. Will he tell us whether he would have introduced a Bill such as this if the labour force in South Africa had been all white&#x003F; I wonder whether the Government would have been so anxious on this decentralization plan and this particular Bill if our labour force had been white. Can the Government tell us what they intend doing to replace the labour that they are going to remove from these huge metropolitan areas. Are we going to have the importation of semi-skilled and unskilled white labour from overseas to replace the labour that is going to be moved to the border areas or the Bantu areas&#x003F; One would think that the large concentration of the Bantu population in the large metropolitan areas of for instance the Rand where the gold mines are, was an accident. It was no accident. The concentration of labour we have on the Rand to-day is naturally due to the gold-mines. But the vast concentration of labour is not employed on the mines. The mines use purely migratory labour. A very large concentration of labour there is in respect of the ancillary services that are necessary to keep these big units going. This is why you have this enormous concentration of labour there. What is going to happen to those industries so necessary to the goldmines&#x003F; What is going to happen to our steel works, for instance&#x003F; Is it the Minister&#x2019;s intention to move these industries to the border areas&#x003F; Because once this Bill becomes law and it is implemented the effect will be that these large industries which employ Bantu labour will not be able to expand, not without the Minister&#x2019;s permission. What is going to happen to these large industries&#x003F; Is the Minister going to replace the labour they require by white labour or is he going to tell them that they have expanded as far as they can and that any further extensions have to be in the border areas&#x003F; Is he going to insist upon that or is he just going to allow these large firms to stagnate&#x003F; Most of us know that in business you cannot stand still&#x2014;you either go forward or you go backwards. So, if these large industries find that they cannot go forward on account of restrictive labour requirements then naturally they will go backwards and perhaps out of business. Let us take the motor-car industry as an example. When the hon. member for Parktown talked about the small man the hon. member for Primrose said that was not an argument. But I should like to tell him and the hon. the Minister that this will affect not only the big man but also the small man. We find that some of the biggest industries in the world have started in backyards with perhaps only one man and a boy. Let us now look at the position of the average garage under this legislation. If any garage anywhere in future wants to extend its business it shall, being a factory, have to get the permission of the Minister to do that. So, as regards the extension of its business it will be restricted. [Interjections.] Have you filling stations down at the border areas&#x003F; Then the hon. member will have to drive down there in order to get <span class="col_6897-6898" refersTo="page_0710"/>petrol.

Under this plan to decentralize, to move the Bantu back to the border areas&#x2014; because obviously this is what this Bill intends doing&#x2014;what is to happen to the white worker&#x003F; What is going to happen to him&#x003F; Naturally the white worker must go with the Black to provide the know-how. So, one wonders whether the Minister would not apply this Bill to the white worker in the border areas to restrict them there. He might say those areas are for black industries and only so many Whites will be allowed. It can cut both ways. As I see it, if the concept of this Bill is carried out it can cost the country millions of rand and will kill private enterprise, and that for an ideology! This is what this Bill means.</p>

<p>There is one thing we are inclined to forget to-day and this is that this prosperous country of ours has been built up not only by the Whites but also by the Blacks, the Coloureds and the Indians. We are inclined to forget this. I submit that by devising these means for moving the Bantu to one area, the Whites to another, the Coloureds to another and the Indians to another, we are going to destroy the natural industrial growth in this country. We have been told by industrialists and economists that if we did not make full use of the natural labour resources we have available in this country there can only be one end for us. So, if we are going to grow to being the industrial giant we should be, we have to make use of these resources. On the other hand, we will not get anywhere if we keep on shifting our labour around like draughts on a draught-board. As far as this country is concerned, that is a retograde and backward step.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>It was with interest that I listened to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, but I could not follow him&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I am afraid that the hon. member could not follow himself. At the beginning of his speech he said that he agreed that industries had to be decentralized. At the end of his speech, on the other hand, he said that if border industries developed and white workers flocked to them, the hon. the Minister could get rid of those white workers once again. But, surely, then we did succeed in effecting decentralization; surely, then we did attain our object, and object both we and the United Party are pursuing. But now the hon. member for Salt River advances a very silly and foolish argument, an argument which contradicts his previous arguments. Mr. Speaker, in our home we usually tell our children that if one has nothing to say, one should rather keep quiet. That is also my advice to the hon. member for Salt River&#x2014;he should rather keep quiet. The hon. member said that this Bill was a &#x201C;master plan&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to state very explicitly and plainly that if this Government does not proceed within the framework of a master plan for South Africa, it will be making a big mistake and be doomed to failure. It is only within the framework of a master plan that one can plan and organize in a balanced way. If, on the other hand, one views development as a sporadic thing, one is involuntarily heading for ruin. That is what hon. members of the Opposition are doing. What the hon. member for Salt River is reading into clause 2 of the Bill, is the power to enforce coercive measures, as they call it. He should go home and read it up once again. All the Minister can tell an industry in terms of this Bill, is that it may not go here or there. At the same time there will be an inter-departmental committee that will be able to furnish any industrialist in South Africa and abroad with the best advice. That is important. I want to go so far as to say that any industrialist who seeks to start an industry in South Africa, should go to this inter-departmental committee in order that he may be advised as to where he may establish the project he is planning&#x2014;be it a coffee project, a tea project or any other project. The inter-departmental committee, which will be in close contact with the permanent committee, will be able to furnish the prospective industrialist with the best advice as to where he may establish his industry.</p>

<p>I am afraid that hon. members of the Opposition and the newspapers supporting them in the Republic of South Africa have done the economy and the industrial development of this country the greatest disservice through their propaganda which preceded this measure and the discussion thereof in this hon. House. With this sort of propaganda they cannot get far. This propaganda is directed at the heart of South Africa. This propaganda will be consumed overseas and used against the Republic of South Africa. But as regards the industrialists abroad, I do not think that the Opposition has achieved much. If overseas industrialists find out that the Opposition is opposing this Bill, they must realize that this is in fact the right measure, because that is the way South Africa has come to know the Opposition over the years. The way in which they have come to know the Opposition over the years, is that when the Opposition opposes something, one should know that it is a good measure. In five or ten years&#x2019; time this very Opposition will suggest that this Bill is their brain-child and that they are proud of it!</p>

<p>The attitude I adopt this afternoon is that the Opposition knows that this Bill is right. They know that it has come at the right stage as far as the interests of the public of South Africa are concerned. I know that at heart they are convinced that this is the right step to take. But now they think and they adopt the view&#x2014;and that is where they are making <span class="col_6899-6900" refersTo="page_0711"/>their mistake&#x2014;that everything this Government does, should be opposed. They believe that they should oppose everything this Government seeks to achieve, because then they perform their function as the official Opposition. Now I want to tell them this. As usual they are once again mistaken, because the industrialists abroad, the people abroad, will know that it is with the best intentions that this Government wants to place this measure on the Statute Book of South Africa. Why does the Opposition emphasize one thing only&#x003F; The Bantu is the carrot that is being dangled in front of the horse&#x2019;s nose. In other words, we see in our mind&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;that is the way the United Party and its newspapers depict this&#x2014;an industrialist with his factory on his back, a factory with smoke and steam belching from its chimney, following a Bantu to the border areas. That is the picture hon. members on the other side are giving us.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask them why they did not dangle the whole bunch of carrots in front of the horse&#x2019;s nose. Why do they not say that the plentiful water of the Tugela River, which is flowing into the sea, is one of those resources&#x003F; Why do they not mention the other resources in the country and say that they, too, will be a source of attraction&#x003F; A few days ago, during another debate, the hon. member for Musgrave pleaded in so many words that the third Iscor should go to the Tugela. And then that very same person comes along and opposes this measure. I am asking the hon. members of the United Party in Natal to state explicitly where they stand in respect of this Bill, which will mean a great deal to South Africa and also to Natal. But what I am asking, is where do they stand&#x003F;</p>

<p>In times of war a nation and all layers of that nation are called up to take concerted action. But not only in times of war, but also in times of emergency and in times of anxiety a nation is called up to act in concert. We know what the present situation in Rhodesia is. Owing to circumstances there, the people in Rhodesia have been called up to stand together in this crisis they are experiencing. This afternoon I want to ask this question, and I want to address it in particular to hon. members of the Opposition. Is it not possible for us in South Africa to stand together, is it not possible for us to make a grand and joint effort to further the welfare and the progress of the Republic of South Africa in times of peace&#x003F; I want to go further.</p>

<p>I want to tell hon. members that South Africa cannot dissociate itself from the rest of the continent of Africa. Everything we do here, we should do in the interests of all population groups of South Africa. As a youth I once had the privilege of listening to the author Eitemal&#x2014;Dr. Erlank&#x2014;at Greytown in Natal. He told a very moving story there. He told us how on a certain occasion, many years ago, he came across an old street-cleaner while he was walking, surrounded by the pomp and splendour of Berlin, Germany. Playfully he tapped the old man on the shoulder and asked him: &#x201C;Old man, are you not ashamed of doing this simple job of sweeping streets amid this pomp and splendour, amid all these people here in Berlin&#x003F;&#x201D; The old man snubbed him by looking over his shoulder and saying: &#x201C;I am doing this for Germany.&#x201D; This afternoon I want to associate myself with the words of the hon. the Minister when he referred to the younger generation and the ideals and aspirations they have in this young Republic of South Africa. What I am asking for, is that we in this Republic of South Africa should make a joint effort in developing and building up this country. I am going further than that. Not only the Whites in South Africa, but every population group of South Africa should be afforded the opportunity of developing and building up this young Republic of ours. Nobody should use the Republic of South Africa for his own purposes through motives of selfishness or self-interest. No body. I am referring to the farmer, the postman, our employees and employers, politicians&#x2014; both those on the Government side and those on the Opposition side. I say that each of them and all population groups, including the industrialists, should also be able to say: &#x201C;I am doing this in the interests of the Republic of South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I say that those opposing this Bill, are living in the past. They are thinking of South Africa as a small country. They are thinking of the small country of 1911, when we were a population of a little more than 6 million people. But to-day, 56 years later, we are dealing with a population of more than 18 million. To the Opposition in particular I want to say that we are concerned here with laying a foundation for the Republic of South Africa, a foundation which will have to support approximately 34 million people by the year 2000. Then the hon. member for Houghton refers to the small number of people in our country. She compares the population of the Witwatersrand with that of a large city such as London. But if one looks ahead at what the position will be in 20 or 25 years&#x2019; time, then one sees a much larger concentration of people there. In terms of this legislation it will be possible to move these concentrations to various areas and to new points of growth, to places where new cities and towns may develop.</p>

<p>In the past&#x2014;and that is the time the United Party remembers&#x2014;the advent of industries was a sensational thing. It was sporadic. It never caused any anxiety and concern. But the time has passed when the appearance of industries on the South African scene was a rarity. Those times have passed and belong to the past. Now we must have orderly planning for the industrial explosion which is taking place in South Africa. There must be a new dispensation now. That is precisely where hon. members of the Opposition fail: They fail to realize that we are dealing with a new period, a new phase upon which we are embarking.</p>

<p><span class="col_6901-6902" refersTo="page_0712"/>I feel that I can discuss this matter frankly. In my constituency I have on a previous occasion already stated it to be my conviction that legislation of this nature will have to be introduced. I put it to my voters that it was necessary for the planning of the Republic of South Africa for industries to be established at new points of growth distributed throughout the entire country. I said that this type of legislation would have to come and that it would be launched through this hon. House. That is what I put to my voters, people who include both Nationalists and United Party supporters. I want to state here that not a single person, including United Party supporters, opposed this. As a matter of fact, they agreed with me that it was correct to take such action, that this legislation had to be passed. I went even further than that. Recently I issued a Press statement in connection with the development of the Tugela Basin, particularly with a view to the possibility of a third Iscor in that area, and, <i>inter alia,</i> I used this sentence in that Press statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our view it will be necessary to have the establishment and location of industries controlled by the Government or a statutory body.</block>

<p>What I envisaged, is precisely what this Bill is seeking to effect. But although this statement was inserted and published virtually fully by the <i>Natal Witness,</i> the <i>Daily News</i> and the <i>Natal Mercury,</i> not one of these three large newspapers of Natal published that particular sentence. I say that this sentence was not published in those newspapers, and the conclusion at which I arrive is that the intelligent editors of those newspapers did not see anything alarming in that sentence&#x2014;absolutely nothing alarming. Two other newspapers, namely the <i>Ladysmith Gazette</i> and <i>Die Nataller</i> also published my statement, and they included that particular sentence. However, on the part of the Opposition there was no revolt against this sentence. To my knowledge there was no criticism against it. Only when the United Party revolted against this measure, when in my opinion they tried to fulfil a function as the Opposition, when they tried to incite people into opposing this Bill, only then did they level criticism. I would not be surprised if they even called in the Black Sash to help them.</p>

<p>But that is how we have come to know the United Party. That is why I say that it is time they took stock of themselves. We need not do that; they must take stock of themselves. I want to put this question to them. Do hon. members of the Opposition really think that this Government will introduce in this House a measure which is in conflict with the economic interests of South Africa, which clashes with the industrial development of this country&#x003F; I am asking the Opposition openly whether they really think that this Government, the father of industries, this Government which has up to now stimulated the economy and the industrial development of this country, do they really think that we shall accept any measure which clashes with and will hamper the interests of South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>My dear chap, your replies are always so wrong-headed; you might as well keep quiet. For what reason would this Government impede or hamper economic progress&#x003F; Would this Government, the father of industrial development in South Africa, seek to harm it all of a sudden&#x003F; I am asking again, for what reason&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#torlage">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. TORLAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on the other side say that the Government will do so because of its ideological objectives. Let us for a single moment forget about Bantu homelands and border areas in South Africa. I think all of us will agree this afternoon that it is high time South Africa decentralized its new industries. Now I want to know: Are there in South Africa better places than these very border areas where decentralization of industries may take place&#x003F; Are there better places&#x003F; Hon. members on the other side will have to agree that the border areas are the best places for industrial decentralization. This Government has already gone a long way towards decentralizing industries. It has already been done with a large measure of success and, in spite of the agitation of the United Party, we shall continue to utilize these natural resources further, wherever they may be situated&#x2014;be it in urban complexes, be it in the four major industrial complexes of South Africa, be it in the rural areas&#x2014;in the interests of the future and the future generations of South Africa.</p>

<p>I also want to put the following question: Does the United Party simply want to allow an industrialist who will use a great deal of water to establish a factory at a place where the consumption is already excessive&#x003F; Over there we have the hon. member for Orange Grove. He is perfectly innocent at this stage. Last year he introduced a private motion here in which it was suggested that this Government had acted short-sightedly as regards water provision in this country, particularly as regards the Vaal Dam. If this Government does not have this master plan, if it does not look ahead further than the United Party wants it to look, then the United Party will, of course, complain one of these days about the overconcentration in certain areas where there are water shortages or where transport facilities are inadequate because of industrial expansion. But their complaint is that the Government is short-sighted. I say that this master planning is necessary. We must think ahead. We must think far into the future. That is why it will be admitted in future that this measure was one of the greatest measures in the interests of laying the foundations for a greater South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_6903-6904" refersTo="page_0713"/>I want to conclude. South Africa has its particular possibilities. South Africa also has its particular problems. We cannot share only the possibilities with the Opposition. The Opposition should also be prepared to do their share as regards solving the particular problems we have to face in South Africa. We cannot allow enemies of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development to attract Bantu labour to White areas on a large scale. That we cannot allow. If other countries haye had to effect controlled, free enterprise, then there is so much more reason why we, with our particular problems, should also do so here in South Africa. This Government has a greater task than that of mere economic profit-seeking. I want the Opposition to support us in this as well. We should not only stand for economic profit-seeking. They must support us by realizing that more important matters than mere profit-seeking are at stake for South Africa and its people. The Opposition should also see to it that the identity of each population group is being preserved and safe-guarded in the Republic of South Africa. I want to conclude by saying that this Government will go a long way to preserve and safeguard the entity of the non-White population groups of South Africa. But it will go much further still to safe-guard the entity of the White man in South Africa. I am asking hon. members of the Opposition to accompany us along that road. It is a duty that does not only rest on the shoulders of hon. members on this side of the House, but also on the shoulders of hon. members on the other side, also on the shoulders of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). That is the sacrifice we must bring, because in this respect we have a task to perform, and we must and will do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like right at the beginning of my speech to respond to the appeal of the hon. member for Klip River that we should unite in the interests of South Africa. Well, here I come to join him on the path of South Africa. Perhaps we are not always following the same path, but still we all think we are in the right direction.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised again the question of compulsion. Does the Bill contain an element of compulsion&#x003F; he asked. It has been raised more pertinently by the hon. the Minister himself, and he has dealt with that. I should like to deal with that in the course of my remarks in due course, not only in response to the hon. member for Klip River but, generally, whether the Bill does contain an element of compulsion. The Minister interrupted several speakers to ask, &#x201C;Where is the compulsion&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me whether the departmental committee of seven would give the wrong advice. He asked whether they would not give the best possible advice. I think they would, according to their judgment. But you see, Sir, a great industrialist does not go to a body constituted in this manner in order to get advice. He has his own experts; he has a team of experts; he has an expert in every direction: he has an engineer, a surveyor, a financier. As the hon. member for Hillbrow said to-day, he has to computerize the information because there is so much information. So, I do not suggest for a moment that this departmental committee would do anything but give the best advice it is in their power to give.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what industrialists would say about the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude in this matter. We are in touch with industrialists, as I assume hon. members on the other side are. We have several industrialists in our party here, men who have had careers in industry, as the Government side has. We have heard people speak here who have experience in industry. I think we are all in touch with the industrial world.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member really has a grievance about a United Party newspaper. I do not know anything about a United Party newspaper. We have no party newspaper. I know of only one English-language newspaper in South Africa which has committed itself to a party&#x2014;and that paper has not committed itself to the United Party. We have no paper of that kind. The hon. member also complained that he was not well treated by the Natal newspapers as far as reporting certain things was concerned. Well, that is nothing to what the Transvaal Afrikaans newspapers do to me &#x2014;they do not report me at all! I think the hon. member for Klip River has been very fortunate so far. At least he is getting something into the English Press in Natal. I think he has been quite fortunate.</p>

<p>Then he raised the question of Natal&#x2019;s interests in this Bill. Well, reading the report of their regional committee, I would say: Leave Natal to look after itself. I think Natal has made a wonderful survey of their own. I am not going to speak for Natal. My experience has been when it comes to industry or education or any other subject that we discussed, Natal are quite capable of looking after themselves. They certainly do not need me to speak for them. The hon. member said: &#x201C;Cannot we stand together in the interests of South Africa&#x003F;&#x201D; Of course we can. We stood together before in the interests of South Africa. After all, this country has built up great industries. We fought in two world wars. We have built up a great nation in just over 50 years. Of course we can stand together. The hon. member told us the story of the hero who was sweeping the streets for &#x201C;Deutschland&#x201D;. I am not prepared to sweep the streets for South Africa, not yet. But I am prepared to cooperate with him. We all are. He asked &#x201C;What will South Africa be in the year 2000 with a population of 34 million&#x003F;&#x201D; I do not know. I shall not be here. I do not know what it is going to be like then, but I do know that the prophecies that have been made about the <span class="col_6905-6906" refersTo="page_0714"/>future of South Africa are generally wrong. If one goes back to the establishment of Union in 1910, I wonder what those fathers who look down upon us in the dining-room would say if they could see what we are debating to-day. Never in their wildest dreams could they have envisaged a development such as we have had and the problems we have to face.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether the Government would do anything detrimental against South Africa and whether we accused them. No, we do not. We think they are acting honestly according to their light. Our criticism is that their lights are so dim. They do not see far enough. They are doing their best. I am not prepared to say they are not patriotic South Africans. I think they are doing their best.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked whether the border is not the best place to establish industries, and whether we could not concede that. No, the border is not the best place. In the Transkei is the best place, in the Native territories, as the Tomlinson Report recommended. They did not recommend that the industries should be established at the border of the reserves. They said: &#x201C;Go into the reserves. Use white capital and skill. Give those people something to build on.&#x201D; But the hon. members on the Government side say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. They are not prepared to do that. They will establish the industries on the border. The workers can live over the border. They have done that in other parts of the country. We are quite in favour of this decentralization of industry. Who is not&#x003F; In every country there is decentralization of industry. The industrialists are in favour of it, if the conditions are favourable. Will the United Party encourage industries where there is no water&#x003F; Of course we will not. Who would do that&#x003F; We certainly would not and I cannot imagine any industrialist doing it. The hon. member asked whether we would not do something to establish industry. We have the 1947 Act and we have acted under that up to now. I think we have done very well. A few days ago we discussed the subject of water. The Water Bill has just been passed through this House unanimously. There is no suggestion that we are not prepared to encourage the establishment of industries. The hon. member, when he says we are not cooperating, is far from the mark. We are very anxious to co-operate with the Government in establishing industry, but we feel that the industrialists are the important people to be considered. They know where they want to establish their industries. It is for the Government to create the conditions, to make it attractive for them and, as my hon. friends have said several times this afternoon, to offer the right inducements. When that is done, then I feel quite sure that we can co-operate as we have co-operated in the past.</p>
