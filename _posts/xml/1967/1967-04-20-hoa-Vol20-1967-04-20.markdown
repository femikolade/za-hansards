<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Before I leave the matter of South-West Africa, I want to round off the point I was making last night. Broadly speaking, we are in agreement with the fundamental approach expounded by the hon. the Minister last night, namely that in Africa one finds diverse peoples and interests and that many of these were lumped together by the accidents of colonial history. We, too, believe that there is no reason why any old colonial territory should necessarily be maintained for ever as a single state in which the majority rules over all the minorities. But at the same time we feel that the reverse is also valid and that one should not go to the other extreme either. In the case of South-West Africa, we believe that it would be unrealistic to create the impression that there are no common interests and ties between the various groups in the territory, especially as far as the southern sector is concerned. Certainly as far as the southern sector of South-West Africa is concerned, there is a very wide field of common interest between the different groups. Therefore we believe that the Government would strengthen its position, both in respect of the support it gets from the population groups within the territory, and from the point of view of the presentation of its case abroad, if it were to go ahead in the first place with improving the material welfare of everybody, as it is doing at the moment, and secondly, creating machinery for self-expression for every group; because there can be no objection to that at all; and thirdly, avoiding every impression that we stand for a territorial split-up in South-West Africa on the basis of colour. I think it is vitally important, in presenting any case in respect of South-West Africa, not to create the impression that we stand for a split-up territorially on the basis of colour. Finally, we believe that the Government would be wise, in the interests of South Africa, to emphasize to the various groups in South-West the desirability of the very practical politics of a federal relationship, both internally and with the Republic of South Africa, because this is the only policy which combines all the autonomy which is possible for any group with all the co-operation which is necessary in the economic circumstances of a territory like South-West Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MER WE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to respond to the contentions and arguments of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout with regard to South-West Africa. I think it is quite a few years that we have had some sort of understanding, in view of developments <span class="col_4539-4540" refersTo="page_0885"/>abroad in respect of South-West, that we should rather leave those matters alone and not drag them across the floor of this House, so that we may not perhaps do South-West Africa and the Republic of South Africa a disservice. I think that was our firm attitude which we adopted consistently, and which proved of considerable benefit to us in our relations with the U.N. For that reason I actually resent the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised those matters in this debate, and here I must add that the Minister in charge of South-West Africa Affairs is actually the hon. the Prime Minister, and that the hon. member should have raised these arguments on the Vote of the Prime Minister. But I resent it that at this stage, one could almost say in this period of crisis, where the U.N. are to convene tomorrow, he should come along and raise certain provocative and contentious matters with regard to South-West Africa. For that reason I do not want to say anything whatsoever about it, and I also want to make an appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that we should leave these matters alone and not discuss them any further.</p>

<p>With the full knowledge of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs made a statement on South-West Africa, and it was handed to him, and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has now been first to drag the party-political dispute on South-West Africa into this debate. But I want to leave the matter there, and I now appeal to the Opposition and also to hon. members on this side of the House that we should try to keep this debate on a high level and that we should not go into the two parties&#x2019; differences on South-West Africa. We can only bring further troubles on our head by doing so. I actually want to welcome the statement made by the hon. the Minister with regard to the U.N., and also the warning he issued that South Africa could no longer contribute to funds used to incite a private feud against South Africa. He referred to the Apartheid Committee of the U.N. This Committee was established on funds to which South Africa also contributes, and they wage certain campaigns against South Africa. It is alleged, of course, that apartheid is a threat to the so called world peace, but one wonders why they have never considered taking the same action against, for example, the threat of Communism which prevails in the world at present. If one considers the session which is to start tomorrow, then it is really blatant proof of the way in which the funds of the U.N., to which we also contribute, are utilized nowadays. If one recalls the time in 1946 when the Charter of the League of United Nations was drawn up, one recalls that principally the attitude was adopted that the different nations of the world were called upon to devote their attention to two perils. One of the perils was the threat to world peace, but another very important one was, of course, the terrible social conditions prevailing in the world. I just want to quote from the Charter of the United Nations Organization itself, in which it set itself the objective of bringing about social progress and better standards of living, and &#x201C;having regard to this objective, to exercise tolerance and to live in peace with each other like common neighbours&#x201D; and &#x201C;to employ machinery for the promotion of the economic and social progress of all nations&#x201D;. If one surveys world conditions, one cannot fail to come under the impression of the tremendous problems existing everywhere in the world, problems which are simply shifted aside. Instead of these problems being dealt with, a special session is convened to discuss, one could almost say, an inconsequential matter such as that of South-West Africa. Mr. Chairman, may I just give you an outline of the tremendous problems with which the U.N. may fruitfully occupy themselves&#x003F; I just want to mention one or two More than half the population of the world suffers various degrees of malnutrition at the moment. Here I have a most interesting report from the Washington <i>Evening Star</i> which points out that last year the population of the world increased by 70 million, while food production in the African countries alone decreased by 4 to 5 per cent. This newspaper writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When we keep in mind that the number of human beings is likely to double to a total of six or seven billion in the next three decades, it is obvious that farm output, which is already alarmingly deficient, will have to be steadily and enormously increased from year to year to cope with the population explosion, otherwise famine on a global scale will hardly be avoidable in the age ahead. Next to the nuclear threat this constitutes perhaps the most fateful problem confronting mankind.</block>

<p>He describes this as the greatest problem confronting the world at present&#x2014;this question of malnutrition. And do you think, Mr. Chairman, that any special attention is devoted to this problem&#x003F; No, instead of that special sessions of the General Assembly are convened to discuss a peaceful country like South Africa. Mr. Chairman, more than 500 million of the population of the world are plagued and maimed by diseases which can in fact be cured, but no attention is given to this because the world occupies itself with matters such as South-West Africa and does not devote the necessary attention to those tremendous problems confronting the world at present. More than 700 million of the adults in the world are illiterate, including 80 per cent of Africa and <span class="col_4541-4542" refersTo="page_0886"/>65 per cent of Asia. What is more, some of the most highly developed countries are 3,000 per cent more advanced than the most underdeveloped countries. That shows you what a tremendous gap there is in the present-day world between the advanced countries and the underdeveloped countries. But do you think the U.N. would devote themselves to a solution of those tremendous problems; do you think the U.N. would harness their skills and finance to lend priority to those problems&#x003F; No, instead of that a small country like South-West Africa, one of the most peaceful countries in the world, is discussed there. While this matter of South-West Africa is being discussed about 300 million dollars are spent daily on manufacturing armaments, which points to preparation for possible aggression, and here one should not exclude the great nations of the world. Instead of devoting their attention to these problems, they are discussing masters such as that relating to South-West Africa, one of the most peaceable nations in the world. But apart from these social problems there are also political problems, which I have just mentioned and which ought to enjoy the attention of the U.N. Take Africa, for example. In Uganda there were 266 tribal clashes last year, in which 58 persons were killed. In Burundi 25,000 people died last year, a number almost equal to the entire Herero population of South-West Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply to one point raised by the hon. member for Middelland, namely that referring to the fact that we were the ones who raised the South-West Africa issue here. At the beginning of my speech last night I said that we did not intend conducting a general debate on South-West Africa, but that there were nevertheless certain matters which we, as Opposition, considered it our duty to bring to the attention of the Government, and for that reason we make no apology for the fact that we raised the question here. Nor am I going to take it to heart that the hon. member resented the fact that we had raised it here. Mr. Chairman, in an early stage of what the hon. member described as the crisis on South-West Africa, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the Government the offer that we should tackle this matter on a national basis, on a non-political basis, as Dr. Malan did when he was Prime Minister. When he wanted to give South-West Africa a new constitution, he called together the two political parties in South-West. He did not act unilaterally as a party leader; as Prime Minister he called together the parties and a joint scheme which both parties approved was then accepted by the Government. We made the Government the offer that it should also deal with the entire South-West Africa issue on a national basis, and should create machinery through which Government and Opposition could come together to discuss the problems of South-West. The Government preferred not to do so, and I do not hold that against it. If the Government feels that it is better to keep its hands free, very well, but then the Government should not come and tell us: You, the Opposition, must be silent; leave everything to us; we are governing. That is a quite impossible situation; then we may as well abolish Parliament. The Government must choose either of two ways. Either it must create machinery for Government and Opposition to consult one another in some committee or other as far as matters relating to South-West are concerned, or it should expect us to discuss South-West African affairs here in the open House. We as an Opposition believe that the more difficult the affairs of South-West become, the more we have to discuss them. We cannot accept the attitude of the hon. member for Middelland that the Opposition should fold its hands and say nothing. We feel that we would then be neglecting our duty. I think our entire approach in this discussion was a positive one. We regard it as our duty to talk about these matters and to present our point of view to the Government, and we shall continue doing so.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have no objection to the problems of South-West Africa being discussed on a high level. Certainly not. That is what Parliament is there for. What I objected to was the way the hon. member for Bezuidenhout tried to make political gain for his party from the matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I did not try to do that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member did try to do that. That is what he did. He should not try to drag this debate down to a political level. Surely we do not want to score political debating points. In this important debate on South-West Africa the future of an entire nation is at issue, and we do not want a debate conducted on a low level. That is my main objection.</p>

<p>I want to continue. I pointed out the tremendous problems that exist and to which the U.N. can usefully devote their attention and talents. There is, for example, the fact that in Africa everything is at present topsy-turvy. During the past year there were 12 <i>coups d&#x2019;etat</i> on this continent. Nobody can really say who is government in certain countries. Matters have come to such a pass that one group is in power one moment and another group the next. One does not actually know what is going on&#x2014;there is only chaos. Now one would surely think that the U.N., who are supposed to be concerned about world peace, would devote their time to resolving that chaos, that they would try to set a trend and that they would solve those problems. But what are they doing instead&#x003F; They drag South-West Africa, one of the most peaceable countries, into the political arena. There are delega es at the U.N. who would fan the flames against South-West Africa to-morrow, and that while their own hands are still red from the slaughter which took place in their own territories.</p>

<p><span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0887"/>Just consider the political unrest in the rest of the world. In referring to that, I just want to emphasize how many problems there are throughout the world, problems which the U.N. can tackle so fruitfully if they have nothing to do. For years India has been waging a feud with Pakistan, a feud to which there is no solution in sight. There is also the case of Goa. India was allowed to conquer Goa, a territory with a larger population than that of South-West Africa&#x2014;White, Coloured and Black. Goa was simply conquered over-night, and not a finger was lifted. Did the U.N. try to bring about peace, quiet and justice there&#x003F; No. Instead of that peaceful countries like South-West Africa are dragged into the fray. Take the political struggle between the Arabs and Israel. It is a situation which may set virtually all South-Eastern Asia on fire. Are all powers devoted to seeking a solution for all these and many other problems&#x003F; No, this is not done. There is also the situation in Vietnam, which threatens to set the whole world on fire. Take the situation in other states of the world where communist infiltration is taking place, and which are threatening to disturb world peace. One would really think the U.N. have ample opportunity to take action in all these cases and to harness their talents, but they neglect to do so. One may say everything is crying to heaven, one may ask, &#x201C;Has the world lost its sense of values&#x003F;&#x201D; Instead of that South-West Africa is discussed, a country which is not going to commit any aggression. South Africa has said repeatedly that she has no interest in any territory in Africa or elsewhere. We do not want to commit any aggression, we shall never allow that. And aggression is the foremost threat to world peace.</p>

<p>Our entire policy in South-West Africa and in South Africa is indeed directed towards making self-determination available to the minority groups in these territories. This will make it impossible for a majority group to dominate a minority group. This is something which tends pre-eminently to affect world peace. It is the basic cause of the <i>coups d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> which are taking place one after another in Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, take countries like South Africa and South-West Africa and consider their situation in the world at present. Ask yourself whether that situation is one which threatens world peace. In this regard I should like to quote some figures. Last year South Africa attracted R119 million from abroad for investment in this country. Would countries which consider South-West Africa a threat to world peace be prepared to invest money in the Republic on such a large scale&#x003F; Since 1962 the investment of the U.S.A. in South Africa has increased by more than 20 per cent. Does that show lack of confidence in the future of our country&#x003F; Is that an indication that those people consider us a possible threat to world peace&#x003F; Then there is Britain, a country which has invested R3,076 million in South Africa, more than its total investment in all the rest of the world. Would the British invest that money here whilst knowing that the local situation was a threat to world peace&#x003F; Take our relations with the African states, for example. We are forming ties of friendship with states in Africa. Delegates from those countries come here and hold peaceful discussions with us on mutual economic problems. We also contribute our share to the solution of the economic problems of those countries.</p>

<p>I can well understand that there are countries which begrudge South Africa a place in the sun. That is the result of the important strategic position South Africa occupies in the world to-day, of its bastion here at the southern tip of Africa, and of the fact that it is the most developed country in Africa. I can therefore well understand the attitude of those countries. I can also understand that the UNO has undergone a considerable metamorphosis since we assisted in creating that Organization in 1946. At that time the UNO consisted of 51 countries, where at present it consists of 122 countries. More than half these countries have since been admitted, countries which have since gained independence and which are not versed in international relations. They are not yet experienced in international relations.</p>

<p>Of course one should like to see the U.N. perform useful service; this is in fact the reason why this Organization was created. But as a result of the unsatisfactory changes that have taken place in this body in recent years, a great responsibility has been placed on the shoulders of the Western world. One trusts that they will not be taken into tow by immature and irresponsible states which seek to foster feuds against South Africa. One trusts that they will rather set trends, that they will endeavour to bring the UNO back to the right track, in order that it may devote its attention to the basic matters for which it was established. Thus it will fulfil the task we should all like to see it perform, the task for which it was established.</p>

<p>The formation of blocs which is taking place in the UNO at present also carries the germ of the destruction of this very Organization. Through this formation of blocs the feuds against certain countries are fostered, of which South Africa is an eloquent example. This formation of blocs carries the germ of the failure of the U.N. That is why at present the entire world is calling for a change of spirit in the U.N., a change of heart and a change of method, in order that the Organization may be brought back to the purpose for which it was created.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I greatly regret that the hon. member for Middelland has seen fit to attack the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular in connection with the contribution which he made regarding the South-West Africa issue. The hon. member called it party friction and trying to obtain advantage for this side of the House, when from this side of the House we are bringing forward calm and collected <span class="col_4545-4546" refersTo="page_0888"/>arguments in connection with statements made by the Minister yesterday relative to the South-West Africa issue. We would gladly respect the wishes of the Minister when he said:</p>

<block name="quote">For obvious reasons I do not wish to start a debate on South-West Africa; but there are a few aspects of the situation in regard to that territory on which I should like to comment briefly.</block>

<p>I maintain that it is in connection with these aspects with which the Minister himself dealt yesterday that we now want to direct some questions to him and would like his explanation. I have one important question which I should like to direct to him when I near the end of the short period I have available to address the Committee. My Leader unequivocally and very definitely stated the Opposition&#x2019;s policy in connection with the South-West Africa issue under the Vote of the Prime Minister when he very clearly stated that this side with the Government would oppose any attempt by any individuals, nations or the United Nations to interfere in the policies of South Africa because we consider that it is our prerogative and our duty to look after South-West Africa. I would however like to quote to the hon. the Minister one paragraph from his statement on South-West Africa yesterday namely:</p>

<block name="quote">Our experience in the Republic with its different national groups, including what we have learnt here in pursuing the ideals of peaceful co-existence, has of course been of great value in deciding on the best practical means of tackling problems in South-West Africa. There too the population is a multinational one, even more so than in South Africa.</block>

<p>It is in dealing with this expression of his, namely &#x201C;a multi-national population&#x201D;, that I want to put a question to the Minister in due course. In saying this I want to say that this concept of a multi-national population is not new in the Republic of South Africa. This concept was developed two years ago. I should like to quote from Hansard of 27th January, 1965 (column 125), when the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the present Minister, used the following words. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">I want to state very clearly that we see the people of South Africa as constituting various nations, various peoples. The Opposition is so fond of the word &#x201C;races&#x201D;, which I do not like very much, whereas I would say various nations. There is a white nation in South Africa, there is a Coloured nation, an Indian nation, and there are various Bantu nations.</block>

<p>Regardless of whether the Opposition agree with this view of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and presumably also the view of the Government, I would like to put the question whether it could not be an embarrassing concept as far as South-West Africa is concerned with far-reaching consequences in the future. I would like to deal briefly with what the Odendaal Commission said in this regard by quoting from page 81 of its Report. It gives here the findings of the inquiry and its recommendations concerning Ovamboland. They recommended that the seven population groups be grouped together in respect of Ovamboland and thereafter in the case of every population group in South-West Africa. When I refer to the South-West Africa report which was mentioned yesterday by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, I would like to say that, leaving out the Whites and the Coloureds in South-West Africa, there are 10 indigenous groups of which six have a population of less than 15,000. I want to ask the Minister if he does not think that we could better describe the South-West Africa population as &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;multi-nation as &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;multinational&#x201D;. I will endeavour to clarify this. Does the Minister not think that it could constitute an embarrassment in the future as regards the commitments of this Government and successive governments if we say that we have a multi-national community in South-West Africa and that every nation should at some stage in the future obtain its independence within its own state and that we have closed the door in regard to any future negotiations on behalf of ourselves both nationally and as far as South-West Africa is concerned to group together various ethnic groups under one state&#x003F; This might, as far as external consumption is concerned and as far as our international relations are concerned, constitute a commitment by this Government that at some future stage there will be no grouping together of the various ethnic groups, but that all races, now called &#x201C;nations&#x201D; in South-West Africa, will in due course obtain sovereign independence. I shall not, nor will we on this side of the House, endeavour to embarrass the Minister in connection with the South-West Africa issue. We are not trying to make political propaganda out of this matter. We are dealing with statements made by the Minister yesterday and we would like some clarity. We on this side of the House would certainly think that it would be a fairer description, and if not a fairer one, then one with less embarrassing and less far-reaching effects, if the Minister would describe the South-West Africa situation in his statement as &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; and not &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow the argument of the hon. member for East London (City) with regard to South-West Africa. I want to make a few observations on the general concept, not necessarily with regard to South-West Africa, of multi-racialism or multi-nationalism. There is a fundamental difference, and I am not speaking of South-West Africa now but in general, between a race and a nation. One race may consist of a number of nations, but one nation <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0889"/>cannot consist of a number of races. A nation is a group of people with one culture, one language and one tradition.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>We speak of the Teutonic race. We speak of the various races that have existed in the history of the world. All Whites do not belong to one race. I think it is a total misconception to talk about the white race. It consists of a number of nations, and it is a misnomer to refer to a non-white race. We talk about non-white nations, each with its own language, its own customs and its own background. I think the entire concept of multi-racialism and of a &#x201C;multi-racial society&#x201D; has been incorrectly absorbed and incorrectly interpreted for many years, to the disadvantage of anybody dealing with these terms. I think the sooner we return to the concept of multi-nationalism in this country and in Africa, the sooner we shall also get away from the idea that the Whites here are a small minority race and that the non-Whites are superior in numbers. As soon as we bring home the concept of a nation, then we are a nation and the Zulu are a nation, the Swazis are a nation and so are all the other Bantu, and then it does not follow naturally that a mass of unified black people are confronting a small white minority. On the contrary, African unity proves to us that they are multinational, otherwise they would have been unanimous and would in fact have borne the imprint of unity. I want to leave that concept there.</p>

<p>I want to make some observations and I want to draw the Committee&#x2019;s attention to the assistance rendered by various world powers to Africa and Asia, and I want to compare South Africa&#x2019;s position to that. That is actually what I want to emphasize to-day. It is customary in our modern world that there is an ever-increasing disparity between the so-called rich, industrially developed countries on the one hand and the poor, underdeveloped countries on the other hand. It is clear that these two are drifting apart. Tremendous efforts are being made on all sides to prevent that rift from forming. As some people see it, it may give rise to a world war if too large a rift forms between the underdeveloped countries, where food is sometimes essential and is not available, and the so-called rich countries. If that rift and disparity becomes too large, it may result in an end to world peace. There are several reasons why various of these richer countries help the poor countries. In the first place, some people generally consider gaining favour purely as an asset in the cold war. If I may use the image. East and West in their disunity, as they confront one another at present and as communism and anti-communism confront one another, are most anxious to win the favour of the unaligned countries. The unaligned countries are mainly the underdeveloped and so-called poor countries. In an attempt to persuade these countries to align themselves with either the West or the East, financial and technical assistance is rendered to these countries on a vast scale. It is an attempt to swing their favour to one side or another. There is another reason why such assistance is rendered. By some people it is regarded, and very blatantly called, bribery on an international scale. By some people it is seen as a return to colonialism, only in a new form. A country becomes so committed through the assistance rendered to it that it dare not act against or resist the donor. They will then be forced to vote with that nation in the UNO and everywhere else. It is therefore an attempt to win them over in that field. The other is a purely economic aim, namely to obtain a market for one&#x2019;s products and for the materials which are produced. How do countries render aid&#x003F; The West appears to be concentrating mainly on North Africa. The North African states have received an average of 12.9 dollars <i>per capita</i> from the West. South of the Sahara this allocation from Western states amounts to only 4.7 dollars <i>per capita.</i> In other words, it is a clear sign that the Western states are concentrating more particularly on states north of the Sahara. Let us consider three northern countries specifically. In Nigeria Western expenditure <i>per capita</i> was one dollar. In Egypt it was 7.17 dollars per person. In Ghana it was 10.57 dollars per person, over the past five years. Specifically with a view to the case I am trying to establish, I now want to consider the assistance rendered to the same three countries by the East. Nigeria had received 44.5 million dollars up to March, 1965, from the East&#x2014;from states such as China, Russia, Czechoslovakia and others. Egypt received 1,365.9 million dollars and Ghana 219.9 million dollars. In other words, a study of these figures makes it clear that these states are at the moment receiving assistance from both sides. Money is donated from both sides in an attempt to win their favour. This is a very clear illustration of the contention that assistance is a means towards ending the cold war. This reminds me very strongly of what we are accustomed to in our black people, particularly in the past, namely that they hold out both hands to receive what is given to them. Now the modern black statesman is still holding out both hands, but he is holding out one to the East and one to the West, and he receives from both sides. And then he does not say thank you to either. This was made quite clear by Sir Abubakar Balewa, the previous Prime Minister of Nigeria, when he said: &#x201C;We know why East and West give as capital and assistance. The East is hoping we shall become communists, and the West is hoping we shall become capitalists. We refuse to be either capitalists or communists. We prefer pan-Africanism, because the moment we choose either of the two sides, both will stop giving.&#x201D; I think this put it in a nutshell.</p>

<p>I want to give some attention to assistance from the United States of America. Some time ago an investigation was carried out and a <span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0890"/>report published. Senator Ellender spoke on it in the American Congress. He said: &#x201C;We are spending unnecessary money in Africa.&#x201D; He gave some examples. He said: &#x201C;The Haile Selassie, the first university in Ethiopia, we are building at a cost of 1.2 million dollars in a country where there is no network of deserving feeder schools. But a university to the value of 1.2 million dollars is being erected. In Somalia we are building a harbour to export grain, of which barely enough is being grown to feed the local population. The reason why we are building this fine harbour is that the communists in Ethiopia are expanding and modernizing the harbour at Assab. Now we have to maintain the balance by handling the matter in this fashion.&#x201D; A commission under the chairmanship of General Lucius Clay published a report in America. He put it as follows: America thought that the same system which succeeded in Europe, namely the Marshall Plan, would also succeed in the underdeveloped countries. He put it as follows: Assistance to the tune of 13,600 million dollars brought about the miraculous recovery of numerous European countries. The U.S.A. thought it would also succeed in Africa. Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The miracle of post-war recovery in Western Europe was made possible by the application of temporary aid to countries whose well-established economic, political and social systems and trained manpower could use it wisely. In the less-developed nations most of these conditions do not exist.</block>

<p>Then he made a strong recommendation that they should assist in some other way, not financially, but through manpower which should go there to train those people. The interest of the communists in Africa arose at a fairly late stage. It was only after the Bandung Conference in 1955 that the communist bloc started taking a specific interest in Africa. This is clearly evident, and initially their interest was not very serious either. In the first four years, namely from 1956 to 1960, Red China allocated only 4 per cent of its foreign aid to Africa; 23 per cent was allocated to Asia and 73 per cent to other communistic countries of the communist bloc. But then Red China suddenly woke up to its role in Africa. The result one can see very clearly in the assault on Africa, with the specific object of making communist influence prevail here. Their aid increased immediately, and from 1961 to 1964 30 per cent of Red China&#x2019;s foreign aid was allocated to Africa; 37 per cent was allocated to Asia, while the assistance to other communist countries decreased to 33 per cent. Let us consider the countries in Africa which are specifically assisted. This presents a new picture. In the first place Egypt receives the highest contribution from Red China and also the highest contribution from Russia. Algeria receives the second highest from Red China and also from Russia. Then we note the phenomenon that Tanzania, which is fairly close to us, is the third best favoured country as far as Red China is concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The figures given to us by the hon. member for Randfontein are very interesting indeed, but I think he must accept the fact that whether the aid which is being given to the less developed countries has been well spent or not, it has been an essential task of the Western countries to attempt to build up those countries in an effort to keep them from falling into the hands of the communists. This, I am afraid, is going to be a feature of life in the post-war era for a long time to come. I think it is accepted by everybody that a lot of money has been wasted, but equally it is now accepted that the direction in which help must turn is towards the training and building up of the populations in those countries, rather than simply pouring millions and millions of dollars into areas which are unable to use the money properly, and therefore waste the aid which is being given. This is a direction which just has to be taken by the better equipped countries. South Africa, of course, falls into that category. South Africa as the most highly industrialized country on the whole of the African continent dare not turn her back on the rest of Africa and dare not withhold her aid, be it in the form of technical advice, or assistance as far as trade is concerned, unless she is to lose all her future influence on the continent of Africa.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member agrees because I do not believe that we are doing enough. I know that we consider that we have our own underdeveloped areas to attend to in Africa, and that is perfectly true, but we cannot isolate ourselves at the Limpopo. We have to go further afield and we have to develop as much trade-in-aid as we possibly can with the rest of the continent of Africa in order to develop future markets for our manufactured products&#x2014;this is in our own selfish interest&#x2014;as gold mining declines in South Africa, as it inevitably must, because it is a wasting asset, and on the other hand to develop the potentialities of our neighbours, of the countries lying to the north of us. We are doing something in this regard, but not enough. I believe the figure laid down as not the optimum but at least the amount which should be aimed at in aid from developed countries to undeveloped countries, is in the neighbourhood of 1 per cent of the gross national product, and I do not think we come anywhere near that as far as the development of Africa is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland gave us quite a long tirade on the actions of other countries at U.N. and about the attitude of U.N. generally towards South Africa. He wondered why it was that U.N. devoted so <span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0891"/>much time to South-West Africa, which is a peaceful country, and to South Africa, which is also peaceful, when there was so much chaos to which they could more profitably have devoted their time. He cited the Malthusian spectre, the vast population explosion in the world, which is not being matched by the productivity necessary as far as the production of food is concerned; and he mentioned various other things like trouble in Israel, India and Pakistan. All this is perfectly true. I do not know, however, why he assumes that U.N. is not devoting any attention to those problems. I think as South Africans we are inclined only to notice the news that concerns South Africa and we seem to forget about other things which are discussed in the great, wide world. I think the very fact that our Press reports so little of international affairs is indicative of our isolationist outlook. Anyone who attends U.N., as I have done on several occasions, will find that there are dozens of problems under discussion. There are committees sitting on all sorts of different subjects.</p>

<p>It is true that much attention is focused on South-West Africa, but then South-West is in a very specific category. It is, after all, an international problem, as the Minister himself said. That is so, whether we like it or not. But the point I am really getting at is that leaving all this aside, the fact that South Africans will just have to accept whether they like it or not, whether we reduce the amount of money we give to U.N. or not, and whether we even walk out of U.N. or not, which I sincerely hope we will not do, because we can surely do better by being there to put the case we have, than by vacating the arena and nevertheless suffering all the disabilities which will follow&#x2014;whatever action we take, we have to recognize one thing, that the world is primarily concerned with the question of racialism. This is the great problem, the problem of race and colour, and none of the hon. member for Randfontein&#x2019;s anthropological dissertations will have any effect on that either.</p>

<p>It is the question of colour which is the main issue in the world to-day, and whatever we do about proving that the standard of living is higher for Africans living in South Africa than it is for Africans living in Nigeria or Kenya or anywhere else in Africa, is absolutely by the way; it does not matter. All that people look at is how do black South Africans&#x2019; standard of living compares with the standard of living of white South Africans. [Interjection.] Hon. members can shout and scream as much as they like, but this happens to be a fact. [Interjection.] No, I do not enjoy their nonsense at U.N., but I am realistic enough to accept the situation which faces us. Therefore I say that although other problems are discussed at U.N., always back to the one overriding problem of this half of the twentieth century comes the attention of the world, and that is racialism. That is why any solution which is offered by South Africa even in South-West Africa, which does not take this into account, will not have the desired effect. I said originally, when the U.N.&#x2019;s Special Committee on South-West Africa was appointed, I thought that it was most likely an illegal committee and certainly it was unrealistic to believe that it would come up with any solution.</p>

<p>I said that at the beginning of the year, but equally I said when South Africa offered her solution for the problem in South-West, by offering independence to Ovamboland, that it was unrealistic to think that this would be acceptable to U.N. It will not be. They are not looking for any form of partition. [Interjection.] I do not know what will satisfy them, but this much I do know, that unless the territory is considered as a whole, and unless the whole question of the complete removal of any discriminatory practices between Black and White is solved, it will not influence the people overseas. People will look at this report with an eagle eye, and what they will look at will be the economic side of it, among other things. They will look primarily at the economic angle. They will look at wage levels as they apply to Whites and to the indigenous people. [Interjection.] Of course there are poor Whites, but white people do not suffer the disability of not being able to move freely around the territory and they do not have to carry passes and they do not have to suffer under job reservation. Those are the matters which U.N. looks at.</p>

<p>We will bluff ourselves in this country if we believe that the presentation of this report would solve our troubles. I am glad it has been presented, for as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has pointed out, it has been very difficult to get any figures or statistics about South-West Africa other than those which emanated from the report of the Odendaal Commission, and that, I may say, was sadly lacking in this respect because it did not mention wage structures at all. Here we have a report which has a section which deals with wages and so we have some information, but we must not bluff ourselves that because we put out a report like this and because we compare the lot of South-West Africans favourably with the lot of people in Nigeria or Kenya or the rest of the African territories reviewed in this report, this is going to justify the fact that the standard of living for non-Whites in South-West is very much lower than that of Whites.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I have been sitting here listening to the hon. member for Houghton. When she came to this House she gave one the impression that she was wearing a kind of political bikini-dress, but nowadays, as the years went by and one got to know her, she need no longer wear a political bikini-dress; <span class="col_4553-4554" refersTo="page_0892"/>she may as well wear a political mini-dress and leave it to one&#x2019;s imagination and one&#x2019;s judgment to form an opinion of her intent on the basis of her past actions. This afternoon we have once more had an exposition of her point of view which was typical of her and true to type. She could not have been more blatant than that nor need she have been more explicit to us as experienced people in this House. Consequently I leave her at that.</p>

<p>If we want to determine the guiding principles of our foreign policy in this new era, it is necessary for us to draw up a balance sheet of what is happening around us. I think we may safely say that the era of decolonization in Africa has virtually drawn to a close. It has gone hand in hand with political emancipation and has focused the attention of the entire world on this process of political emancipation. I consider it as being necessary just to mention what this process of political emancipation has entailed so as to enable us to place our foreign policy in the proper light. To the states which have passed through this process it has brought fame; it has brought honour; it has brought emotional enthusiasm which has bubbled up and has bubbled over at times. In the second place it has virtually turned Africa into an auction mart. The communist has come here to sell his ideology. The post-war liberalists, of whom the hon. member for Houghton is a perfect exponent, have come to sell their political philosophy. In the third place it has given these politically emancipated states access to various regional or world forums of which we have examples and which provides the world with a constant stream of evidence of their absolute impotence. What is more important, however, is what this process of political emancipation has not brought to Africa. I want to mention a few of these things. In the first place it has not been attended with the slightest indication of economic emancipation. In the second place it has made these politically emancipated states more impotent in the economic sphere as a result of the fact&#x2014;and that follows as certainly as the day follows the night&#x2014;that if one has political emancipation which is not supported by economic power or economic growth, that very same political emancipation degenerates into a condition of unrest and instability which affects and undermines the bases of economic stability. In the third place it has in fact brought emotional enthusiasm and honour and the things which go hand in hand with that, but it has not brought capital; it has not brought food and it has not brought essential and indispensable knowledge. It has not brought more land. What is more important &#x2014;it has had no regard to what we call geographic determination; it has completely ignored geographic borders. Just look at the map of Africa. Ethnic groups, nations which belong together, have been separated and divided from one another with straight lines and for decades that will be a source of unrest and instability in Africa. Nor has it made the slightest change to the size of the populations. Somali has a small population. Of all these states which have become free, there are hardly more than six which have a larger population than London. There are 16 which have a smaller population than Chicago and there are three of them which have a smaller population than Johannesburg. The average income of the majority of the states is approximately R70 <i>per capita</i> per annum but the income which is the due of some states is no more than approximately R14 <i>per capita</i> per annum. There are some of these states which have a smaller budget than one of the universities in the United States of America. There are some of these states whose annual budgets and turnovers are no larger than that of one of the chain stores in America. Another thing which this political emancipation has not brought is greater unity. Do you know, Mr. Chairman, that there are hundreds of different groups in Ghana, all of which at some stage used the words, &#x201C;The people have the free right to determine their political, economic, social and cultural status&#x201D;&#x003F; Ghana has more than 200 of them. Sierra Leone probably has 20 or more. This political emancipation has not brought about increased trade or greater trade potential. But what is important is that the economic strength of quite a number of these states depends on a single commodity. Nigeria has ground nuts only, Somalia has bananas only. Ghana has only five commodities and the world can manage without any of them whereas Ghana cannot manage without exporting them. I want to remind you, Sir, of the fact that the large Tanganyika ground nut scheme of the thirties miscarried as a result of climatological conditions in Africa, the Africa that has since become free and has passed through this process of political emancipation. To this image I want to contrast the process of emancipation of the Republic of South Africa. When we withdrew from the Commonwealth and became a republic, South Africa completed its full cycle of political emancipation. The difference between what happened here and what happened to the north of our borders is that South Africa&#x2019;s process of political emancipation was supported by a strong and growing economy. The time has arrived when we are no longer able to divorce a progressive and positive foreign policy from dynamic economic growth and from a strong economy, and consequently I am of the opinion that we may now ask the Western world, without any fear that to do so will be bravado on our part, to make a re-assessment of the political value of black Africa in the light of their economic strength. In the second place I think we may safely ask the Western world to make a reassessment of the hollow cry that South Africa&#x2019;s internal affairs constitute a threat to world peace. I want to put it as follows: In our political guidance of the Bantu nations towards political emancipation, we are doing something which the Western world did not do in Africa in this process of decolonization. We are providing our guidance of the Bantu nations towards political emancipation with a <span class="col_4555-4556" refersTo="page_0893"/>strong and steady economic support. This is the big difference but at the same time it provides the guarantee to us that when the Bantu may reach his eventual culmination point of political emancipation that will not be attended, as it has been attended in black Africa, with unrest, <i>coups d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat</i> and bloodshed; it will be a peaceful and stable culmination point. Consequently I say that the Republic of South Africa may request the world to ask us for advice, because we are of Africa; we know Africa. The Republic of South Africa is not a builder of colonies, we are a builder of states.</p>

<p>I want to make the prediction here that we, in this big international task in which we are engaged, namely that of leading nations to political emancipation, will be more than a match for this post-war liberalism in South Africa and in Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to touch upon certain aspects of our relations with the U.S.A. But before I do that I do want to say that, as always, I found it interesting to listen to the hon. member for Carletonville, and I think many will find his arguments very persuasive. I would have thought that some of his arguments would cause him to reflect seriously upon the course that he and his Government are advocating.</p>

<p>I also just want to touch lightly on what the hon. member for Randfontein dealt with partly, because the hon. the Minister also raised the matter. They both dealt with the question that South Africa was a multinational country. I should be very glad if the Minister would explain to us whether a nation in this sense requires to have a country of its own, and, if so, which country there is for the Coloureds and which for the Indians. Because unless one is prepared to give an answer to that question&#x2014;and a straight answer at that&#x2014; I believe that what they said is misleading and I believe it is unworthy of the Government. Let us get clarity about terms and thereby give greater clarity to the entire electorate when reviewing our problems.</p>

<p>I want to turn now to our relations with the U.S.A. I am particularly keen to know about the spirit in which the Minister approaches our relations with that country. I am particularly keen to know what is the state of mind of himself and his Government in this regard. I am particularly keen to know whether they have regained balance fully in this matter. I think that I should indicate why I am so concerned about this. Clearly the importance of our relations with the U.S. cannot be overstressed. America is the leading power in the world, the power which, by not being prepared to move against us, ensures certainly for the foreseeable future that we can be left to work out our own destiny here without outside interference of a serious kind.</p>

<p>There have been unhappy incidents between us and the U.S.A. in recent times. Offence has been given on both sides. One saw from the American side many utterances and some actions which were deeply wounding to us.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to elaborate on these utterances now. The actions were particularly in regard to the supply of arms to enable us to play our part in the defence of this part of the Western chain. But there were on our side, in the not so distant past at all, incidents which seemed to show a considerable lack of balance in the handling of our affairs, and which seemed to indicate that we were almost vying with them&#x2014;and they with us, too&#x2014;to give offence to each other. These incidents took place when this Minister was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and therefore it becomes important to know what makes the hon. the Minister tick in regard to the U.S.A.</p>

<p>By way of illustration of this pattern I want to refer to the incidents in regard to the aircraft-carrier <i>Independence,</i> and our attitude there. I refer to the threatened incidents regarding the tracking stations. I refer to certain difficulties that were reported regarding certain personnel of the U.S. embassy. As I say, the actions of the Americans, and certain actions of ours, gave one the impression that the two states were vying with each other to give and take offence. Shortly before these incidents I had read in a publication by an American, called, I think, <i>Notes on South African Foreign Policy,</i> a statement which shocked me considerably, a statement which I found impossible to believe when I read it, but which, in the light of the subsequent incidents, made me fearful that there may be truth in it. This publication was issued in 1965. It commenced with a statement to this effect, that in the opinion of influential and responsible Americans South Africa and the U.S. are drifting into a state of hostilities. Now this statement was made by a person both well acquainted with American conditions and with South African conditions. As I say, I was staggered to read this; but then there did come these incidents which made it seem possible that America, particularly, but ourselves too, was rather reckless about our relations.</p>

<p>We certainly have our vital interests to protect, and our vital interests can certainly not be sacrificed on anybody&#x2019;s account. We have our internal affairs, and undoubtedly the outside world cannot be allowed to dictate to us how we settle these affairs. But having said this, I believe that particularly in regard to the U.S.A. we should not be quick to take offence nor should we be quick to give offence. That indeed applies to all countries with whom we have friendly relations. We must, I think, appreciate the American position. They are an immense shield to South Africa at this present time. Were it not for the Americans, we would be in an extremely ticklish position here in Africa. We already have the Chinese causing trouble from their distant lair, and notwithstanding all the problems they have in their own part of the world they are entering into considerable expenditure in Africa. We know how within weeks of Britain leaving Zanzibar the Chinese were in. We know how Tanzania is largely under their influence. We know how they are strongly entrenched in <span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0894"/>Basutoland. We had that fact from the late Prime Minister. There was a time when our police were saying quite frequently that in all the Protectorates there was strong communist influence. But for various reasons this has been mentioned less and less during recent times.</p>

<p>America and the war she is fighting in Vietnam mean an immense shield to us. The sacrifices they, are making there undoubtedly keep back the Chinese flood. If America were to withdraw to her mainland, I have no doubt that such great Chinese resources and strength would be released that we would have an extremely difficult problem on our hands here in South Africa. One can think merely of Madagascar lying on our one flank; one can think of their position already in Basutoland; one can think of the other new territories which have received their independence. One can apply the theories of the last hon. member who spoke to indicate that so many of these states are probably not yet ready for their full independence. So it is by the sacrifices of America in treasure and blood&#x2014;and they have 400,000 men fighting in Vietnam&#x2014; that we are able to sleep as peacefully in our beds at night as we do. I think that in the light of that situation we have to be, as I say, very disinclined to give offence. I shall repeat again, lest anyone misunderstand me: We have our vital interests which cannot be sacrificed. We have our internal affairs which we must be allowed to settle.</p>

<p>When time prevented me a short while ago from saying what I intended saying, I was saying that the Republic of South Africa was able to advise the world in regard to affairs affecting Africa, because we ourselves were of Africa. I was also saying that post-war liberalism, of which the hon. member for Houghton was an exponent, would come to a dead end in South Africa, not as a result of congresses we might hold nor as a result of pamphlets which we might issue, but mainly as a result of the fact that it would come into conflict with reality. This reality is to be found in the fact that the Republic of South Africa, in its process of emancipating the Bantu to political maturity, is giving the Bantu economic support. When such political emancipation is attended with economic emancipation one has what is a prerequisite as well as an essential basis for peace and quiet and stability. It is because this vacuum has been caused in Africa over the past decade that the present scene in Africa is unfolding itself before our eyes. I want to repeat that the Republic of South Africa is not a builder of colonies but a builder of states. The Republic has never made any bid in Africa to sell its ideology. It has repeatedly been stressed in this House that the policy of separate development was no export product and that it was not our desire to place it on the world market as an export commodity to which we attached a certain price. The hon. member for Pine-lands spoke of certain powers which allegedly were of so much value to the world and which allegedly had brought the world such a great deal of good. I want to point out to him, however, that the aid given and assistance rendered in Africa by some of those powers contemplated a totally different object than that contemplated by the Republic when it is prepared to make available to Africa its knowledge, its capital and its food on a basis of exchange and mutual achievement. In this is to be found the basic difference between the foreign policy of South Africa, one which has to have the closest links with its economic power, and the foreign policies of those powers particularly as regards Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the Republic of South Africa is able to perform a tremendous task in the international sphere. In this regard, however, we must not restrict our task to Africa alone and be blind to everything but Africa. At the same time we may not lose sight of Africa. Consequently I am saying that we must not be blind to anything but Africa but at the same time we may not ignore the vacuum which has been caused in Africa nor the possibilities which that may hold for us. We find ourselves in the fortunate position that we have a dynamic and positive foreign policy, one which we are able to reformulate from time to time as developments require. In developing this strong and positive foreign policy, South Africa may always depend on the knowledge and the experience which it has acquired, on its untapped resources and on its large food potential. Africa has a crying need of all these things. A political party that wants to be worth its salt in the future&#x2014;and in this regard I am addressing myself to the Opposition in particular&#x2014;will have to adapt itself to the idea that there will no longer be any scope for plying the domestic front with arguments. The population of South Africa has already accepted separate development and the emancipation of the Bantu nations in its various aspects. Where the Opposition may make a constructive contribution to the advantage of South Africa is in the formulation of a forceful foreign policy. This holds a tremendous challenge for us outside as well as inside this continent of Africa, of which we irrevocably and inseparably form a part. South Africa, as virtually the only full-fledged state in Africa which is competent and qualified to operate in the international sphere, has to accept the challenge of Africa. If we <span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0895"/>do so, South Africa will reap the fruits of being a strong independent state and at the same time we will not be abandoning the historical bases of our foreign policy&#x2014;namely, the safeguarding of our security and of our identity, and keeping open ways of international communication, and the guarantee that South Africa will be able to provide its growing millions with the necessary opportunities of gaining a livelihood. This we can best do by seeking assistance from and giving assistance to our neighbours.</p>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to one of the great men of our times, a person who was recently taken from us in such a tragic way&#x2014;Professor J. P. Bruwer, the late vice-principal of the University of Port Elizabeth. I regard this as being a suitable occasion for paying tribute to his memory because over a very long period he exerted himself actively for and also made an important contribution to the development of better relations, particularly with the black people of Africa. As one of the most important witnesses for South Africa in the South-West Africa case before the World Court, his wide knowledge, his insight, his integrity and honesty made a strong impression on everyone. Many writings, of which &#x201C;South-West Africa: Disputed Land&#x201D; is the latest and one worth reading, appeared from his pen. For a considerable period he was Commissioner-General in the Ovambo homeland where he rendered services of inestimable value mainly as a result of the fact that he spoke the language of the people and consequently had a better understanding of them. But it was particularly during the nine years which he spent as a missionary and teacher in Malawi and Zambia, while his wife was in charge of a large medical institution, that he probably made his greatest contribution to the Republic of South Africa and established relations on which we are able to build to-day. He could speak and read seven Bantu languages fluently. He often corresponded with African leaders. After his death his wife was literally flooded with letters and telegrams from people of African states, including African leaders. The mission from Malawi which paid a visit to our country at the time of the death of Professor Bruwer requested the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs to convey also their sympathy to Mrs. Bruwer. The spirit of appreciation which radiated from this fine tribute is indicative of the tremendous esteem in which the black people of Africa held this man. He had two great unrealized ideals. The first of these ideals was the erection of a building which could serve as a photo-library of the separate African states. At the time of his death he had already made a great deal of progress with the collection of these photos. His second ideal was for an institution to be erected in one of our larger cities where ordinary people, not necessarily leaders, from African states could spend short holidays so as to come into contact with the South African way of life. It would be fitting if these two monuments were to be erected in memory of this great son of South Africa.</p>

<p>Persons like Professor Bruwer and others are the ones who laid the foundations on which we can build to-day as far as good relations are concerned. The hon. the Minister and his Department, particularly its Africa Division, also deserve the highest praise and appreciation for the excellent progress made and the miraculous improvements effected in our relations with African states. I believe that our success or failure in the international world will depend on our relations with African states. Therefore the impression which a number of Ministers from Malawi who paid us a short visit could take back with them was of vital importance. The speech made by Dr. Banda after the return of those Ministers to Malawi is interesting, as is the admonition he addressed to other African states because of their hypocrisy. According to <i>The Herald</i> of 30th March he said on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While they are criticizing me for trading with South Africa openly, they themselves are trading with South Africa secretly. While they are decrying South Africa they are doing so on stomachs full of South African meat.</block>

<p>Subsequently he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I have to face realities and that is that South Africa is here to stay. It is no use we African leaders deceiving or deluding ourselves about it. South Africa is militarily the strongest power on our continent. No single state or combination of states in Africa can ever hope to expel South Africa or obliterate her from the face of Africa. And it would be wrong for the United Nations to wage war on or against South Africa for political reasons.</block>

<p>These are the words of an African leader and one hopes that these words will also lead to maturer reflection and greater realism on the part of other African leaders. It is because these people accept our <i>bona fides,</i> because they know us and know that they can rely on us that recent times have brought other phenomena which indicate that cracks are beginning to appear in the wall of prejudice and hatred which have been built up against us. So, for example, Harry Nkumbula of the African National Congress, the Leader of the Opposition in Zambia, recently pleaded that Zambia should follow Malawi&#x2019;s example and establish trade relations with South Africa. Dr. Robert Gardner, Secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, who is a Ghanaian, for instance, said that the stereotyped condemnation of Lesotho, Malawi and Swaziland as being hostages of South Africa should be discontinued because those people might have good reasons for co-operating with South Africa. Lesotho&#x2019;s High Commissioner in London, Mr. J. R. L. Kotsokoane, said <span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0896"/>unambiguously that his country would cooperate with South Africa whatever the rest of Africa might do. Although ours is a state which has developed far&#x2014;the most highly developed state in Africa&#x2014;we do not treat these people condescendingly and prescribe to them what they should and should not do. On the contrary, we see our task in Africa precisely in the light that we want to help the nations of Africa to help themselves, to retain their self-respect and to work out their own salvation so that they may stand on their own feet. Consequently we do not go to those people with large amounts of money to lower them to the status of beggars. The assistance we offer to the developing states of Africa can never be measured-in terms of money. The assistance in the technical, scientific and particularly agricultural spheres is of such tremendous value for the very reason that we do not go to them with hollow theories. We have practical experience and we know Africa and its people.</p>

<p>The world is now beginning to realize what we in South Africa realized many years ago. The problems of Africa are not the problems of one man one vote, but the problems of poverty and hunger and misery and ignorance. In order to relieve this condition, South Africa is performing an enormous task, the scope of which is becoming wider and wider. I mention only a few examples. There is the interstate commission for the control of foot-and-mouth disease to which eight African states belong. At the head of this commission, as its director, is a South African, Dr. M. C. Lambrechts. Research in this regard has helped a great deal in isolating and combating this dreaded disease amongst the cattle herds of Africa. There is the international board of control for combating the red locust to which the following states, <i>inter alia,</i> belong, together with South Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Uganda, Burundi, Ruanda, Malawi, Angola, Mozambique and the Congo. South Africa makes the biggest financial contribution to that board of control, namely R100,000 per annum. The locust is being combated in this way and crops are being saved. Throughout the year South Africa assists in the campaign of combating the tsetse fly, the insect which is regarded as the curse of Africa and which spreads sleeping sickness. South African pilots recently sprayed an area covering thousands of miles in order to exterminate this insect. A heavy flow of Whites and Bantu from all African states are granted interviews every day by our Department of Agriculture to supply them with information on the many agricultural problems. Onderstepoort, which is internationally famous, makes available millions of doses of vaccine to these countries if they ask for them. We are the most advanced country in the world as far as rinderpest is concerned, and all African states enjoy the benefit of this&#x2014;even countries such as Persia and Pakistan. South African scientific magazines are distributed free of charge throughout the world. There are magazines such as <i>The South African Journal of Veterinary Science, Farming in South Africa,</i> and others. Even countries such as British Guiana, Gambia, Madagascar and Mauritius, receive these magazines. It is illuminating that even the Russian Academy for Science has already requested South African agricultural magazines which it re-distributes. In this way South Africa is going ahead quietly to help the people of Africa to help themselves. We are doing all these things without creating the impression that we are superior, something which is so often ascribed to us. As a matter of fact, it is precisely our policy of separate development with its relentless emphasis on separate freedoms for nations which feel separate and with its respect for identities which creates for us the basis on which we are able to co-operate with these people as equals. Separate development and the recognition of the right of self-determination of other people, and the firm maintenance of our own right of self-determination, do not constitute an obstacle as far as our foreign policy is concerned. Those things form its very foundation. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry the hon. member for Carletonville is not here. I must say that for a moment I found myself curiously at one with him when he was talking about the vacuum that exists in Africa to-day. I believe that the metropolitan powers who pulled out of Africa in such a precipitous fashion did the world a very grave disservice because they did in fact leave a vacuum in Africa into which all sorts of other inimical powers are seeking to penetrate. There is no question about the fact that we in South Africa shine like a light in this vacuum. If the darkness is to be rolled back, we in South Africa have a vital part to play. It is the part of this Minister to do that. That is the responsibility of his Department. I must say that I found it exceedingly strange, coming from the hon. member from Carletonville, that he should talk about reality, when one finds the brutal fact of economic integration in this country forcing the National Party to redefine their policy time after time to the point where today we have reached a policy of virtual Balkanization of our country to avoid the inescapable consequences of that economic integration under which we live&#x2014;the natural consequences of our life in this country of South Africa. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what progress he and his Department are making in a direction which I think is vital to all of us here in the southern portion of Africa. It is vital to our country, South Africa, and it is vital to all our neighbouring countries. I am referring to a way of finding a common answer to the challenge which communist and African nationalist subversion and sabotage poses to all of us, to white South Africa, to all our black neighbours, to Rhodesia, to South-West Africa and the Portuguese territories. If anything can ruin what we are achieving and what we are seeking to achieve in Africa, it is that sort of armed subversion <span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0897"/>which will force not only us but our neighbours as well to divert the resources which are to-day applied to positive development to the negative means of repression which this kind of subversion brings in its train. I should like to know what steps, if any, are being taken by the Department to approach our neighbouring countries to build up some kind of defensive alliance in the southern portion of Africa. We have this unifying factor. It is a common menace to all of us. It was stressed by the hon. member for Pinelands that the late Prime Minister mentioned with concern the growing communist penetration of the then Protectorates. To-day we are in this favourable position, that we can deal with emergent states which are not under the control of Britain any more, but which are able to enter with us into some kind of agreement. I think it is vital to us to realize that to them, as to us, communist subversion is a very grave threat indeed. I realize that this is a ticklish problem because the last thing we want to do in South Africa is to give the impression that we are expansionists or militarists in any way at all. We are not, and we do not want to create the impression that we are, because that would be fatal to what we are trying to do, which is to act as a leader in Africa, to lead our people and the others in Africa to a more secure and stable future. It will take careful negotiation to avoid giving that impression, but I believe that it can be done because we already have a very close relationship with the territories immediately to the north of us, a relationship of trade which must lead to greater community of interest in all spheres. This guarantee of stability against the threat of subversion is the most important of all, in my opinion. Southern Africa is like a house of cards. If one country topples under communist subversion, I believe it will be with the utmost difficulty that we will be able to hold up the remainder of the structure. I think that we as the most powerful and most developed country in Southern Africa should take the initiative at the very highest level of negotiation to offer some sort of guarantee to our neighbours against subversion of this sort, because their vital interests and ours are so clearly affected. I believe that we can offer them an umbrella of some sort, and some kind of guarantee for stability. The significant part of this is that the African leaders are showing themselves receptive to this kind of advance from South Africa, even so receptive that they will brave the obloquy of other African leaders, to be associated with us. I think this is a critical time, and while the iron is hot and the climate of opinion in the world seems to be swinging against the extremism and the complete instability of Africa, we should take the initiative. I would welcome from the Minister of Foreign Affairs some indication of whether he has something like this in mind, whether it is practicable and whether this is not the time when one ought to do it.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>In this debate there were certain points which particularly caught my attention. I shall not follow up on the arguments raised by the hon. member who has just sat down, but some of the things he said struck me,:too, and I agree with him. Among the matters which caught my attention in this debate was, in the first place, the statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in regard to the U.N. Committee on Apartheid and our financial obligations to the U.N. I feel that in this respect, too, it was high time we took unequivocal, firm and correct action&#x2014;as the Minister of Information said yesterday&#x2014;as we have done in respect of Rhodesia and South-West Africa.</p>

<p>To refresh your memory, on 20th April, 1965, this Special Committee on Apartheid was so presumptuous as to ask the Secretary-General to request UNESCO &#x201C;to prepare a study on the effects of the policy of apartheid in the fields of education, science and culture&#x201D;. Subsequent to that Nigeria made a request in that committee for the extension of a publicity campaign against apartheid. These things happened in that Special Committee, and we in South Africa are paying for them. South Africa&#x2019;s objection was set out in a letter dated 9th July, 1965, in which we said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been a tradition of the United Nations and its Secretary, including publicity organs, not to take a position on an issue but simply to report faithfully and fairly the proceedings within the United Nations, reflecting both sides of the issue.</block>

<p>If it so happens that only one side of the case is presented, then South Africa asks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then the traditional practice of U.N. as well as elementary justice require that the South African case as presented in U.N. on various occasions be given equal publicity to enable world opinion to make a fair judgment.</block>

<p>These documents were handed over and yet, in the 39th session which followed immediately afterwards, this matter was not even discussed. But the point I want to make is this. As far as these objections are concerned, we are not quite alone in the stand we are taking. I find that Dr. Hastings Banda said the following in the statement of policy he made in the Malawi Parliament in 1966&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have welcomed to this country those persons who represent the specialized agencies of the U.N., and we support the action they are taking throughout the world. However, I disapprove of the increasing tendency of allowing international politics to creep into the deliberations of the agencies. My Government and I are deeply convinced that international political matters should only be discussed in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the U.N., and that any attempt at discussing these matters in special agencies can only have an adverse effect on their activities.</block>

<p><span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0898"/>This sensible view (taken by an African leader brings me now to the general impression which has been taking root amongst all of us lately, namely that South Africa has now been given the green light. At this s age I think that it is fitting for us to praise the hon. the Prime Minister for having succeeded, in the short while he has been in office, in making known such phrases as &#x201C;Accept us as we are&#x201D; and &#x201C;We have faith and a sense of honour&#x201D;. In this respect I also want to praise the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. If the world has to accept us as we are, it has to know who we are and how we are, and through his contribution he informs the world. He does not speak often, but when he speaks, he speaks timeously and correctly, as far as I am concerned. I want to express my gratitude for the two excellent publications, dealing with our foreign problems, which have appeared in the past year. These publications are the <i>Questions Affecting South Africa and the United Nations,</i> which appeared last year, and this year&#x2019;s <i>South-West African Survey,</i> on which I shall not elaborate because in my opinion this, too, is a matter which we cannot discuss at this juncture without possibly doing harm to our own cause. We are grateful for the change in the pattern of action in our foreign policy. From now on it will be dealt with in this way: in future the Minister of Foreign Affairs will deal with matters relating to Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. He made an announcement to that effect. I want to pay him this compliment because his handling of these matters has been faultless up to now. Southern Africa is becoming an ever-growing bloc of nations co-operating economically. Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s far-sightedness in this respect is gradually becoming a reality, and Africa is beginning to listen to reason. The view expressed by Robert Gardner of the U.N.&#x2019;s Economic Commission for Africa that &#x201C;to achieve viability for most African countries almost necessarily implies close and systematic co-operation with their neighbours&#x201D; may be linked up with the view held by the leader of a country which will also gain its independence in Southern Africa soon, namely Prince Makosini, who is soon to become the Prime Minister of Swaziland and who is at present the leader of the most powerful party there. He described the basis of his foreign policy as having sound relations with his neighbouring states, and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other states. According to him Swaziland, a small country of 6,000 sq. miles, will maintain firm economic ties with South Africa, and he repeated these principles in November.</p>

<p>It is possible to quote a number of these examples, and I think that this is so because we have hastened ourselves slowly in our relations with African states. These things were achieved under the policy of apartheid, under the policy of independent development, and for that reason I think that it is unwise to say too much about diplomatic representation in the African states at this stage. One should not force the issue. At the beginning of this year the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs said the following (Hansard, Col. 439, 31st January, 1967)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I must tell you frankly, Sir, that I believe that there will in fact be an exchange of diplomatic representatives with African states at some future stage, but let me add at once that that is not the real problem at the present moment.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to address myself to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular. My appeal to hon. members is that they should rather refrain from making a political debating point in this House out of a matter which requires delicate handling. In his paper on <i>Swart Afrika:Politieke en Administratiewe</i> Tendense<i>,</i> Dr. J. J. N. Cloete writes the following on African leaders (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of them are undoubtedly aware of the numerous advantages co-operation with South Africa would imply for them, but in view of the present political climate in Africa and in the world in general, they simply cannot afford to establish friendly relations with South Africa.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are aware of the spectacles of diplomatic ostentation that have taken place in Africa. We know how precipitately diplomatic relations were entered into and how they were just as often simply broken off again.</p>

<p>At present Russia still has 18 diplomatic missions in Africa, and from behind the Iron Curtain there are 88 such missions in Africa. Our commonsense ought to tell us that our status does not permit us to become involved in such diplomatic races. To my mind we should also refrain from giving too much publicity to the other things we are doing for them and the other relations we have with them in the economic sphere. Indeed, the African states should be accommodated on the world scene, but it is a matter which should not be exaggerated. But for certain exceptions these leaders have not yet gained experience in formulating foreign policy; nor have they gained experience in diplomatic practices. In this respect they have no precedents. Diplomacy is an art which has developed over the last century or two and even in Western countries it merely dates back to about 160 years ago, and we feel that in this case this is not Africa&#x2019;s major need. Mr. Chairman, what are the true facts about the needs of Africa&#x003F; We have often been told here that the masses are lapsing into a state of poverty, ignorance, disease and economic imbalance. To them democracy and Communism are in actual fact nothing but words. I believe that South Africa is doing the right thing in marking time as far as diplomatic representation is concerned, because it has been proved in the rest of the African states that, if this is overdone, it can only be to the detriment of these young states.</p>

<from><span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0899"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, allow me to congratulate the official Opposition cordially on the way they acted in this debate on the extremely important Foreign Affairs Vote. When one glances through the debates which have been conducted on this Vote since 1948, one finds that the conduct of the official Opposition was of such a nature that it often gave one the feeling that they had no love for this country. Sir, I do not want to be petty. If what they said here to-day is their sincere approach, then it is a major breakthrough as far as the future is concerned. It is only a pity that it was not stated from the very outset that the official Opposition conceded that what had been achieved as regards the African states, was in fact achieved as a result of the policy of separate development. This was made possible through the development of the policy in which we on this side of the House believe. Mr. Chairman, when South Africa became a Republic the late Dr. Verwoerd stated unequivocally that, in spite of the hate campaign waged by the African states, he would nevertheless go on trying to foster better relations and to bring about better relationships between the African states and the Republic of South Africa. Separate development, as the hon. the Prime Minister has already stated, is not a policy which was formulated for export purposes. I am convinced that if we had ever tried to do that, we should never have been able to face the outside world as we are doing to-day. It was great statesmanship to make the statement that we had reached the stage where South Africa could go out into the world to make its contribution. I believe that south of the Equator, not merely south of the Kunene or south of the Zambesi, South Africa will in the next decade or two make a tremendous contribution to the welfare of the approximately 25 million people living south of the Zambesi and the Kunene, and the far larger numbers living in the area from there up to the Equator. I believe that South Africa will do that through the maintenance of its white civilization and through the development of the policy of separate development. May I just state here, Sir, that it may never remain static. On the contrary, we shall always have to build on our policy of separate development so that there may be no danger of the Whites being swamped by the Blacks. Africa is a challenge to the nation of South Africa, but this nation of ours has faith in the future of this country; this nation believes that it has a destined purpose. This nation has never refused to render a contribution to the development of Africa, be it by means of missionary work or by means of our Department of Agriculture. I am convinced that the nation which knows the soul of Africa, the white nation here on the southern point of Africa, is better able to render a contribution to the progress of the African states than countries which are buying the friendship of the African states. After all, it is a fact that the Western nations as well as the communistic nations are trying to buy the friendship of the inhabitants of African states. I am convinced that they will not succeed in doing so. On the contrary, I believe that the contribution of the Whites in South Africa will be on a much higher level than that of merely buying ties of friendship. Owing to its geographic position. South Africa has a major role to play in Africa as regards commerce, but South Africa realizes that one of the greatest problems with which Africa has to contend, lies in the ethnical division of the population groups. The African states have to contend with the problem of various ethnic groups in one and the same country, and that is why a revolution is taking place in Africa. There is so much hostility among the various ethnic population groups and tribes that it is quite impossible to try to stimulate evolution, and as a result this continuous revolution is taking place. The African states will have to find their own formula. South Africa will never dictate to them that they should accept our policy. On the contrary, it has been stated time and again that we believe in peaceful co-existence without intervention in the affairs of other African states. I believe that this is the right policy, but I believe that a formula will in fact be found in Africa&#x2014;perhaps under the cloak of another name&#x2014;to create peace and a future for these African states. I am convinced that there is not a single person in South Africa who begrudges them that. The various ethnic groups will have to be respected and they will have to be afforded the opportunity to work out their own salvation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, once we are dealing with matters of policy, we sometimes forget about the Estimates. Would the hon. the Minister be so kind as to shed light on a few items in the Estimates when he gives us his reply&#x003F; I am referring to page 233, to the item &#x201C;Other staff&#x201D; opposite an amount of R165.000. A footnote reads that it &#x201C;includes provision for two posts additional to the authorized establishment&#x201D;. I am also referring to the item &#x201C;Technical assistance and co-operation&#x201D; on page 239 under sub-head E. The amount requested for this purpose this year, namely R250,000, is much higher than that of last year. Would the Minister furnish us with some information in that regard&#x003F; Then the item &#x201C;Secret services&#x201D;. Earlier in this Session the Minister explained that the account in respect of &#x201C;Secret services&#x201D; in the Foreign Affairs Vote, did not mean espionage services. Would it not be better if the term &#x201C;Confidential services&#x201D; were used instead&#x003F; Still under sub-head E, there is the item &#x201C;Payment to legal and other experts&#x201D; opposite an amount of R15,000, an item which did not appear last year. Would the hon. the Minister kindly furnish us with information about this item as well&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows that this side does not like &#x201C;Thank the Minister&#x201D;-speeches, but we would be unfair if we did not say that we felt satisfied with the progress made in connection with contact with certain African states. At this stage it is as yet only in a <span class="col_4569-4570" refersTo="page_0900"/>limited field. We know that there has also been contact with certain other African states further up north, and I merely wondered whether the time was not ripe for the Minister to furnish us with some new information in regard to further progress as regards contact with African states.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year an interesting little report appeared in the official <i>South African Digest.</i> It appeared under the heading &#x201C;Bantu preacher surprises Holland&#x201D;. The report read as follows: &#x201C;A Bantu Minister spoke to approximately 60,000 Dutch people during the past three weeks and succeeded in creating chaos among the critics of South Africa in Holland.&#x201D; This is a wonderful testimonial for the preacher, the Rev. S. G. Ntoane. I have been wondering whether the time has not arrived for the Minister to consider the desirability of South Africa&#x2019;s making greater use of the opportunity of finding non-White leaders to be of assistance&#x2014;as this one was&#x2014; in breaking down misconceptions about South Africa abroad. Experience has shown that there are elements abroad who will pay much more attention to what a non-White person from South Africa has to say than to anything which comes from the Government itself or from white persons. Here we have practical proof of that once again. It has always been our point of view that the Government should employ all possible means to improve our image. I am asking, therefore, whether the time has not arrived for the Minister to see whether it is possible to find non-White leaders to be of assistance in breaking down misconceptions abroad.</p>

<p>There have been certain new appointments of ambassadors in recent times. I am thinking of the new appointment in London in particular. I should like to express our satisfaction at the appointment of Dr. H. G. Luttig as our ambassador in London. Until recently he was our ambassador in Vienna, which is somewhat removed from the scope of the ordinary news coverage in South Africa. However, our information is that he has quietly effected important breakthroughs for South Africa in Eastern Europe. I want to say that we are aware of that, and we feel that he will be an asset to South Africa in London.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time has not arrived for him to reconsider the attitude adopted by the Government in regard to certain diplomatic functions held in our country. The hon. member for Pinelands raised the question of our relations with America. I want to agree with what he said. America has recently adopted a very interesting attitude in regard to S.W.A. at the U.N. It is clear to us that it has made a stand in certain respects, that it is eager to enter into a dialogue with South Africa and to put a stop to wild ventures. I think we for our part ought to do everything in our power to establish and maintain the most cordial and natural relations with the U.S.A. The hon. the Prime Minister explained that where an &#x201C;interstate&#x201D; function takes place, colour will play no part at all. I am raising this point for the purpose of expressing the hope that we shall soon again reach the position where the established relations in respect of local diplomatic functions will have been restored.</p>

<p>As I have said, there has been an improvement in respect of our relations with certain states in Africa, especially those close to us. I want to ask the Minister whether it is also the intention to induce the Leader of Botswana to pay a visit to South Africa with a view to closer relations. In a certain sense Botswana is more important than Lesotho, because it is a territory which borders on S.W.A., and it is in addition a gateway to the North. As a matter of fact, there are also large numbers of Hereros in Botswana, and I think we should devise special plans for entering, as soon as possible, into the closest relations with Botswana as well.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister to request his people kindly to exercise caution when they make public statements. Recently there was a case which upset the Portuguese. There are certain hon. members on the other side who are so quick to refer to Portuguese Territories as being &#x201C;coffee coloured&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of the Interior returned from Brazil and said that we did not want to land ourselves in the position in which Brazil finds itself and become a &#x201C;coffee-coloured state&#x201D;. That statement gave a tremendous amount of offence. We are always very dissatisfied when other people refer sneeringly to the racial policy in South Africa, but sometimes we, too, are inclined to refer sneeringly to people who pursue a different policy&#x2014;for instance, a policy of multi-racialism&#x2014;and are very successful with it. I am thinking of Brazil, which is an outstanding example of a unitary state which is entirely multi-racial. The same applies to Mozambique and Angola. In any case, I think we should get away from statements of that nature. I feel that it is time the Minister said something about this matter, because if it comes from him, it will in fact have effect and induce people to exercise more caution.</p>

<p>A further matter I want to raise is the question of the Chinese community in South Africa. I do not want to go into details now, but there is great dissatisfaction amongst members of the Chinese community in Johannesburg about certain steps for which the hon. the Minister is not responsible but which falls under another Department. In Johannesburg this small community&#x2014;they are a mere handful of people&#x2014;are being bundled into a group area. Suggestions have already been made to the Government as to how to handle this matter in a different way. I think this is a matter of which the Minister of Foreign Affairs ought to take due notice. We should bear in mind that China is a member of the Security Council, and at this stage it would be very unwise if harmful impressions were to be created abroad, especially as far as China is concerned, harmful impressions which could, in turn, spark off new fires among the Afro-Asians, under the leadership of China, against <span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0901"/>South Africa. When the Vote in question comes up for discussion here, we shall go into further detail, but I am sure that the hon. the Minister knows what I am referring to. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Mooi River who participated in the debate earlier this afternoon made a few statements which really deserve to be emphasized. I want to congratulate the hon. member on the attitude he adopted. The hon. member referred to the communist danger in South Africa and also to the fact that South Africa is in no way aggressive in its approach to our neighbours to the north of us. I think it is deserving of emphasis that this is a common attitude which is to be found on both sides of the House. I think we owe the hon. member for Mooi River a vote of thanks for stating it here in very clear language. Africa does in fact constitute a threat to South Africa. I particularly want to point out the military aspects of this threat. There is in fact a communist-inspired military threat to us from Africa. I think the reply to that has already been given adequately by President Banda of Malawi when he enumerated what the consequences would be of any venture of that nature against South Africa. There are other threats to South Africa which I do not particularly want to go into but I want to refer to the notorious Carnegie assessment which was made in regard to a possible threat to South Africa. I think that we should once more look for the answer from Mr. McNamara, the Secretary for Defence of the U.S.A., and the Joint Chiefs of Military Staff, people who are realistic and people who realize the implications of steps of the nature of those mentioned in the Carnegie Report. Despite these replies I still think it necessary to state once more from the South African point of view that it must be very clearly understood that we do not deem it advisable for anybody to harbour thoughts of a military venture against South Africa. We are not challenging anybody, we have no aggressive designs on anybody, our only desire is for peace, but in order to maintain peace it is necessary to keep oneself strong, as has been stated on previous occasions by military leaders. It is for that reason also necessary for us in South Africa to consider that aspect.</p>

<p>We realize that our army is perhaps small, and that it may perhaps not be a match for large task forces which want to take action under the auspices of the U.N.O. In spite of the boundless confidence we have in our own military preparedness, we realize that we are not invincible. It is also necessary to say that if the world should ever want to confront South Africa with a military threat, it will have to deal with a far greater unity amongst the peoples of South Africa than they realize. I think there is little difference of opinion in this House; and I think that there is little difference of opinion amongst the other sectors of the population in South Africa, and it is necessary that we say to the world that, with a few exceptions, they would have to deal with the opposition of 18 million people if they were to take any military action against South Africa. The other sectors of our population are also eager to continue with their programme of development, something which they are in fact doing, and that they will proceed to live a good life in South Africa unhindered and unmolested by communist intervention or otherwise. That is why it is necessary for us to say to the world that if they want to attack us in this field they will have to deal with a very much greater feeling of unity within South Africa and will have to deal with a great deal more than may possibly appear on the surface.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize another aspect of South Africa&#x2019;s strength, and pre-eminently its military strength. This is the fact that the strength of South Africa is also an advantage to our neighbours to the north of us. In the first place it is not necessary for our neighbours to the north of us to unite themselves against a military attack via the south. They have here at the southernmost point of Africa a stronghold and a bastion which is a guarantee to our neighbours to the north of us that a military threat to them from this quarter can only arise after the strongest stronghold in South Africa has fallen. Our neighbours to the north of us have a guarantee that South Africa is here to ward off communistic infiltration and interference of a military or other nature; that is why it is possible for our neighbours to the north of us to devote their full attention to their development and their own evolution without ever having to worry about a stab in the back from the south being a threat to them. I think it also holds economic advantages. I think it means that they need never keep an army in readiness to watch the south. I think that they need never throw up defences to the south because they know that here in the south is a country which is protecting their flanks. I think it is particularly important for our neighbours to the north of us to realize that there is a bulwark here which is also going to keep open their line of communication for them. Here in South Africa we maintain an orderly communication system which forms a channel for our neighbours to the north of us through which they may at all times import and export materials, and the South African army is also there as a protection of those communications which are the life arteries of our neighbours to the north of us. The air space in South Africa is open to them for their use. The air space of Southern Africa is guaranteed by the readiness of South Africa to protect that as well, and our trade routes and various other traffic arteries, apart from our harbours and sea-communications, remain available for Africa thanks to the stability we have here and thanks to the protection which we are affording and the guarantee we are offering that it is going to remain available for Africa. I think it is necessary that our neighbours realize that the strength of South Africa is a material and <span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0902"/>political advantage to them in this sphere as well. Politically they benefit in this sense that they are able to proceed with their development in the course which they have adopted in Africa without ever having to fear that a poltically inspired attack may be aimed at them from the south. South Africa, with its acknowledged and accepted policies, is sufficient guarantee that this will never come from the south. The states to the north of us may proceed unhindered in their development without the fear which some of the north African states have of a foreign or even overseas inspired political coup being aimed at them and that political leaders can have a jumping-off place from whence some of them may proceed to these African states. I think it is important for them and I. think that they must realize that they have never had that danger and that threat from South Africa and that our traditional attitude towards these kind of events in South Africa is one of the greatest guarantees to them that they have nothing of that nature to fear from this quarter.</p>

<p>To sum up, we are a small country and we realize it. But we have a desire to survive and to develop in our own way. This desire is not restricted to part of the nation only. That desire to develop unhindered is inherent in the entire population of 18 million people. That is why we say to the friendly states to the north of us: &#x201C;Here is a bastion in the south which is going to protect you as well so that the dangers which threaten others in Africa will not hinder you.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Middelburg will forgive me if I do not react to any great extent to what he said. I have a few other matters which I want to broach with the Minister. Of course I agree to a large extent with what the hon. member said in regard to military threat and defence. However, these are matters which, in my opinion, could be discussed under the Defence Vote.</p>

<p>I should like to ascertain from the hon. the Minister what the reason is for the decrease of almost R20,000 in salaries and administrative costs for South Africa House. Last year there was an increase of R30,000 as far as this item was concerned; this year there is a decrease of approximately R20,000, despite the fact that the number of officials has remained constant. One would have thought that with the increase in the cost of living it would have been difficult to bring about such a decrease. The second matter in regard to which I should like an explanation is item C of the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, the item in regard to Posts, Telegraphs and Telephone Services. As far as telegrams and cables are concerned there is an increase of R9,500, and as far as postage is concerned, approximately R21,000&#x2014;an overall increase, as far as this item is concerned, of almost R31,000. What is the reason for this tremendous increase over the space of one year&#x003F;</p>

<p>I return now to the question of our diplomatic representation abroad. When we glance at the list of representatives we see that in Germany, in addition to an ambassador, we have two consuls general: one in Hamburg and one in M&#x00FC;nchen. It would appear that our representation in Germany is overloaded while there are other countries in which we do not as yet have representation and where we would very much like representation. Can the hon. the Minister explain this&#x003F; In Japan, for example, we only have a consul general at the moment, we do not yet have an ambassador. Does the hon. the Minister not think that it is time we had a full-fledged office in Japan with an ambassador&#x003F; Year after year I have been pleading for the expansion of our diplomatic representation. Does the hon. Minister not think that it is time we penetrated deeper into the Middle East for example&#x003F; Does he not think we ought to let our influence be felt there too, apart from the representation we already have in the Lebanon&#x003F; I am thinking here of Turkey and of a restitution of our diplomatic representation in Israel. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could see his way clear to telling us whether our diplomatic representation with Israel is going to be restituted.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to this improved image which we have created for ourselves with the visit here of the trade mission from Malawi and China, as well as the visit of heads of state of neighbouring states, etc. We who regularly receive publications from abroad, could see what effect this has had. 1$ the Minister prepared to make an announcement at this stage in regard to the possibility of a further expansion of this improved image of South Africa abroad by expanding our diplomatic representation in these neighbouring states of ours which are favourably disposed towards us and whose heads of state we have already received here&#x003F; Of course I do not want to embarrass the hon. the Minister but if he is able to make a statement in this regard we would appreciate it.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by repeating my appeal which I have made on several occasions. As far as diplomatic representation is concerned we are lagging behind many other countries with smaller populations than ours. What possibility is there of there being some expansion of our diplomatic representation abroad in the near future&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to begin by saying a few words in connection with South-West Africa. In the first place I want to say that I appreciate it that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout stressed the points of agreement between the Opposition and us and that this opportunity was not seized upon for having a large-scale debate on South-West Africa. It was not my intention to have such a debate either. Some points have been raised, however, to which I want to reply briefly. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked whether there were any limits to our willingness to invite people to South-West Africa. Of course there are limits. Although we shall welcome visits <span class="col_4575-4576" refersTo="page_0903"/>to this Territory, we have to go about it very judiciously and we may not throw open South-West Africa to any Tom, Dick and Harry. There are certain persons whom we will certainly not allow there. I need not mention any names in this connection. Others, on the other hand, we will in fact admit there. The name of one of them has been mentioned here, namely that of Prime Minister Jonathan. I do not know whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and other hon. members noticed that the first report on what Prime Minister Jonathan was purported to have said in his speech was followed by a subsequent report in which the first report was corrected in certain respects. What it amounts to is that Chief Jonathan said that he did not want to go to the United Nations without having had an opportunity to visit South-West Africa, because he did not want to speak on a matter of which he had no knowledge. Incidentally, he did not have the forthcoming special session of the United Nations in mind. I may say that if Prime Minister Jonathan wants to visit South-West Africa, he will certainly be most welcome there. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also referred to the possibility of visits by certain consular representatives. Some Consuls-general have already intimated that they would like to go there. The opportunity to do so will in fact be created for them. As regards non-Government members, I must point out that we have to have regard to the disposition and the motives of the people who express the wish to go there. These will guide us in deciding whether or not we should admit them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked whether the statement I had made before the United Nations was not perhaps inconsistent with my statement in this House as regards South-West Africa&#x2019;s separate international status, identity or character. I used all three of these words. Well, there is no inconsistency. However, we must have absolute clarity as to what is meant by these words. In the past our adversaries in international politics contended that South-West Africa had an international status, but then they interpreted that concept as including accountability on the part of South Africa to the world and to the United Nations in particular. That, of course, we have consistently denied most emphatically. We deny that South-West Africa has any international status or identity in the sense in which they use these words, and I think the hon. Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interjection referred to this. We have never disputed the fact that, internationally speaking, South-West Africa has a separate identity or character or status, in the sense that South-West Africa is separate from South Africa in international law and has not been incorporated by South Africa. I hope the position is clear to the hon. member. We have frequently stated this attitude. And when we speak of a separate status for South-West Africa in that sense, it is of course by no means anything new.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout advanced the argument that the economic section of the <i>South-West Africa Survey</i> was inconsistent with the political section. As he put it, it is envisaged in the political section that even small territories in South-West Africa could become independent, whereas the economic section emphasizes that if South-West Africa as a whole became independent, it would cause the economic collapse of the entire territory. In connection with this last point he also cited my speech before the U.N. The reply is that the hon. member&#x2019;s conception of this matter is not entirely correct, particularly as regards the economic section, which was referred to both in the <i>Survey</i> and in my speech before the U.N. It was not suggested that South-West Africa&#x2019;s economy would collapse purely as a result of political independence, but in fact if political independence came about in such a way that the economic ties and co-operation with the Republic were terminated, for example through such independence being forced upon South-West Africa from the outside by a state or states which are hostile to South Africa or which are not prepared to co-operate with us. I think the hon. members will agree that these are two different matters altogether. When we speak of political possibilities for the future in terms of this Government&#x2019;s policy, the accent falls on the right of self-determination of nations. We neither can nor will deny any nation the right to choose political independence, but there are two very important additional points in this regard. The first is that independence is only one choice which a nation would be able to make, and I think the hon. the Prime Minister also emphasized this on his Vote. It could voluntarily choose some or other form of association with another nation or nations. Our policy for South-West Africa leaves that possibility open to each such nation. We do not want to enforce a sort of child marriage beforehand by which such a nation will be bound when it comes of age. Secondly, our policy presupposes that the political independence of national units, even if they are small, will come about in an atmosphere of goodwill, precisely because the threat of domination is eliminated, and that close economic cooperation on a voluntary basis with neighbouring states and with South Africa herself will be able to continue. If this can develop in our relations with Lesotho and Botswana, why can it not be retained in the case of Ovamboland, Damaraland, etc.&#x003F; In 1964 the late Dr. Verwoerd said in this House, in the very context of South-West Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that political independence and economic independence need not go hand in hand in the case of smaller entities, but that the politically independent area will be able to lean for assistance on a larger economic neighbouring community, of which it will be able to form an economic part.</block>

<p><span class="col_4577-4578" refersTo="page_0904"/>That is and remains our policy, and there is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) asked what possibility there was of exchanging diplomatic representation in the case of Japan and the Middle East. I may tell the hon. member that this is unfortunately&#x2014;I do not hold it against him that he raised it&#x2014;not the kind of thing one discusses across the floor of the House. There are many factors involved. I may give him the assurance that we are continually keeping a very close watch on the position in all fields. The hon. member also referred to the fact that in a country such as Germany we have two Consulates-General in addition to our Embassy. I may give the hon. member the assurance that this is by no means a case of Germany, the West German Republic, being over-stocked with representatives from South Africa, but the fact of the matter is that for various reasons we have too little representation in some other important countries. In the case of the U.S.A., for example, we have an embassy with three Consulates-General, and there are also possibilities for further expansion. But there, too, various factors have to be taken into consideration constantly, such as the question of finance, staff, etc. I do not think there are any substantial grounds for suggesting that we are over-represented in West Germany, which after all, if I am not mistaken, is the second largest international trade country in the world. But if the hon. member tells me that we are not adequately represented in some countries, then I must agree with him.</p>

<p>As regards further representation in Africa, I do not want to say anything further about that to-day. I have already made a statement in that regard, and the hon. the Prime Minister also referred to it recently. I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further in that regard at this stage. A question was asked. 7, think also by the hon. member for East London (City), in connection with expenditure involved in taking over South Africa House. He referred to sub-head A. The decrease here is attributable mainly to an overestimate of the funds required to cover the increases in the salaries of locally recruited staff. The hon. member will be aware that we have a large number of locally recruited staff at all our missions, and those persons salaries and cost of living allowances fluctuate continually, with the result that continual adjustments have to be made. But then he also said that against this should be offset normal annual scale increments, which results in a net decrease of R19,000. With regard to paragraph 3 (1). the increase is attributable to the fact that provision is now being made, with Treasury approval, for the telegraph and telephone services of all the departments accommodated in South Africa House, and also to an increase in the cost of telephone services and in postal rates.</p>

<p>In a good speech the hon. member for Middelburg rightly pointed out the importance to South Africa&#x2019;s position abroad of our unanimity here as a population, of our determination to maintain our position, and particularly also of our preparedness for any eventualities, because in addition to our economic strength these factors are amongst our most powerful weapons. The hon. members for Gordonia and Rustenburg made fine speeches on our Africa policy. Those speeches, like most others, provide testimony of study and knowledge. The question of diplomatic representation was also raised by the hon. member for Gordonia. I may give him the assurance that, as the hon. the Prime Minister also said during the discussion on his Vote, South Africa&#x2019;s interests, practical considerations and the cost will be the decisive factors when decisions have to be taken in regard to the opening of diplomatic missions in the case of our neighbours in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>As he did last year, the hon. member for Mooi River made a constructive contribution, which is appreciated, apart from his political dig at the beginning, of which we need not take any notice. He asked what we were doing to promote joint action against Communism in Southern Africa, and also in Africa and in the Southern Hemisphere. I may give him the assurance that we are doing everything in our power and that we are operating in many fields. Some of these operations are of such a nature that I would rather not discuss them at this stage. But I may remind him of the fact that we are trying to help our neighbours in Southern Africa to be economically stable. It is in our interests, too, that they should enjoy political stability. We try to assist them in the technical field, as regards social matters and in many other fields, and that stability acts as a counter to Communism. We also go out of our way to make our neighbours feel that they are safe here in that we pose no threat to them, and that they need fear no imperialism or colonialism on our part. In addition we see to it that no undermining activities against our neighbouring states are conducted from South Africa. We simply do not tolerate that, and in most cases we also succeed in co-operating with our neighbours in such a way that they do not allow such activities against South Africa either. We also discuss the threat of Communism and the methods employed by the communists. Our Prime Minister discusses these matters when he holds consultations with, for example, the Prime Minister of Lesotho. I do so when I hold consultations with colleagues. In this connection 7 may inform this hon. House that I hope to have a routine consultation shortly with Chief Jonathan in his capacity as Foreign Minister of Lesotho. These matters are also discussed by our officials, who consult one another constantly. Our neighbours in Southern Africa are accepting to an increasing extent that we entertain no sinister ulterior motives or aspirations at their expense.</p>

<p>One of the hon. members on this side of the House quoted from the speech by Dr. Banda. Here before me I have a Hansard report of the Malawi Parliament, which contains a report delivered by the three Ministers who took part in the mission to South Africa, <span class="col_4579-4580" refersTo="page_0905"/>and I wish hon. members could read this report. It contains absolutely no discordant notes. It testifies of enthusiasm and confidence as far as the future is concerned. I just want to quote what was said <i>inter alia</i> by Minister Aleke Banda&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of course, when we spoke to them about assisting Malawi in various fields, they emphasized to us that this help would be given free of all strings.</block>

<p>Please note that he said this in the Malawi Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be offered in such a way that we would never regret receiving it at any time. This is appreciated, Mr. Speaker, because we know that sometimes, as our own President has told us many times, people give help for the purpose of turning you either into a kind of banana republic or a republic of one sort or the other. But there was no question of that. They were generally willing to cooperate with us on an equal basis in the various fields in which we might seek assistance. Of course, as would be expected, and as is normal whenever they had the opportunity, they explained their policy of apartheid and how it works. We hold them that they could not expect us to agree with the policy of apartheid. But the fact that we disagree with their policy was no reason why we should boycott them and have no trade or other economic co-operation.</block>

<p>At this stage, according to the Hansard report, there was applause in the Parliament of Malawi.</p>

<p>As he did last year, the hon. member for Mooi River spoke about the possibility of concluding treaties with our neighbours. We should not act precipitately as far as that is concerned. We should also guard against the impression being created that we may perhaps be engaged, as is sometimes alleged about South Africa, in forming a military bloc here in South Africa, which is untrue, of course. We have to go slowly and carefully, but I may assure hon. members that we are most certainly consolidating and expanding these good relations with our neighbours as far as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with the tribute paid to the late Dr. Bruwer by the hon. member for Algoa. I should like to endorse what he said. It was a very great loss to South Africa that we should lose such a gifted and able person at an early stage of his life, someone who had indeed contributed a great deal towards consolidating the traditional friendship between South Africa and the people of Malawi. We would have been able to make very good use of him in our operations in Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville made a good speech. He suggested that we should call upon the West to make a revaluation of Africa, with the emphasis on the economic side of things. But that is in fact what is happening. The hon. member said that the world could come to us for advice. I would rather put it this way: We who know Africa and the problems of Africa are prepared to cooperate with other states in respect of Africa when they adopt a realistic approach to Africa. And there are many indications that that is happening. The accent is being placed more and more on recognizing the importance of economic development, the importance of old traditions and customs, of ethnic grouping, etc. It is alleged that the Russians appreciate that the failure of the policy of the Western powers in Africa is due largely to the fact that they took no note of the ethnic differences in Africa. The new approach, as it was recently put to me in a report in connection with aid to Africa, is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aid should be aimed at basic economic development rather than purchasing political allegiance. Anti-communism cannot be bought with money.</block>

<p>That is the kind of attitude we welcome, and with governments which adopt that attitude we shall gladly co-operate in helping to uplift Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to become involved in an argument with the hon. member for Pinelands on the &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D; idea. We all know that there are exceptions in this regard. We know &#x2014;and we have often discussed the matter in this House&#x2014;that there are certain minority population groups, but I am not going to argue with him about that in this debate. The hon. member asked in what spirit we approached our relations with the United States. In this regard I want to refer the hon. member for Pinelands to a statement I made in this House last year during the discussion on my Vote, when I pointed out that there were certain important, unfortunate points of friction between the United States and us. It is no use denying that; it is simply a fact. But I said that we were trying to avoid those points of friction and that we were concentrating on the large number of points of agreement, the many fields in which we had common interests. I do not think it can serve any good purpose whatsoever to rake up old sores today, as the hon. member sought to do by harking back to the <i>Independence</i> incident, to tracking stations, to embassy staff, etc. I have since had personal talks with Mr. Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State; with his assistant, Mr. Palmer, who succeeded Mr. Williams and who is in charge of the Africa Division of their Department of State; and I have also had personal talks with Mr. Goldberg. I also want to tell the hon. member that we continually have talks with members of the local American Embassy and with members of the Department of State in America, just as we have in the case of all other countries with whom we have diplomatic relations. We discuss our problems and we consider these problems together. We fully appreciate the importance of our relations <span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0906"/>with the U.S.A., but we must always bear in mind that we are a sovereign state. The U.S.A. knows exactly where we stand. They know exactly where we stand in respect of Communism. They know what our attitude is with regard to Vietnam; they know what our policy is with regard to Africa; they have concrete proof of that. They also know very well what strong feelings we have on the principle of non-interference by one state in the domestic affairs of another state. They also know our feelings on South-West Africa and other burning problems, and I hope that they respect our attitude just as we respect their attitude. And I have no doubt that this will happen to an increasing extent, because we are providing more and more concrete proof of our ability to solve our difficult problems here in Southern Africa through the course we have adopted and have followed consistently. I am convinced that we shall enjoy much less respect abroad if we dance to someone else&#x2019;s tune instead of acting in accordance with our own convictions.</p>

<p>I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member for East London (City) about the use of words. I accept his good intentions when he prefers the word &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D; to &#x201C;different national groups&#x201D; or &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D;. I may perhaps be able to make out an even stronger case against the use of his expression &#x201C;multiracial&#x201D;, because in this post-war world in which we are living the word &#x201C;race&#x201D; is even much more taboo than the word &#x201C;nation&#x201D; or &#x201C;people&#x201D;. In this respect I just want to say that the Government cannot change the facts as they exist. The fact of the matter is simply that there are different nations in the Republic and also in South-West Africa. Would the hon. member for East London (City) suggest, for example in the case of South-West Africa, that the traditionally hostile groups, the Nama and the Herero, be thrown together by an authority and against their will&#x003F; Each one of them need not be a separate state. If of their own accord they reach the stage where they want to become friends and where they want to co-exist in peace, then it is a different matter, of course, and something we shall all welcome.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton referred to the possibility of greater assistance to and co-operation with the rest of Africa. The hon. member is usually extremely well-prepared but in this particular case I do not think she did her homework well, because if she had even read the newspapers she would have realized that that is exactly what we have been striving to do for a long time and that we are at the moment achieving a great deal of success in this very field. At the same time, when the hon. member advocates greater assistance, I can refer her to the quotation which I have just read out, namely, that anti-Communism cannot be bought.</p>

<p>The hon. member realizes that and agrees with me.</p>

<p>Then I just want to say this in connection with the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. She referred to the importance of racial matters. I believe &#x2014;and many share my view&#x2014;that the tragedy of the world to-day is the world&#x2019;s obsession with race and with colour. And I think that unfortunately that is also the case with the hon. member and her party. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Middelland made a good and most constructive speech in which he pointed out, among other things, that the real points of danger in the world are in actual fact the questions of food, education and all those things which are in such short supply in Africa, and with which we are able to assist to a very large extent. The speech made by the hon. member for Randfontein was also along these lines and also testified of thorough study and sound knowledge.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to certain items on the Estimates. It is true that there has been a considerable increase in the amount requested for technical assistance &#x2014;it amounts to R&#x2153; million. This amount is an indication of how much more we are now doing in this particular field, and I think all hon. members welcome it, because both sides of this House have in the past pleaded that we should do more in this particular field.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked a question about the payment to legal and other experts. These funds are intended to be used in connection with the preparation of documents which my Department will send to governments and international organizations, as announced by the hon. the Prime Minister and also by myself. It is sometimes necessary for us to make use of experts who have</p>

<p>specialized, expert knowledge of this kind of work, and we need this money to do so.</p>

<p>Some comment was made on the item &#x201C;Secret Services&#x201D;. The object of the Bill</p>

<p>which has been passed by this House was in fact to replace that term&#x2014;it provides for another designation for this item, which will be known in future as the &#x201C;Special Account for Foreign Affairs&#x201D;. This designation will therefore fall away. We did not like it, nor did the hon. member for Constantia like it at the time. That designation will now fall away&#x2014;it is also quite misleading.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked what progress was being made in Africa. I do not want to elaborate on that in detail; time does not permit me to do so, nor do I think this is the proper occasion. I lifted the curtain to some extent earlier in this Session. All I can say is that we are faced with a great challenge. There is an enormous amount of work to be done. My department is being over-taxed. We also make frequent use of other Departments, from which we receive enthusiastic assistance and support, at both ministerial and official level. I believe that the events of the past few months with regard to our ralations with our immediate neighbouring states and also with Malawi will produce good results. In fact, I have cause for saying <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0907"/>that they are already producing good results. For obvious reasons I do not want to go into details, but I feel so optimistic about the matter that I believe that these events may lead to greater realism in Africa and that the present period may usher in a new era of peace and prosperity and co-operation for Southern Africa.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Bezuidenhout for his appreciative attitude in connection with the appointment of an ambassador in one of our key posts. I do not wish to say anything further about mixed receptions on this occasion, but I just want to point out that a distinction must be drawn between mixed receptions in the ordinary sense of the word and receptions at which representatives of foreign governments or diplomats themselves who are non-Whites are received. We must draw a very clear distinction between an ordinary mixed reception attended by South Africans and others in South Africa and functions at which government representatives or diplomatic representatives of non-white nations and governments are received in South Africa. I hope that distinction is clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what the position was as regards Botswana. It is not for me to say that this or that neighbouring state is the most important to us, but we consider our relations with Botswana to be of great importance. As regards reciprocal visits by Prime Ministers, these are matters which are not discussed in a Parliament either&#x2014;not before they have been arranged. But what I do want to say here is that we maintain constant relations with Botswana, that good work is being done, and that a member of our Cabinet will shortly pay an official visit to Botswana for a specific purpose, namely my colleague Minister Jim Fouch&#x00E9;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the so-called dissatisfaction among Chinese in Johannesburg. I have no knowledge of that. All I can say is that we have very sound friendly relations with Nationalist China. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan has visited South Africa twice recently. He was here in transit, and on each occasion he paid me a personal visit. Recently a trade mission from Taiwan paid a particularly successful visit to South Africa. Our relations are therefore good. In fact, we have recently also opened a consulate-general in Taipeh. I do not think there is any cause for concern over our relations with China.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to congratulate all hon. members who have taken part in this debate on the high standard they maintained throughout, and on the valuable contributions made by all of them without exception, and I want to give them the assurance that this is most encouraging to me and to my Department, particularly in these times in which we are all hard pressed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>It is impossible, in the time available, for us to cover all the aspects of this Vote. Consequently, we are going to try to confine ourselves to those aspects on which we feel the Minister should give us a statement of policy or where he should do something in regard to other aspects where his Department is not fulfilling its purpose. I will confine myself to only two issues, issues the hon. the Minister should attend to. The first of these is that evidence is available which leads us to believe that the housing programme will have to be considerably cut. To make my point in this respect perfectly clear I should like to read one quotation only seeing that I do not have time to read more. This news item relates to proposed cuts in the housing programme of the Durban City Council. The City Engineer has reported to the Durban City Council that there has been a further reduction in the available housing funds in spite of the fact that there is a serious shortage of housing for all race groups in Durban. Nevertheless, the Government has so limited the use of State housing funds that the City Engineer&#x2019;s department was restricted to completing council houses, only where such housing had already been begun. He also reported that it was unlikely that there would be any change in this respect during the coming financial year and that, consequently, it would not be possible to get on with any new council housing schemes. He also reported that but for the restrictions on Government housing funds his organization could have undertaken the following work: (1) the completion of all services needed at Chatsworth; (2) the provision of additional housing for Coloured people at Sparks Estate; (3) and a start on the Newlands-Phoenix Indian housing project and the European housing scheme at Hillary. This and other evidence leads us to believe that despite the fantastic demand there is for housing at the present moment there is going to be a cut in the rate at which housing is going to be provided. So I should like the Minister to give us a picture of what he visualizes is going to happen in future, particularly during this year. If there is to be a cut in housing programmes it is important that he reviews the rate at which he is going to implement group areas. The Government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand they cannot implement a policy of shifting groups who are to a certain extent housed at the moment, if not satisfactorily then at least they are housed. While we too want to see them moved to better housing conditions it seems foolish, to me. to push on with this programme at a rate which South Africa, in terms of housing, cannot afford at the moment. I think the time has come for the hon. the Minister to give us a statement relating the Government&#x2019;s ability to provide houses to the rate at which it is implementing its group areas policy. I think we have to have this indication so that we may get a picture of <span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0908"/>what the relationship between these two aspects is. I believe somewhere in the picture there is an imbalance. At times the implementation of group areas has been pushed harder than the country&#x2019;s building capacity can afford. This is to a large extent responsible for the shortage of houses for the natural increase in our population as well as for the new immigrants which this Government is bringing in. I think we have got to review the situation and review it very shortly and very thoroughly.</p>

<p>The second item relates to the housing which is in fact being provided. I think the time has come when we should have a thorough independent investigation into the manner in which housing is being provided. Let me give the hon. the Minister one or two illustrations of what I mean. I have here a cutting from a Cape Town newspaper in which it is said that the Minister was told by Senator Klopper, a member of his own party, of the troubles and complaints in respect of housing in Durban. The main part of the complaint is that about 70 houses were built at Yellowwood Park by tender for the department and that it appears from what Senator Klopper has been told that the contractors were &#x201C;in a bit of a hurry&#x201D;. This is the nice genteel way in which he puts it. When he met the residents in Durban less than two weeks ago&#x2014;this cutting dates from March &#x2014;all the complaints were about workmanship, such as leaking roofs, inferior materials, lifting floor tiles, lack of retaining walls and of proper drainage. These then are the complaints Senator Klopper spoke about to his Minister. But I have just had a complaint investigated near Pretoria, in a place called Tileba. A man wrote to us and I got someone to go and investigate. I cannot read all of the report but will make it available to the Minister. I can make extracts of it available to him. What happened here was that a man earning a salary from a Government department bought a house which was built by the Department of Community Development and sold to him. The trouble is that this department is selling these houses to people &#x201C;voetstoots&#x201D;, with &#x2018;he result that all the woes and troubles that come to light afterwards are the responsibilities of the person who bought the house. Now, the cost of living survey carried out by the Bureau of Statistics shows that the average family is living to the limit of its income and that lower income group families are spending more than they earn. In this case I think the family concerned just falls within this group. And yet this family is now being faced with the problem of cracking walls because the foundation was not sound enough&#x2014;I believe a six inch foundation was constructed on soil which has a clay underlay. Investigations were not made before these houses were constructed. It is only a very small scheme and yet at least 12 houses have developed cracked walls, which are getting worse and worse. The approach of the department to the problems of these people is not a good one&#x2014;to say the least. The department is only passing the buck back to these people who cannot afford the repairs. This man of whom I am speaking has been told that he will be allowed R340 off his bond at the end, but where is he going to find this amount of money now to do these repairs&#x003F; He does not have it. This is what is happening to these people. They believed in all good faith that they were setting themselves up for life by buying a house. For them it is a means of saving in these hard times. But, to put it mildly, they found that they have been sold a pup. I accept that it is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention to do that but I say I want an investigation into all these aspects. I have evidence which shows that certain builders are being looked upon very favourably in certain areas. In the Bluff, for instance, an area which I know well, the bulk of the houses were built by Hollander immigrants who built houses for the population of that area at very reasonable prices. These builders have now left and the few builders who are favoured by the Minister&#x2019;s department are undertaking the bulk of the building to-day and are waxing rich on it. The builder who built the house of this man in Pretoria, and other houses that are cracking and very badly constructed&#x2014;I had the case investigated and I know what I am talking about&#x2014;has been awarded another contract and it is fair to assume that these houses will be built in exactly the same manner as the others.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Jerry built.&#x201D; That is the term. Sir. Materials are not up to standard and people when they think they have made an investment for life find that what they have done was to buy a lot of trouble. So I think the time has come for this to be investigated. The provision of housing, the clearance of slums and the implementation of group areas are next to Defence commanding more of the national income than any other aspect of this Government&#x2019;s operations at the present moment. And I say funds are being used in a haphazard manner. When one sees the results of what is being done then one is convinced of this. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat put a few direct questions to the hon. the Minister and I shall leave it at that. What surprises me a little, however, is that the hon. member is to-day still talking about the implementation of the Group Areas Act. After so many years, and after the Western world has been putting the concept and the ideal of community development into practice for so long, and after all the years during which the United Party tried to govern this country, and also after the National Government has been applying community development so successfully here, the hon. member for Umlazi still talks about the &#x201C;implementation of group areas&#x201D;, and then draws a distinction between the Slums Act and the other Acts. He has never heard of the fundamental concept, the great ideal of community development. [Interjection.] That hon. member is so far off <span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0909"/>course that he does not know what his hon. colleague there told him either.</p>

<p>It is quite clear to me why the hon. member is so confused. If one were to go back and consider the pathetic record of that party while they were in power, then one can understand that there are certain basic principles as far as housing is concerned which they have never quite grasped. I do not want to rake up the past here this afternoon, but one could perhaps try, merely in order to set the record straight in places, to remind them a little of what things were like when they were governing this country. When I say that then I am doing so out of gratitude to this hon. Minister of ours and to this Government which has achieved such fine things, particularly in our urban areas, in regard to supplying decent housing for our people. To mention just one example: In the city where I come from there were for example 600 Asiatic families, 4,000 Coloured families and an incalculable welter of Bantu families living and residing together and the Whites in Satanic wretchedness.</p>

<p>If a rope were placed round the neck of that hon. member and he were taken overseas he would be a good representation abroad of a South African baboon.</p>

<p>Before that hon. member interrupted me I was telling you what the position in one of our coastal cities had been. But the Government stepped in and to-day order has been established out of this major chaos. But first our Government, to be able to apply actual community development in its broader sense, had to lay down certain guiding lines, certain foundations. That is why in the years during which we governed the following appeared: Important amendments to the Slums Act, the Government Villages Act, the Group Areas Development Act, the Rents Act, the important Housing Act, the Group Areas Act itself, and ultimately the Community Development Act. These steps were necessary to enable the strong arms of community development, i.e. the National Housing Commission, the Development Council and the Bantu Housing Council, to function properly. In other words, this task was tackled systematically, because hon. members on the opposite side will recall the conditions which we inherited. When they were governing last they had a council called the Social and Economic Plans Council. In 1944 this Council established that in 1943, while they were governing, there had been a shortage of 60,000 white houses in this country. In that same year they estimated that in 1948 there would be a shortage of 70,000 houses for Whites. That was the state of affairs we inherited. To deal with that situation certain guiding lines and foundations had to be laid down, otherwise it would never have been possible for us to establish order out of that chaos. It is obvious therefore that with the re-organization of our Department of Community Development in 1964 our deceased Prime Minister was able at that time to say that it would be the ideal of that Department to see to it that all groups were properly settled and accommodated in order to allow them to develop into healthy communities. If one takes that as background then one can understand why this Government has such a particularly fine record as far as housing in South Africa is concerned. For example I should just like to quote a few figures. From 1948 to 1966 the National Housing Commission alone built 43,305 houses at a cost of R178 million. Subsequently, and over the same period, the Departments of Public Works, Railways and Forestry built 30,178 houses at a cost of R172 million. If one were to add to that all the houses which the Department has built in conjunction with the building societies in terms of the guarantee scheme and the Railways under their scheme, one finds that the overall total of almost 120,000 houses has been built at a cost of R460 million. In addition to that we have also spent a further R216 million on non-white housing in South Africa.</p>

<p>On a certain occasion the hon. member for Durban (Point) succeeded in taking off the political mask of the United Party and he then &#x2014;I think it was a kind of despairing cry&#x2014;said in this House: &#x201C;I think that we (and then he referred to the United Party Government) when we were in power did not meet our responsibilities in full either&#x201D;. I can understand that cry of fear. I think that what the hon. member meant at that time but did not say in so many words was that they were sorry that in the many years during which they had governed they did not fulfil their duties in the field of housing. I want to take this idea further. It is such a pity that one had to inherit this bankrupt estate and had to build on it. It made the task so much more difficult, particularly if we take into consideration the fact that there is a world shortage of housing today. There is a world-wide trend and this trend is being given momentum in South Africa on account of the special conditions prevailing in South Africa. This world-wide trend is acknowledged by all the major writers in the field of housing. For example, I have here a book by Charles Abrahams. He is the chief consultant of America as far as housing is concerned. He is chief adviser to the United Nations as far as housing is concerned. In this connection he states, <i>inter alia,</i> that in Calcutta to-day there are still 600,000 people sleeping in the streets at night and that in 1904 there were 1,700 people sleeping in the streets of London, but that this position had improved to such an extent that in 1963 there were only 129 people who had to sleep outside on a cold winter&#x2019;s night. I have here another authoritative work on housing. Mr. P. Jamine of Pretoria, writes <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of extraordinary technical, medical and other progress during this century, housing still remains one of the most important of the domestic problems, confronting many nations in the world to-day.</block>

<p><span class="col_4589-4590" refersTo="page_0910"/>We admit that we are having to deal with a housing shortage in this country, but we are also prepared to accept the challenge, and under the guidance of our hon. Minister we have made the necessary adjustments to be able to cope with this problem. I believe that in the years which lie ahead, with the adjustments which we have made, we will achieve our goal. As you know we have in the first place introduced building control and the acknowledged authority, Mr. T. T. Woodhead, the president of the Association of South African Building Societies, is very hopeful. He states: &#x201C;Control over the construction of large buildings which was introduced by the Government in 1964 will help to channel labour and material in this direction.&#x201D; We know that the Railways have increased the officials&#x2019; loans to railway officials from R8,000 to R9,000 per person. We are also aware of the adjustments which have been made in recent legislation and I believe that the major injunction of our late Prime Minister when he put it emphatically to the nation that it should at all times be our ideal to see to it that all our people are properly accommodated, and provided with housing, that this great and unforgettable injunction to the nation of South Africa will be carried out to the letter of the law under the guidance of this National Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down still seems to be living in the years 1944 to 1948. We are concerned with the year 1967. In case that hon. member may not know it, I think he was old enough to have been fighting for his country in 1943 if he had wanted, but he certainly was old enough to know that there was a war on and to know that there were no building materials available and that the building effort of the country was directed towards the national war effort of the time. Notwithstanding that, that member made a hullabaloo of the fact that a survey had disclosed a shortage of 70,000 houses in 1948.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. After these 19 years of Nat rule, in Durban alone there is a shortage now of 70,000 houses. There is a total of 70,000 houses required for all races in one town. In Durban alone there are approximately 3,400 white people waiting for houses. There are 1,500 European families waiting for city council houses alone. Throughout the country the figure now under this so-called wonderful Government is as bad or worse as that exaggerated figure which the hon. member quoted just now. But I do not have the time to waste on 1948; I want to deal with 1967. I want to say that if all the words that were spoken about housing were bricks, then we would have a few houses for people to live in. That member and the Government seem to think it is more important to shift people around than to get on with building the houses for them to live in. That hon. member said so. He said that you first had to set the pattern &#x2014;that you first had to have group areas and shift and juggle people around. There are people who have not got roofs over their heads, who are living in rooms in backyards and who need houses. We believe that the first priority is to provide the houses for these people&#x2014;not to talk about them but to provide them, first put the roofs over the people&#x2019;s heads and then get on with pretty ideological patterns.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has made an analysis of the effect of the freezing of rent control on the provision of housing by private enterprise, particularly in the field of flats since the extension last year. We warned the Minister at the time that this was a temporary emergency measure and that as such we could accept it. The Minister himself made provision for withdrawing that measure at the earliest possible opportunity. Needless to say, like any measure, there is no sign of withdrawal but the position is getting worse. According to the information and the statistics, and I do not have the time to go into masses of figures now, there are less plans being approved now than there were a year ago.</p>

<p>They were plans which were already approved when rent control was extended. If the Minister denies it, let him get up and say it is untrue that the extension of rent control has inhibited private residential building. I would be glad to know that that is wrong because I am concerned about the position. I feel that it is something which has to be looked at very carefully. I am also concerned with one or two detailed aspects. One is the position of the family who qualify for sub-economic housing, which they get at subsidized rates based on a nominal interest rate. When those people move up above the means test level, and before they reach the top of the means test level, that is to say persons moving above the new level of R100 per month, they immediately lose the right to sub-economic housing.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The gap between sub-economic and economic is such that I have had the complaint that people who were getting sub-economic housing were, by receiving an increase of RIO a month, and having to pay the economic interest rate on housing, in fact losing money. Their increase in fact is a loss because of the increase in rent which they have to pay. As I have said, this has been reported to me. The figures I was given were that a RIO rise in earnings can lead to an R18 per month increase in rental. As I have said, I do not stand by this figure. I think it seems high, but it was given to me. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister what he does for the people in between those two brackets, namely the sub-economic and the economic.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the position of housing in Durban, and particularly with flats provided by the Department. We heard from the hon. member for Umlazi of the jerry-built buildings which were falling down. I asked the Minister what flats had been completed in Durban. He told me that two blocks of flats and one maisonette had been completed last year. In regard to the one block of flats, completed for occupation last year and comprising 26 flats, only two flats were occupied at the end of March. The rental was R75 and a decrease is now under consideration, but the Minister has not said anything about that building subsiding and about there being cracks in it. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the architectural design of the flats which he has just had completed in Durban has been unsatisfactory. I do not want to point to individual appointments and contracts, but there seems to be something very funny about the architectural contract for these blocks of flats, because alongside these buildings private enterprise flats are being let at a cheaper rental than that at which the Government is able to let their flats. My information from architectural circles is that it is because there has not been the proper planning and designing in the architecture both regarding economy and stability. But what do we have&#x003F; We have flats provided for the lower income group, and the Minister started them off at R87 per month. Now he has had to reduce them to R72 per month and R70 per month in order to get tenants. Only after this reduction are they now starting to get tenants into these flats. One has 26 out of the 36 occupied, since the reduction in rentals. The other block started off at R87 as well, but now it is R75 and the Minister is talking of reducing it again, but the block is still empty. Sir, R87 a month, or even R75, is not the sort of rental that the lower income groups can afford to pay. That is not meeting the problem we have, the problem of housing the persons who cannot afford to pay these rentals. They can get it cheaper from private enterprise. Next door to one of the Government blocks is a newly completed block, completed within the last year. Compared to the Government building, it has balconies, better facilities and larger rooms, and yet the rentals are R72 against the R75 which the Government is charging for inferior flats, according to my information. If private enterprise can do that, surely the Government can do better when it comes to providing accommodation for the lower income groups. There must be something wrong if the flats are empty. According to the figures, as late as February this year there were 1,500 people in that income group looking for flats and houses in Durban. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>As usual, the noise made to-day by the hon. member for Durban (Point) was much bigger than he himself. We know that old story of his, all that shouting about the housing shortage. The Minister and we on this side are quite aware of the fact that there is a shortage, but we are also aware of the fact that it is as a result of certain circumstances that there is such a shortage. We know that there has been a tremendous development in South Africa and that there is a great influx of immigrants and also a flow of the rural population to the cities. We are aware of the fact that a population explosion is taking place in the country, and it is estimated that in 30 years&#x2019; time our population will have doubled itself, and we also know that in future we shall have problems as far as housing is concerned. All these things have caused and aggravated the situation. We also know, as the hon. member said, that the increase in the price of building materials has had the result that schemes are getting further and further out of reach of more and more people, but despite all these circumstances we are aware of the fact that the Government is making more and more money available for housing, so much money that some years ago the municipalities were afraid of using it because they were afraid that they would then have houses standing empty, and Durban was one of those. The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to the leeway in 1948 and to the present one, but there was a time when Durban itself would not use the money. Why does the hon. member not tell the House about that&#x003F;</p>

<p>But I want to come back more specifically to the local conditions in Johannesburg and also in my constituency. I just want to mention that Johannesburg&#x2019;s City Council is also one of the great culprits. Although the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) made such a fuss about housing in Johannesburg the other day, he said that he was proud of being <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0912"/>a member of the City Council of Johannesburg. I am also proud to have been a member of that Council, but my pride derives from the fact that I was a representative of the opposition party in the City Council. The other day the hon. member made a fuss about housing for Bantu, but Johannesburg is one of the worst stick-in-the-muds as far as housing for all groups is concerned. I admit that Bantu housing in Johannesburg is at present among the best in the country, but it was the National Party Government which had to take the Johannesburg City Council by the ear and lead it and show it how to get down to that housing. But to-day they are proud of that. But what about the Coloured population in Johannesburg&#x003F; Is the City Council proud of that housing&#x003F; And what about the Indian population&#x003F; Are they proud of the housing for those people&#x003F; No, they hamper the Government time and again. It is quite clear to me that the Government has done its proper share, and much more, as far as housing is concerned.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with another aspect as regards Johannesburg. There we have the Vrededorp-Page View renewal scheme, and the city renewal and slum clearance involved in it. It is actually a new trend in South Africa, something which is actually still at the planning stage. In my constituency in Vrededorp and in the Page View complex we have one of the first to be developed. According to my information the first few blocks of flats with some maisonettes will be erected in Vrededorp in the near future, which will actually serve to test its reception by the public. I also understand that as far as Park View is concerned, which has the largest Indian community in Johannesburg, the residential removal to Lenasia and also the business removal to Fordsburg will be completed within two years. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will correct me if my assumption is wrong, in order that the inhabitants of Vrededorp and Mayfair may know what the position is.</p>

<p>Then we are experiencing another problem in Mayfair and in Von Brandis, and that is the problem of the illegal Chinese who are living in that constituency. [Interjections.] I do not want to say very much about the Chinese, but I must use this opportunity to thank the hon. member for Von Brandis for the convincing and fervent plea he made in this House last year in connection with the Chinese. It is encouraging to anyone on this side of the House to come across a United Party Member of Parliament who makes such a plea to promote the policy of the National Party in respect of group areas and separate development. I may tell the hon. member for Von Brandis, if he does not know this, that in his and in my constituencies, which adjoin each other, there are many United Party people who contact me every now and then to inquire and to try to help in the progress of that local development of group areas. They are people who accept that National Party policy and who also endeavour to make it succeed. I think it will be news to the hon. member that United Party people have approached me and have said: &#x201C;We should also like to help; we should also like to pull our weight in order that the development of separate group areas may be expedited, but we are not Nationalists and we cannot approach the National Party openly; can we not join your people in establishing a rate-payers&#x2019; association in order that we may also Have a say in the clearance of conditions in Park View, particularly as far as the Chinese are concerned, and in order that we may also help to have the policy implemented so that we may get rid of those people in our locality&#x003F;&#x201D; Finally I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to use all his influence, when the group area for the Chinese is declared&#x2014;and I assume that will happen in the near future&#x2014;to see to it that the removal of the Chinese is carried out. I ask that not only on behalf of the white community. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to confine myself to the question of the housing of the Coloureds. I would like to say at once that we know that the Government is doing its best in regard to the provision of housing for the Coloureds. Whether the Government has done all it could is not material. I am prepared to concede that a very sincere attempt is being made to deal with this most important question of housing. In providing housing for Coloureds, the Government must of necessity, of course, also provide housing for the poorer Coloured people by way&#x00B7; of what is known as sub-economic housing schemes. Sub-economic housing schemes, in my humble opinion, are all right as a first step in getting those people away from the bushes, and I concede that in many cases they are housed under very much better conditions than the conditions to which they were accustomed. I think the trouble in this country is that sub-economic housing has been overdone inasmuch as it has become the rule and not the exception. It is not the fault of this Government only; this is something which started years ago, but my plea to the Minister to-day is that the Government should gradually switch from sub-economic housing schemes to home-ownership schemes. I have pleaded for this before and I want to stress that home-ownership schemes would be welcomed by the Coloureds, because if there is one thing of which the Coloured man is very proud it is his home. He would like to have his own home. Unfortunately cases arise where people have to be moved under the Group Areas Act from homes which they regard as far superior to the new homes to which they are moved. It is no improvement as far as they are concerned. My plea to-day is that in conjunction with sub-economic housing schemes the Government should also build economic housing schemes. There will then be a gradual transition from the sub-economic level to the home-ownership level and you will find that the Government will save a considerable amount of money in health services. I concede again that the conditions under which the Coloureds live in sub-economic <span class="col_4595-4596" refersTo="page_0913"/>housing schemes are better than the conditions under which they lived previously. These houses are however without ceiling in some cases and in other cases without doors. These conditions are not conducive to good health. I have had many complaints in this regard, but I do not want to go too deeply into this matter because these conditions obtained long before the Minister&#x2019;s time. I want to point out that there are many cases where people who started in a sub-economic house so improved their position that the present income of the family is so high because of the fact that the man&#x2019;s children are working that he no longer qualifies as a sub-economic tenant. You then find that he has to leave his premises. Where does he go to&#x003F; There is a shortage of houses for that type of man. The hon. the Minister shakes his head. If he is housed in a City Council scheme, I do not think they would keep him there forever. If the Minister tells me that he can stay there forever, then things have changed since I was a member of the City Council. I say to the hon. the Minister in all sincerity that he should seriously consider&#x2014;I do not expect the change to come about to-morrow&#x2014;whether there should not be a gradual transition from sub-economic schemes to home-ownership schemes. A tenant would rather pay R2 per week for his own home than 50 cents or 60 cents per week for a sub-economic house. A Coloured man who can afford to pay R2 per week, or whatever the amount is, for a house in an economic housing scheme, will then become a proud house-owner. I say that a gradual transition from sub-economic to home-ownership schemes will at least be the beginning to an eventual improvement in the housing position of the poorer Coloured people. It will save the Government a considerable amount of money on health services. I am glad to see that there is an increase of some R6 million in the Loan Vote for the National Housing Fund. That at least shows that the housing programme is going to be stepped up. I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me, however, why there is a reduction of some R4 million in item K, &#x201C;Loans to Community Development Fund in terms of section 12 (1) (a) of Act No. 3 of 1966&#x201D;. I do not know what the reason for this reduction is, but if this increase of R6 million means that the provision of homes is to be accelerated, then it is all to the good.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to make an appeal that we should once and for all get away as far as it is humanly possible from sub-economic housing schemes as fast as we can. We will find that it will pay handsome dividends. In conclusion I want to emphasize that I do not expect miracles within the next year or two, but I would like to hear from the hon. the Minister that the idea which I have put to him is worth while considering.</p>

<speech by="#swiegers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. SWIEGERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, by way of introduction I want to say that I think hon. members opposite are the last people who should talk in this House about a shortage of housing. The hon. member for Newton Park should listen now. [Interjection.] We can argue about elections later. According to calculations made by the United Party there was a shortage of 70,000 housing units in 1948, but actually their calculations were incorrect. In fact there was a shortage of 100,000 housing units, but after ten years, in 1958, there was no shortage any more. During the period from 1958 to 1961 there was no shortage of housing in this country. This is more than one can say about the position when the United Party was in power.</p>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to say a few words to the hon. the Minister in regard to my own constituency. If there is any constituency in the Republic of South Africa to-day that is grateful to the hon. the Minister and his staff for what has been done in the field of housing for Whites it is Uitenhage. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Durban (Point) is really being a nuisance. I want to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the hon. the Minister for what has been done in my constituency in the field of housing for Whites. Uitenhage is a town with a population of 60,000, of which approximately 20,0 are Whites. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I want to convey my thanks and appreciation to the regional representative of the Department of Community Development and his staff, who are always prepared to help us whenever these matters regarding the shortage of housing arise. Mr. Chairman, I should like just to give you an idea of the position obtaining in my constituency. In my constituency the following schemes have been approved: 100 houses under the selling scheme at Fairbridge Heights, 36 flats at Van Riebeeck Heights and 100 low-cost economic houses; the Minister gave his approval for 27 of these houses to be erected by the local authority. In the past financial year R228,500 was allocated for housing for Whites while R391.900 has been allocated in the current financial year, which means a total allocation of R620,400. We are indebted to the Minister for all these concessions, but the situation in Uitenhage nevertheless remains critical in that one has the phenomenon in the Uitenhage-Port Elizabeth complex that many of the people staying in Uitenhage are employed outside my constituency in places such as Despatch and Port Elizabeth and vicinity. I want to ask the Minister very respectfully that he should bear in mind, when funds are allocated for this purpose, that the white population in Uitenhage is increasing considerably.</p>

<p>I just want to refer in passing to a memorandum regarding the selling scheme houses at Fairbridge Heights in my constituency, a memorandum issued by the Uitenhage Municipality to every applicant who applies for a house there. I want to refer the hon. the Minister very respectfully to clause 4 of that memorandum. I do not know whether it applies to all the other town councils, but according to clause 4 of the said memorandum it is, in fact, the case in Uitenhage that &#x201C;the Uitenhage <span class="col_4597-4598" refersTo="page_0914"/>Town Council reserves to itself the right to refuse applications without furnishing any reasons". I want to point out to the hon. the Minister very respectfully that this clause is partly responsible for there being a large measure of dissatisfaction among applicants by reason of the fact that applications which are submitted may be refused summarily without any reason being furnished. It will be appreciated if the Department will carry out the necessary investigations in this connection.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words to the hon. the Minister as regards the low-cost economic and sub-economic housing units for Whites. In the first place I want to refer to the structural design and style of these houses, which, with a few exceptions, all look alike. I should like to ask the Minister whether some variety could not be introduced as far as the present construction of houses of this type is concerned. I also want to ask the Minister whether the floor area cannot be increased. Some of these houses are most uncomfortable. According to my information the floor area of the sub-economic houses is 300 sq. ft., while in the case of the low-cost economic unit it is 560 sq. ft.</p>

<p>In addition I want to ask the Minister whether the erection of semi-detached houses cannot be restricted to the minimum, because in this respect I must say that the occupants of such houses are in the position that they very often have to sacrifice a great deal of privacy. I want to point out to the Minister that when a housing scheme is built and the housing units all look alike, one finds in practice that the occupants to a large extent develop an inferiority complex because the houses in that scheme all look alike. It is quite often wrongly suggested that the occupants of houses in such a scheme are less privileged people and that they cannot afford anything better. This is a factor which sometimes is a handicap in social intercourse with others who are in a better financial position. Socially the inhabitants of such a scheme are sometimes regarded as a separate entity because of their place of residence and the area in which they stay, and in many cases it is most unfair to use that argument against them. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the housing schemes that are undertaken&#x2014;for which we have great appreciation&#x2014;cannot be distributed evenly throughout the whole area of a town or city. These schemes are often built in the outlying areas of a city or town while suitable sites can sometimes be found in a more central position.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that hon. members opposite have this afternoon dealt with this problem of housing from only two points of view, either from a purely political point of view or from a purely parochial point of view. The hon. member who has just sat down spent half his time thanking the Minister for what he has done for him and the other half asking for additional things that should be done for him. This question of housing is far too critical and far too important to have it dealt with on a parochial level. We are all very concerned, not only with the problem of housing <i>per se</i> but with the fact that the problem of housing leaves other problems in its wake. The hon. the Minister will know that in Johannesburg there was a newspaper report about a petition which was being drawn up by certain tenants in one of the areas in Johannesburg to complain about certain of the immigrants, who, as a group, because they are apt to live together in groups, were buying up houses and then giving the tenants notice. It is this sort of thing that a housing shortage leads to. The immigrant is beginning to be attacked and we are having problems from local people regarding immigrants in this country. Therefore I think that the hon. the Minister should this afternoon bring us up to date with the actual position as it is to-day. He spoke about it last year at some length and we should like to know from him whether there has been any improvement in the position or not. We have a lot of figures appearing in a lot of places as to what the actual shortage of houses is. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of about a month or six weeks ago there was an article suggesting that some 78,000 people were waiting for houses. They broke it down into 23,000 in the Transvaal, 33,000 in the Cape, 17,000 in Natal and 4,500 in the Free State. I have no idea how far these figures are correct or wrong. I hope that the hon. the Minister will tell us what the shortage is at the moment, as far as he knows.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) dealt with the question of rent control and its effect on building. We also know that the hon. the Minister introduced building control some time ago. It would appear from the monthly <i>Bulletin of Statistics,</i> which is where we get our information, that there has been a decrease in dwelling units completed for the first ten months of 1966, which are the only statistics we have, compared with the previous period. I hope the hon. the Minister who interjected when the hon. member for Durban (Point) was speaking will tell us what is happening, firstly in regard to the number of units being completed, and secondly the number of units for which plans have already been passed.</p>

<p><span class="col_4599-4600" refersTo="page_0915"/>I want to deal with another aspect. This is something I have spoken about in this House before. There is one particular obstacle which hinders the building of houses, and that is the question of the establishment of new townships I know that the hon. the Minister has a commission which is inquiring into this matter, but I have here just a few cases of extraordinary delays in the establishment of townships. I have handed this information to the hon. the Minister, through his Department. I was notified of another case the other day, in which there was a delay of nine years in the establishment of a township. That township is not yet established.</p>

<p>I quoted the Minister an instance of a delay of seven years in the case of one township but I also have a number of instances where delays of six years, five years and four years have occurred. I want to make it clear that these delays are not always caused by the Townships Board. Very often they are caused by other Government departments. Before a township can be established there are certain Government departments that have to be consulted&#x2014;the National Transport Commission, the S.A. Railways, the Post Office, the Group Areas Board etc. Sometimes 10, 15 and even more other Government departments may have to be consulted before a township can be finally established. But one of the main culprits in regard to these delays is the National Roads Board and in both these two instances, where a delay of nine and seven years has occurred, the delay was caused by questions concerning roads. In England there is a regulation that when a townships board or its equivalent in that country, writes to a department about a new township, that department must comment within 30 days and if it does not it will be accepted that it has consented to the establishment of the proposed township so far as that department is concerned. Also in America there is a time limit by which the different government departments must advise the body responsible for the establishment of new development whether they agree or disagree. So I hope the hon. the Minister will bring pressure to bear on the provinces, which in the main are concerned here, and on Government departments that are affected, so that we can have something similar in this country&#x2014;where a department can be required to make up its mind within a stated period. Otherwise we are never going to get anything done. These delays are expensive delays and are costing everyone concerned money.</p>

<p>Let us take this township which took nine years to be established as an illustration. The Minister knows that if to-day you invest R1 at 8 per cent cumulative interest that R1 will be worth R1,999 at the end of nine years&#x2014; it doubles itself. So, if a township owner has invested R100,000 in a proposed township that investment has after nine years already become R200.000. What does this mean&#x003F; It means that a plot of land which originally had cost R1,000 will cost R2,000 by the time the township is finally established. And if the township owner now wants to sell these plots at a profit, as he would want to, and adds on 20 per cent, the cost now would be R2,400 in comparison with R1,200 that it would have been originally. What is more, when townships take so long to be established and developed, plots in neighbouring areas become more expensive because there is no competition&#x2014;it is a question of supply and demand. If there are ten plots available in a certain township and it takes years and years to establish and develop a neighbouring township it is obvious that the price of existing plots must go up. In other words, this delay in connection with the establishment of townships and the provision of land for building is increasing the costs of housing day by day. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us when he expects his committee to report to him on these problems and how it is intended to solve them. Because unless we can make land available quickly&#x2014;and there is little enough land available as it is&#x2014;we are going to find that the cost of housing is going to go up and up and up. I am not referring only to those houses built by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. Quite rightly the hon. the Minister said that the public could not expect the Government to build all the houses. In that I agree with him 100 per cent. Members of the public must also build their own houses. The entrepreneur and the investor have to see to that. However, this is becoming more and more difficult because of the delay in making land available for building purposes and the prices are going up almost daily. This is the normal consequence where money is invested and no immediate return can be seen. When the individual buyer can eventually buy, he has to pay anything from 50 to 75 per cent more than he would have if these matters had been dealt with expeditiously. The Minister should, therefore, regard this as a most vital factor.</p>

<p>The same circumstances apply to subdivisions of townships already established. Take the case of the township of Five Acres which has to be divided up into acre lots. Here two to three years are required to have a simple subdivision made&#x2014;in other words, the public have to wait from two to three years before they can get that land to build on. These are the things which are hindering the Minister in his efforts to cope with the housing problem.</p>

<speech by="#reyneke">

<p>I must say the hon. member for Parktown has set an example to his party colleagues in trying to make such a constructive contribution in an attempt to solve our problems. All afternoon we have had to hear of this terrible housing shortage that exists. I do not think the hon. the Minister should take too much notice of it, however&#x2014;hon. members opposite are but poor judges. They still have the same judgment to-day that they had years ago when our children had to go to school in tents and when squatter camps sprang up everywhere like mushrooms. At that time squatter camps represented adequate housing as far as they <span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0916"/>were concerned. Our Government, on the other hand, is realistic. We realize the problem which exist as far as housing is concerned. The cause of these problems must not only be sought in Government policy, because we are living in a time of inflationary conditions and in addition a war of interest rates is being waged. Building societies have to borrow money on short term and have to lend it out on long term. That, of course, causes interest rates to soar. In this regard I am thinking particularly of the middle income group, a group which finds it very difficult to obtain houses&#x2014;not only because of the high prices of houses, but also because of the high rate of interest prevailing at present. If we say the average price of a good house to-day is R10,000 and if a person has to borrow that amount at a rate of interest of 8&#x00BD; per cent, it initially costs him R850&#x2014;R71 per month&#x2014; in interest alone. If we now assume that people in this group have an average income of between R200 and R250 per month, it is morally wrong that a person should have to pay out one third of his income for interest alone on the bond on his house. What about his other obligations to his family&#x003F; He still has to feed and clothe them. But this is not the only cause of the shortage of housing. Another cause lies in the fact that our methods of construction do not make for the rapid construction of houses. To my mind this problem can be solved by means of pre-fabrication. Pre-fabrication will not only make it possible for houses to be built more quickly but it will also make houses cheaper and will thus bring them within reach of the man in the middle income group. At the moment the building regulations of local authorities make no provision for unconventional building methods.</p>

<p>Although the Department of Housing is not subject to such regulations, I nevertheless think that the time has arrived that we should have uniform building regulations, regulations which will not only permit but also encourage unconventional building methods. I cannot see why we should tolerate a state of affairs where in one and the same town the Department allows prefabrication for its own houses, while the local authority of that town is not allowed to do so in the case of houses built by private persons. I have made a few inquiries in connection with prefabrication and perhaps I may give a few particulars for the information of bon. members who are not fully acquainted with it. Prefabricated methods are methods by which separate parts are manufactured in factories in advance and are assembled on the site with a minimum of time and labour to form housing units. If I were to judge impartially I should say that prefabrication has the following advantages. In the first place, it facilitates the control over the quality of the material which will be used. What is more, less skilled labour is required, which is the very thing of which we have such a tremendous shortage&#x2014;we have a shortage of skilled artisans. Moreover, better working conditions are created for those workmen because those units are mainly manufactured in factories. Alternatively they would have to be constructed, on the site in the open. There is also the matter of continuity of production, something which is of great importance to us, because our climatic conditions in the Republic are very variable. Even under unfavourable climatic conditions production of those housing units can be continued. Those housing units can also be erected much more quickly. It takes between three and four months to build, an ordinary house, while a house can be erected within three or four weeks by making &#x2018;use of prefabricated methods. The cost is also much less than in the case of a house built by conventional methods. It is not yet possible to determine; the exact cost at this stage, but from inquiries it appears to me as though one can have a very fine house built by means of the prefabrication method at. plus/minus R4 per square foot. Against that the basic cost of a conventional house&#x2014;without any luxury fittings&#x2014;amounts to R6 per square foot. In this regard I do not have in mind the initial building costs only, but also the interest on the capital expenditure. A medium-sized conventional house of approximately 1,500 square feet will, cost approximately R9,000. while the same house, built by means of the prefabricated system, will probably cost plus/minus R6.000. At the present rate of interest there will be a saving of approximately R255 per year on interest alone. There is some difference of opinion about the appearance of these houses. Of course, this is something which is judged subjectively and which is consequently difficult to ascertain as a result of the opinions of the various judges. I have taken the trouble to go and have a look at a few of these houses in Pretoria and I Can assure hon. members that, if care is taken to avoid sameness of roof shape and location on the sites, those houses present a particularly fine and neat appearance. As far as durability is concerned, I do not doubt that the houses will be most hard-wearing, particularly in view of the experiments which are carried out with the material to be used. There are prefabricated buildings which have been built years ago&#x2014;I am thinking of school buildings, for example &#x2014;and which have stood the test of time and durability very well. We have such buildings here in Cape Town too. Hon. members who have visited Acacia Park might have looked at the houses which have been built there, houses which are not intended for civil servants and heads of Departments only, but also for Members of Parliament. Hon. members will, probably, agree with me that those houses, present a very neat appearance. The occupants say that they are highly satisfied with the houses. The houses are, perhaps, not as roomy as those we are used to, but to my mind they Offer all; the conveniences one would like to have. What is more, they are very neatly finished and present a neat appearance.</p>

<p><span class="col_4603-4604" refersTo="page_0917"/>I really think that we have reached the stage now where we should realize that the values in regard to housing are completely false. One&#x2019;s position in society should not be determined by the house in which one lives, but the consideration must be whether the house serves its purpose. I can really see only one solution to our housing problem, and that is to make use of the prefabricated methods, a method which enables us to erect houses within a shorter space of time and at much lower cost.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to join the hon. member who has just sat down in his plea for extra housing, even if it has to be provided by making use of prefabs. I hope the hon. member will forgive me if I do not go any further in that direction because I should like to talk about another matter and that is about the difficulties created for people who are moved as a result of the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>I want to start off by drawing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that both in Cape Town and in Durban where a great number of people are moved, the Coloured and the Indian population groups in fact outnumber the Europeans. In these circumstances I think one can say that these two race groups are probably the most affected by the application of this Act. We move voiceless millions of people about the country with little regard to human rights and dignities or disruption of family life. Because the Department forces people to move from areas which they had occupied for generations, areas which, in many cases, were never occupied by white people, hardships are suffered by these two groups. Most people of the white group do not even begin to realize what hardships these people endure. I think that most white people are little concerned with this particular problem. I know that the Minister&#x2019;s Department does give some consideration to it, but I should like to suggest a few things which the Minister&#x2019;s Department could consider.</p>

<p>I believe that the time has come for the Department to create a commission of inquiry into the hardships caused to these various race groups by the implementation of the Group Areas Act. I think that this commission should inquire into all aspects of the effects of shifting so large a proportion of the South African population. I believe that if the Minister is sincere and if he was sincere when he stated that the Act would be applied fairly and as humanely as possible, then surely he will have no objection to instituting a full inquiry into all the various aspects of the Act and how it affects the many thousands of people who are forced to move by its implementation.</p>

<p>Certain parts of the Act affect the Indian group in Durban and because I know them better than the Coloured group here in Cape Town. I will confine my remarks to them though I have no doubt the same things apply here in Cape Town. Surely we owe our fellow South Africans a duty of inquiring into their difficulties under this Act. The Government have come forward from time to time, year after year, with various amendments to the Act to improve the position, as the recent amendment did. But there are still so many things causing distress that it seems the Government are heartless about difficulties caused to certain groups. [Interjections.] I want to say to the Minister&#x2014;and also to those hon. members who are getting a little restless &#x2014;that I am not blaming the Minister&#x2019;s Department entirely for these things. But I do blame the Minister when there is no action taken to try to rectify what should be rectified. That is why I suggest a commission which could investigate these matters and try to put them right.</p>

<p>I have received certain reports concerning some of these difficulties and I want to read one or two extracts from these reports to the Minister. Firstly, I want to refer to land prices. According to the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The price of land in Durban for housing developments is very high and one of the most important factors contributing towards the high cost is from the tendency amongst Indians to buy land without any intention of building on it immediately.</block>

<p>The Minister may well know that this in fact happened at Isipingo Beach. A fair amount of the land there was bought by Indians from Pretoria and Johannesburg purely on a speculation basis. That tended to exclude Indians who had been displaced from areas in Durban. Obviously there is room for investigation in this particular respect. According to this report, &#x201C;Speculation is encouraged by the freedom of credit buying&#x201D;. For instance, the Durban City Council, when it sells land by public auction does so on a deposit of 10 per cent and the balance is paid in seven yearly instalments at current rate of interest. If this credit buying were to cease and if displaced Indians were given the first option on land, then they could use money received in respect of their old properties to buy land in the new areas. But this is not the case. What in fact does take place is that land speculation has caused prices to soar to such an extent that displaced Indians have no hope at all of settling in a new area. As I said earlier on, I am not blaming the Minister for this sort of thing. I do say, though, that the Minister should have an investigation made into these matters to see if something can be done to stop it.</p>

<p>The next point I want to make refers to exemption from the by-laws. I quote again from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The exemption granted to the Board from the provisions of by-laws and regulations of a local authority has brought about certain conditions which are certainly not anything to be proud of. This is the sort of thing that happens. The department had developed a township at Shallcross for Indians and the standard of roads, houses, <span class="col_4605-4606" refersTo="page_0918"/>sanitary arrangements, etc. is very poor compared to the standard upon which the Durban City Council has developed the Chatsworth Indian Township.</block>

<p>Perhaps consideration could be given to the possibility that the Board should not be exempted from local by-laws, as obviously this is causing a type of community to develop the standards of which are certainly lower than one should like to see.</p>

<p>The next point I want to make concerns property sales, and I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Durban there are several areas owned and occupied by Indians in large numbers which were proclaimed for members of the white and Coloured groups. One of these areas was Cato Manor where at date of proclamation (June, 1958) there were approximately 40,000 Indians settled there. Even since the date of proclamation, and even now, members of the white group show little interest in buying property in Cato Manor.</block>

<p>The report also refers to expropriated property&#x2014;the Board expropriates property and in many cases hardships are suffered. Mention is also made of basic values, values which bear little relationship to the true value of land. I mentioned earlier, when the Bill was considered here, that basic values did not help the Indians to resettle in their own community in a style equal to that in which they had been living. We determine new areas for Indians but we tend to ignore certain factors of Indian life&#x2014;the sons and daughters move in with the parents, instead of moving out. There are many other matters dealt with in the reports I have here, but I do not wish to read out everything contained in them.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that these matters are so involved, and there are so many of them, that the only way possible in which justice can be done is for the Minister to appoint a commission to go into all the problems associated with the moving of such large numbers of our population.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is strange how many times this matter regarding the removal of communities is raised by hon. members opposite. It was also interesting to see how the hon. member who has just sat down quoted figures. At times he spoke of millions, then of thousands and finally of the large percentage of the population which is moved. The hon. member is doing harm to our country. If the outside world is given the impression that millions or thousands or a very large percentage of the population are being moved it will do our country harm. The hon. member spoke about Natal and certain areas in Natal. Why did the hon. member not rather go and determine how many people were affected where people had been moved in any particular area&#x003F; He should give us the exact figures. He should not simply talk of millions and then of thousands and then of a large percentage of the population. Has the hon. member compared the disadvantages suffered by people who are moved with the benefits they derive from being moved&#x003F; There are the benefits of better housing and of a new community that is being built up, a community in which those people may serve their own community so much better. When hon. members opposite discuss this matter they never mention these benefits here. It is also wrong to suggest that it is only the non-Whites who have to bear the burden of removals&#x2014;also the Whites have to bear the burden of removals, even if it is only a financial burden. In that respect as well hon. members opposite, and also the hon. member who has just sat down, give a complete misrepresentation.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked for a commission of inquiry to be appointed. These things are done in terms of a particular Act, which was fully debated at the time of its introduction in this House. It was considered from all angles. It has also been amended on occasion. The hon. member even referred to amendments which were made to the benefit of those people on whose behalf he pleaded here. Action is taken in terms of that Act, and the Government also intends to carry out the policy of separating residential areas, and the Government will do that in a humane manner and with as little hardship as possible to those population groups for whom hon. members opposite plead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is difficult to switch over to a new topic at this juncture&#x2014;it is almost time for the House to adjourn&#x2014;but I shall start discussing it and I hope, Sir, that you will see me when this debate is continued so that I shall be able to finish what I have to say.</p>
