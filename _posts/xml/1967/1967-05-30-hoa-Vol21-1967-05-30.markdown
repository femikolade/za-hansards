<p>(1) and (2) Yes, invitations to the two meetings of the International Communications Satellite System were received on 24th March and 18th April, 1967, respectively. The purpose of the meetings is to study technical and traffic matters and the conditions under which channels of the satellite system will be used for the present, and to discuss problems in that regard.</p>

<p>The satellite communications system is still in an experimental stage, whereas South Africa already possesses a modern radio communications system, and will shortly also have the use of a well-proven modern cable system. At this juncture, therefore, it was not considered necessary to accept the invitations. South Africa, as member, will be kept fully informed of the discussions.</p>

<heading>ADDRESS TO THE STATE PRESIDENT</heading>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move, as an unopposed motion, that the following address be presented to the State President&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the Members of the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, have learnt with regret that you are to relinquish the office of State President of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<block name="quote">We wish to place on record our sincere and deep appreciation of the invaluable service you so selflessly rendered to your country and your people over a long period of years; as a member of the House of Assembly from 1923 to 1938 and again from 1941 to 1959; as a Cabinet Minister from 1948 to 1959; as ninth and last Governor-General of the Union of South Africa from 1959 to 1961 and as State President from 1961 to 1967.</block>

<block name="quote">In particular we wish to pay tribute to the capable and dignified manner in which you, as first State President of the Republic of South Africa, filled that high office and as Head of State helped to shape and direct the new State for which you always cherished the highest ideals.</block>

<block name="quote">We also wish to express our sincere appreciation to Mrs. Swart for the charm and warm friendliness with which she assisted you in adding lustre to the office of State President.</block>

<block name="quote">We wish you and Mrs. Swart a well-earned rest and we pray that with the blessing of Almighty God, you both may long be spared to our country and our people.</block>

<p>We are gathered here this afternoon on this historic occasion to take our leave, as a House of Assembly, of the first State President of the Republic. Not only to take our leave, but also, in the words of the address, to express our appreciation to the State President and Mrs. Swart and to place it on record in this way. I hasten to add, Mr. Speaker, that the fact that we are able to do so in the spirit prevailing here this afternoon is in truth the greatest compliment that we can pay the present State President. We have come to know him as a man of many abilities; we have come to know him as a man of wide interests; we have come to know him as a man with a fine sense of humour. We have come to know him as a man who has at all times displayed a sense of the historic and an appreciation of the finer things in life, but we have also known him&#x2014;and his career of 44 years bears testimony to this&#x2014;as a man who gave of himself unstintingly and who served unstintingly. During the five years of my term of office as Minister of Justice I very frequently came into personal contact with him on an official level, and subsequently as Prime Minister he and I worked together very intimately for several months. I was always struck by the devotion with which he fulfilled his office and by the meticulous way in which he discharged the duties attaching thereto.</p>

<p>You are aware, Mr. Speaker, that the question of becoming a Republic was for many years a contentious, perhaps the most contentious, issue in our national life, and you <span class="col_6913-6914" refersTo="page_0718"/>are aware that the referendum held in regard to that matter decided in favour of the establishment of a Republic by a relatively small majority of just over 70,000. You, Mr. Speaker, and hon. members will agree with me that not only getting the Republic firmly established, but, indeed, getting it accepted by our people, therefore depended in large measure on the way in which the State President and his wife conducted themselves. And the success achieved in that bears testimony to the splendid way in which the State President and Mrs. Swart conducted themselves. It is true that all of us who play a part in public life are exposed to criticism; not only we ourselves, but very often our wives as well. Regarding Mrs. Swart I wish to say that in all the years she played a part in public life I for one never heard anybody say anything about her that was not said in praise, and because she too had a duty to perform and performed it in such a magnificent way, we also wish to convey to her, as is stated in the address, our gratitude and appreciation on this occasion.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, with the coming of the Republic we were all called upon to play our part to promote national unity. We are gathered here today to pay tribute to the State President and Mrs. Swart for the role they played to unite our people and to make it possible for our people, not only to accept the Republic but also to serve that Republic to the best of their ability. We are extremely sorry that circumstances, sad circumstances of which we are all aware, prevented us from taking proper leave of the State President and Mrs. Swart and to pay our final respects to them. I think I can say in all sincerity on behalf of all of us that we were extremely fortunate in our choice of our first State President. It was, I make bold to say, good to know him; it was good for us and South Africa to have had him. He served our people and our country with great distinction, and in this regard it gives me great pleasure to make the following announcement on behalf of the Government.</p>

<p>With the first State President&#x2019;s relinquishment of office, attention has naturally been given to some means by which lasting homage can be done to him. Our Republic became a reality in 1961, with the result that when a decimal system of currency was introduced in that year, the effigy of the Queen of England on our coins was replaced by that of Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of white civilization at this southernmost tip of Africa. As the South African coins have such close ties with the Republic&#x2019;s history and form an integral part of our daily lives, the Government has decided that it will be fitting to do homage to the person of our Republic&#x2019;s first State President by substituting his effigy for that of Jan van Riebeeck on all coins normally in circulation to be minted in 1968. All coins from one cent to 50 cents issued during 1968 will accordingly bear the effigy of State President C. R. Swart.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely say that it is a great pleasure to associate myself and this side of the House with the motion just moved by the hon. the Prime Minister. I think that we will all warmly support the suggestion that the State President&#x2019;s effigy should appear on the coins in 1968. I may say that I hope that perhaps stamps will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>I think this is a unique occasion. This is the only time in our history when it will be our privilege to pay tribute to someone who was the representative of the monarchy in South Africa and later the representative of our Republic here in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister made some small mention of the State President&#x2019;s record before he became Governor-General. Sir, I do not propose to venture into that field. The State President was known to us as a controversial figure before he became State President. He was a tough politician, a hard fighter, but always a man with a most delightful sense of humour. I do not propose to revive the memories of those days. I want to concentrate on his career after 1959 when he became first Governor-General and subsequently the first State President of the Republic of South Africa. I think we all know that that was a difficult transition to make. Loyalties are not like jackets that you can put on and take off at will. There were very deep feelings involved and it was quite clear that much would depend on the first State President in assisting the transition from one type of State to another. I think one can say that it was here that the personality, the dignity and the tact of Mr. and Mrs. Swart played a vital role in making a peaceful and a complete change possible. It required qualities of human understanding, qualities of tact and an innate sense of propriety which very few people are blessed to possess. I think that both Mr. and Mrs. Swart proved themselves to be richly endowed with those remarkable qualities. Here, Sir, I want to associate myself very particularly with the charming tribute which the hon. the Prime Minister paid to Mrs. Swart. I think it was richly deserved and I think she will always be remembered as a First Lady who served with the greatest distinction.</p>

<p>Sir, the services of the State President of South Africa, not only to the Government as such but to many great organizations which are representative of the nation, and also to important constituent groups of the nation, were, I thought, outstanding. I think they were marked at all times by that devotion to duty of which the hon. the Prime Minister spoke, by sincerity and by untiring zeal.</p>

<p>Now that the State President and his wife are going to enjoy a well-deserved rest on his farm in his beloved Free State I think we can say that the good wishes of the whole nation accompany them. We wish him and Mrs. Swart well. We pray that they will enjoy many happy years of retirement together in the loving company of each other. I may say that I believe their association with each other has <span class="col_6915-6916" refersTo="page_0719"/>been an inspiring model to the whole nation. In the years to come I am sure that successors in office will often look back to the precedents established by the first State President and will hope to be worthy successors to one who had that unique distinction of being the last Governor-General and the first State President.</p>

<p>I second the motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to associate myself, my colleagues and myself, as well as the Coloured people of our Republic, with the motion before the House, and with the well-deserved tributes paid to our retiring State President and Mrs. Swart. This occasion, I am sure, brings mixed feelings to our many hearts&#x2014;joy and thankfulness that this occasion affords us a public opportunity of expressing our gratitude to one who has devoted almost his entire adult life to the service of his country and his people, and regret that this spells the exit of a lovable character into what, I am sure we all hope, will be a long and happy retirement. It is not given to many men to be permitted to sail through the storm of political strife into the save harbour of a happy, peaceful and honoured age, and to become not only the living symbol, but the actual respected friend, of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Our retiring State President, by the grace of God, has achieved this outstanding gift of fortune, and we are grateful that the nation&#x2019;s choice should have fallen upon him as the first State President of our young Republic. By his impartiality and tolerance, by his absolute dedication to public service, by his friendliness with all sections of our multi-racial population, Mr. Swart has engraved his name in honoured letters upon the pages of our country&#x2019;s history. In all his public manifestations, as the Prime Minister has so rightly remarked, he was at all times ably supported by his loyal and devoted wife, who always carried out her multifarious duties with exceeding grace and dignity.</p>

<p>It is our fervent wish that Divine Providence may spare Mr. and Mrs. Swart for many more years in good health and happiness, to enable them to enjoy to the utmost the benefits of a long and well-earned retirement.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill repeals an Act which was passed in this House in 1948. That Act of 1948 was introduced into this House in the shadow of the ghastly explosions in Japan in 1945, and naturally with the thoughts and fears which existed at that time, it was a measure which tried to control the use of this powerful force, namely the splitting of the atom. It is understandable that such an Act should contain many restrictions. But many years have passed and many things have happened during those years to change the outlook and the thoughts of humans about this powerful force. Since then the world has learnt to control the use of this force, to some extent at least, it has learnt to make this great force useful to the human race. It is probably the greatest force available, a force which, if properly used, will probably do away with want, poverty and hunger throughout the world. However, by this Bill, instead of creating possibilities, instead of helping this country to use the power which it has in its hands, we have added restrictions to the existing Act, the Act which is now being repealed. I feel that in doing this the Government has taken a wrong step. When one realizes that within the next three years two private American firms will build 20 nuclear reactors and are seeking orders for the construction of other reactors, I think one can realize how much the peaceful use of nuclear power can be utilized without restrictions other than the ordinary restrictions demanded by the health and safety of the population. I am sorry to say that this Bill contains more restrictions than the measure it repeals. The one that is being repealed at least permitted discussion, but in this Bill we find that it is almost impossible for two nuclear physicists working in different laboratories in this country to carry on a conversation. Because if a student or worker in Pelindaba happens to meet a student or worker in the nuclear institute of the Southern Universities, and neither of them knew each other, and they discussed what is happening in their laboratories, it is quite possible that each of them would in their particular sphere feel that it is necessary for them to report to the Atomic Board that somebody was discussing secrets relating to nuclear power in the country. Not only that, but it will be impossible for any laboratory research worker or any worker in an institute supported by the Atomic Board to publish papers without the consent of the Atomic Energy Board. It is unlikely that the Atomic Energy Board would refuse consent, but in the case of scientific papers and discussions at scientific meetings, there is an inevitable delay because of the inevitable red <span class="col_6917-6918" refersTo="page_0720"/>tape. This is not conducive to happy service in those laboratories. Furthermore, the restrictions, particularly in clause 30 (1) (a), interfere with fundamental research. Fundamental research is not concerned greatly with the invention of military weapons or with assistance of industrial development. It is the fundamental investigation of basic knowledge. It is true that such research in the long run frequently leads to practical application, but in the beginning fundamental research should be free. I have no quarrel with the first half of this Bill. That is why this side of the House accepted the Bill. The second half of the Bill deals with the control of science and the control of individuals. If it is not seriously reconsidered, it will drive from the country some of our best brains who work in this field. This is a most interesting subject before the world to-day. This Bill, if not modified in these respects, will increase the brain drain from the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Central) has taken a great interest not only in this Bill but in all matters relating to atomic energy. I know that for many years he made a study of this particular subject. I also know that he is particularly perturbed about the possibility of our scientists not having the freedom which he feels they ought to have. May I say that I have, since we had the Second Reading debate, had a very long and thorough discussion with the director-general of the Atomic Energy Institute. He has given me the absolute assurance that what we are doing in this Bill, and particularly in clause 30, is in line with what is being done all over the world. Secondly he gave me the assurance, and this does not only come from him, but also from other sources, that the staff at the Atomic Energy Board are very happy indeed. They work in a very happy atmosphere because they have a full opportunity to do their research work. It is not only encouraged, but also financed by the board and by the Government. Furthermore, ample opportunity for both members of the Atomic Board and for its staff is given to take part in international symposiums and discussions. For the safety of the State, however, in respect of such a very dangerous matter as atomic energy, and also to comply with international practice, it is absolutely necessary to take the measures we are taking in this Bill. May I also say to the hon. member that South Africa has, especially for such a small country, made considerable progress in the use of atomic energy for peacetime purposes and for uses which will be to the benefit of the human race, and not to the detriment of the human race. Furthermore I should like to point out to the hon. member that we have a very definite international responsibility in these matters. Where we are making this progress in harnessing atomic energy for peacetime use it is all the more necessary that more and more scientists come to the fore and take part in this particular type of research. It is thus even more necessary to have that check. May I emphasize that it will not in any way debar our scientists from doing research or from the opportunities which exist in other countries. I should like the hon. member to accept this assurance from me as emanating from a very thorough discussion with the director-general of the Atomic Energy Board.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last night I indicated that I would discuss with the hon. the Minister today the manner in which I think compulsion can be applied in terms of this Bill. I think it is not only a bill which contains provisions of compulsion implicitly, but in addition it makes provision for compulsion being applied in a discriminatory manner. The Bill creates a situation in which the hon. the Minister has absolute power. I should like to direct my remarks especially in regard to the first paragraph of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia, which reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">That this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Bill because it,<i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) seeks to place in the hands of the Minister complete and unfettered control of the use of land, labour and industrial development in the country.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, it creates a situation where the hon. the Minister has absolute power. This Bill is a stage in the development of Government policy in introducing legislation, which we have observed in the House now for some time. It is a trend in Government legislation which I can explain by referring to two Bills in which I was interested. The first was a Bill to provide pensions for non-White servants of the Government. Naturally we were pleased to have a Bill of that kind, but when the Bill was introduced, it was not really a pensions bill at all. It gave no details of a pension scheme. What it did do was this: It gave the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions the right to create pension schemes by ordinary regulations issued by his department, and not one pension scheme for all non-White employees, but as many as he wished. He introduced this government by regulation. The hon.<span class="col_6919-6920" refersTo="page_0721"/>The Minister in introducing his Bill and in replying to the debate made his attitude perfectly clear. I want to quote one extract from his speech in reply to the Second Reading debate. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">This legislation is merely enabling legislation and the regulations to be promulgated in terms of it will actually define the pension scheme.</block>

<p>In other words, we now have the situation where a pension scheme can be defined by a regulation of the Minister. That was the first case, where this autocratic power is placed in the hands of the Minister. I come now to the second case. About the first one I should like to add that the number of officers of the Government to whom the Minister could delegate his powers was practically unlimited. I come now to the second Bill with which we are more familiar because we passed it this Session. That was the National Education Policy Bill. I am not going to discuss the terms of the Bill. I want to discuss this trend of handing to the Minister absolute power. Under the National Education Policy Bill the hon. the Minister assumed powers over all White education in South Africa. He assumed the powers which formerly belonged to the Administrator-in-Executive Committee in the provinces. In doing so he has also assumed powers to state that by regulation he could nullify any ordinance passed by a province. In other words, we have there the same situation where he himself assumes all the power that is necessary so that he can control by regulation and it is unnecessary for him to state in the terms of the Bill what he intends to do. We know the answer to this. We have the same situation being created here where the Minister assumes powers to control the location and extension of industry. Of course we have here the same factor of the delegation of the Minister&#x2019;s power. The Minister&#x2019;s powers in this case are to be delegated to the Here VII. We used to have the Here XVII in our history of South Africa but now it will go to seven of the senior officers of the Government. The Minister has the power to delegate to them his powers. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he regards it as a healthy trend in legislation that he should assume that power. Does he feel that it is the correct method&#x003F; Should he not state in the Bill in a positive manner what he intends to do and how he intends to make provision for this new establishment of industry&#x003F; I think that is the obvious thing to do. Of course the Minister said, as his predecessors did in the case of the other two Bills, that there will be provision made for consultation. What does this blessed word &#x201C;consultation&#x201D; mean&#x003F; It is rather like the old woman who said that she gained much support from that blessed word Mesopotamia. It is a fine-sounding word and consultation is also a fine-sounding word. The English actor David Garrick said that a colleague of his, George Whiteside, could make people either laugh or weep by just pronouncing the word Mesopotamia. That is what consultation has come to mean in this House. Hon. members say in any debate, &#x201C;Ah, but there will be consultation.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister of Education said that he would have consultation as well. With whom would he consult&#x003F; He said he would consult with the Administrators. He would also consult, he said, with the Education Advisory Committee. Who were they&#x003F; They were a body appointed by himself.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>My point of view is this. It should not be necessary to have ordinary consultation. The powers should be laid down definitely in the Bill. What does consultation mean&#x003F; When a Judge has to sentence a criminal, he consults him. He says to the criminal: &#x201C;Would you like to say anything in mitigation of sentence&#x003F;&#x201D; He asks for his opinion. The criminal or his advocate gives good reasons and the Judge, if he is slightly impressed, says: &#x201C;Well, I shall pass sentence to-morrow.&#x201D; That is the attitude. The Minister can do the same. Everything depends on the personality of the Minister. Nothing positive is laid down in this Bill. That is our objection to the Bill. It creates an autocracy in government. It is government by decree, and the decree is issued by the hon. the Minister himself.</p>

<p>I want to come to this question of the establishment of industry. What is the driving force in the establishment of industry&#x003F; Hon. members tell us that if people wish to serve South Africa, or if they are interested in the Government&#x2019;s policy and wish to support it, they will establish industries on the borders of the reserves or in areas dictated to them by the Government. Men do not establish industries for that reason. There is only one important motive. All the others are subsidiary. The important motive is the profit motive. Men will establish industries where it is going to pay, and pay dividends. The only people who do not do that are the Industrial Development Corporation, which has been established for a different reason, to establish Government industries. But when men have to establish an industry under private enterprise&#x2014;and we are all agreed that that is our system&#x2014;they are interested in the profit motive. Is it going to pay&#x003F; Will it pay dividends&#x003F; When I say &#x201C;Will it pay dividends&#x003F;&#x201D; another matter comes to my mind. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister was here when we discussed the report of the Industrial Development Corporation. They gave us the story of the Cyril Lord Company. They spoke about, not the failure of the company, but the exceedingly difficult time they have had, establishing their industry on the borders of the reserves. They explained the reasons. That was not very encouraging to the other industries that wished to establish themselves there. The I.D.C. said the situation was almost catastrophic. Perhaps the Government can act in this way. They are <span class="col_6921-6922" refersTo="page_0722"/>spending the public&#x2019;s money. But when the ordinary entrepreneur establishes an industry, he investigates to see whether there is a profit, whether it will pay.</p>

<p>The next point I wish to deal with is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of what has happened in other countries by way of comparison. The hon. the Minister told us that in Paris provision was made for the zoning of areas for industry, offices, etc. He need not have gone to Paris; he could have gone to Parys, because Parys, like any South African town, makes provision for zoning. They have zoning for industry and for residents just as Johannesburg. Cape Town or any other city in South Africa has. He spoke about the situation in London. There is a county council for London and its area. I think someday, if the Government intends to abolish the provinces, we may have a county council for the whole Witwatersrand. I think that might come. Then the hon. the Minister spoke about the situation in England and pointed out that the Government was bringing pressure upon the industries to decentralize.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The story is different there. In England there are certain areas which were depressed areas. Those areas were in Lancashire, along the Tyne, the Clyde and in South Wales. Those industries, after a long successful period, after they had flourished, found that ship-building, coal-mining and the cotton industries had faded. But they had the infrastructure, about which we hear so much, at their disposal. They have the infrastructure and the Government says industries will go there; you have transport and roads and power and communications and you can establish yourself there. That is the policy in Britain, and it is also a good policy here because we have an area rather like that. We have discussed it here. We had a motion by the hon. member for Benoni in the last Parliament, Mr. Ross, and the hon. member for Brakpan made a valuable contribution to that discussion. The hon. members for Benoni and Springs are interested in this because we have in the East Rand not an area that is depressed but an area where the industry on which it was established is gradually failing. The mines are gradually becoming worked out. Therefore I think the hon. the Minister should indicate what he intends to do there. He should indicate in the Bill what provision he is making. It is no good telling them to do the best they can in the meantime and he will help them when the time comes. They want a positive statement in regard to the concessions that will be made to industry. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the concessions which have already been made to establish industries in the border areas have not been sufficient. Has the Industrial Development Corporation advised that there should be further concessions&#x003F; Because if that were necessary, we could discuss it in the Bill. We have emphasized here that there should be inducements and not compulsion. We should say to these people that if they go there they will have special concessions, particularly in regard to transport and the establishment of an infrastructure. But here we have a perfect example, on the East Rand, as I mentioned, where you have the infra-structure and where we are anxious to see industries established.</p>

<p>I want to refer to a point which was mentioned by the hon. the Minister. He said that if the situation developed further, in Johannesburg especially, we would have difficulty with Soweto; it would be necessary to provide facilities for education and for residence, etc. But the hon. member for Krugersdorp asked why the companies did not provide housing; why should they leave it all to the Government&#x003F; Sir, the companies offered to do so. They said they would build houses for their employees, but the Government refused; there could be only one system, sites and services. We also went further. When a Native township was to be transferred to the new area, we said that people who had property rights should retain those rights. But the companies themselves, if approached, I am sure, will make provision, as all industries have done. I think provision can be made for that.</p>

<p>I want to say what I think about this Bill itself. If the intention of the Minister is to persuade industry to decentralize and to go nearer to the Reserves, I think the provisions of the Bill are far too drastic. I do not think this will do. The hon. the Minister now has the right to say to one industry that he will support it, and to say to another industry he will not support it. I think that is unsound. That is not a positive step. I think a member said that it was a negative Bill with a positive result. I think it was the hon. member for Florida who said so. What are we to do with the Bantu who have to be moved&#x003F; We have been told that in this Bill there is a Bantu in the woodpile, that it is part of the Government&#x2019;s policy to remove Bantu from the Witwatersrand and other areas. But where are they to go&#x003F; To the farms&#x003F; Well, I have worked out from the latest statistics available that the number of Bantu employees compared with Whites on the farms is about 50 to 1. That is for male employees, and for female employees it is over 400 to 1. Where are they to go&#x003F; To the farms&#x003F; Should they go back to the Reserves to starve&#x003F; What is the policy of the Government&#x003F; These people are employed profitably now in the industrial areas. Why should they not have an opportunity to develop there&#x003F; We have housing and transport. It will be necessary to improve the transport from time to time, but we have these things. The infrastructure is there. We have the power and everything that the Minister has mentioned, but still the Minister says they should be removed from there. I should like the Minister to tell us what is his policy in regard to the future of these people. They cannot go to the farms. The farmers say <span class="col_6923-6924" refersTo="page_0723"/>they have too many already. When I gave those figures, I was not speaking of casual employees, but of employees who are employed on the farms permanently. Where are these Africans to go from the Witwatersrand and other similar areas&#x003F; What is the policy&#x003F; I have never understood what the Government intends to do with these people. We say they should be educated, so that they can go to the Reserves, but the Government will not give them a secondary school in Soweto. They say they must go to the Reserves to be educated. The policy has always been to bring the school to the child, but in this case we say that the child should be sent away from his mother and father and from his home surroundings. He should be sent to the Reserves. Perhaps the hon. member for Heilbron will help me here. He knows it is true that the commercial men in Johannesburg offered to build a commercial school in Soweto and pay for it, but they were refused permission. What is the policy to be&#x003F;</p>

But the children do not know where the Bantustan is. It has no meaning for them. They were born and bred in Soweto and their parents were born and bred there, but now they are told that the Bantustan is their homeland. But they belong to Johannesburg, or the East Rand, or the West Rand. I appeal to the Minister to tell us what he will do with these people who are displaced. Now people have to come to the Minister if they wish to employ an extra African in a factory, because that means an extension of the factory. That is the definition. If you employ an extra African, you are extending your industry.</p>

<p>In characteristic fashion the hon. member for Kensington tried once again to ask a whole series of questions to which he knew the replies as well as anybody else. The fact of the matter is that the United Party as a whole, by the nature of its spirit and constitution, has always been the Party to take the line of least resistance under all circumstances. If one studies the history of that Party, one can understand why they always take the line of least resistance, as they are also doing in the case of this legislation. The Party was originally constituted of irreconcilable elements, and the moment a stand had to be taken on a matter of principle, there was conflict and friction, and rather than to take a stand, they did nothing at all. This became the spirit of the United Party, also during the period when they governed the country, to such an extent that the motto of one of their great leaders was: &#x201C;Let things develop.&#x201D; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>That is the spirit of the entire United Party. They take the line of least resistance under all circumstances. They are unable to take a strong and unwavering stand on any issue. They simply have no attitude in principle. Mr. Speaker, have you ever seen any United Party member put his fist into the air and say: &#x201C;We stand by the Graaff Senate-plan, come what may&#x201D;&#x003F; No, they simply refuse to take a stand. Have you ever seen the United Party take an unwavering stand&#x003F; No. The policy of the United Party is always: &#x201C;If matters develop in this way, we shall do this, but if matters develop in that way, then we shall do that.&#x201D; The best description I could have for the United Party is to say that they are in actual fact like lukewarm jelly. The form in which it settles once it cools off depends on the mould in which one pours it. If one pours it into a round bowl it is round, and if one pours it into a square dish it is square. They take no stand. They always first want to see what happens before they adopt their attitude. The National Party, on the other hand, adopts the attitude in respect of this Bill and in respect of all issues that one has to follow the right course, no matter how strong the resistance may be. It does not take the line of least resistance; it follows the right course to achieve the ultimate objective for which it aims deliberately and purposefully, and whether that course is fraught with problems and difficulties, whether it goes uphill or downhill, we follow that course, the right course, because we have an ultimate destination for which we are heading deliberately and purposefully. That is the difference between the two Parties. Do you know. Sir, what the true state of affairs is&#x003F; It is illustrated by the numbers in this House. The Party which is following the right course and which is following a course which heads for an ultimate objective must naturally always move uphill, because it is always more difficult to reach heights; that is why we are moving uphill and that is why we reach heights in our numbers and in our policy and in our constitution. The United Party, on the contrary, has taken the line of least resistance since it was founded, and what course is the <span class="col_6925-6926" refersTo="page_0724"/>line of least resistance since it was founded, and what course is the line of least resistance&#x003F; The road downhill, not even the level road. There is less resistance on the downhill road than on the level road. They have consistently moved along that downhill road, until they reached their present position as far as their numbers are concerned&#x2014;in the swamp&#x2014;while we are up there on the mountain peak.</p>

<p>Yes, with them it is like a donkey cart; all the traces are slack, but the cart follows behind because it is a downhill road.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to come back to the Bill which is before us at present, what is the basic concept in this measure&#x003F; So much has been said about the Bill, but I should like to state a few basic concepts here. At present industries are established in South Africa, some in the border areas, some in the urban areas and some in the rural areas. This Bill does not contain one provision in terms of which those industries could be shifted somewhere else. Number two: In the years ahead new industries will naturally be established. There will be a need of new industries; the capital and the raw materials will be available and new industries will be established. This Bill provides that when new industries are established, the hon. the Minister will be able to select those new industries. He will be able to say: &#x201C;I am prepared to allow this industry in this area, and I am not prepared to allow that industry in that area.&#x201D; The reasons for his selection are set out very clearly in clause 2; they are the question of labour, the question of water, the question of land, and all those things. It is as clear as crystal. The hon. the Minister will be able to select only new industries; he will be able to say: &#x201C;This one may be established here.&#x201D; He is not going to tell an industrialist: &#x201C;You may not establish your industry here; you must go there.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister merely has the power to tell the industrialist: &#x201C;You may not establish your industry here,&#x201D; and then the industrialist can draw his own conclusions.</p>

<p>The third argument is that existing industries would want to expand. This Bill provides: &#x201C;&#x2026; an extension of a factory means any increase in the number of employees employed in such factory,&#x201D; if the proposed amendment of the hon. the Minister is read with the clause. In other words, it simply means: If an industrialist says: &#x201C;I want to treble my capital.&#x201D; the hon. the Minister of Planning will tell him: &#x201C;If you want to do so in Johannesburg, you may do so with the greatest of pleasure.&#x201D; If the industrialist wants to extend his buildings, the Minister will also tell him that he may do so with the greatest of pleasure. If the industrialist says that he wants to employ 30 or 40 additional Whites, he will be subject to no restrictions, but as soon as he wants to increase his number of Bantu labourers, the hon. The Minister will say:&#x201C;Let me first look at your application to see whether it is a reasonable or an unreasonable increase.&#x201D; The Minister then judges and says: &#x201C;Yes, you may do so&#x201D; or &#x201C;No, you may not do this.&#x201D; This is quite clear. If the industrialist says that he wants to replace his Bantu labour by Coloured labour, then there is no problem. This Bill places no restriction on that. It deals exclusively with the increase of Bantu labour in certain areas to be proclaimed by the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, how will this measure function in practice&#x003F; Surely that is clear. In terms of clause 9 a committee is to be established comprising seven persons. This committee will consist of men who will serve on it and who by authority of the Minister and of the Cabinet will lay down a certain course of policy for themselves, and if an industrialist wishes to extend his industry he will not first have to go to the trouble of drawing up plans and approaching the City Council; he will very soon learn from experience that right at the outset he should pick up the telephone and contact this committee and say:&#x201C;Look, this is what I propose to do; this is what I want to do in this specific area; is it in line with the policy prescribed by you at present or is in in conflict with it&#x003F; These are my needs and this is my situation.&#x201D; He will then be able to get guidance from that committee immediately. The committee may then perhaps tell him: &#x201C;In terms of the present policy we cannot allow that, but if you did this or that, it could be done.&#x201D; Surely that is clear as crystal. The committee will be contacted for advice; that advice will be given in a practical fashion. If people want to be recalcitrant, if their motive is purely personal profit and not the interests of the country, if despite the advice of the committee they persist in their attitudes, their application will be rejected, and should be rejected. Would the United Party not have such applications rejected&#x003F; So much for the establishment of industries. But this Bill also contains restrictions in respect of land. At present there is industrial land which has already been proclaimed. At the moment there is no statutory power of any nature in terms of which the further planning of that land can be controlled. In other words, if industrialists want to establish industries on that land which will employ an excessive number of Bantu labourers, there is at present no statutory power in terms of which this could be prevented. Here I want to mention one example mentioned by the late Dr. Verwoerd on a previous occasion. He mentioned the example of sawmills in a certain town on the East Rand. The hon. member referred to the East Rand, and I want to ask him whether this is the kind of industry he would recommend for the East Rand. This example of the sawmill was mentioned by the late Dr. Verwoerd while he was still Minister of Native Affairs. There was a sawmill in a certain East Rand town. It belonged to three white proprietors, who employed 200 Bantu. The three white proprietors then quarrelled and each of <span class="col_6927-6928" refersTo="page_0725"/>them went and founded his own sawmill, i.e., three new industries. As a result, three industrial sites were taken up immediately, but the proprietors employed no additional Whites. The Bantu labour establishment in one case was 120, in the other case 200, and in the third case 90. How did the town council of Springs benefit by that&#x003F; The town council of Springs then had to provide housing for 410 Bantu in its location, instead of 200, while still having only three white taxpayers, whom it had had previously. In the third place three of its most valuable industrial sites in that highly industrialized area were occupied by this kind of industry. How did industry benefit by that; how did the town council of Springs and South Africa benefit by that&#x003F; That is the kind of thing which this legislation seeks to prohibit. I want to ask the Opposition whether they are not in favour of that kind of thing being prohibited&#x003F; At the moment we have no legislation in terms of which such extensions to industries can be prohibited. At the moment it is done by appealing to people to cooperate, people who agree in goodwill, but statutorily the Government has no right to prohibit the establishment of such industries, unless this measure is passed. Mr. Speaker, let me state it in practical terms: Precisely what are we going to achieve&#x003F; There is a certain number of additional industries which are in any event going to be established in South Africa by the year 2000. All this Bill seeks is to be able to ensure that the right type of industry will be established in the right place. All this Bill seeks is to allow those industries which are not Bantu-labour intensive to carry on and to develop in the metropolitan areas or in the rural towns, where we are so anxious to establish points of growth, and to encourage the establishment of Bantu-labour intensive industries in the border areas. They will be assisted and incentives will be provided to induce them to go to the border areas. What is the United Party&#x2019;s method of dealing with this same problem&#x003F; They say: &#x201C;We believe in freedom; the industrialist must be able to go where he pleases.&#x201D; Do you see, this is once again the line of least resistance. It is in fact the typical United Party policy&#x2014;the line of least resistance. They want the industrialist to be free to go wherever he likes, and if he wants to establish himself inside Johannesburg with his enormous Bantu labour establishment, then I may not say a word against it; I must simply allow him to go there because he must supposedly be free. The United Party say that they believe in free competition and free movement, in this country: for that reason that industrialist must simply be free. In this era in which we live this concept of individual freedom and this idea of freedom border on licence and recklessness. I do not want to say this in respect of industry, but in fact in respect of the individual. Where is the world heading with its exaggerated yearning for freedom. this yearning for individual freedom&#x003F; Apparently one may do whatever one pleases, even if it is the silliest thing conceivable. Surely the greatest freedom, by all the rules we know, lies within the law&#x2014;there we have the greatest freedom. If we allowed this situation, it would simply become impossible.</p>

<p>Now I want to say at once that the factors which are usually taken into consideration in planning such an industry, namely raw materials, a market, water, labour, capital, transport, etc., are generally known. But there is one factor of location which the United Party loses sight of altogether in its opposition to this measure, and which I think industry is losing sight of altogether. It is an extremely important factor in the location of industries. I am referring to the factor of security and stability with a view to the future. If there were no control, if the Bantu could move freely to the urban areas, if the industries in the cities could expand as they please, no matter what congestion it caused, it does not demand a great deal of intelligence to realize and to accept that concomitant with that influx there would be progressive development of the Bantu population in that area. Their standard of living will increase; their educational facilities will be such that in course of time they will attain a higher standard of living. And in course of time they will begin to make demands because they will refuse to reconcile themselves to the prevailing circumstances. I say that they will begin to make demands, and not only economic demands but also political demands. They will be justified in making those demands if they can gain permanence in those areas&#x2014;and the world will help them to make those demands. This could have only one final result. It will jeopardize the White&#x2019;s position and the stability that has prevailed through the years, to the detriment of the country, to the detriment of civilization and to the detriment of the industrialist. His entire investment will suffer the same fate as that which we have seen in so many African states to the north of us. Our industrialists are losing sight of that factor in location if they fight this legislation. If we bear that factor in mind, I say that security is more important, and the guarantee of stability is more important, than all these other factors. It would be folly to do anything of that kind. As I have said, the attitude of the National Party is: We want to locate the right industry in the right place; we want points of growth everywhere, and we want matters to develop in this way. The National Party wants industry not only to serve itself selfishly, but also to serve the country like any good taxpayer and loyal South African. That is the task we expect of industry. We must choose to-day. We must choose whether we should allow industries to go where they please, spurred on purely by the motive of money and profit, with the result that the nation and civilization are undermined, or whether we should choose that industry be guided to act wisely for the benefit and security of everybody, and also for their own benefit.</p>

<p><span class="col_6929-6930" refersTo="page_0726"/>On a previous occasion&#x2014;it was a rather informal and social occasion and for that reason I am not going to mention the name of the hon. member&#x2014;a fairly senior member of the Opposition said, &#x201C;Well, let us be merry&#x2014;we are the last of the aristocrats.&#x201D; It was said in a convivial moment, and for decency&#x2019;s sake I am therefore not going to mention the name of the hon. member. That is the attitude; we are the last of the aristocrats, afterwards the blacks will take over, or it will all be gone. That is why the attitude and the train of thinking of that Party are entirely fatalistic. Their attitude is: We are the last generation to live in this way&#x2014;after us everything will be gone anyway; let us therefore enjoy it; let us enjoy life; why should we try to solve difficult problems; why should we try to unravel difficult problems&#x003F; Why should we face problems and seek solutions to difficult situations&#x003F; Their attitude is: Let us take the line of least resistance. Surely that is the easiest. Meanwhile we enjoy life. As for the generation that follows us, it is a pity, but the factor of time and the era have decreed that we should be the last of the aristocracy to live in this way.</p>

<p>If the Opposition persists in adopting this attitude, the following generations will never forgive them for what they are now doing. I do not want to lecture to the industrialists, but I do want to tell them this. It appears to me as though the approach of the industrialists should simply be the following: When an industrialist has to decide where to locate his industry, he considers his location factors. Now I simply want to say that in these areas which will be reserved by the Minister in terms of this legislation, there will simply be no Bantu labour available to industry. Those who are in fact there are there only temporarily and will in due course be removed to their homelands. There is therefore no more labour available, and why would an industrialist be so foolish as to establish an industry where Bantu labour is not available if he needs it&#x003F; If no water had been available, surely the industrialist would not have considered locating his industry there. Now this measure tells the industrialist that in certain areas no Bantu labour will be available to him. It would therefore be foolish of him to go and establish his industry there.</p>

<p>I remember very well that quite a few years ago&#x2014;at the time I was a fairly junior member of this hon. House&#x2014;Mr. Robinson, at present Sir Albert Robinson, was appointed High Commissioner of the Central African Federation in London. On his way he paid us a visit because he had previously been M.P. for Langlaagte. He addressed us in the old caucus room of the Government Party. On that occasion he defended the policy of his Party in Rhodesia&#x2014;at the time Sir Roy Welensky was Prime Minister. I do not want to tread on Rhodesia&#x2019;s toes now; I shall not go into that. What he said I just want to relate briefly to the specific legislation before the House at the moment. He explained to us the policy of &#x201C;partnership&#x201D;, etc., and amongst other things he said that in order to generate points of growth and to make the country develop as rapidly as possible in the economic field, they were doing everything in their ability to bring the Bantu from the reserves to the urban areas. He said that they were encouraged to take up training there as labourers, etc., in order that their economy might develop at a tremendously rapid rate. On that occasion the M.P.s were all sitting together, and I remember very well that the hon. member for Kensington, who spoke just before me, was sitting right in front of me. Me immediately brought that to the attention of the hon. member who was sitting next to him, and said that in Rhodesia they were making special attempts to draw the Bantu workers from the reserves to the cities, whereas in South Africa we apply influx control in an attempt to keep our Bantu from the cities. Under the circumstances nobody is trying to level reproaches. But I think we should learn a lesson from what happened there, without leveling reproaches in any way. Let us just learn the lesson and realize that to draw the Bantu to the white cities will merely have the result that they will make demands, demands which will not stop at economic demands or housing.</p>

<p>We are always hearing from the Opposition that economic laws can never bend. They say economic laws are inflexible&#x2014;they simply transcend everything, and must be obeyed. According to them an economic law is invariable. I quoted a certain instance here on a previous occasion, and I want to quote it again because I think it is apposite. In our history there were two occasions on which certain factors proved conclusive, in one the economic laws were the decisive factor, and in the other practical politics was decisive. The results were widely different, and the result of the application of practical politics was the favourable and advantageous one. Let me illustrate what I mean.</p>

<p>In 1860 the sugar farmers in Natal complained to the then colonial government in Natal that they could not get workers. The Zulu were not willing to work in the sugar cane plantations. Economic laws demanded that they should have labour, and they then insisted on Indian labour from India. Economic laws prevailed, because the Government yielded and Indians were imported in large numbers, without any control, to come and work in the sugar cane plantations of Natal. As a result of that we are facing the situation to-day that the Zulu are working on the plantations while the Indians are one of our problems. In that case economic laws prevailed. I now quote another example. In 1906, shortly after the three years&#x2019; war, the Chamber of Mines complained that they could not get labourers for the gold-mines, and they demanded that Chinese be imported to come and work in the mines. Chinese were imported into South Africa on a large scale, and the gold mines continued operating with Chinese labour. <span class="col_6931-6932" refersTo="page_0727"/>But practical politics simply demanded that we did not want those people here, and the reaction on the part of the people was such that they did not want Chinese here. General Botha, as Prime Minister of the Transvaal in those days, i.e. 1906, 1907, had the courage of his convictions and sent the Chinese back to China. And to-day our gold mines are operating just as well, or even better than ever, and we have no Chinese problem. Here we had an example of economic laws versus practical politics.</p>

<p>What are we doing in this legislation under discussion&#x003F; To me this Bill is one of the small pieces in a large jig-saw puzzle which represents the layout of South Africa&#x2014;it is an important piece, because as soon as that piece has been put into its place, it will be possible to fit in quite a number of other pieces. For that reason I say that this Bill is a very important piece in this jig-saw puzzle.</p>

<p>No, the pieces of their jig-saw puzzle are scattered far and wide. In the Afrikaans language struggle of former years the question was asked at one stage: &#x201C;Is dit ons ernst&#x003F;&#x201D; This gave rise to the clarion call: "Laat dit ons ernst wezen!&#x201D; And then Dr. Malan, the politician, came and said: &#x201C;Dit is ons ernst.&#x201D; As far as politics is concerned the National Party is saying to the United Party and to the whole world&#x2014;to the industrialist and all others&#x2014;that it is a matter of serious concern to us to keep this country white; we are not merely talking&#x2014;we are serious about it, we are going to do it. That is what we are doing in this Bill. We are honest, we are sincere, we mean it, and no matter how difficult it may be, we are going to carry it through. The ultimate objective the National Party has set itself in its policy of separate development is total separation in all fields. That is our ultimate objective.</p>

<p>Let me make this matter very clear On 15th September, 1958 (Hansard, column 3805), the previous Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, put it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ideal of total apartheid gives one something to aim at. We have said clearly &#x2014;Dr. Malan said so, Adv. Strijdom said so, I have said it repeatedly and I shall say it again&#x2014;that the policy of apartheid constantly moves in the direction of ever-increasing separation. The ideal must be total separation in every sphere, but everyone realizes that to-day that is impracticable.</block>

<p>The emphasis is on &#x201C;to-day&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">But everyone realizes also that if one has such a clear and definite aim, then one can test one&#x2019;s daily deeds by that yardstick to see whether one is leading the country towards more and more separation, whether it be within our country, as long as White and non-white are both here, or whether it be territorially to the extent to which one can promote it, even at this stage.</block>

<p>That is the attitude of the National Party, and it is still that to-day. This Bill is measured by that yardstick, namely whether it strives towards ever-increasing separation between the races with a view to future total separation. It has passed this test. In fact, it is even more incisive&#x2014;in this Bill we are already beginning with the territorial separation which is here mentioned as an alternative. The points of growth are being created.</p>

<p>Every generation will have to contribute its share and will have to do its share to promote that ideal. I know that at this stage it is not possible to foresee the entire process. But every generation should do what it can and with due regard to labour, economic and other conditions it should work in that direction. If every generation continues doing its share, there will ultimately be a generation which will be able to cut the final knot and to achieve total separation. But if one generation is too flabby in spirit and too spineless to contribute its share, everything is undone and our people will in future never have an opportunity to cut the knot finally. Once we have pursued this process to its conclusion, to total separation &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; once we have reached the stage where the Bantu will be in his own area and the white in his and where we will be able to manage without the Bantu and the Bantu without us&#x2014;I know hon. members on the opposite side may throw up their hands, but I want to tell them that if one has no ideal one will never get anywhere&#x2014;only then will we as a white nation complete our task as guardian to the ward. Surely the ward does not always remain subservient to the guardian; surely he does not always remain dependent on the guardian. The concept of guardianship means that the ward is trained to the point where he can become free. Otherwise it is not the relationship or a guardian to a ward, but that of a master to a slave. If we carry the concept of guardianship with us, matters have to develop along those lines &#x2014;independence without the danger of self-destruction. That is how far we have to pursue this matter. This legislation will contribute towards that and the Government is moving strongly, positively and purposefully towards securing the survival of the white, despite the slackness of spirit in the United Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down referred to a speech made by the late Dr. Verwoerd in 1958&#x2014;ten years ago. But what the hon. member forgot to mention was that Dr. Verwoerd set a period of 20 years in which he intended to accomplish this &#x201C;magnificent obsession&#x201D; which he had, that this Nationalist Party has. 1978 was the date and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has staked his reputation on that. Well, they have had half of that time already and what have they accomplished&#x003F; The answer is that White South Africa, as they like to call it, is more black than it was then. That is all that they have accomplished. The hon. member for Randfontein spoke about the &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; of the Nationalist Party, mentioned that it had a positive approach and was following a definite role. But, I ask you Sir, has anything more negative than this Bill ever been presented to this House&#x003F; Nothing more negative has ever been presented to this House. It is merely a manifestation of their pathological fear of the Bantu people and until such time as they are prepared to face up to this they will get nowhere in South Africa. They think they can draw a line arbitrarily in South Africa, push the Bantu people to the other side of the line where they will be out of sight and become no longer the responsibility of this Government and then we need worry about them no longer. As I have said, this is the most negative approach we have ever had. I want to go further and say that it is no longer responsible&#x2014;this Government is no longer being responsible. If we want an example let us take the example given by the hon. member for Randfontein when he spoke about the industrialist who wanted to expand and everything was approved until such time as he wanted more Bantu labour when it was stopped. Later on in my speech I will comment further on what was said by the hon. member in this connection. I shall also refer to some of the comments made by the hon. the Deputy Minister. But let me say now that this example sums up completely the attitude of this Government towards this Bill. This Bill is not what is written in its title. The hon. member for Randfontein admitted as much; the hon. member for Heilbron admitted it.</p>

The hon. member for Randfontein said this Bill was going to help and assist the Bantu people to progress. Has he read the Bill&#x003F; Did he read clause 13 where the Bantu areas are specifically excluded&#x003F; How is this going to help the progress of the Bantu people&#x003F; I shall refer to that later as well. Of course he displayed the most abysmal ignorance when he referred to the sugar cane lands of Natal. He said that the Indians were introduced to work on the sugar cane lands of Natal because the Zulus would not work there. [Interjections.] I am not disagreeing, Sir. So far I agree, but when the hon. member asked what the position is to-day and says that the Indians are a problem in South Africa and that the Zulus are working in the cane fields &#x2026;</p>

<p>Thank you. The hon. member agrees with me. It is not so. Of course it is not so, and the hon. member for Randfontein should know so. He should know that to get people to work on the sugar fields, we have to import them from outside the country. When we cannot get Pondos to come to Natal to work, we fetch Shangaans from Portuguese East Africa. With regard to the mines and the Chinese the Government is creating other problems. They are creating a problem in regard to the Malawians who are being imported to work in the mines. No, Sir, I am afraid that I cannot accept the arguments of the hon. member for Randfontein.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. member for Queenstown has left. He was here a minute ago. I wanted to take him to task for what he said yesterday about the number of jobs provided in border industries.

I have tried to find out, but nobody can tell me. The hon. member for Queenstown also referred to the fact that for every one person mentioned in certain figures which were quoted, there were two more outside, including one who was the lorry driver.

<block name="quote">In a short space of four years we have kept about 600,000 Bantu in their own homelands who otherwise would have found their way to one or other metropolitan area.</block>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">If this could be achieved in four years, you can just imagine what the position is going to be in another five or ten years.</block>

<p>Little did we know how prophetic that statement was to turn out to be. In November, 1966, we had him again saying:</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has already persuaded industry to accept this policy of border industrial development.</block>

<p>To prove this he went on to say that there were 300,000 Bantu employed in industry and services in these areas and that meant that nearly 1,000,000 people were making a living there and had been kept out of the metropolitan areas. Surely this must indicate a degree of success in regard to their policy. Was the hon. the Deputy Minister not satisfied&#x003F; If he honestly believed that a million people have been kept out in five years, surely this would have been a fantastic achievement&#x003F; Surely he should have been satisfied with the progress if that was correct&#x003F; But now we find that that is not the case. Other statements, too numerous to mention now, have been made by the same hon. gentleman, hon. Ministers and hon. members on the other side. The question is this: If these statements are correct and if such fantastic results have been achieved, if industry has now accepted this policy and if this development is gathering momentum, as hon. members on that side have claimed, why is this Bill necessary now&#x003F; If in only five years a million Bantu are making a living, as is claimed&#x2014;and this has been achieved with voluntary co-operation by industrialists because there was no compulsion at that stage&#x2014; and it is gathering momentum, as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration has claimed, if these fantastic results have been achieved, why is there a necessity now for a Bill to compel industrialists to go to these areas to conform with Nationalist Party ideology&#x003F; Nobody on that side wants to answer this question. It is because the Government knows that notwithstanding the grandiose plans that have been made, it has failed. This policy has failed dismally. The statements which have been made by hon. members on the other side have been made with the sole object of pulling the wool over the eyes of thinking South Africans. It has failed economically and they know it. The hon. the Deputy Minister told us the other day that it costs R6,000 to provide employment for one Bantu in the Witwatersrand area. The figures which I have been able to find, as I told the House the other day, showed that it costs R9,000 to provide employment for one Bantu in the border areas. That is what it has cost the country to date. Accumulatively it has cost over R400 million. The only authoritative statement concerning the number of employed Bantu is 44,600. Anybody can work it out for himself. It is R9,000 for one job.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I resent that. The Minister knows I fought for this development.</p>

<p>I hoped the Bantu would get some concrete benefit from this development, but I was sadly disappointed. Sociologically also the Bantu have got nothing out of it. Ideologically it has also failed, because firstly this border area development has failed to keep apart the separate Bantu nations. It has failed to keep them separate. Bantu of all the so-called nations are gathering at these so-called growth points, and does the Government think they will ever be able to separate them again&#x003F; They will never do it. Secondly, this concept is working in reverse, because most of the workers in the border areas are living in the white urban areas and on Fridays they go home to the white urban areas. That is what is happening. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Thirdly, and this is the biggest failure of all, this Government has failed to sell its ideological concept to the people of South Africa, and particularly to the industrialist. This Bill is the Government&#x2019;s final admission of the failure of its border industry policy, which is based on its apartheid ideology and not on sound economics. This Bill is merely another manifestation, as I said earlier, of how serious the hon. the Minister of Finance was when he made the statement in this House which was repeated just now by the hon. member for Randfontein, that this Government would bend and, if necessary, would break the economy before it would budge one iota from this ideological policy. It is obvious that the Government has failed to draw industries to the border areas by the inducements it has offered. Secondly, it is obvious that the Government has failed to persuade the Bantu voluntarily to remain in their so-called homelands, let alone to return to them, by the development of border industries and the creation of work opportunities there. In other words, it has failed to sell its ideological concept to the people of South Africa and it has failed to make white South Africa more white, as I said before. Now, after all this and because it has failed, it is resorting to compulsory measures to force its ideologies on the industrialists of South Africa and, through them, on the people. [Interjection.] These measures of compulsion which have now been placed before us in this Bill come after statements which have been made such as the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition, the co-operation of the provincial and local authorities is needed in various fields. Finally, the co-operation of the industrialists themselves is of the utmost importance.</block>

<p>Another one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is ample scope for fruitful co-operation between the Government and private enterprise.</block>

<p>And of course there is the one which was quoted earlier: &#x201C;No compulsory measures will be applied to force intending industrialists to establish themselves in border areas.&#x201D; All these statements were made by the late Dr. Verwoerd. He was talking in connection with this policy of the development of border industries. Now there seems to have been a shift from this Verwoerd policy of fruitful cooperation between the Government and private enterprise. He is the one who spoke about fruitful co-operation and no compulsory measures. Sir, I do not know who is to blame for it. I think we will call it a &#x201C;Blaar&#x201D; policy, because after all it was this hon. gentleman who gave us the first intimation of this Bill. Funnily enough, this followed on a radio talk he gave on 28th August last year, in which he said: &#x201C;I am sure this can be done without undue, if any, interference with normal economics and industrial development in these areas.&#x201D; He was referring to the metropolitan areas. [Interjection.] I think we have heard enough evidence in this House during the last two days to doubt what the hon. the Deputy Minister said then. Anyway, after he had made this entirely reasonable statement which everybody accepted, we had the same Deputy Minister saying in this House on 12th October last year in Hansard, Col. 4103, certain things which showed his true colours. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6939-6940" refersTo="page_0731"/>And I go further! Legislation may be necessary to compel them to do that.</block>

<p>He was talking about the industrialists and he continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Legislation may be necessary to enable us to say to certain industries on the Witwatersrand: You are not allowed to establish your industries here; you have too many Bantu in your employment.</block>

<p>Then he went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If an industrialist wants to establish a new industry on the Witwatersrand and tells us that he is going to have 1,000 Bantu and 100 Whites in his employment, we must be in a position to say to him: No, you are not allowed to establish your industry here; you will have to go to Hammarsdale, Pietersburg or to Queenstown. If legislation is necessary for that, then legislation will be introduced, and quite soon, too.</block>

<p>We have the admission we want. I do not think it is worthwhile going any further with this. [Interjection.] As I have indicated from these quotations, here we have the shift from the honeyed word and the talk of co-operation to the wielding of the big stick&#x2014;co-operate or else, and this Bill is the &#x201C;or else&#x201D;. In addition to this compulsion, this Bill removes all provisions for consultation with commerce, with provincial authorities and with local authorities.</p>

<p>The Chambers of Industry and also the Industrial Councils have made it abundantly clear that they oppose any measure of compulsion and any form of licensing, even this so-called permit system which is being introduced by this Minister, and that they resent any intrusion by this Government into the free competitive enterprise system which has pertained in the past. All democratic people will reject this waving of the big stick by the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in his Second Reading speech, referred to legislation in other countries, but other countries offered suitable inducements and not merely the implementation of an ideological policy. That is the only reason why this Bill is being introduced. We have heard that and we are satisfied on that point. But let me say this: Not one of our cities is even a quarter of the size of one of the metropolises overseas to which the hon. the Minister referred. He said that he had the added problem of the Bantu people. But they are not a problem in the economic sphere. That is something this Government must understand; they are not a problem in the economic sphere. As an hon. gentleman said in the Other Place only the other week, &#x201C;we lean too much upon the Bantu.&#x201D; That hon. gentleman is a member of the Government party and I think he hit on the truth when he said that. We are leaning too much upon the Bantu, but this hon. Minister and his followers in this House do not seem to appreciate this. We must accept the Bantu people as part of one integrated economic unit in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, that brings me to clause 13 of this Bill. Clause 13&#x2014;unlucky 13 &#x2014;excludes the Bantu areas from all the provisions of this Bill. Why are the Bantu areas specifically excluded&#x003F; Two questions arise: Firstly, does the development in the Bantu areas not need planning&#x003F; Secondly, is it not planned to develop the Bantu areas&#x003F; Sir, I <span class="col_6941-6942" refersTo="page_0732"/>would like an answer from the hon. the Minister to that question when he replies. What is the intention behind the insertion of clause 13&#x003F; Is it that we do not intend planning and developing the Bantu areas, or is it that that development does not need planning&#x003F; Although it is apparent that the hon. the Deputy Minister was aware of this provision, he still made that statement on the 10th May in East London. [Interjections.] On the same day the hon. the Deputy Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> Moreover, it is our duty to develop the homelands and to provide them with opportunities for employment inside their areas and on their borders.</block>

<p>I call upon the hon. the Deputy Minister now to persuade the hon. the Minister to drop clause 13 of this Bill.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Fine, then I shall leave it at that. I want to tell the hon. member for Kensington that the main reason for our having such a struggle in South Africa at present with this problem of our cities being gradually swamped by the Blacks, is the laxity and neglect on the part of the United Party Government to have implemented influx control properly. At present we are still making up that leeway. Mr. Speaker, this is the tragedy of the time in which we are living: The moment this Government introduces legislation&#x2014;no matter how good it may be, no matter how essential that legislation may be, no matter how conducive it may be to the welfare of our country&#x2014;it is all of a sudden described by the Opposition as ideological legislation if the words &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; or &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; appear in it. Then no arguments, no matter how good they may be, can convince the Opposition; the good qualities of the legislation are ignored, and it is fought tooth and nail by the Opposition. But they do not only fight that legislation; they go even further and they arouse suspicion amongst members of the public outside. They drag in other bodies to fight that legislation along with them. Mr. Speaker, for many years already warnings have been issued against the concentration of industries at a few places in the Republic of South Africa, particularly on the Witwatersrand, in Pretoria, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban. These warnings have not only been issued by the National Party, but even leading economists are warning that the conditions which are developing in those complexes, will become unmanageable later. Over the past few years it has to a certain extent been agreed that this development in the urban complexes is unsound. This problem is not only found here in the Republic of South Africa; it is a problem that is even being experienced in England. In England, where they have the system of free enterprise, the authorities avail themselves of legislative powers to effect the decentralization of industries. However, there is one aspect which is peculiar to South Africa, namely that owing to the composition of our population we in South Africa have an extraordinary problem. In the Republic of South Africa we have four ethnic groups. We have the White ethnic group, the Coloured ethnic group, the Bantu ethnic group <span class="col_6943-6944" refersTo="page_0733"/>and the Indian ethnic group, and because of the composition of our various ethnic groups our industrial problems are of a more serious nature. It is in fact the National Party that has created prosperity in the Republic of South Africa. The National Party is responsible for the development of this industrial giant. The National Party is the one that came with the policy of &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. The National Party was the one that started processing our raw materials here in the Republic. The hon. member for Yeoville will remember very well how, in the olden days, our raw materials were shipped, one after the other, to Mother England to be processed there. After that the manufactured articles were shipped back to South Africa in huge crates adorned with the Union Jacks the words &#x201C;Buy British&#x201D;. However, those days belong to the past now, and the United Party is supporting the National Party as far as that is concerned. Those days belong to the past. Is the local processing of the raw materials of our own soil not something that was accomplished by this Government&#x003F; Is it not this Government that introduced sound, effective industrial legislation based on job reservation amongst the various ethnic groups&#x003F; This gave rise to industrial peace, racial peace and a country free from strikes. At present this industrial giant of ours is being housed on only 3 per cent of our country&#x2019;s surface area. The fact of the matter is that 80 per cent of the gross production of the private secondary industry is being produced at present on this 3 per cent of our surface area. One of the consequences of this concentration of industries in this small area, is a concentration of the population which implies serious problems and high costs, both for the communities concerned and for the individual. One of the problems which is being created within the metropolitan area, is that of providing the four different ethnic groups in the Republic of South Africa with proper housing. In the years immediately after the Second World War we saw how high the price was the country had to pay for an unhampered influx of people in the form of an enormous housing problem and social evils. The preventive measures that were taken at that time benefited the whole country, also the Bantu and the other ethnic groups in our country. Those bad old days are past, but the danger exists that South Africa will have to pay another high price if its industrialists do not co-operate more enthusiastically in locating their factories in such a way that the industrial pattern is better adjusted to the population pattern.</p>

<p>It has become necessary to-day to bring a group of Bantu from the Transkei so that they may work in the major cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town and others. It may be that this has more immediate advantages than proceeding in a different way. But in the long run the country may benefit much more if that factory which needed those extra Bantu, had moved closer to the Bantu homeland. We must not underestimate the dangers of this desire to enjoy temporary advantages only.</p>

<p>Amongst our industrialists in particular there is the belief that Bantu labour is cheap. That is an impression that has become established very firmly to-day. That is why it is difficult to deny that Bantu labour is cheap. Nevertheless, South Africa should long ago have learnt the lesson that this labour, when it is in the form of a flow of Bantu to our existing cities, is in <span class="col_6945-6946" refersTo="page_0734"/>actual fact expensive labour, particularly if we consider its social and political consequences. To-day it has almost become the fashion amongst all our industrialists that a factory is not a factory in name unless it has been established within the urban complex or within the metropolitan area. We also find this in our Public Service, and I am vehemently opposed to this outlook. Every Government Department feels that it should establish itself in Pretoria. Unfortunately it is the case to-day that a Government Department does not consider itself to be a full-fledged Government Department&#x2014;and public servants do not consider themselves to be full-blooded public servants&#x2014;unless the Department has established itself in the heart of Pretoria. The same outlook prevails amongst our industrialists. They feel that if they cannot establish themselves in Johannesburg, Cape Town or Durban, they no longer count. They think that all the other places&#x2014;be they border areas, be they smaller cities or towns&#x2014;are of no importance. The time has now arrived for this expensive fashion which the industrialists and the city councils are so fond of following, namely simply to want to accommodate any sort ot factory within the metropolitan complex, to be extirpated root and branch. That fashion must really be stamped out.</p>

<p>If we look back at the past period, we find that our present Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has been trying, also in the days when he was the Deputy Minister, on a voluntary basis with the various local authorities, to establish the right industries within specific metropolitan areas. He has been doing everything in his power to have the right industries establish themselves at the right places. To-day I want to express my thanks and appreciation to all those local authorities that have been co-operating in trying to achieve this ultimate object of ours, namely reducing the number of Bantu within the urban complexes. But even where that cooperation existed, the Western Cape was the area which took the lead in realizing this great danger of being swamped by the Blacks. Several years ago the Western Cape started on a voluntary basis to remove the Bantu from its own area. Since the Western Cape has taken the lead, it is imperative at present for the North, where that black stream is flowing with much more force, not to lag behind. In view of the fact that here in the Western Cape a beginning has been made in removing the Bantu, we felt this is a very formidable problem and that we should think about this matter soberly, and that is why plans should be drawn up and that is why everybody&#x2019;s cooperation is essential in this field. If I call to mind the speeches that were made in this House when the mines on the East and West Rand were closed down, and if I call to mind the speeches the ex-member for Springs and the ex-member for Benoni made here when they accused this side of the House of creating ghost towns on the East Rand and the West Rand by establishing industries in the border areas, then I want to know what has happened to those members. The electorate lost confidence in them. They are no longer here today. Only their ghosts are still haunting this House.</p>

<p>Did ghost towns develop on the East and West Rand&#x003F; Is it not this very Government that helped those city councils with the development of industries in that area&#x003F; Was it not this very Minister who allocated industrial land to certain town councils so as to help them to expand further&#x003F; The National Government is the Government that established those towns. But if we look to-day at the way the urban complexes are being swamped by Blacks, and at the report that was submitted to the City Council of Johannesburg, then we find this. The report deals with the Bantu population and its housing and other Bantu needs, and it recommends&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That an additional Bantu township of at least six square miles in extent should be provided in order to keep pace with the natural increase within the complex of the Johannesburg City Council.</block>

<p>Further on they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although influx control has contributed a great deal to stabilizing the urban Bantu population, it is estimated that from 1960 to 1965 a total of an additional 50,000 new arrivals have settled in the metropolitan area.</block>

<p>It goes further by saying that urgent representations are to be made to the authorities for an inquiry to be made into the provision of additional transport facilities for passengers between Soweto and Johannesburg, and for a start to be made as soon as possible with the construction of a main connecting road between Soweto and Johannesburg.</p>

<p>We do not want to close it up. That is not our intention. Listen to my speech. If we look at that report, we find that more than half a million Bantu have been housed in that complex this year. In 1980 there will be 794,620. Do these hon. members realize what it means for 50,000 new Bantu from the Bantu homelands to house themselves in these enormous metropolitan areas&#x003F; Do they realize what tremendous <span class="col_6947-6948" refersTo="page_0735"/>adaptability those people have to evince in coming to this large area&#x003F; Do they realize how those people must feel when they come from their homelands to work in these large areas, to do work of which they have had no previous experience&#x003F; Is it therefore not of much greater value to take these factories to them&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member for Hillbrow a question, because he has knowledge of mines. Has he ever stood still and looked when those thousands of Bantu who are perfect strangers get off at those mining compounds&#x003F; Has he seen that fear and that terror in their eyes&#x003F; Does he realize what it means to them to come and work there as complete strangers&#x003F; Those hon. members are laughing about it. They know how a white person feels when he takes up employment at a strange place. If we look at Johannesburg and the development that has taken place there, then I want to ask any member here this afternoon whether it is to the advantage of the Republic of South Africa that Johannesburg should become bigger and bigger and that it should become blacker. Then we may talk about a black danger. I want to ask hon. members this afternoon how we may extend road communications or introduce more train services to Soweto. What are we going to do with that whole complex within Johannesburg&#x003F; To-day it takes an invalid in a wheel-chair less time to travel down Eloff Street than it does an industrialist in a large, black American car. An invalid can do so much faster. Do hon. members of the Opposition realize that we want to bring relief to this large complex&#x003F; Do they realize what major problems are being created there&#x003F; Since we are discussing physical planning to-day, I want to ask whether the industrialist has ever thought of contributing his share. I want to ask hon. members on the other side whether they know that in the Witwatersrand complex there is one factory which employs more than 4,000 male Bantu.</p>

<p>We are not ashamed of that. We shall help them if the raw materials are there. Hon. members need not become excited now. I know the policy of the National Party. I want to ask those hon. members a question. What would the purchasing power of that area have been if that industry had been established there&#x003F; How happily would those families not have lived together! But what does the industrialist do&#x003F; Has he ever given a thought to changing his working hours&#x003F; It has become the fashion amongst all of us that every factory should start at 7 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, come winter or summer. The Railways must see to it that those people arrive at a certain place at 7 o&#x2019;clock. Have we ever given thought to staggering the working hours a little so that some start at 5 o&#x2019;clock, some at 6 o&#x2019;clock and others at 7 o&#x2019;clock&#x003F; Why must a worker rise at 5 o&#x2019;clock on a winter morning to go to work&#x003F; What is his productivity on such a winter morning&#x003F; Nothing. [Interjections.] Do not ask Ben. Ask the industrialists. Why should he have to do that&#x003F; Why can the industrialists not accommodate us as far as that is concerned&#x003F; I want to go further. Why can our educational bodies not accommodate us either&#x003F; Why should the local authorities have to see to it that all the children arrive at all the schools at a given time&#x003F; I want to put forward this suggestion to the industrialists. I want to say that we should make better use of our hours in the summer. We must work longer in the summer months. In winter we must work shorter hours. In that way fewer man hours will go to waste. In this way this hon. Minister tried to set about these matters on a voluntary basis. He was very successful, but the problem is much more serious than the man in the street realizes. Now the Government has introduced this measure. This legislation will still be described in the future as the legislation of the century. It also brings assistance to the under-developed areas. It brings prosperity to both the Bantu and the Whites. It will bring prosperity to those remote places. [Interjections.] Do you know what, Sir&#x003F; At the next elections our majorities will be greater and greater. The majorities of the Opposition will shrink and shrink until nothing remains. I want to say that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) will be defeated. [Interjections.] The hon. member for East London (City) will also be gone. This legislation will also eliminate the bottle-necks in our urban complexes. This legislation will enhance the productivity of every factory. The hon. member for Hillbrow must pay attention. The old belief that Bantu labour is cheap, now belongs to the past. Now proper deliberations will take place as to whether another Bantu should be employed and whether something else should be tried instead, because now every industrialist will have to obtain permission before he may employ an additional Bantu. Then the matter will be investigated properly. Those old <i>laissez-faire</i> ideas will vanish into thin air. Proper investigation will be carried out as to whether that additional Bantu is necessary. In that way we shall enhance the productivity in every factory in the Republic of South Africa.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the hon. member for Brakpan for having put one of the issues in this Bill before us so clearly. He made the statement during the course of his remarks that Johannesburg was too black and that we should stop it from becoming blacker. I want to submit that <span class="col_6949-6950" refersTo="page_0736"/>Johannesburg proportionately is one of the whitest places in the whole of South Africa, figuratively and literally. It is one of the few spots in South Africa where the Whites are holding their own and more than holding their own in relation to the black people. I shall devote some time to try to establish that in the minds of hon. members like the hon. member for Brakpan. The difficulty is that, having listened to this debate and having read the speeches I could not hear myself, I am astounded at the confusion of thought in the minds of the apologists for the Bill. I was for example interested to listen to the hon. member for Randfontein, who made out that this is really a segregation measure, that it is a major measure on the way to &#x201C;totale apartheid&#x201D;, to the achievement of the ideal of total separation in South Africa. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration of course believes that we have one integral economy in South Africa for all the races. He even pulls independent states into that integral economy, but the hon. member for Randfontein will persist, in spite of the contrary statements of the Deputy Minister, that the ideal is total apartheid, including, if it is total, economic apartheid or economic separation. It must be so, because all of us who have been in this House for a while can remember the eloquence we had from hon. members on the opposite side in trying to establish that economic segregation is vitally necessary for the future. I can remember the eloquence with which the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party used to tell us that if we have economic integration to-day, the next step inevitably must be biological integration, with all the bloody undertones of that suggestion. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, who at the time was a member of our party, will remember that that is the philosophy of the party to which he now belongs, namely that economic integration must lead to complete integration, including biological integration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course he. knew it was nonsense when he was with us, and he has not unlearnt it yet. If he wants to be a good Nationalist he will have to remember that economic integration is the precursor of biological integration. I am not trying to cross-examine hon. members. They can answer me at their leisure, but I want to pose this question generally: Where does this measure do what the hon. member for Randfontein and so many other speakers from the other side have claimed&#x003F; Where does it advance economic segregation&#x003F; To my mind that is the cardinal question. If it is the Government&#x2019;s policy and the Governments belief that they must have greater and greater separation of the races, then border industry does not advance that policy; for the immediate visible consequence of border industrial development is that one establishes factories with white capital, white skill, white enterprise on the white mans side of the border of the reserve, but one has to draw ones labour from the other side, from the black mans part of South Africa, to come and work in the factory. We shall have the same economic integration at Pietermaritzburg or Rosslyn or Queenstown or King William&#x2019;s Town or East London, as we have to-day in Johannesburg or in Port Elizabeth or, to a smaller extent, in Cape Town. I cannot see how it advances in any immediate sense of the word the ideal of total apartheid: It shifts the geographic location of economic integration and that is all. It shifts it to an area fraught with greater danger for the peaceful development of South Africa than Johannesburg or the other existing cities of South Africa, as I shall show.</p>

<p>What is it that the Government wants to achieve&#x003F; Is it greater segregation&#x003F; Is it a forward march on the road to total apartheid as has been suggested, or is it purely negative, namely that they want to reduce the growth of a city like Johannesburg, in view of the fact that that growth depends to some extent upon black labour&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration as long ago as 1962, when he was Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, made it perfectly clear that that was the purpose, namely to achieve a more favourable ratio of White to Black in the present white areas of South Africa. For example, he spoke to the 11th Annual Congress of* the Institute of Administrators of Non-European Affairs of South Africa at Mossel Bay on 28th August, 1962, and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The calculation of these index ratios for all industries in certain areas is equally enlightening. It has just been said that the index for all industries in South Africa is one White to 2.2 Bantu. Compare with this the position in the following areas. Transvaal as a whole, 1 to 2.3.</block>

<p>Then he went on to give other examples, and then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You will agree with me. I am sure, when I say that it should be endeavoured to have industries with labour ratios which are smaller than the aggregate ratio of 1 to 2.2 for the country as a whole, located in the white areas not being border industry areas. The ratio of 1 to 1.5 has been mentioned, but a lower ratio would be even better.</block>

<p>That is very interesting. But now, what is the position&#x003F; Let us accept that as the ideal. The ideal should be to establish a ratio of 1 to 1.5, White to Black in the industrial areas, and if possible, we should improve upon that ratio. What is the factual position to-day&#x003F; If you look at South Africa, there are very few areas where that ratio is achieved, but Johannesburg is one of them. I have here statistics compiled at the time we celebrated the Golden <span class="col_6951-6952" refersTo="page_0737"/>Jubilee of our Union. It is the only statistics where I could find the figures presented in this form, and these figures are very interesting. We find that in 1960&#x2014;and the ratios could not have worsened since then&#x2014;the position for the whole of the Witwatersrand of economically active and non-active Whites and non-Whites was that there were 1,018,086 Whites and 1,567,093 Bantu. That is a ratio of just under 1.5. Show me another part of South Africa where you have a ratio so favourable to the Whites. For every 100 Bantu in that area, there were 64.9 Whites. If you look at industry, if you look at the economically employed in that area, it is even more interesting. In Johannesburg, in the manufacturing industry, we then had 41,944 Whites and only 53,231 Bantu. On the whole of the Witwatersrand, for all industries, you had 98,012 Whites employed as compared with 253,113 Blacks. But it is the manufacturing industry against which this Bill is directed! [Interjections.] I want to return to Johannesburg for a moment. You will find, Sir, that in agriculture&#x2014;there is some agriculture round about Johannesburg&#x2014;there are 945 Whites employed and 5,049 Blacks, a ratio of almost 1 to 5. In mining and quarrying, which is of course a &#x201C;plekgebonde&#x201D; industry, you have 4,889 Whites to 33,000 Blacks. In industry I have given the figures, 41,944 Whites and 53,231 Blacks. In construction you have 10,998 Whites to 16,438 Bantu. In transport and communication there are 12,851 Whites to 8,721 Blacks. Then you come to public utilities, which must exist in any case, and in electricity, gas and water you find 2,080 Whites and 4,929 Blacks. Finally, we come to something which is very interesting. It is called &#x201C;Government, etc.&#x201D;. I have tried to find out what the &#x201C;etc.&#x201D; is and I find it is local authorities and domestic employees. There we have 40,963 Whites as against 130,098 Blacks. The point is that if you want to reduce the ratio of White to Black workers, employees in secondary industry, with which this Bill deals chiefly, to a ratio of 1 to 1, which surely is the ideal, you only have to remove 11,000 black workers from all the secondary industries of Johannesburg to get a ratio of 1 to 1. But you will not have affected the ratio as a whole in any material sense at all. What you will have done is to create a greater demand for black labour because those 11,000 Blacks will probably be replaced by Whites and you have created a greater demand for Government services and domestic services. What have you solved&#x003F; I want to suggest that the Government has not done its homework in making this attack upon the industries in our cities.</p>

<p>I want to take it a little bit further. I want to emphasize that the undertakings, the form of enterprise in our cities where the ratio of Black to White is most favourable to the white man and most closely approximates the ideal the Government sets itself, is in the manufacturing industry. Now the Government wants to break down this ratio. It wants to force these industries, which keep our cities proportionately whiter than any other area of South Africa, to the preponderantly black areas on the borders of the reserves. I want to illustrate my argument further by asking the Minister to have a look at the position in the Transvaal, and I want to quote an authority, the only authority who demographically has analyzed the situation in one of our provinces, and fortunately for the purposes of this discussion, the key province, the Transvaal. I want to refer to Dr. J. M. Scheepers, who a year or two ago presented a thesis for his doctorate at the University of South Africa entitled <i>Die Bevolkingsverbreiding van Transvaal, &#x2019;n Korrelatiewe Kartografies-geografiese Analise van die Mens-landverhouding.</i> If you read this thoroughly authenticated and substantiated document, which should be compulsory reading for every Member of Parliament, and certainly for the members of the Cabinet, you find that you cannot escape this conclusion, that the Transvaal is predominantly a black province, one of the blackest of the four provinces. But the industrial towns I am speaking of are proportionately the whiter parts of the Transvaal. And, if one adopts the criteria of the Government, they are the healthiest areas of the Transvaal. Let me read what Dr. Scheepers has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die Transvaal woon meer as 6.1 miljoen blankes en Bantoes tesame, maar met &#x2019;n eensydige oorwig ten gunste van die Bantoe, soos deurgaans uit die vorige hoof-stuk geblyk het, en waarby &#x2019;n gemiddelde ratio van 31.69 blankes vir elke 100 Bantoes bestaan. Op die platteland is die ratio veel kleiner, naamlik 9.20 (blankes vir elke 100 Bantoes), maar in die stedelike of kern-nedersettings is dit meer in die guns van die blanke, naamlik 62.46, maar nog ver van die getalle-ewewig op &#x2019;n ratio van 100.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Planimetriese ontleding van die kaart toon dat 16.06 persent van die oppervlakte van Transvaal heeltemal swart is; geen enkele landelike gebied &#x2026;</block>

<p>But that is not Johannesburg. [Interjection.] Yes, I concede that if 16.06 per cent of the Transvaal is pitch black, it is Nat as well. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Geen enkele landelike gebied kan as wit bestempel word nie en by slegs &#x2019;n karige .09 persent van die oppervlakte is die blanke in die meerderheid.</block>

<p>Further I should like to read this to you, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is duidelik dat die sones (die witste dele) beperk is tot omstedelike gebiede&#x2014; vergelyk die gebied was van Vanderbijlpark tussen Vereeniging, Johannesburg, Krugers-dorp, Carletonville, rondom Pretoria, Pietersburg, Groblersdal, Ellisras, Brits, Magaliesberg en Bloemhof.</block>

<p><span class="col_6953-6954" refersTo="page_0738"/>Those are the white areas of the Transvaal, and not one of them is to be a border area under the policy of the Government. I now want to find out what the Government wishes to achieve.</p>

<p>It is an entirely true argument. It is an argument based on facts. We on this side of the House are concerned with facts, and hon. members opposite are concerned with pipedreams. That is the great difference between us. The point I want to make is this, that according to all authorities who examined this situation, the best prospects for peace and peaceful co-existence&#x2014;and we have to co-exist in this country whether we like to or not&#x2014;exist in the urban areas because in those areas, the industrial areas, you have people, Black and White, who have a common purpose. They work in common factories and they form a common urban community and their interests are interrelated and interdependent. They have a common allegiance. They are subjects of a common State and they are obedient to the laws of a common Government. To some extent they have a common interest in maintaining law and order. But what is the position where you have the juxtaposition of black areas developing on separate lines in a separate direction to a separate destiny, next to white areas which are developing again towards a separate destiny of their own, and with no common purpose or common interest and no common allegiance, because if the Government and the hon. member for Randfontein have their way, soon there will be no common allegiance between the black workers in the border industries and the black owners or managers of those industries on the white side of the reserves, and there will be no common interest in maintaining law and order in the same community. Here I again want to quote from Dr. Scheepers, who has made a close study of the matter, based upon the facts. I have no reason to believe that Dr. Scheepers is a supporter of the United Party. I only have reason to believe that he is an independent scientist who has made a study of this situation. Here are his conclusions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die laaste en sonder twyfel die interessantste maar ook die ontstellendste situasie wat deur die kaart geopenbaar word, is duidelike patrone van opeenhoping van isoratio&#x2019;s.

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Louis Trichardt, Groblersdal en Wit-rivier-Nelspruit.</block>

<p>Another border industrial area. Sir, what the Government is doing is that they want to take draconian powers to compel South African industries to move away from relatively safe areas where you have a healthy ratio of white and black inhabitants to areas where the potential of friction is greatest. But, Sir, that is not all. I want hon. members, especially those hon. members who represent workers in this House, to consider what the consequences of this may be to the standard of living of the white workers in South Africa. When we discussed the Labour Vote I took the opportunity of speaking at length, for half an hour, on the danger of making low wages a major inducement to attract industries to the borders of the reserves. I do not want to repeat that; I want to develop another thought in the few minutes left to me. The trade union leaders of this country are concerned that an ever-increasing proportion of the workers of South Africa, because of our labour laws and labour conventions in this country, are not part of the collective bargaining machinery of South Africa. They are unorganized, and this reduces the bargaining powers of the trade unions <i>vis-a-vis</i> their employers. It is theoretically possible, if the border industries develop, where industrial council agreements are not applicable, where job reservation is not applicable, where the conventional colour bar is not applicable, that so many jobs and types of jobs will be done by black people from the reserves that the employers will be powerful enough as a result to ignore the representations of the white trade unions because they will not be representative in any way of the employees of that area. Sir. I say that this is a grave danger to the standards of living of the white workers of this country, and to the bargaining powers of the trade unions of South Africa, upon whom firstly the standard of living of the workers depends and secondly the success of the principle of collective bargaining <span class="col_6955-6956" refersTo="page_0739"/>as applied in South Africa. The more I look at this policy, the more convinced I am that it is a policy conceived in folly.</p>

<p>If I could misquote Milton and apply it to this policy I would say &#x201C;thy brood of folly in ignorance bred&#x201D;. It is quite clear that this problem has not been studied and that its consequences have not been studied. If the idea is total apartheid, in every sphere, as my hon. friend the likeable member for Randfontein says, then I assume that we revive the theory that in time these areas will become politically sovereign. Sir, has the Government considered what the consequences for South Africa will be if our major industries are compelled to establish themselves on the white man&#x2019;s side of the reserves and the labour comes from the black man&#x2019;s side of the reserves, from sovereign independent countries. Are they going to stop those independent countries from having trade unions operating in the white-owned factories on the other side of the borders of the reserves&#x003F; How do hon. members opposite think the Governments will react in cases of industrial disputes&#x003F; Will the white Government go against its own white citizens who own and manage those factories&#x003F; Will the black Governments go against their own black citizens who work in those factories and who are involved in that dispute&#x003F; Or will every industrial dispute threaten to become an international dispute which may end heaven knows where&#x003F; [Laughter.]</p>

<p>No, Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education must not laugh. [Interjection.] Yes, he can laugh as much as he likes but I challenge him to get up and to say to me that it is not the policy of this Government to draw the labour for these white factories from the black areas of South Africa. He must tell me that it is not the policy of this Government to permit those areas to develop to full sovereign independence, if they so wish, and. thirdly, he must deny that this Government intends to support its own subjects in disputes. Let him stand up and tell me where I am wrong.</p>

<p>Sir, probably hundreds of thousands of visitors work here. The hon. the Deputy Minister, after having made grandiose announcements about dumping the black workers from Cape Town and the Peninsula back into the Transkei, has already had the embarrassment of being rebuked by the Prime Minister of the Transkei, which is not a sovereign independent country, when he protested against this announcement and said: &#x201C;What must I do with these people when they arrive here&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. the Deputy Minister was embarrassed and he had to soft-pedal. I can imagine what the situation would be if the Transkei were an independent sovereign state. They will simply refuse to accept these workers. He asked me a few moments ago whether any difficulties had arisen because of his policy. Sir, the Transkei is not even an independent state yet and difficulties have already arisen.

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that Kaiser Matanzima put the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education in his place. He has been much more modest and much less frivolous in his approach to this problem ever since then. They are now talking about what will happen to these black workers when they are sent back to the reserves. But, Sir, there is a simple challenge to the Government. If they believe in total apartheid as an ideal, then they should advance it. You do not advance total apartheid as an ideal by trying economically to integrate whole reserves with the economy of the white man through industrial development on the white man&#x2019;s side of those reserves, in close proximity to the reserves. If you want to advance total apartheid, then you will use all the resources of the South African State, if you really meant it. Where are these young people in the Cabinet who are so determined&#x003F; If they are so determined, why do they not do everything in their power and employ the resources of the South African State to further total apartheid by encouraging development inside the reserves&#x003F; Why do they not abandon this self-centred, selfish attitude of theirs that in order to change the ratio of population in the cities, to the advantage of the white man they must establish industries not in the black man&#x2019;s reserves, but in the white man&#x2019;s territory, using the labour of the black man from the reserves&#x003F; Sir, that is the policy of the Government. I accuse the Government of insincerity; I accuse them of frivolity; I accuse them of superficiality; I accuse them of utter shallowness in their approach to these problems.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member for Yeoville used more or less the same arguments the hon. member for Hill-brow used yesterday, only the hon. member for Yeoville made much more use of gestures than the hon. member for Hillbrow did. The hon. member for Yeoville was much more melodramatic than the hon. member for Hill-brow, but basically their arguments were the same. They claim that this legislation and the application thereof are an illogical step, because it is applied to secondary industry but not to agriculture and mining, and then they quote us figures to prove that the ratio of Bantu workers to white workers in the Vaal triangle and in the cities, is better than the ratio in the rural areas. I agree whole-heartedly that if we merely looked at the figures as they were in the year 1960, we would find that in the smaller country towns, in the servicing activities and in factories, the ratio of Bantu <span class="col_6957-6958" refersTo="page_0740"/>workers to white workers was 220 to 100, whereas the ratio in the 14 major industrial areas in South Africa was 183 to 100. But if we compare the employment figure in the mining industry with the employment figure in the manufacturing industry, we find that the ratio of Bantu workers to white workers in the mining industry is two to five times higher than the ratio in the manufacturing industry. But, Mr. Speaker, all these arguments and figures do not impress me. If we look at the development that is going to take place in the future, and if we look at the nature of these various industries&#x2014;the primary sector (the agricultural, fishing and mining industries) on the one hand, and secondary industries on the other hand&#x2014;then the first characteristic that strikes us is the fact that one&#x2019;s primary industries&#x2014;among which I include mining&#x2014;are location-orientated industries as against the manufacturing industry which is not necessarily location-orientated. It stands to reason that these location-orientated industries, such as mining and agriculture, cannot so easily be expected to get rid of their Bantu labour or to move to another area. If we look at agriculture, we find that mechanization can only progress up to a certain point, whereas the manufacturing industry is pre-eminently the field of production where mechanization and automation may be applied on a much larger scale than has been the case so far. I also want to point out that if we look at the development that will take place in the future and at what the trend was in the past, we find that there has been a consistent downward trend in the contribution made by mining and agriculture to the gross domestic product in South Africa. The percentage contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product in 1960 was 12.3 per cent, whereas it was estimated at 9.4 per cent in 1966. The contribution of mining to the gross domestic product in 1960 was 13.8 per cent, whereas it was estimated at only 12.5 per cent in 1966. As against that the contribution made by the manufacturing industry increased from 18.5 per cent in 1960 to 21.9 per cent in 1966. We must accept that the greatest contribution to the total domestic product&#x2014; which is now being estimated at approximately R7.6 billion for 1966, and which, at current prices, will amount to R44 billion in the year 2000&#x2014;will be made by the manufacturing industry. If we want to lessen the hold Bantu labour has on the white homeland for the sake of the demographic situation in South Africa in the future, then it is to my mind a logical step for us to turn to the manufacturing industry in the first place.</p>

<p>Having listened to the debate conducted on this Bill over the past few days, one is struck by the fact that a measure such as this one in fact clearly shows up the differences in outlook between the National Party and the United Party. This debate has given us a clear indication of the picture that the National Party holds up to South Africa in the future and of the picture that the United Party holds up to South Africa in the future. Through the mouth of its speakers in this debate, the United Party has made it clear to us that what it sees in South Africa, is one large Bantu population of 12.5 million, and that that 12.5 million Bantu must look to the whole of South Africa for their contribution to the total national economy; that they (the United Party) see the whole of South Africa as the national homeland of the Bantu as well. I am making this statement mainly on the strength of three arguments that were used by Opposition speakers here. In the first instance, the statement was made this this legislation should be fought because it was supposed to be ideological legislation; they do not fight this Bill because they are opposed to the decentralization of industries; they are fighting it on ideological grounds. The second statement they made is that the Government had supposedly introduced this Bill because it was admitting that the policy of border area development pursued so far, was a failure.</p>

<p>The third argument that was advanced by speakers on the Opposition side was that they fought this legislation because the industries were not being persuaded by means of consultation and other inducements to go to the border areas, but force was being used to cause industries to decentralize and go to border areas. In its outlook and also with the introduction of this Bill, the National Party, on the other hand, recognizes the national aspirations of all the various Bantu peoples in South Africa and also of the white people. It sees before it a picture of South Africa in which the national happiness and the development of all its peoples should be promoted positively. That is why I see this Bill as a positive measure which seeks to effect orderly planning and which must lead to the stimulation of development in and around the Bantu homelands, and to the creation of new points of growth, also in the homeland of the Whites. Therefore it is also in accurate to allege that the policy of border area development has been a failure so far. The policy of establishing industries in border areas is a policy which was only given recognition in the second half of the year 1960. But in the subsequent four years, up to 1964, the most important task was the following. In the first place, places had to be selected where points of growth could develop in the border areas. In the second place, the so-called infra-structure, or the provision of basic services, had to be given priority. In the third place, at the proposed points of growth towns had to be established where Whites and non-Whites could be housed. These things had to be done beforehand, so that we cannot really contrast this policy, as an applied policy of border areas development up to the year 1964, to what took place in the rest of South Africa. It is only when we look at the picture from 1964 up to the present time that we can evaluate the results that have been achieved in the field of border area development. If we look at the analyzes that have been made by experts such as Dr. Jooste &#x2014;who analyzed for the Department of Planning <span class="col_6959-6960" refersTo="page_0741"/>all the figures relating to Bantu who had been taken into employment, for instance, in the Eastern Cape&#x2014;then one finds that approximately 34 per cent of the natural population increase of the Eastern Cape Bantu were kept in the border areas. If one looks at South Africa as a whole, one will find that almost 40 per cent of the natural population increase of the Bantu have been absorbed in the industries and in new trades that have developed in the border areas. Therefore I want to make the statement that, in view of the fact that this policy has only been applied in practice for approximately three years, we cannot accept the accusation made by the United Party, namely that through this legislation the Government is supposedly admitting that border area development purely by means of inducements has failed so far. We, on the other hand, view this measure only as an additional means for achieving the objects of what we see as the completed picture of South Africa in years to come. The picture we see is one that has at times been depicted excellently by a person Opposition speakers are fond of quoting, especially when it suits them, namely Dr. Anton Rupert. On a certain occasion he addressed industrialists in Britain and informed them about the way he viewed the future industrial pattern and the general pattern of economic development in South Africa. His basic premise was that, just as Britain and its industrialists feared that development in their dominions, and here in South Africa as well, would result in trade between those dominions and Britain taking place on a smaller scale, the opposite was being proved in practice. With the development of South Africa and countries such as Australia and New Zealand, as well as the emergence of their own industries, trade has in actual fact increased and that pattern is still continuing, not only in respect of Britain as an old industrial country, but also in respect of the other old established industrial countries in Western Europe. The basic premise he made was, therefore, that an old industrial country, with the lead it gained at one stage, will never be overtaken by a young industrial country. It is the task of the older country to concentrate more and more on providing other developing industrial countries mainly with machinery and other capital goods. Furthermore, it is its task to make its industries more sophisticated so that the older industrial countries may supply the young industrial country with those things the latter country is not yet able to provide for itself. He elaborated on this idea and made the statement that, just as a pattern of growing trade among Europe, Britain and South Africa took place while the industries in South Africa were still in the development stage, such a pattern of trade would also, in the course of time and with the right climate, develop in South Africa. As progress is made in the industries in South Africa, as we are able to supply more capital goods and our products become more sophisticated, we shall also be able to supply more to our own Bantu home lands by means of the industrial development that will take place within those homelands and on their borders.</p>

<p>With that I also want to reply to the argument that was used by the hon. member for Pinetown. He wanted to know what would happen if we were to permit there to be, without tariff protection, a favourable wage basis for industries in our homelands. He wanted to know what we would do if we were to find that those industries were undermining our industries in the major metropolitan areas in that they could produce goods more cheaply. The answer to that is the answer given by Dr. Anton Rupert&#x2014;a great industrialist and at the same time an idealist&#x2014;namely that we need not fear that we shall be undermined by development that will take place in the homelands or in the border areas, because as the Bantu are diverted to those industries in larger numbers, as they succeed in manufacturing elementary manufactured goods, it will be the task of the white homeland to supply those developing industries with capital goods. That is why we can expect the trend to be in the direction of increased trade as and when the standard of living rises in those areas. That is why, unlike the United Party, we as the National Party are not afraid that this policy of developing our homelands, development within those areas as well as on their borders, will constitute a threat to the white homeland &#x2014;rather that this will be the basis on which we shall be able to maintain our development in years to come.</p>

<p>The statement was made here that this Bill is a coercive measure. Let me point out that in town and city planning schemes there is judicious planning as to where industries may establish themselves in those municipal or urban areas, areas where they fit in best with the scheme. Does the United Party also regard this as coercion or do they regard it as systematic and orderly development&#x003F; If there is planning on a regional basis and certain industries are not allowed in certain areas&#x2014;if, for some reason or other, the gases they emit, for instance, they do not fit in with the planning of a region&#x2014;and they are told to go to other areas, is that coercion or is that orderly planning&#x003F; If we marked out, on a national scale, certain areas as areas where the climate is the most favourable for certain industrial development and where it is considered to be in the interests of one&#x2019;s country that certain industries should bring relief to them, especially industries in which the Bantu preponderate, and that they should not be established in white metropolitan areas, does that amount to coercion or is it orderly planning&#x003F; If that is coercion, then coercion has become a fine-sounding word to me and I am no longer afraid of it. In the picture we have before us, we should be able to see that we are now entering upon a period of relative consolidation. All the steps taken by the State are aimed at ensuring that the development that takes place at this stage is not too rapid. We as the <span class="col_6961-6962" refersTo="page_0742"/>National Party believe that a golden era of development awaits our country, and that after this period of consolidation we shall take leaps ahead such as we have never seen before. If we think of the national aspirations of the Whites and of the various Bantu peoples and admit that inherently each of them has the same aspirations, and if we see ahead of us a 30-year period of unprecedented industrial development, is it not time we came forward with a measure such as this one&#x003F; Is it not time we asked the industrialist not only to concentrate on the greatest possible profits, but also on the question of where he may establish his industries in the interests of his shareholders and in the interests of his fatherland&#x003F;</p>

<p>To my mind the greatest advantage this Bill can have for our country and its industrial development is to be found in the fact that thought will once more be given to these matters. With this new thought and with a positive approach, I believe that we shall not agree with what Mr. J. Patten wrote in <i>The Cape Argus</i> of 25th May, namely that regions such as the Western Cape and the Southern Cape will become industrial step-children. Rather than that, I believe that our industrialists themselves, since they will now have a choice as regards their future development, will notice areas they have not yet considered seriously enough in the past. My personal opinion is that this will mean the beginning of new development for the Western Cape and also for the Southern Cape, so that these regions will also be able to render a greater contribution to the gross national product of the future. I believe that if our industrialists paused to consider this matter and saw the picture as a whole, as we see it, that if they saw the enormous opportunities awaiting them, they would agree with a statement that was made several years ago by Mr. Mauer-berger, one of the greatest industrialists the Cape Peninsula has ever produced, the textile king of the Western Cape. After Dr. Verwoerd had made the announcement in connection with the development of border industries, Mr. Mauerberger said that just as the Rand and Kimberley had produced their generation of millionaires in the days of the development of the diamond and gold-mining industries, he saw the border industries as the sphere which would produce the next generation of millionaires in South Africa. If our industrialists were to view the potential we have there in the same spirit as Mr. Mauerberger. I believe that they will not look upon this Bill as a coercive measure but as an opportunity for them to consider this matter properly.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Vasco will pardon me if I do not follow him in his line of argument. As a matter of fact, Sir, I do not intend following any line of argument. My observations on and my attitude towards this measure before the House are based on conclusions I came to on my own. I unfortunately had to be absent from Cape Town when the hon. the Minister introduced this measure. I can assure the House that I was in no way influenced by what the hon. the Minister had to tell the House. I did not have much opportunity of listening to other members. I simply studied this Bill objectively and dispassionately and I came to my own conclusions, taking into account my duty to the House and to the electorate who put me here and my duty as a citizen of the land of my birth.</p>

<p>It is clear that in certain circles any measure that can be construed as conducive to the development of Bantu homelands will be opposed as a result of party policy. I have come to the conclusion over the years that any such measure is practically regarded with the same spirit as a jihad or holy war. If the Opposition or any political faction in the House are opposed to the Bantu homelands policy, it is their duty to oppose it in the House, and I do not wish to interfere in any way. It is just unfortunate that from time to time measures do come before the House which are linked in some form or another with the Bantu homelands policy, but of which major parts are vitally necessary to the well-being and the progressive development of the country. In many cases it is looked upon as a subterfuge or a decoy for the development of Bantu homelands, and then opposed. What might be vitally necessary or for the good of the country then starts a political wrangle. This is nothing new. I suppose it is politics. My own position, however, is different, and as I owe no allegiance anywhere, I have tried to come to an objective conclusion in regard to the Bill. The people I represent in the House derive no benefit from political wrangles. In any case they have no say in the formulation of party policies. Taking into account what is in the interests of my electorate, the people who put me here, and having studied and gained a great deal of knowledge of what the Coloured people need, I wish to dwell for a few moments on the Bantu homelands policy. I was in the House some years ago when the late Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, launched the so-called Bantu homelands policy. It was clear to me at the time that this policy in regard to the Bantu population, apart from being something completely new, was a brainchild of the late Dr. Verwoerd. It was clear from the outset that the application, development and implementation of this policy would have far-reaching effects in South Africa and on South Africa, and also far-reaching effects beyond the borders of our country. It was a <span class="col_6963-6964" refersTo="page_0743"/>complete departure from the old concept of Native administration, as it was called, or Bantu administration, or the rule of the Bantu within the borders of our country. Immediately questions arose in my mind as to what the end of the road would be in regard to the application of this policy. I wondered what the ultimate form of development would be. Would it end with the creation of independent autonomous states&#x003F; If so, what would the relations be like between such new states and the Republic&#x003F; What attitudes would develop in those states and territories towards the Republic&#x003F; How would they be economically sustained with populations running into millions&#x003F; I concluded that this was a bold, new policy fraught with problems to which I did not have all the solutions.</p>

<p>To my mind, and according to my way of thinking, the success of the policy depended on the speed of development which would take place and the resolution with which this new policy would be implemented. It would depend on how the dangers which might arise and the seemingly insurmountable problems would be overcome. Because this was an unprecedented policy, an unprecedented form of government which was envisaged for the Bantu population of South Africa; it was easy&#x2014;as it still is&#x2014;to conjure up dangers or problems which might, or might not, exist. In my humble opinion many of these dangers that were&#x2014; and are&#x2014;foreseen might not exist at all. Certain incontrovertible facts have crystallized since this policy was announced and started to be implemented. I feel that we have arrived at a stage where we cannot but take certain facts into account. The first is that the South African electorate have on various occasions &#x2014;including a referendum in which this issue played a very important part&#x2014;endorsed this policy. They have done so in spite of the sacrifices which the white man will have to make to implement this policy and to develop it to its ultimate end. They will have to make financial sacrifices running into many millions of rand for many years. They will have to sacrifice certain land which will be given to the Bantu homelands or incorporated into the Bantu homelands. In spite of all this, the electorate have endorsed the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the future of the Bantu within the borders of the Republic. In the second place, development that has taken place since then has proved that the Bantu&#x2014;and here I am specially referring to the Transkei&#x2014;are accepting this policy, and that in spite of the fact that certain organizations with great sums of money played a role, and in spite of the fact that experienced agitators had their opportunities in the Transkei during the elections there. Since the elections there, the Bantu in the Transkei who are in favour of this policy are gaining more and more support in their endorsement and acceptance of this policy. Taking these two factors into account, one arrives at the third fact, and that is this. In the implementation of this policy, when has the point of no return been reached&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now, this is a very important point. I can best liken it to an aircraft taking off from the ground. The pilot can chart his course. He can chop and change the course, when the engines are warming up and even when he is taxiing out to take up position against the wind. He can change his mind when he guns up his engines. But there is a point of no return somewhere along the line. After a certain point has been reached whilst travelling on the runway, there is no turning back. If due to human failure or mechanical fault something goes wrong with the aircraft, that aircraft must continue with the take-off, and perhaps meet with disaster and destruction. Because it had reached the point of no return. I feel that when dealing with a matter as important as this policy, we must define our attitude thereto. When is the point of no return as far as this policy is concerned, reached&#x003F; Has it already been reached&#x003F; If so, what is our attitude going to be to the further implementation of the Bantu homelands policy&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my humble opinion the point of no return was reached on the day when this policy was officially enunciated by the late Prime Minister in this House. One cannot expect a responsible government, shouldering the responsibilities attendant upon millions of Bantu inside the borders of South Africa, and taking into account the developments in the rest of Africa and the attitude of major powers in the world who do not have our experience of these matters and who will not leave us alone to sort out our own problems. to have the Bantu population in South Africa oscillating between what the Government is busy doing and what a government in five or ten years&#x2019; time might do. At some stage we must decide whether we have reached the point of no return&#x2014;and I say we have reached that point&#x2014;and, if so, we must decide what our future responsibilities are as regards the Bantu population of South Africa, the white population of South Africa, and the Coloured and Indian populations of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>In considering this matter we may very well ask ourselves&#x2014;assuming the point of no return has already been reached, what is the alternative to be if the present policy is not the answer, if it is not going to work, and if the inherent dangers of the policy are too great&#x003F; I regard this question of the utmost importance. If we accept that it is our duty and our right, as members of this hon. House, to criticize the policy, to find fault with it, and to point out the dangers inherent in the policy, we also have a further duty. and that is to tell the House and the country what the alternative policy is if we do not agree with the policy at present being applied.</p>

<p>I do not regard myself as a veteran politician. I do not regard myself as someone who will go down in the political history of this country as the man who came up with the solutions at the right time. I regard myself as a plain South African with a little experience, a second-generation South African only, but <span class="col_6965-6966" refersTo="page_0744"/>with nowhere to go if I had to leave this country. I have come to the conclusion that, whatever our feelings might have been in the past and at the time when this policy was enunciated and put into practice, and whatever we might still be motivated by, I have not been able to find an alternative to this policy at present being implemented. We know what has been happening elsewhere in Africa over the last 20 years. We are aware of the attitudes and the opinions of the rest of the world as regards our country. We know that the U.N., on which we pinned our hopes for peace after World War II, has become a farce. It is perfectly clear that it will not satisfy the Bantu in South Africa, it will not satisfy the non-white states of the world&#x2014;of which there are many and who predominate at the U.N. &#x2014;and it will not satisfy those states who sympathize with those states, if we declared that we will give our Bantu eight white representatives in this House. If that is not acceptable, and if we accept that the point of no return as far as this policy is concerned has been reached, then I cannot against my better knowledge condemn everything pertaining to the separate development of the Bantu homelands just because certain legislation which is vitally necessary in many respects for the implementing of that policy comes before this House. Then I, as a member of this House, cannot speak and vote against such a measure.</p>

<p>I regard the principle of planning as imperative and most important for any country, and particularly for our country where we have problems which other countries do not have. I was in the home of a friend in Pretoria in 1964 when it was announced that a Department of Planning was to be established. He asked me What I thought about it. and my spontaneous reply was, &#x201C;In my opinion this step is 30 or 40 years or more overdue.&#x201D; I said this, and I say so now, taking into account all forms of development over the last 30 or 40 years, whether it be roads, dams, irrigation works, the development of settlements or cities, or whatever the case may be. There was lack of co-ordination and lack of planning. A certain hon. member here&#x2014;I cannot remember who it was&#x2014;suggested that the water of the Vaalharts scheme could be diverted to the Witwatersrand in order to augment the water supply there. I regard that as silly, stupid and senseless. I cannot how you can sacrifice anything from the Witwatersrand in favour of Vaalharts or <i>vice versa,</i> but what I do see is that it remains the responsibility of the powers that be at present to provide for the shortages on both sides, whether of the Rand or of Vaalharts. [Interjection.] Let us not be facetious. I feel that had there been a broader basis of planning in general, with the knowledge that the Government could have mustered 30 or 40 years ago, that scheme could have been planned in such a manner that the supplies of which we are short now could easily have been augmented without planning virtually <i>de novo</i> additional schemes by which to augment it.</p>

<p>The principle of planning is no new principle. I asked a certain gentleman yesterday what his opinion was about this Bill, and he said it amounted to dictatorship. He is entitled to his opinion, but the principle of planning is not new. Anywhere you live, within the jurisdiction of any local authority, if you want to build a house or set up an industry you have to submit plans and you cannot erect that structure unless your plans are approved of. The only difference here is that it is not on a local authority basis or on a provincial basis; here it is on a national basis, which I regard as overdue and very necessary indeed. As I say, the principle is not new, but what is vitally necessary is for that principle to be applied throughout with thoroughness and vigour. Let me give an example. I grew up in the city where the Houses of Parliament stand. I remember very well that as far as Cape Town is concerned, at a very early age I came to the conclusion that Cape Town was never planned; it just came into existence. The principle of planning on a large scale was accepted rather late. How many industrial areas are there in Cape Town&#x003F; There are Paarden Eiland and Epping. Paarden Eiland came into existence as the result of the fact that Escom built a power station there, and beyond it there was a vlei which was gradually filled up but which at that stage was unsuited for human habitation. Houses could not be built there. But here you find industrial areas and residential areas cheek by jowl. You have a District Six as the result of the lack of planning. One does not want to throw doubts on the abilities of our city fathers of former years, but the time has now come where in this second half of the century no Government. in this country especially, can allow a <i>laissez-faire</i> development.</p>

<p>Planning must be done not only on a provincial authority basis or on a municipal basis, but on a national basis. There are many respects in which one cannot plan only on a provincial basis, such as water schemes where the river is the boundary between two provinces. In that case there has to be coordination on a national basis. What happened in Cape Town&#x003F; When the depression passed over in 1933 or 1934, there was a boom. Industries developed and factories sprang up. This was perpetuated during the war years, and it was all to the good. I remember walking barefooted in the streets of Cape Town, and I also enjoyed good years when I was able to buy my first bicycle. It was very good and we all appreciated it, but we reaped the bitter fruits of the lack of planning that went with it. The factories went up and labour had to come here, and it streamed into Cape Town, but what a mess there was to be cleared up after the war, and how long did it take to clear it up, at the cost of what bitter suffering to human beings, whether black or brown, and all because at that time there was no coordinated planning! Labour streamed in, but housing was not provided. I take all these factors into account. One of the reasons why this <span class="col_6967-6968" refersTo="page_0745"/>Bill is necessary is because you have various factors involved in the development of industry. Firstly you need labour, and secondly, housing for that labour. You need water and electric power. Transport has to be taken into consideration, especially in South Africa, where we have an abundance of cheap coal. I feel that with my little study of anthropology it is certainly desirable to have your labour housed in such a way that if possible that labour finds itself in its natural habitat. I wish to emphasize this point because the labour concerned here is primarily, except in the Western Province and certain parts of the Cape Province, African labour. When I came from the platteland to Cape Town as a boy of nine, I was intensely unhappy here. It took me years to become acclimatized. What can we expect a Bantu to experience when he comes here at the age of 20&#x003F; He is brought here from his homeland not because he wants to come but because he has to work, because he has to provide for his relatives over there. He is brought into this environment with no guidance. This is very important. Talk to any sociologist or any person who has knowledge of the African in his homeland and who has knowledge of the sociological problems arising when the Bantu comes here to work. He is not allowed to have female company. He cannot bring his wife and family along. These unnatural circumstances prevail. Hence my argument that it is preferable to see these people in employment at such a distance from their natural habitat that, if not nightly after work, they can go home at least over weekends. We have the areas which can be developed, where you have the necessary factors for the sitting of industries and where these people can be housed in such a manner that they are not deprived of family life. Whatever argument you may bring along, however much you might try to view it from ivory towers, you cannot compare the sociological and human problems of the Bantu in a large city which is completely strange to him, where the way of life is completely strange to him, with the position of a white person. His background is completely different. I wish to make bold to say this, that in allowing this unplanned development of industries and this influx of labour to take place, the white man has done an injustice to the black man, and an unforgivable injustice, and we have allowed the Coloured people to be undercut in their own natural habitat where they have existed all these years, by the African coming in with a much lower standard of living, and with a much greater sense of tribal law and custom, and those customs were superimposed on them. Taking that into account, I also feel that not a single member of this House will get up and pronounce himself as being against influx control. In fact, it was very interesting to learn that in the old Cape House of Representatives before responsible government was granted, in 1857, measures were adopted in the form of influx control. No member here will say influx control must be abolished. If we are not in favour of abolishing influx control, can we reconcile ourselves with this perpetuated system of migrant labour, this system of disrupting the Bantu and superimposing on him laws and customs which he cannot appreciate, which he does not understand, and which invariably lead to problems like the tsotsi problem&#x003F; The young ones growing up there do not assimilate the good aspects of what Western civilization imposes on them. They are completely helpless; they retrogress: and the result is the sort of sociological problems that we have to-day with our young Bantu in the larger cities. </p>

<p>I think we are all agreed that the hardships which result from the system of migrant labour, under which thousands of people live in cities to which they cannot bring their wives and children and in which they cannot lead a normal family life, must be alleviated. What I cannot understand then is why we do not all welcome the Government&#x2019;s attempt to develop or to evolve a system under which this injustice to the Bantu, which is inherent in the system of migrant labour, need not be per-petuated but under which, instead of living in bachelor quarters in Langa or elsewhere, he will be able to go home to his family after his day&#x2019;s work, not necessarily every night, but at least for the week-end where possible, and not every two or three years as is the case at present. It would be to the benefit of the country if we could have the Bantu&#x2019;s place of employment so situated that this present system can be done away with as far as possible. Sir, after studying this Bill and its ramifications, I have come to the conclusion that, in this matter, as in so many other matters, I cannot allow myself to be guided by the attitude of the Opposition in this House.</p>

<p>To mention one example, when the Bill which provided for Coloured education to be taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs came before this House, we were warned of the so-called grave dangers of the proposed take-over. To-day we know that the fears which were then expressed have proved to be groundless. I refuse to believe that a responsible government would deliberately come along with a measure such as this, well knowing that if it is put on the Statute Book and applied it will stultify, choke and strangle private initiative and the development of the country. I cannot accept that because it is well known not only to those of us who are not members of the Government but especially to the Prime Minister and his Cabinet and to members on the Government side that the future of South Africa, the solution of our problems and especially this problem, depends on development in every sphere but especially in the industrial sphere. That is why I cannot accept that the Government would bring a measure before the House knowing that its implementation will choke and strangle private initiative and enterprise. There is one appeal, however, that I wish to make to the hon.<span class="col_6969-6970" refersTo="page_0746"/>the Minister. Sir, I have heard the fears expressed from time to time, especially last week in Durban, that it may take a long time, when application is made for permission to site an industry in a certain area, before finality is reached. I wish to appeal to the Minister to allay the fears of the potential industrialist and to stream-line his Department so that there will be no unnecessary delay, because my experience has been that once a company has been formed and it has acquired the necessary capital to start to build or to go into production, time means money. The industrialist cannot afford to wait for months for a reply from the Department as to whether or not he may proceed with his venture. Secondly, I wish to appeal to the Minister to take into account, in conjunction with other Government Departments, the fact that in the Transkei, which is part of my constituency, there are 14,000 Coloured people who will have to be displaced there. Opportunities of employment and development will have to be provided for them in some other area. They are at the moment living in a state of uncertainty. They have no future there. We are dealing here with people who are virtually of our kin, people who are Western in origin, who speak our language, who have adopted the Christian religion, who have taken the Afrikaans language there and have existed there for generations. They will have to get out of an area in which we have held out the possibility of ultimate sovereign independence to the Bantu, and we have a responsibility towards them. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is that in considering any scheme of general planning adequate provision will be made for those 14,000 Coloureds in the Transkei, whom I represent in this House.</p>

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity in order to congratulate two people. In the first instance I want to congratulate the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, on a rational, sensible speech in regard to this very important legislation. I think it is the best speech which I have heard him make since I came to this House. I want to congratulate him on it. Then I also want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation and say to him that we welcome it and that we are glad that he has set out the principles of the legislation so clearly. The resistance of the Opposition to this Bill is based on the fact that they are aware that our policy of apartheid is succeeding. They are accusing the Government and the Minister that this legislation is aimed at destroying the factory industry and, secondly, that the Government is ostensibly going to transfer all industries which have already been established here to other areas and in that way cause chaos. Mr. Speaker, that is a misrepresentation, because those are by no means the objectives of this legislation. What is being envisaged in this Bill is to send future industrial development in a direction which is economic. practical and correct. The hon. the Minister described this Bill as a positive measure, and that is in fact the case. Hon. members have uttered the cry that our apartheid policy had failed. They know very well that that is not the case. Six to seven years ago there were few border industries. However, points of growth were established. The infrastructure already exists, and where it does not already exist it is being established. This Bill now makes provision for control over industrial land. The Government will now be able to determine where industries will in future have to be established. I ask myself what the practical effect of this legislation is going to be. It is clear to me that what will happen is this: If an industrialist wants to establish an industry he will be guided and advised; the committee to be established will perhaps say to him: &#x201C;Look, you cannot establish this industry in a metropolitan area such as Johannesburg, but there are areas, such as Pietersburg, where you can establish it.&#x201D; Pietersburg is ready to receive them, and so is any other industrial area. The infrastructure exists. Now they come along and establish their industries there. Suppose a number of them have established themselves there and that between them they employ say 5,000 Bantu. That means that 5,000 less Bantu in the Johannesburg area and 5,000 fewer houses which would have had to be provided there. That will mean 5,000 Bantu living in their own homeland. And precisely the same amenities are being provided for them there as were previously provided. Then they are amongst their own people. That is the practical result, which I foresee in this legislation. But the United Party has once again chosen the road leading to the political downfall in our country. It seems to me they are doing so deliberately. They have once again adopted the attitude, and the whole theme of their attack is. that the economic powers are sacrosanct and that they must not be interfered with. The State, according to the statements made by the Opposition, must be a slave to the law of free economic powers, instead of them being applied to the benefit of itself and to the benefit of the citizens in its country. Despite the predictions of the Opposition, for example that industry is going to be destroyed, these economic powers are now going to be channelized through legislation to bring about increased economic success and greater incomes and a higher standard of living in the country. History teaches us and it has also shown that the industrialist looks for profits. He does not care where his factory is situated, as long as he can make a profit. Does the Opposition now want to suggest, by stating that industry will be destroyed, that the manufacturer will be deprived of his right to make profits&#x003F; Or that his factories will be closed down&#x003F; Surely they cannot talk about the destruction of industry. As I said, this legislation will result in the standard of living in the country being raised, and being raised for all race groups. That is the position owing to the fact that decentralization will bring it about. The history of the industrial development <span class="col_6971-6972" refersTo="page_0747"/>in the older countries in the world has shown that this is so. With the development of the industrial countries there was always the problem that it was always necessary to fight against the movement of free economic powers. The arguments quoted here by the Opposition are the same old arguments which were quoted by the advocates of the old <i>laissez-faire</i> politics. Over and against that there was the ideology of the younger countries which had developed and wanted to become economically and industrially independent, and who advocated State intervention. The same struggle then took place which is, to a lesser degree, taking place here. What happened then in the history of the world as far as the old mother countries are concerned, which have changed to-day, and that of the young countries, which became established industrial countries, is a phenomenon which will re-occur. That is what is now happening here. State intervention took the form of protective methods, tariffs, prohibitions on import, and numerous other forms of legislation. The State intervention included methods for encouraging the erection of factories within a rural area &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and also to encourage it within specific national borders. Apart from the question as to whether or not it will be economic, according to the cry which the Opposition are raising or not, the countries nevertheless developed. These countries developed and industries developed, precisely because of encouragement by the State and State policy. What the State in fact did was to channelize, formulate and utilize those economic powers and send them in a certain direction. They never allowed economic powers to choose their own course. The advocates of the <i>laissez-faire</i> policy of that time predicted that terrible chaos would arise. But, after all, that did not happen. International trade continued, the standard of living increased, and industries were established everywhere. Now I am asking that if this did in fact happen on an international level, why cannot a country, within its own borders, also use those economic powers to its own advantage by means of various methods of planning&#x003F; I want to refer to legislation which was passed years ago in this House and which at that time aroused great concern amongst the protagonists of the <i>laissez-faire</i> policy. I am referring now to the Marketing Act. At that time the same argument was used, and it was said that the State was interfering unnecessarily. Strangely enough that legislation was passed by the then United Party Government. It was said that the free powers of the economy were being interfered with. It was asked what costs it would not involve for the country. It was asked what the distribution costs would not amount to. I am certain that not one of those members on the opposite side of the House would want to stand up to-day and say that that Act ought to be repealed. It is precisely the same in the case of this Bill. No Government will allow development in its country to be stifled. Surely it is an unfair accusation on the part of the Opposition to say that the Government will ruin industry completely. According to the commission which the Government has from the nation it is obliged to see to it that development takes place which will be in the interests of the country as well as of all groups and races within its borders. Ours is a young, developing country in the industrial sphere. For us it is absolutely essential to see to it that a foundation of proper planning and control by the State is provided. This legislation is attempting to do just that, and is not attempting to stifle development. It is attempting to channelize development in a certain direction, for which posterity will be grateful to us. The United Party will also thank us for having merely dragged them along with us. I also believe that we will subsequently be thanked, to an equal extent, by the race groups of the country which are going to be benefited by this legislation. This legislation does not arise out of foolishness, pettiness, injudiciousness, and out of a desire to plough democracy under, as has been alleged here. It arises out of a deep conviction of the serious need for the orderly survival of our entire racial community; it arose after serious consideration had been given to the conservation of all our immobile resources and their proper utilization; it has arisen on account of a deficiency which existed for a proper coordinating factor within our general industrial development: it arose out of the need which existed to deal timeously with and prevent the problems which have cropped up in other countries owing to over-population, etc.; it arises out of the danger of injudicious development of industrial land areas by local bodies. I find it a pity that it was not possible to include the development of normal township areas under this legislation as well because I regard it as a very important subdivision of the entire development programme. This legislation also arises out of the seriousness with which this side of the House regards its task and out of a deep love for what is our own and the need to nurture that, to protect it and to deal with it in such a way that it will always remain our own.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg has made the same mistake I think as most other hon. members on that side, namely to base his argument on the assumption that this Bill is designed to decentralize industry in the true sense of the word and that it is to enable the hon. the Minister to plan for the future of industry. The hon. member has expressed the sincerity and the honesty of purpose with which they approach this job. But what the hon. member forgets is that after being in government for 20 years and having applied a policy which does not seem to be succeeding, the hon. the Minister has <span class="col_6973-6974" refersTo="page_0748"/>now sincerely come to this House and said that he was going to use this measure to direct industry to the border areas. He said that, but the hon. member apparently did not hear him because not one of his arguments was based on the assumption that this Bill is intended to direct industry to border areas. He happened to mention Pietersburg which is a border industry area. He said everything needed for the infrastructure would be there. But I wonder whether the hon. member has at some time or another made any investigation of any of the areas to which this Government has already directed industry. Let us take Pietermaritzburg. We have seen terrific blowups in the newspapers about how this Government was encouraging industry to go to the Pietermaritzburg area. But what infrastructure exists there&#x003F; Is there, for instance, sufficient and adequate transport&#x003F; Are all the other facilities necessary for this boom blowup of Pietermaritzburg available there&#x003F; Is the infrastructure there&#x003F; Of course it is not. There may be signs of it coming along but at the present moment it does not exist. What is more, the Pietermaritzburg area is not properly planned for the industries being directed there. So, what makes the hon. member assume that the hon. the Minister can send industries to Pietersburg to-morrow and that the infrastructure would be there&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to make this point very strongly, because it does not seem to be properly realized, that we on this side are not opposed to the decentralization of industry and if this hon. Minister had brought a Bill to this House to improve on the development of our natural resources, the Bill which he is now repealing; if he had come to this House and said that he wanted to plan areas better and provide the required infrastructure, i.e. all the necessities, and that he wanted to devote himself to doing an investigation for the better establishment of industry, irrespective of where those areas are&#x2014;and I admit some of these areas might have been border areas while many of them would not have been such&#x2014;he would have encountered a totally different approach to this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister apparently is trying to confuse the issue. I have read the Bill and I know what is in it. The powers he will have under it are absolute powers. As he himself said, he would have the right to say &#x201C;ja&#x201D; or &#x201C;nee&#x201D;. He was quite frank in stating it as the intention of this Bill to direct industry to the border areas. Let us do some rethinking on that basis and take into consideration the arguments used by hon. members opposite. The hon. member for Vasco asked, whether this was &#x201C;dwang&#x201D; or &#x201C;ordelike beplanning&#x201D;&#x003F; Let us see what it is as we go along. It is all very well for him to have asked that about half a dozen times without producing any proof that it was in fact &#x201C;ordelike beplanning&#x201D;. Before him the hon. member for Brakpan referred to the developments on the East Rand. Developments there had gone on despite protests. Well, these developments have taken place for the very reason that this Bill did not exist. They went on because the industries concerned were allowed to establish themselves there and were not directed to an area remote from the East Rand. These industries were allowed to establish themselves there to stabilize the area where the mines were dying. We do not have to be super economists to know that. And yet the hon. member for Brakpan comes along and throws that in as an argument in support of this Bill. But if anything, it is an argument against this Bill, because had this Bill already been operative some of those industries would have been directed elsewhere. What would then have been the fate of the East Rand to-day&#x003F; It would have been something totally different from what it is at the present moment. The Minister can laugh if he wants to laugh but he must listen to the facts of his Bill. We have to analyze it and express our opinions on it. We have to take what is in it and not what the Minister tells us is in it. His assurances do not mean anything because if they had he would have written them into the Bill itself. But he did not do that&#x2014;he preferred to come to this House to indicate that he was prepared to consider reasonable amendments. I think it is to clause 4 that he said he was prepared to consider reasonable amendments&#x2014;in other words, he is open to bids; he will accept the highest bid offered and the one which will satisfy objections to it. But, says the Minister, if he does not like it he shall not give it. Why does the Minister come with these suggestions&#x003F; Why does he not put forward an amendment which he knows will remove objections to it&#x003F; Because he wants the objections to remain&#x2014;that is why. It is quite simple.</p>

<p>I want to remind the Minister that industry is the livelihood of a large part of the community. I wish the Minister would realize this. He should realize that it is not a toy to be played with, to be played politics with. South Africa relies upon industry to stabilize us as the mines gradually fade and die. So, if the Minister is now going to direct all our industries to the border areas, what is going to replace the dying mines&#x003F; Will they not have to direct the total population from those areas to the border areas&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am asking questions of the hon. the Minister, questions to which he is supposed to reply. I shall quote the hon. member for Heilbron and his philosophy in a moment. As I was saying, we are looking towards industry to stabilize our economy as the gold mines fade out. This is a fact&#x2014;the entire economy of South Africa looks at it that way. So the Minister must not come and play around with industry, kick it around, inhibit and discourage the establishment of new industries. We need every one we can get. Let me tell him that the powers he is going to have here, he and his officials&#x2014;because he is going to delegate a lot of his authority to his officials&#x2014;are so varied and so absolute that no industrialist. I believe, contemplating the establishment of an industry or the extension of an existing one, could possibly make allowance for all the things that might befall him from the Department of Planning. Because they are all negative. Every aspect which is put forward in this Bill, as far as the industrialist is concerned, is a negative one. He is told: You may not do this, you may not do that. Why doesn&#x2019;t the Minister draft a Bill which means something&#x003F; Then the industrialist can read it and say, &#x201C;I can plan the establishment of my industry and these are the factors I have to take into consideration.&#x201D; Let the Minister tell me how an industrialist can sit down with this Bill in front of him, take all the factors which it contains into consideration, put them down on a piece of paper and work out where he stands at the end of that calculation&#x003F; Because he cannot do it; this Bill does not allow him to do it&#x2014;it is a negative Bill with a completely negative approach to the whole problem. It just says that he may not go here or there without the Minister&#x2019;s permission; he may not increase his employment without the Minister&#x2019;s permission; he may not do this and he may not do that. This is what the Bill says. How does one calculate those factors&#x003F; I believe this must have a discouraging effect on industrialists who deal in facts and not in Ministerial fiction. This is the position. Industry is based on facts. Now, how can one extract facts from this Bill&#x003F; All one can get from this measure is a permit and discussions with officials of the department, and if one is lucky one might be able to get a picture of what is going to happen when one establishes one&#x2019;s industry. That is what this Bill does. Because the industrialist must get permits and permission for everything that he wants to do. That is what the Bill says. [Interjection.] The hon. member may read the Bill to-night and come back again.</p>

<p>I think the Minister must also allow for the fact that I do not believe any industrialist who wants to establish an industry in this country wants to subject himself to the penalties prescribed in this Bill. It talks of a fine, imprisonment, or both. Of course he does not want to subject himself Jo such penalties. Why should a man be subject to penalties of this nature, to sanctions of this nature, when he is trying to establish an industry for the good of himself, his shareholders and for South Africa&#x003F; Why should he be subject to these penalties just because a Minister says he may not do this and he may not do that&#x003F; What I want to ask the Minister is this: Will that encourage industrialists to establish themselves, or will it discourage them&#x003F; Will it encourage them, will it make them happier to establish their industries because they run the risk of paying a penalty if they do not do everything that they are told to do&#x003F; I believe that this Bill will have a detrimental effect upon the establishment of industry, an effect which the Minister does not yet realize&#x2014;and neither does this House.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to support the first leg of this amendment, which says&#x2014;and I want to remind the House what it says&#x2014;that the Bill seeks to place in the hands of the Minister complete and unfettered control of land, labour and industrial development of the country.</p>

<p>What makes this Minister and his department all of a sudden more fitted to determine the factors which are vital Jo the establishment of a new industry&#x003F; What is it that suddenly makes the Minister more qualified than the industry itself&#x003F; I should like to know, because up to now the Minister has shown that he is quite incapable of planning for the establishment of industries. No planning at all has been done. His department has been used purely and simply to enforce the ideology of the Government, for instance, for group areas declarations. I do not know for what other purpose it has been used. Now all of a sudden it is being used for sending new industries more especially, and possibly some of the older ones, to the border industrial areas. Is that a Planning Department&#x003F; Is that the function of the Department of Planning&#x003F; I do not believe that is the function of a department of this nature at all. I believe the Minister should place every possible factor, every possible research facility, at the disposal of industry, and say, &#x201C;This is what we have to offer in this area and this is what we have to offer in that area.&#x201D; Surely to goodness, after that industrialists and industry itself are capable of determining which are the best of those offered areas to which they should go and where they should site themselves. But the approach here is different&#x2014;&#x201C;You will go there &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

In terms of this measure no local authority may any longer establish a new industrial area, plan a new industrial area, or allow a new industry to be established there without the permission of this Minister. The local authorities are now waking up to the dangers which face them under this Bill. I want to refer to Durban in this regard. I have a report here which states that &#x201C;Durban may be a &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; town&#x201D;. I do not say this, but it is the opinion of two men who up to now have been the main people in planning the land and the industrial future of Durban. I do not say this, no politician on this did says this. This is said by people who are vitally and basically concerned with the planning of the industrial future of a city like Durban. This does not only apply to Durban&#x2014;it applies also to Bloemfontein, and it will be interesting to see what will happen in the Orange Free State as a result of this Bill, where there are no Bantu areas.</p>

<p>And a ghost Department of Planning. It shows one that ghosts do exist, and there is no reason why there should not be another one. The city engineer and the town clerk of Durban are perturbed about this aspect of the Bill and the effects it might well have on the city of Durban in the future. Let me read a few extracts of what they say as reported in <i>The Natal Mercury</i> of 27th May, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Bill radically affects the town planning functions of local authorities &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to make this point again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill radically affects the town planning functions of local authorities because it provides that without the written approval of the Minister of Planning, no town-planning scheme, which provides for the zoning of land for industry, may be approved, no land for industrial purposes may be subdivided and no industrial townships may be established.</block>

<p>Anybody who has had anything at all to do with the organization and the financing of local authorities in the past knows that one of their greatest assets is their industrial land, in many cases land which is of no value and of no use for any other purpose whatsoever. Now. here all of a sudden the Minister comes along and says: &#x201C;You cannot use that land for industry unless I tell you in writing you can, because the industries that were going to establish themselves in your area, I am telling to establish themselves in an area far removed &#x2014;maybe in another province, maybe at the other end of the Republic.&#x201D; Can one therefore wonder why these people are concerned and why it is said that Durban may become a &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; town&#x003F; According to the newspaper, the town clerk and the city engineer say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the possible effects of this measure on the Council&#x2019;s planning schemes and future proposals for industrial development, it seems desirable that some form of protest should be registered against this further inroad into the autonomy of local government.</block>

<p>Another factor now enters the picture, namely &#x201C;this further inroad into the autonomy of local government&#x201D;. Of course, that is exactly what this Bill is doing. It will not only intrude into local government, but it will also intrude up to provincial level, because this measure removes all control which the provinces have over their own affairs as far as industries are concerned. This Minister can now take it a step further. Not only can he say that an industrialist may not establish himself within the area of a specific local authority, but he may well direct the establishment right out of the province and thus over-rule the Administrator, because the Administrator cannot do anything without the Minister&#x2019;s sanction either. These are facts&#x2014;I am quoting the facts of the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to continue quoting from the newspaper. As I said, these two Durban officials said that Durban could become a &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; town. The city engineer also said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any system of planned dispersal, the parent city of a metropolitan area should not be hindered so that it becomes a ghost town with a depressing effect upon the whole region.</block>

<p>This is good reasoning, it is good thinking. We have had no assurance from this Minister that this will not happen. The engineer goes <span class="col_6979-6980" refersTo="page_0751"/>further, and I want to make this point with the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not intended to criticize matters of major Governmental policy, but it is felt that the City Council should be made aware of the possible effects upon the natural growth of the city, including the economic and social life of citizens, of any enforced retarding of industrial growth.</block>

<p>Now we see that the powers which the Minister is taking can affect the whole life and the future of a city like Durban, or any other city, and he can turn it into a &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; city or a &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; town. He can. There is no question about that at all. The city engineer of Durban is quite right. Let me quote further what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Forced decentralization of industry will be harmful until the stage has been reached when the city is having serious administration difficulties. But this stage is not likely to be reached until 1991, when Durbans&#x2019; population will be about 1,250,000, which is quite small by big city standards.</block>

<p>I hope the Minister is listening to this. We have had arguments in this House that our cities and towns are growing too big and that we must move the people away. Here we see it is estimated that by the year 1991 Durban will have a population of H million people. The city engineer adds that &#x201C;it is quite small by big city standards&#x201D;. What does the Minister want to move the industries away from Durban for&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am glad you did&#x2014;I hope it had some effect on you. The Minister is now taking power to say to industries that they cannot establish themselves where they wish. What is going to be the position as regards this forecast if the Minister says that&#x003F; The calculations of every city in South Africa are based on industrial planning: it is the lifeblood of every city in the Republic, of every town of any size at all. The platteland towns are looking for and encouraging industry because their future growth depends upon it. and not only their future growth but their survival. If they do not have industrial development then they become &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; towns and &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; cities. That is what happens&#x2014;this is where the word &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; comes in. In the hands of the Minister and his officials are being given the powers to create &#x201C;ghost&#x201D; towns. That is the fact of the matter. I read further from the <i>Mercury&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>Because Durban will probably be fully development in 25 years its size and industrial activity will be automatically limited. Any disturbance of Durban&#x2019;s economy would have an effect on the whole of Natal &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to make this point particularly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; because Durban contributes 70 per cent of the provincial income and is responsible for 70 per cent of provincial activity in certain other respects.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I think the hon. member must come back to the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>With respect. Sir, the facts are these: The Minister under this Bill has power which means that he, in fact, now controls industrial development, and not the local authority. This is why the local authorities become so important. Because with the powers which they are losing to the Minister they are no longer &#x201C;capable&#x201D;, if I may say so, to determine their own future. They can no longer be &#x201C;captains of their own souls or masters of their own fate&#x201D;. Because this Minister is taking that power from them. I believe this is a most important factor and I am glad that I have had the opportunity of making the point and bringing it to the notice of the House and to the notice of all South Africans, all those people who are going to be affected by this Bill.</p>

<p>In addition to this, what is the effect on the economy as a whole going to be of these powers of the Minister and his ability to direct industries&#x003F; We have already had one sample. It will tend to split the economy, and already factories, so I am told, are tending to produce either in the higher price-range or the lower price-range. Because the factories which remain, those which remain in the white areas, cannot compete with the factories which are being established by the Minister now in the border areas. So the border area factories are undercutting the other factories in many articles that they manufacture. We have this for example in the case of Hammarsdale, where the other factories which used to produce a grade and quality of goods at a reasonable price can no longer compete. They have now to channel their efforts to other types of production to get into a higher price-range in order to meet the economic factors of the area in which they are established because they cannot compete with the border industries. Therefore I believe that with the powers as a whole which the Minister will have, he is in fact going to tend to direct the white population towards the borders of the Bantu areas. It must have that effect, because I think in many cases the Bantu-intensive industries. of which the Minister has spoken, are also white-intensive. Then what does one do&#x003F; Does one leave the white people behind and just send the Bantu concerned to the border areas industries&#x003F; Surely the white people also have to be taken there. Therefore the whole process of moving these factories and directing new ones to the border areas will mean in effect the breaking down of the existing areas and the re-establishment on the borders. I do not want to enter into a discussion as to whether we want all our white population on the perimeters <span class="col_6981-6982" refersTo="page_0752"/>of South Africa adjoining the Bantu areas. I do not want to go into a long discussion about whether we want Johannesburg to develop further or whether we don&#x2019;t or any of the other cities in South Africa for that matter. But I believe these are vital factors that have to be taken into consideration. So I believe that on the whole this measure is going to tend to disperse the white people to the border areas, and I believe that that will eventually lead to the breaking down of those borders. I do not believe that we can draw a line and let one population group live on one side and the other population group live on the other side, without in fact those borders being disturbed. I am talking about these theoretical borders about which we can get no details.</p>

<p>I think another reason why this Bill is not good is because the thinking behind it is designed to be good for apartheid. I do not believe the thinking behind this Bill is designed to be good for industry or good for South Africa.</p>

<p>I support the second leg of this amendment too, which deplores the fact that the Minister is scrapping the Natural Resources Development Act. I support it for the reason that the approach of that Act was a much better approach than the approach which the Minister has in this Bill. The approach there was one of consultation, of trying to find out where the best areas were to establish an industry, where industries could best thrive, and where they could do the most good for South Africa. Under that scheme, I want to remind the Minister, we have had some very fine regional plans drawn up. We in Natal are very proud of the plans for the Tugela basin. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umlazi did his best to conjure up as many bogies as possible in his speech in order to sir up the industrialists of South Africa against this measure and against the hon. the Minister, and to put a spoke in the wheel of co-operation with the Government in respect of its implementation. Why is the Opposition doing that&#x003F; It does not surprise one that they act in that way, because it is in accordance with the course of action adopted by them in the past in respect of every effort made and in respect of every measure introduced by this side to ensure the continued existence of the Whites in South Africa and to relieve the population pressure exerted by the non-Whites&#x2014;pre-eminently by the Bantu&#x2014;on the Whites in our large metropolitan cities. The Opposition say that they also stand for the preservation of white civilization and the white man and his values in the cities and in the Republic of South Africa. Yet they are always doing the very opposite of what they say, because they have opposed every measure which has been introduced by this Government over the years since it came to power.</p>

<p>That is why they are also opposing this Bill tooth and nail just as they opposed all the other measures. The Opposition believes in only one policy and that is a kind of economic &#x201C;free and easy&#x201D; faith, in other words, they are interested only in seeing what profits and dividends can be obtained without the socioeconomic factors, which the hon. the Minister mentioned so clearly when he introduced the Bill, being taken into account. If this <i>laissez-faire</i> policy of the Opposition, in other words, if uncontrolled and unrestrained industrial expansion were to continue in our large cities, it would be the surest way of destroying the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. We who come from the large cities, especially from Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand complex, speak from experience. The hon. member for Yeoville may use as many arguments as he likes, he may make as many quotations as he pleases:&#x2014;from theses as well&#x2014; but the fact remains that if preventive action is not taken by means of a measure such as this, we on the Witwatersrand will eventually drown in a black sea. In other words, Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand will eventually become only a white island in a black sea. The Opposition, however, are not concerned about this, because they are opposed to our bringing about more and more segregation in our white areas, especially in our cities. The Opposition knows that this is one of the Government&#x2019;s greatest milestones on the road to the realization of our policy of separate development, and that is why they are opposing this measure so recklessly and so ruthlessly. Their whole aim is to make the economy of South Africa become even blacker still, because in their inner sanctums, where they hatch their plans, they say that that is the surest way of defeating the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. I am not saying these things without any grounds. No less a person than one of their former leading front-benchers, a person who is no longer in this House, one of their leading economists, namely the former member for Jeppes, said that straight out in this House in 1964. I want to quote what the former member for Jeppes, Dr. Frans Cronje, said here with reference to an economic boycott speech made by the late Mr. Adlai Stevenson. He said that if he could give any advice to those people who wanted to apply boycotts against South Africa, he could not give them any better advice than the following. I quote from the Hansard of 1964 (vol. 11, column 6189). This is what the then hon. member for Jeppes said:</p>

<p>If the aim of those people who threaten economic sanctions to South Africa is to remove apartheid, the obvious way of doing that is to encourage rapid economic development in this country. If they had any knowledge of what had happened in South Africa over the last 10 or 15 years they would realize that the more rapidly the country developed economically the more of a myth the policy of racial separation had become in South Africa and the policy of apartheid. They should realize that every new factory <span class="col_6983-6984" refersTo="page_0753"/>makes apartheid and the Government policy that more unreal.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Cronje went on and showed his true colours, as well as those of the party to which he belongs, by saying:</p>

<block name="quote">If we had a spell of rapid economic development in this country of the same order we have had over the past few years, it is inevitable that civil and political rights will have to be extended to the non-Whites, no matter what Government is in power.</block>

<p>There, Mr. Speaker, you have the reason why this hon. Opposition is opposing this measure tooth and nail. It is because they feel that their whole approach to further economic integration is being effectively checked by this legislation.</p>

<p>I want to continue and refer to a speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and which I listened to the other day while the motion of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was under discussion. There the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the Other Place, Senator Oelrich, replied in the affirmative to a question put by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education put, namely whether the Bantu should be allowed to enter the industrial areas without restriction as those areas develop. The hon. the Deputy Minister asked whether they should enter on a single or on a family basis, to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition replied very clearly that it should be on a family basis. If that is the policy of the United Party, we may tell them that we shall use that point of view of theirs against them on one platform after another during the recess, that is to say, the fact that it is their policy that Bantu workers should enter our industrial areas on a family basis without any control being exercised. If that is their policy, what will the position be ten years hence&#x003F; Ten years hence there will be an additional 750,000 single Bantu employees on the Witwatersrand alone. Calculated at five per family it means that an additional number of three million will enter and come to live in our metropolitan areas on the Witwatersrand within the next ten years.</p>
