<p>Whether any experiments have taken place or are contemplated with the placing of disused motor car bodies and chassis in dongas to combat soil erosion; if so, with what results; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services" to="#wood">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES:</from>

<p>No. Due to corrosion and the power of storm water such obstructions have only a limited period of usefulness. It may be considered for use as temporary backing strips to promote the establishment of common reeds, grass and poplars, but the transport of such material is usually uneconomical and the use thereof presents numerous problems. Research with a view to the mass-use thereof for soil conservation can unfortunately not enjoy a high priority above other more urgent problems.</p>

<question by="#murray" to="#minister_of_health">

<num>*13.</num>

<from>Mr. L. G. MURRAY</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether the possibility of injury to the public and/or marine life as a result of the submerged cargo of the <i>Seafarer</i> at Mouille Point, Cape Town, has been investigated; if so, with what results;</li>

<li>(2) whether any action has been taken to protect the public from injury; if so, what action.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#murray">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; the finding is that provided the drums are not tampered with. there is little possibility that tetra-ethyl lead which may escape from drums aboard the wreck <i>S.A. Seafarer</i> may endanger the health of the public. Regular analyses by the Medical Officer of Health of Cape Town still show that there is no excess tetra-ethyl lead in sea water in the vicinity of the wreck or at neighbouring beaches. There are approximately 140 drums of the poison under the wreck. As the poison is heavier than water, it will tend to sink to the bottom of the sea, should the drums rust through. The poison is insoluble in ordinary water, but has &#x00E1; solubility of one part per million in sea water.<br/>Initially there was danger to marine life in the vicinity of the wreck as a result of pentachlorophenol poisoning, but there is no indication of such danger now. This powder was contained in bags and has presumably in the meantime completely dissolved.<br/>The Director of Sea Fisheries recently made an investigation with the aid of deep sea divers and found that marine life in the vicinity had recovered.</li>

<li>(2) Yes; several warnings to the public not to bathe in the vicinity of the wreck were given by the police in the Press as well as over the radio. The main danger attached to bathing was from floating pieces of wreckage and not the possibility of poisoning.<br/>The place is regularly visited by an officer of the Port Health Staff. A committee consisting of the Regional Director, State Health Services, Medical Officer of Health, City Engineer, Police, Harbour Captain and the officer in charge of the chemical laboratories of the Department of Health, under the chairmanship of the Town Clerk, keeps a watchful eye on the situation.</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b) No. To qualify for promotion to particular grades, officers have to complete prescribed periods of service in their existing grades. As a result of the structural changes there were not enough officers who had completed the prescribed periods of service and who could be considered for promotion available for all the new posts in certain grades. To obtain enough candidates, the prescribed periods of service had to be temporarily relaxed. As officers are promoted strictly on merit, it was thereupon necessary to assess the merit of all candidates afresh. Of the officers who qualified as a result of the relaxation of the prescribed periods of service, 16 who attained a higher merit assessment superseded officers who had completed the previously prescribed periods of service.</li>

<li>(2) No. The promotions procedure is known to officers and merit meetings are attended by representatives of their staff associations.</li>

<p>It is not possible to apportion the expenditure in respect of the three services at this stage. This is done after the close of the financial year when the appropriation accounts are compiled.</p>

<p>The difference between the above-mentioned revenue and expenditure figures does not represent profit. When profit is calculated, provision must be made for items such as depreciation, interest on capital, the Government&#x2019;s contribution towards pension funds, etc. These calculations are also made at the close of the financial year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last night, I was referring to the unfortunate speech made by the hon. member for Innesdal. I took exception to the slurs and the sneers cast by that hon. member on the attempt by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to find a bipartisan approach above party political division to certain limited aspects of our political life concerning foreign policy. I think that we of the Opposition, who have had to endure considerable criticism and remarks about this bipartisan approach which we desire and which we understand the Prime Minister desires as well, are entitled to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether the attitude of this front-bencher of the Nationalist Party, a not unimportant member of the Nationalist Party, <span class="col_251-252" refersTo="page_0143"/>was the attitude of the governing party? Does the hon. the Prime Minister support that attitude? Does the Prime Minister also look upon the bipartisan approach that we are seeking as something ridiculous and something to be condemned?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is no such thing as a bipartisan approach. All that has happened is that I have told the hon. the Leader of the Opposition from time to time what the position was and we discussed that. That is all there is to it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member spoke about something entirely different. It had nothing to do with this at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is very interesting as we must now assume that as regards the approaches by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition and vice versa (the only one about which we had public information was an approach by the Prime Minister to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give him certain information), the intention is that the major political parties in this country should show a common front to the world in respect of certain aspects of our foreign policy. Because if that is the intention then I can only say that the attitude of the hon. member for Innesdal is unpatriotic, un-South African and totally unworthy. The attitude of the hon. member for Innesdal is not atypical. His was the worst we saw in the debate but throughout we have had attempts by members on the other side of the House to escape the responsibility which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and speakers in support of him have placed at the door of the Government. The Leader of the Opposition and those who supported him raised important issues, supported by authority and fact. They were reasoned speeches dealing with matters affecting the people of South Africa and dealing in particular with the problem of inflation. More particularly, with the problem of inflation as it affects our gold-mining industry, our farmers and those ordinary people of South Africa who have fixed incomes. No impartial spectator and no impartial listener to the debate of the past four days can say that the Government has treated those problems with the attention and the care and the responsibility they deserve.</p>

<p>I would refer you, Sir, to the reply which the hon. the Prime Minister attempted to give the Leader of the Opposition. It reflected the slap-happy attitude of the Government in the face of these problems. It reflected the attitude of the Government, namely that all is well with South Africa, that there are no real problems. If only the Opposition would keep quiet, the Government may bluff the people to believe that that is so. That was their attitude, an attitude of indifference to the people who suffer the consequences of Government incompetence and Government ineptitude. The hon. the Prime Minister, I think, should know that all South Africans who awaited this first major entry of his into the discussions of this Parliament must have been disappointed in his performance. He reminded us of something which Sheridan said years ago of a Member of his Parliament: &#x201C;That the hon. member depended on his memory for his jokes and upon his imagination for his facts.&#x201D; I will give the hon. the Prime Minister full credit for the fact that he was amusing. He raised laughter and we laughed as well at times. But, Mr. Speaker, when I was young my parents took me to Pagel&#x2019;s Circus and we roared with laughter at the antics of the clowns, Tickey and Spuds, but it never occurred to us that Tickey or Spuds would be entrusted with the responsibilities of the Prime Minister of South Africa.</p>

<p>I think that the Prime Minister should bear that in mind. That was the type of reply we got in this debate. Now I ask you to look at the kind of argument produced in reply to our attacks. First of all, there were attempts at a counter-attack. The hon. member for Brakpan tried to distract attention by launching an attack upon the City Council of Johannesburg where the happy people of that city are governed in their intimate affairs by a United Party municipality. The hon. member&#x2019;s charge was that the capital expenditure of the city of Johannesburg was lavish and to support that he referred to the motorways which have been built. I forgive the hon. member for Brakpan for being ignorant but why he should always find so much delight in his own ignorance baffles me. He should know that there is no municipality in South Africa that co-operates so gladly with the Government in any attempt to curtail expenditure. I should like to tell the House that in the year 1965-&#x2019;66 at short notice the Johannesburg Town Council was asked to cut capital expenditure by R2 million and that they did. This year, 1966-&#x2019;67, they proposed a capital expenditure of R50 million. At the request of the Government they immediately cut that by R8 million. Only R20 million of the original R50 million had to be obtained by loan funds but even then at the request of the Government they cut that remaining amount by a further R2&#x00BD; million. They co-operated with the Government and helped in every possible way to reduce capital expenditure at this time. When the United Party City Council of Johannesburg were asked to cut expenditure in the <span class="col_253-254" refersTo="page_0144"/>national interest, they did not turn once to the Government and say: &#x201C;Tell us how and where we must save this money.&#x201D; They did not once put the onus upon other people. They accepted their own responsibility and they cut their expenditure which is more than we can say of this Government. That was the one kind of argument.</p>

<p>The other kind of argument used by the hon. the Prime Minister as well was that he expressed surprise that on this motion of no confidence, so well deserved by the Government, the United Party did not state its own policy. In the first place, Mr. Speaker, that is not expected of us. What is expected of us and what we are determined to do in this debate and other debates which will follow is to show up, to reveal and to expose the ineptitude and inefficiency and incompetence of the present Cabinet. But I want to say that in the very nature of our criticism the policy of the Opposition is stated and becomes apparent. The Leader of the <b>Opposition made</b> it perfectly clear that there should be a real reduction in State expenditure and that a United Party government would set about that. Secondly, he made it perfectly clear that it would be necessary to export some of the surplus capital in South Africa. He made it perfectly clear that it was vitally necessary to tackle our manpower problem with more imagination and more success and with more action than we are getting from the Government. I do not want to repeat the speech of my hon. Leader, but again and again in his criticism and in his suggestions he made the policy of the United Party perfectly clear. Sir, there are none so deaf as those who not wish to hear and none so blind as those who do not wish to see. The Prime Minister prefers to be both deaf and blind, because he and the Cabinet surrounding him do not have the ability to carry out the things that are necessary in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Another argument which came from the hon. the Prime Minister was: Why talk about inflation? Why blame me for inflation? It is a world phenomenon. Of course it is a world phenomenon, Sir. But some countries are more successful than others in combating inflation. I should like to give you one example.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I can give you more. I could mention France and Australia, but I want to make mention particularly of the United States of America, which is at present engaged upon what can only be described as a major war in Vietnam. In spite of that, their rate of increase in the cost structure is half of what it has been in South Africa over the past five years. I am a South African, Sir. I believe that we can be as efficient and as well-governed any day as the people of the United States of America. It is just unfortunate that we are stuck with a bad Government. That, however, can be changed.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister has another excuse. He threw up his hands in despair and said: But the gold price has been fixed for 30 years. He said that he was not responsible for that. Of course he was not responsible for that, but, Sir, that should be a greater spur to him to fight inflation, because South Africa is the greatest gold-producing country in the world, making an important contribution to the wherewithal with which the Western world has to face the continuing crisis of ideology. It should be a spur to a South African Government to combat inflation more efficiently than other countries. It should not be an excuse. It should not be an exhibition of pathetic incompetence, of lack of ability. It should be the spur for efficient action on the part of the Government, and that is lacking, Sir.</p>

<p>Then the Prime Minister produced a surprising argument. I expected better from him. He said that the United Party&#x2019;s attitude was that we must combat inflation and we should know that the only way that you can combat inflation is by cutting wages, especially White wages.</p>

<p>No, Sir. I am not talking nonsense. We heard the Prime Minister. He challenged us with the fact that we were satisfied to accept that White wages would have to be reduced. He put rhetorical questions to us and was followed by other speakers on that side. They were taking refuge once again, as the Nationalist Party has always done, behind race prejudice. They were taking refuge behind the exploitation of race prejudice. We have a Government in South Africa which appeals to the people time after time with success and then when their sins are exposed they make the gibe: Why are we successful at elections? I am telling you why they are successful at elections. They are willing without regard to the true interests of South Africa unscrupulously to exploit race prejudice and to create and to fan the flames of race prejudice. [Interjections.] In this retreat behind the fears and the prejudices for which they are responsible they have the cheek to turn to us on this side of the House and say: You must define your attitude to separate development. <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0145"/>Mr. Speaker, before we do that, should they not define separate development? There is much which concerns the separate existence and the separate living of the various races in South Africa which is part of the accepted and conventional life of South Africa, and which most of us accept. Most of us live that way without laws or compulsion. But, Sir, there is also very much in the so-called separate development policy of the Government which is petty, humiliating to other human beings, which does not further the interests of either race in any way except to salve the aggressiveness of some people in South Africa. I want to say here and now that if we have to accept that sort of thing then the answer of the United Party is a most emphatic &#x201C;no thank you&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Government what they are doing apart from the speeches by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, repudiated by the Secretary for Bantu Administration. Where is there any evidence of real action by the Government to bring about separate development in the fundamental aspects of South African life? I think that until we get an answer to that question, their question is a silly one. It is an escapist question. It is like a detective story. It is like a James Bond story in which people take refuge when they want to escape reality. Mr. Speaker, there is no separation in the fundamental things in South Africa. There is no separation and not even the beginning of separation in South Africa in something so fundamental as the common production by the various races of South Africa of the means by which we live and by which we enjoy life. There is no fundamental separation in the economy of South Africa. There is only growing integration. There is no separate development at all. [Interjection.] That hon. member says &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;. I do not blame him. One can only be a Nationalist in South Africa to-day if you ignore facts, when you regard hard facts as nonsense.</p>

<p>With your permission, Sir, I should like to give the House some hard facts. I have looked at the table of employment opportunities in the Monthly Bulletin of Statistics. I find that an interesting development is taking place in South Africa while the Government applies a policy which they call &#x201C;Separate Development&#x201D;. In 1959-&#x2019;60 1,737,000 people of all races were employed in South Africa. In 1964-&#x2019;65, five years later, 1,998,000 were employed. Of these, in 1959-&#x2019;60 the Whites numbered 409,000. In 1964-&#x2019;65 they numbered 482,000. I do not want to give you too many figures, Sir, but that means that the Whites accounted for an increase in the number of employed people of 73,000 over those five years, out of a total increase of 361,000. While 73,000 Whites were newly employed in those five years in the common industrial activities of the races in South Africa and in the common economic activities of the people of South Africa, there were 288,000, almost 300,000, non-Whites.</p>

<p>I am showing, Sir, that there is no true fundamental separate development in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, in the manufacturing industry the figures are even more striking. Whites accounted for 69,000 out of an increase in people employed of 310,000. 69,000 Whites were newly employed in those industries in the five years up to 1964-&#x2019;65, but there were 241,000 non-Whites. Look at the ratio, Sir. Somebody asked me about percentages. I should like to give them the figures. Look at the ratio of people employed in construction, for example. Five years ago 25 per cent of the people employed on construction in South Africa were Whites. Five years later only 20 per cent were Whites. Those are facts. Those are official statistics that come from the Government. In the manufacturing industry 33 per cent of the people who were employed in 1960 were Whites. In 1965 only 25 per cent. Where is the separate development? And, Sir, this tendency will continue.</p>

<p>Yes, this tendency will continue and I can give the House the assurance that the King Canute that has come from Vereeniging will never stop this tidal wave &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>On Monday we were privileged to receive a very significant document. I do not think that hon. members on that side have had the time to look at this document. They take their time about things. This document is a report on the Economic Development Programme for the Republic of South Africa, released by the Department of Planning. It is a report on what happened in South Africa last year. If hon. members will look at pages 7 and 8 they will see how brilliantly successful the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration is in turning the tide, in stopping the integration of Black labour in South Africa. I find that on page 7 there is a table, No. 1.3, which gives one most interesting information. I will not give my own comments on this table, but I will read the comments given by the experts of the Department of Planning. Paragraph 26 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this qualification is borne in mind the employment of Whites, according to Table 1.3 increased in the years 1964-&#x2019;65 by 42,500 persons, or by 3.6 per cent from 1964-&#x2019;65.</block>

<p>This is how paragraph 27 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the employment of non-Whites is concerned Table 1.3 shows that this increased by 179,000, or 3.8 per cent.</block>

<p><span class="col_257-258" refersTo="page_0146"/>Even expressed as a percentage it is a faster increase, not only if expressed in absolute numbers. Paragraph 29 reads as follows, and this is the important fact&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It can also be seen from Table 1.3 that employment in secondary industry increased at a much more rapid rate during 1965 than that set out in the Economic Development Plan projections. In the case of Whites this difference is 12,500 persons, for non-Whites 83,800 persons.</block>

<p>This economic development programme projected that during the next five years we would have an increase in our national product every year of about 5 or 5.5 per cent. For that purpose we would need another 500,000 non-White workers in South Africa. That was their projection. In the first year they are 84,000 out in their projection. In the first year their own anticipations are exceeded by 84,000. [Interjections.] Every time the hon. Deputy Minister speaks he exposes the futility of Government policy. [Interjections.] I think we should subsidize his speeches.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there are things being done. There are attempts now to stifle development in our urban areas. Or, let me put it differently&#x2014; now there are attempts to encourage greater development on the borders of the reserves.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that is right. They may be achieving some measure of success. But, of course, that is not separate development. That is not development in the Native areas, of the Native areas. That is development for the White people on the borders of the reserves, on the White side of the reserves, with the aid of Black labour from the reserves. That is integration. But, Sir, to judge by results it is not very effective integration. The hon. Leader of the Opposition is right when he says that one of the answers to the problem of inflation is greater productivity, but then the failure of this Government is the more colossal, it is absolutely staggering. This is what happened according to the experts of the Department of Planning, according to this official document. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1965 the greatest increase in employment occurred in secondary industry where employment rose by 11.1 per cent.</block>

<p>It is a marvellous achievement. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That of non-Whites rose by no less than 15.9 per cent.</block>

<p>There was thus an increase in the employment of non-Whites in secondary industry of 15.9 per cent in one year. And we have separate development! But the results are interesting, because in the same paragraph 28 the experts say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand, the increase in the volume of production was only 8 per cent.</block>

<p>We thus have a position that there was 11.1 per cent more White workers, 15.9 per cent more non-White workers, yet productivity increased by 8 per cent only. Again and again in this document they express concern at the decline in the productivity of the South African worker. It has not been possible to find a true correlation, but I believe that it is inescapable that part of this decline in productivity is the direct consequence of the artificial, ideological compulsions which this Government is bringing to bear upon the economic development of South Africa. And then the hon. members opposite have the cheek to say that we on this side have no policy!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have to increase the productivity of our people, and we have to abandon stupid policies that bring us no nearer to the achievement of any real purpose in the life of South Africa, like this border development for instance. We on this side say that we are in favour of decentralization of industry if based on the economic and social interests of people. But decentralization of industry purely for ideological reasons, for the achievement of the unachievable, is ridiculous and silly; it is incompetent and inept; it is against the interests of South Africa. And, where necessary, we have to change the pattern of labour. The Government itself&#x2014;and it cannot deny it&#x2014;sat by while the Government mining engineer some time ago permitted experiments to be conducted on the Witwatersrand in the gold mining industry. Afterwards the Government took fright and ran away. But those experiments are necessary. In every aspect of industrial and economic life of South Africa employers and employees are taking the bit between their own teeth and repudiating the Government&#x2019;s policy. In the light of the figures which I have given it is clear that they are changing the pattern of labour in South Africa, and the same thing will have to come in an industry like the gold mining industry, provided that there are adequate guarantees that the standard of living of the White workers will not be affected. And that, Sir, is the responsibility of the Government. After the war, when it was necessary to give greater opportunities to non-White labour in the building industry, the Smuts Government gave guarantees, and would have honoured them if that had become necessary. I think that the time has come that this Government, who are entirely responsible for those very fears which are to-day haunting the minds of the mine-workers, should disabuse the mine-workers of those fears, by giving them adequate sureties and guarantees against what they fear will happen. But for this Government to believe, for this Government to continue to practise those things to which my Leader referred, of looking upon South Africa with its population of more than 16 million as consisting of only 3¾ million people who have to give all the services on <span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_0147"/>the executive, administrative and skilled levels of life to that vaster community, is preposterous, ridiculous, short-sighted, incompetent, inept. They do not deserve to control South Africa while they do not change their ways.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour_and_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR AND OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I have spent several days listening to this debate and I have followed the Opposition&#x2019;s criticism very closely, and I must say, one cannot but express one&#x2019;s disappointment in the quality of the criticism produced in this debate. Considering the fact that this motion was phrased so widely that it purported to criticize the incompetence of the entire Cabinet, one expected rather more substantiated criticism than we have heard in the blustering so far. What I found disappointing was the poor type of criticism, accompanied by reproaches, which was levelled at the hon. the Prime Minister because he had supposedly not devoted adequate attention to the criticism of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Have the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and hon. members on the opposite side noticed how little attention their own Press devoted to the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition? Have they looked at that; have they studied it? [Interjections.] I am referring to the Press that supports the United Party, and at every election advices the voters to vote for the United Party. Hon. members of the Opposition expect the hon. the Prime Minister to pay attention to the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, a speech which even his own Press did not consider worthy of proper publication. I think that in future we on this side and in this House should not expect our Prime Minister to respond to an attack such as that made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition unless it has more substance than his had. It is resented that the hon. the Prime Minister responded by asking why the United Party did not set out their own policy. The hon. member for Yeoville has now said that it is not their duty to get up in this House and state their policy. Does the hon. member know what that implies for them as a party? It implies that the United Party has finally written off the possibility of becoming the alternative government in this country, because a debate such as this offers the opposition party the opportunity not only to bring criticism against the Government but also, in accordance with the example set by the National Party when it was the opposition, to produce a positive policy which it can oppose to the policy of the Government. How else could one possibly hope ever to come into power if one did not follow that elementary course? Mr. Speaker, I trust sincerely that in future we shall not expect our Prime Minister to respond to criticism of that quality in every debate on a motion of no-confidence.</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition have produced all kinds of sophisms. The hon. member for Yeoville made the accusation against the hon. the Prime Minister that he wanted to enforce reduced wages in order to achieve a solution. What arrant nonsense! Was it not under this Government that wages rose as they have in fact risen in the past 19 years? Is it not still the attitude of this Government that we ask the workers and their organizations to make their wage demands responsibly while at the same time telling them that we shall continue to regard their wage demands with the utmost sympathy? It has always been our attitude that the labourer is worthy of his hire. He must receive the wages he deserves, and if we ask him to make his demands for wages in a responsible fashion, it does not mean that he has to forgo those wages. On the contrary, the past has shown that under this r&#x00E9;gime the labourer received the wage increases for which he bargained from time to time.</p>

<p>Then my hon. friends produced another sophism about the increased number of Bantu employed in the White areas. What would the United Party have us do? Are we to negate the increase in the Bantu population? Should no Bantu be employed any longer? Are they to sit in their respective homelands and become a breeding ground for agitation and Communism because they are unemployed? How else are they to be kept in employment and provided with a decent standard of living? We are all eager to show the world abroad what South Africa is doing for its non-Whites. We are all proud of that. What we are doing for our non-Whites compares favourably with what African states are doing for their own people. How can we present a good image to the world abroad unless we offer those people opportunities for work? The hon. member quoted statistics to demonstrate how the number of Bantu in the White areas of South Africa has increased. Surely the hon. member should know that our border industries are also situred in White South Africa. Surely he should know that some of those tens of thousands of additional Bantu who have been employed have in fact been employed in those border industries. Surely the hon. member should take that into consideration. He should take into consideration that in the years ahead the number of Bantu employed in White South Africa will naturally increase even further because the border industry development is expanding and more Bantu will be employed. Surely it is ridiculous to regard that as prejudicial to White South Africa. No, what counts is this: While having this increased employment of Bantu labour, we also have full employment as far as the Whites in this country are concerned. What is important is the fact that the Whites feel secure in their work and that the attitude of the Government has resulted in the high degree of industrial peace that we are experiencing in this country; that is important. Mr. Speaker, to present that kind of image here is to present a distorted image. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration was hauled up for censure of his attitude as regards Bantu employment. Under the guidance of the Minister and his Deputy a new <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_0148"/>labour pattern is developing on the Witwatersrand specifically; I mention the Witwatersrand because my constituency is situated there. At present we have a ratio there of one White worker to only two Bantu workers; that is a unique achievement; we have never had that before. [Interjections.] I am now speaking of the average. That ratio is at present being maintained in my constituency. It is an achievement to be proud of. The policy and administration of the Government are aimed at maintaining that ratio. Mr. Speaker, surely that provides a safeguard for the White worker. It does offer the non-White worker employment, but it also has the advantage that it keeps our metropolitan cities White and that they are not inundated by this black mass. In the border areas we offer them opportunities for employment and development.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to another matter, one to which some hon. members of the Opposition referred obliquely, i.e. the mine-worker troubles. Yesterday the hon. member for Yeoville said by way of interjection that in the present situation the mine-workers had a grievance against the Government and not against the Chamber of Mines.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That type of interjection and the other oblique references made here to the mine-worker troubles, made it quite clear to me that the attitude of the United Party is such that it is engaged in exactly the same as that in which the <i>Sunday Times</i> is engaged every Sunday. One of the most striking features of that newspaper and of some of the English-language newspapers is that any comment on unrest or strikes receives the utmost, the widest publicity in those newspapers. That has created the impression that the more irresponsible the source, the greater the publicity it receives. It is clear as daylight that the sole object of those parties is to embarrass the Government. That is why it is said time and again by that Press that they want a &#x201C;showdown&#x201D; with the Government. That they may prejudice their own friends, the mining interests, is apparently of minor importance. What counts is to embarrass the Government. I want to say here and now that the Opposition and that ally of theirs, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, will not succeed in their object of estranging the White mine-workers from the National Party, firstly because the White mine-workers know what this party and this Government mean to their protection and secondly because they know that the policy of the United Party rings the death-knell for the industrial colour-bar, and because they know that, it need not be feared that the <i>Sunday Times</i> and the Opposition will succeed in their object.</p>

<p>I should now like to set out the attitude of the Government with regard to this matter. The hon. member for Yeoville also referred to more extensive employment of Bantu labour and to the protection and security needed by the White mine-worker. The Government&#x2019;s attitude with regard to mine-workers actually centres on three main issues. Firstly, as far as the present matter is concerned, it is our sincere wish that a satisfactory wage regulation for the mine-workers be put into operation as soon as possible; that is our first wish. Our second wish is that the colour bar for those mine-workers must be maintained. It must be maintained no matter what wage regulations are adopted; it must be part and parcel of those wage regulations, the protection of the White worker, for without that protection and without that sense of security he will not be a contented worker, and we shall not have labour peace in this country, and that is basic to the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>Our third wish as far as the mine-workers are concerned is a strong and sound mine-workers&#x2019; trade union. It is our sincere wish because a strong trade union is absolutely essential for the bargaining procedure the mine-worker has to follow in order to obtain better wages and working conditions. It is the machine which must negotiate those for him, and it is therefore in his interest and in the interest of industry and of all of us that the means he requires to bargain for those better wages shall be strong and sound. With a view to that the Government, as you are aware, Mr. Speaker, caused two enquiries to be instituted in mine-worker affairs in the past year or two. The first inquiry related to the dissatisfaction which arose in connection with the colour bar. You are aware, Sir, that in consequence of the inquiry of that commission, and in view of its report, the <i>status quo</i> in the mining industry was restored. You are also aware of the second inquiry. It was instituted as a result of the domestic difficulties in the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union which gave rise to diverse strikes. We had the matter investigated. You are aware that it resulted in&#x2019; a general election for the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union. When that election was held it was my task, as spokesman for the Government in that field, to declare at once that we recognized that new Mine-workers&#x2019; Union Executive, and I want to repeat in this House to-day that the Government recognizes them. But furthermore, on the occasion when they visited me, the president and members of his executive, I offered them all possible help from departmental quarters to assist them through advice, and I wished them all success in their negotiations and expressed the hope that the negotiations they had to conduct for better working conditions would be finalized speedily. Now as the hon. House knows, there have since been strikes. Those strikes occurred to our deep regret, and it was equally regrettable that the Attorney-General deemed it necessary to institute prosecutions. I sincerely regret that workers have become involved in this fashion, and that workers are to suffer as a result of the actions of certain persons. The Government regrets that, because we genuinely desire <span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_0149"/>the continuation of the goodwill we showed after the election of the new executive, and the continuation of the good-will towards the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, which is an important instrument in the industrial life of our country. In that spirit I want to repeat to-day that we as a Government are most anxious that those wage negotiations should be finalized satisfactorily. It is in the interests of the mineworkers, of the mining industry and of the country. But the Government is also appreciative of the fact that the mine-workers have certain problems; we are not blind to their problems. We are fully aware of their problems. We have had commissions of inquiry from time to time and we are conversant with their problems. As a result the Government would gladly offer further assistance to the mineworkers in that connection. It is beyond doubt that the wage question is basic to much of the dissatisfaction among the mineworkers. Their dissatisfaction with the wage position gives rise to the fact that strikes are sometimes called over other matters. In view of that the Government is genuinely prepared, apart from the advice we have offered and given them from time to time, to offer the mineworkers other assistance as well, within the framework of our labour legislation.</p>

<p>With a view to such assistance, I want to state to-day that the Government is agreeable to the appointment of a mediating committee to assist the mine-workers in their negotiations for better wage conditions with the Chamber of Mines. In this regard I just want to refer to something else, and that is a plea which is made from time to time by certain well-meaning persons that we should appoint a commission of inquiry to inquire into the whole position of the mine-workers, their wages and working conditions. Bearing in mind that the achievement of a satisfactory wage agreement is actually the crux of the entire matter and of the problem, I want to suggest that it is my conviction that a commission of inquiry cannot produce a satisfactory solution in this regard. Appointing a commission of inquiry will be of no use. It will produce a report and make recommendations in regard to wages, etc., and then either the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union will not be amenable or the Chamber of Mines will not accept them, and then absolutely nothing will have been achieved; the only result will be further frustration.</p>

<p>No, what is needed in this regard is that a wage agreement shall be arrived at between the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines, an agreement which should actually rest on two pillars. The first is that the mine-worker must be given a satisfactory wage, and the second is that the position of the White mine-worker must be duly safeguarded in that agreement. Those are the two basic principles, and such an arrangement cannot be brought about by a commission of inquiry. It cannot bring about such a wage agreement. A commission cannot finalize those important negotiations; it will merely leave it up in the air and cause more dissatisfaction. For that reason, because we realize that, we should like to assist the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union if they so wish. If they wish us to assist them in that regard, to establish a mediating commission, the Government will consider it most favourably.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We can discuss that on some other occasion. It depends on whether they accept the principle. But you may rest assured that the committee will consist of people who know the industry and who are capable of approaching the problem sympathetically and knowledgeably, so that they will be able to act as an effective mediating committee between the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines. But I want to emphasize that the offer we are making, which we hope will meet with favourable consideration, can be put into effect only if it is requested by the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union. What would be the point of our appointing a mediating committee, even one constituted by the most capable men, if the workers declared that they did not want it and would not co-operate with such a committee? That is why I want to suggest now that it will rest with the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union, with the organized mine-workers, whether they will avail themselves of this offer; and I want to express the hope that the Mine-workers&#x2019; Union will consider this offer and decide on it with the utmost responsibility. This matter is of interest to all of us. It is in the interests of the mine-workers that there should be peace and quiet and order; it is in the interests of the country as a whole and it is therefore a matter which lends itself least of all to any exploitation by anybody. I therefore trust that we shall be safeguarded against that in this delicate and important matter. Because this important industry can prosper only if it can rely on a contented labour force, I really trust that all parties concerned will adopt the most positive approach to this proposal of a mediating committee. It is therefore my hope that this offer we are making, in view of the fact that we seek to assist the mine-workers within the framework of labour legislation, will receive their very serious consideration, and I trust that all other concerns will also approach this matter in an equally positive spirit.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the House is indebted to the hon. the Minister for the statement which he has just made in relation to the mining industry in South Africa and whilst he has told the House quite frankly that certain aspects of the activities within the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union have not yet cleared themselves up, I do not wish to proceed further to discuss what he has suggested but rather to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that whilst he has given us time this afternoon and dealt with <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_0150"/>the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, there is a large body of workers that fall under his purview as Minister of Labour who are far from satisfied with the purchasing power of the wages which they now receive. It is a known fact that any steps taken to review wages or to review industrial conciliation agreements or wage determinations take a fairly lengthy period of time to complete. An industrial conciliation agreement review might take as long as 2&#x00BD; years. During that time while the employee remains under the conditions of that existing agreement there are fluctuations in the purchasing power of the money which he is earning.</p>

<p>At this stage I want to refer particularly to remarks made by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs when he countered our criticism of the Government&#x2019;s changed approach to the economic situation in South Africa by saying that changed conditions require a change of approach, for instance, that the &#x201C;spend for prosperity&#x201D; was quite justifiable at the time as justifiable as was later &#x201C;save to counter inflation&#x201D;. But where does the wage earner and the salary man stand during these fluctuations. While the Government can take steps to attempt to halt inflation or to curb the increasing cost of living, the salary man is left with a static income to cope with varying conditions and it is for the very reasons that the Minister of Economic Affairs used to justify the changed approach by the Government that we on this side of the House have advocated over and over again that until there is a settled economic pattern in this country, it is essential that the wage earner&#x2019;s wages and the salaried man&#x2019;s income should be tied to the cost of living index by a cost of living allowance. Until that is done this Government is not being just and fair and is not facing up to the problems of the man whose income is fixed by way of wage or a salary. That has been done before in this country. The cost of living allowance was introduced to meet fluctuations and difficult circumstances and when an even keel was achieved, there was a consolidation of the cost of living allowance or part of it into the basic salary of the State employee or private employee. My belief is that this Government has failed in not taking steps to assist those salaried persons and people with a fixed income to meet the problems which they have had to face.</p>

<p>It has been suggested also that the Government itself is quite blameless in so far as spiralling inflation is concerned. I should like to quote some figures which I think will indicate that a good deal of blame attaches to the Government in regard to non-productive capital expenditure in the last two years in particular. During the 12 months ending June, 1965, the fixed capital outlay by public authorities had increased by 19 per cent over the previous 12 months. In the period up to June, 1966, the fixed capital outlay by public authorities had increased by 27 per cent over the previous 12 months. The increase in current private investment for the period ending June, 1964, had been as much as 21 per cent. Then in the following 12 months as a result of restrictions and as a result of the review of the position as far as private industry and private enterprise was concerned, that increase was reduced from a 21 per cent to a 7 per cent increase.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I stand here to-day to support the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for those reasons which I have indicated and for several other reasons with which I will deal briefly. It seems necessary having listened to this debate during the course of this week to make one thing perfectly clear as far as this side of the House is concerned. That is that when we criticize the way in which our country is being governed and the actions of this Government, we are not criticizing South Africa so that when we say that this Government is not ensuring or achieving the maximum momentum of expansion of industries, commerce and economic development in this country, we are not criticizing South Africa; we are criticizing this Government. We are a very fortunate country. We are a fortunate country in that we have almost unlimited potential for expansion but this Government is not using that potential because of what my hon. Leader termed a stop-go approach to industrial development in South Africa. That stop-go criticism has not come from this party only. That is a criticism which is levelled at this Government by as important a body as the Federated Chamber of Industries which has gone so far as to say, and I quote from an editorial with approval the statement of one of its delegates at a recent conference, that &#x201C;Industry was often bewitched, bothered and bewildered because of conflicting statements made by various highly placed Government persons. It was therefore difficult to ascertain what the precise policy position was under present conditions. From discussions it appeared that even those in informed circles were somewhat vague in replying to pertinent questions.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, I will give one example. As recently as October of last year the Director of Imports and Exports made a statement which was published for world consumption in the <i>SOUTH AFRICAN DIGEST</i> that import control was the price to be paid for the current wave of prosperity. The Director said:</p>

<block name="quote">He did not subscribe to the view that import control, in the present circumstances, was inflationary. South Africa&#x2019;s inflationary pressures were of a cost-push nature arising from a shortage of skilled manpower.</block>

<p>But what did the hon. the Minister of Finance in his opacity then as Minister of Economic Affairs say in a statement two months later. He said that what we needed to counter inflationary tendencies was a relaxation of import control and he in fact brought in the relaxations within two months. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked about a stop-go policy as far as this Government <span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0151"/>was concerned, it was said that there was no foundation for making such a statement. What is worthy of greater condemnation in my view is the fact that this Government has denied to South Africa opportunities of development to such an extent that a Minister of Economic Affairs can stand in this House and say that an inflow of foreign capital is an embarrassment. The reason is that this Government has persistently refused to accept the advice of industrialists and I need quote only one and that is the advice given by Dr. Anton Rupert in 1961. Dr. Anton Rupert said that we must develop at least one of the Bantu homelands on a large scale. An area as big as Pondoland should for instance be able to provide for 11 million people if they went to work as productively as the people of the Netherlands. &#x201C;I do not think we could achieve this by methods at present being used, without adding to it White industrial leadership. I do not believe that we will be able to attain it without bringing in White management and leadership.&#x201D; Dr. Rupert continued and said: &#x201C;It is a strange thing that we South African industrialists can build a factory on a partnership basis in Malaya but we cannot do it in the Transkei. There is no reason for fear. Confidence can and must create mutual confidence.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, surely it is condemnation in itself of this Government when we have the large available labour forces which exist here in this country of ours, the large available forces which can be trained and adapted to an increased tempo of production and industry that we should have to say that the inflow of foreign capital is an embarrassment to us. Ours is a country which is blessed with the opportunity of expansion which no other country in the world enjoys at the present. I believe that that is the biggest condemnation which one can offer of the Government at the moment, in so far as the use of the opportunities in this country is concerned. They are being wasted and neglected because of an attempt to achieve an ideology, which the hon. member this afternoon has so clearly indicated is far from being achieved. In fact, we are going in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>May I in conclusion just deal briefly with a point which was raised by the hon. member for Klipriver. I am sorry that he is not here to-day. I was surprised that the hon. member should have raised by way of criticism of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a suggestion that he should have brought forward and debated in this House the Rhodesian issue during this debate. What are the facts? My hon. Leader indicated at an early stage that we on this side of the House were of the opinion that Mr. Smith&#x2019;s Rhodesian Government should have <i>de facto</i> recognition. The position at the present moment is that South Africa has an accredited representative to the Rhodesian Government and the Rhodesian Government has an accredited representative in South Africa. Both the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. the Prime Minister have indicated to the public that they are on common ground as far as the Rhodesian issue is concerned. There was agreement between them. I would have thought that the hon. member for Klip River would in the course of his speech have expressed the gratitude of the country to the two hon. gentlemen concerned for what they have been able to achieve in so far as this difficult problem of Rhodesia is concerned. I can only say that he has perhaps not been kept abreast of what has been taking place in regard to that particular problem. One understands of course the fact that the hon. member for Houghton should have raised this matter. Unfortunately she was overseas while these developments took place and perhaps in her case also one must accept that she was unaware of what was taking place as regards South Africa&#x2019;s relations with Rhodesia.</p>

<p>I believe that the House is justified in reviewing what has been done by the Cabinet and what has not been done by the Cabinet in considering the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that if there is one group of people who have been and who are still suffering and who will continue to suffer because of the incompetence of this Government, it is the man who is bound to make do and keep a family on a fixed income as a wage earner or a salaried man. For those reasons I support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>I knew nothing about it. That is all I am saying. I am only saying that I knew nothing about it. I am not placing the blame on the hon. member for Transkei, who has raised the matter. Neither do I blame him for raising it. I am going to deal with the matter now, and I think you expect me to reply to it as the responsible Minister of the Interior. <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0152"/>The fact that this tragic event occurred in this House focused particular attention on one person. If that person had committed this same deed on some other person, in the street or in a slum area, nobody would have thought about him again. Apparently nobody took any interest in him before. Nobody would then have given him a great deal of publicity. It does not mean that because he was such an insignificant person these things which are bound up with the deed he committed did not have to be investigated and reviewed closely. I have here the speech of the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. member has brought the matter into this debate. The manner in which the hon. member raised and dealt with the matter here, represents nothing but an attempt to infuse some spirit into this unsuccessful no-confidence debate of theirs. In actual fact, to many people the findings of this Commission were reassuring and they were satisfied by them. But because nothing sensational came to light really, the report was also disappointing to others. I wonder whether the Opposition would not have liked something terribly sensational to have come to light. As a matter of fact, the report produced nothing but, for example, in the first instance, the following. There was no organized attempt and there was no link between Tsafendas and any other organizations before he committed this deed. Secondly, there was indeed negligence in some departments, not only in one department. Some officials made mistakes within the normal routine of human actions, but these were not deliberate. That was brought out very clearly. Then the Commissioner mentions a few of the departments, and one of them is the Department of the Interior. He mentions five officials of that Department. Not one of them was a highly placed or highly paid official or one carrying heavy responsibility. They were all officials in a lower salary group. The minimum qualification for employment for most of these officials is only standard seven. We should like to appoint only people with matriculation certificates in such posts, but they are simply unobtainable and consequently we have to use some of the other people. I take it that those people are necessary to-day to continue the work in all the services in the entire Public Service. Not only in the Public Service, but also in private enterprise employers are forced, as a result of over-employment, the greater demand for employees and the low unemployment position prevailing at present, to employ people whose training is such that they cannot, in fact, perform their duties in a very responsible manner.</p>

<p>Now I want to say briefly that I do not want to exonerate these people. Nobody can defend negligence or find fault with the findings of the Commission in respect of what it found had been going on in my Department. Nobody can say that those conditions did not exist. Nobody can find fault with those findings. It is a factual state of affairs. But to get the right perspective one also has to look at the background. More than 1,000 permanent officials are employed in this Department. That is apart from the temporary officials. They have approximately one million files in their possession. When Immigration and Customs and Excise was transferred to that Department in 1962, they brought 233,000 files with them. As I say, the Department already had about one million files at that time. The additional files had to be incorporated, tabulated and coordinated. It is an almost impossible task if one considers the relatively small staff, and, moreover, the files go back many years.</p>

<p>I should like to put right a few facts in connection with this matter, as well as in connection with the report of the Commission. The hon. member tried to create the impression&#x2014;or rather, he made the accusation&#x2014;that Ministers did not care or know anything about what happened in their various departments. He made a special point of conceding that I, as the new Minister of the Interior, had been in charge of this Department for only a short time, and that the worst misdemeanours had in fact occurred before my time. He consequently laid the blame on my predecessor.</p>

<p>As regards ministerial control of, interest in and responsibility for the various departments, there is to my knowledge not one single Minister who can be accused of ever having failed in his duty in that regard. Least of all can it be said of my predecessor. Both this House and the country know him, and I think it is uncalled for to label him in this House as one who did not know what was going on in his department, because the most terrible things are supposed to have happened there. I now want to show hon. members how my predecessor always gave his full attention to possible deficiencies within his own department and to the streamlining and reorganization of his department.</p>

<p>The hon. member simply does not know what is going on in Government departments; that is why he says that. My real objection to the Opposition has nothing to do with their criticism, but with the fact that their criticism is so useless and fruitless because it is not based on facts and knowledge.</p>

<p>What about the Judge&#x2019;s criticism?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Judge recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that a work study investigation into the organization and methods of the Department of the Interior be instituted. The hon. member said that I had stated that such an organization and methods work study had been introduced three years ago and he held that up as proof of terrible inefficiency and negligence and dozens of other weaknesses and shortcomings in the Department, particularly <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0153"/>in respect of the control of files, registration and so forth. But if the hon. member had known more about the functioning of the Public Service, he would surely have known that the Public Service Commission&#x2014;which also falls under the Minister of the Interior&#x2014;introduced these organization and methods study groups to bring about greater productivity, greater efficiency, better organization and better functioning in the Public Service and to check this constant and, as the Opposition alleges year after year, excessive enlargement of the Public Service. Every department gets the opportunity to train and instruct people in the department specifically for those purposes in order that they in turn may become the instructors and the heads to ensure the smooth working of the organization. That organization and methods study group, led by one of the Public Service officials, has been working in the Department of the Interior for the past three years. But it is not an investigation that is being instituted, as many members of the public think and as one may incorrectly infer from newspaper reports. It is a study group whose aim and task it is to ensure, through proper streamlining of the organization and the working methods, that the work is done properly and efficiently and that any possibility of inefficiency within a department is eliminated as far as possible. The study group is not only making a study of what is wrong, but it is also implementing certain things as it goes along. Many things are being implemented, not only in that departments, but also in other Government departments. They will have to continue with this work all the time in future in order to streamline the Public Service properly and to make and to keep it the most efficient service in the world.</p>

<p>Apart from the study group which is working in the Department and giving guidance and introducing new methods, my predecessor, to mention an example, wrote a letter to the Secretary for the Department on 14th May, 1965&#x2014;when this group was already engaged on its work. He did so because certain matters had come to his notice as a result of complaints lodged by the public, and otherwise. There had been complaints of delays in replying to letters, that applications for visas, passports and the like were not being dealt with expeditiously and satisfactorily, and so forth. I shall now read to you what the then Minister of the Interior wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not want to create the impression for one moment that I adopt an unsympathetic attitude as regards the staff problems experienced by the Department, or that I expect you to give your personal attention to each individual matter. But I do feel that I want to express a few thoughts in this connection in all kindness. It seems to me as though the time has arrived for your parliamentary staff, here in Cape Town as well as in Pretoria, to devise some system or other for keeping a complete record of all representations forwarded to the Department for attention.</block>

<p>Here is a specific suggestion made by him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If no reply is received within 14 days, it will be necessary to ascertain by telex what the reason for the delay is and when a reply can be expected. You will know that I forward most matters to you for attention before receipt of the letters is acknowledged. If, therefore, I receive a reply from the Department within 14 days, it will be possible to furnish the person who made the representations with a reply or a provisional reply, but if not, why should I simply say: &#x201C;I have received your letter&#x201D; and thus dispose of the matter?</block>

<p>What followed upon that? What followed upon that was, <i>inter alia</i>, that &#x201C;immediately after receiving Minister De Klerk&#x2019;s instructions on 14th May, 1965, the Secretary for the Interior carried out his wishes. Complete and proper records have to be kept&#x201D;. That was done and it is still the position at present. &#x201C;Complete and proper records have to be kept, in the parliamentary office as well as at head office, of all postal articles received from the Minister, so that no delays can arise in replying thereto and there can be no reason for complaints about delays. It was then arranged that a census survey of all files in all the offices be made every Wednesday and submitted to the Records Section, and that has resulted in the tracing of files being greatly facilitated and expedited. It then also became possible to deal with correspondence more expeditiously.&#x201D; I mention this merely as an example.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to Tsafendas. How did Tsafendas come to the notice of the Department? He again came specifically to the notice of the Department before he committed this deed. He could have been brought to the notice of the Department by means of a police report or a report from the Security Police. He could also have come to our notice as a result of the fact that my own Department obtains information on cases where we have doubt. The two files on Tsafendas were among the 233,000 files in the Department which had not yet been correlated; we have other files. Our local control officer here was requested to grant a reclassification to Tsafendas in the first instance. Tsafendas wanted to be reclassified as being a &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; instead of a &#x201C;White&#x201D;. The control officer thereupon had the matter investigated and found that owing to Tsafendas&#x2019;s connections, his attitude and his association with non-Whites he was an undesirable person, and as a result of that it was ascertained that he had been granted permanent residence. Because he had been granted permanent residence by the Department of Immigration, which does not fall under my Department and for which the Department of the Interior is not responsible, there was no alternative <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0154"/>but to ask that he should remain here and be reclassified or that he should be deported. No submission was made to me in respect of Tsafendas to the effect that he should be deported for reasons of security. The deportation order was issued because he was considered not to be an asset to this country, and because of his actions. No criminal record was submitted to me at that stage. I decided to sign the deportation order because he would not be an asset to South Africa and also because he was not a citizen of this country. Contrary to what is stated in the report, those files were forwarded to me from Pretoria on 4th August. The files reached my secretary on 8th August and he forwarded them to my office that evening. The next day, the 9th. I saw the files, dealt with them and returned them to him; on 10th August he forwarded the files to the deputy secretary responsible for that section; he too was in Cape Town, and he forwarded them to head office that same day. Strangely enough it took those files four days to reach Cape Town from Pretoria by mail bag. The files reached Pretoria only on the 17th.</p>

Hon. members should, however, remember that Tsafendas&#x2019;s case was not regarded as an extremely urgent one which had to be dealt with speedily so that he could be deported immediately.

<p>A communist?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He was a communist in the days when the United Party was in power. The fact that he had leanings towards Communism was known even in the days when the United Party was still in power. He had been refused entry, but he had entered the country illegally. He was convicted here, but in spite of that he was detained here for several months under a permit for temporary residence because he had done active war service. There are many people in the country who have leanings towards Communism. If we have to adopt leanings towards Communism as our criterion for deportation, I wonder how many people, including members of the United Party, will have to be deported. It is very easy to say somebody has leanings towards Communism, but when is he a communist and when does he merely have leanings towards Communism? [Interjections.] That was a report which came from Portugal. But the deportation order was issued irrespective of that. A letter addressed to the police was signed on 1st September. They had various addresses of this person, and on the 2nd it was ascertained that the address in the letter addressed to the police was not the correct one, and the letter was then retyped. That was on the 2nd. The 3rd was a Saturday, the 4th a Sunday, the 5th a Monday, a holiday, and the 6th was the Tuesday on which the murder was committed. Hon. members will realize what a concurrence of circumstances there was. Immediately after the murder had been committed, the Secretary for the Department came to me and said that we should possibly have more information about the person than the information I had before me when I signed the deportation order. I immediately gave instructions that an investigation should be made and that all files should be examined to see what information the Department had about anybody who as much as smelt of Tsafendas. This they did.</p>

<p>Secondly, and this followed immediately, we issued a Press statement in this connection as soon as I knew that the Public Service Commission was going to have the investigation instituted. I made a statement to the Press on 20th September, before this Commission was appointed, that I had requested the Public Service Commission to have a very thorough investigation instituted into any matter in the Department which might in any way be related to negligence in the Department, and so forth. On the 21st the Public Service Commission appointed the person concerned, an exinspector of the Public Service Commission, Mr. De Vos Pienaar, the present deputy secretary for the Department of Customs and Excise and an extremely competent person who has experience of that type of work, because he was the Chief Inspector of the Public Service Commission for many years. He submitted a report to me, dated 1st October, 1966. I have the report here, but I have never laid eyes on the report. I did not want to see it either: I was not interested in it, not until a week before this Report of the Commission was submitted to the House. Instructions were issued, however, that this report should be made available to the Commission in its entirety so that the latter would have it as a guide; and I can give you the assurance that if you read these two reports you will see that all the factual findings of Mr. Pienaar have been summarized and incorporated in the report of the Commission. That was what we did immediately. If any further action has to be taken, it is, as the Secretary for the Department said in his statement yesterday, a matter for each Government Department itself to decide what steps should be taken, if any, against these people in connection with the charges of omission, negligence and irresponsibility made against them here. If any action is to be taken against such persons, it will be taken under the Public Service Act. But it is not for my Department to concern itself with the actions of other departments. I shall certainly give proper attention to my own Department.</p>

<p><span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0155"/>Where does the idea come from, and why must it be suggested to the world, that the Ministers are not interested in their Departments, that they merely sit idle and do only what is absolutely necessary, but nothing more? If that were the case, do you think the Public Service in South Africa would be held in such high esteem by everyone in the country as it is? Because surely the Public Service Commission alone, and the integrity of the people alone, are not the only factors to be taken into account when one talks of what progress they have made in the Service. I want to quote one final passage from Mr. De Klerk&#x2019;s letter to the Department. He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection I want to make an appeal to the political sensibility of the officials in the Department.</block>

<p>There are certain minor matters which they think cannot have any political significance, and they should realize that those are not matters they can sit and mull over. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Please note, I am not asking officials to throw their political convictions overboard, but I am asking officials to develop a political sense in matters they are dealing with daily and can bring to my notice by submitting them to me. Co-operation of this nature forms a firm bond between a Minister and his Department. It is also absolutely essential for the efficient functioning of the Department.</block>

<p>That is the language used, that is the spirit, that is also the sense of responsibility that is displayed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister stated that we had raised this matter of the Van Wyk Report in order to put life into this debate. I would say that if there was no other evidence of incompetence on the part of the Government than is shown in that report, it would fully justify this debate and our motion.</p>

<p>It is true that the present Minister of the Interior has only been in this Department for about six months, but I would say that since then his actions speak very loudly indeed of great incompetence. I should like to pause there for one moment before dealing with the wider aspects of the report.</p>

<p>In the first place, we know now that it is not due to his incompetence that he was not in the House when this matter was raised by the hon. member for Transkei, but the incompetence of someone whom we regarded as most efficient, namely the hon. the Chief Whip, because the latter was in fact told several hours before the hon. member for Transkei spoke that this matter was going to be raised. Indeed, we began to wonder who was running this Department, because in this morning&#x2019;s newspaper, we had a statement from the Secretary for the Department that there may possibly be an inquiry into the findings of negligence. But we did not expect to receive that information from the Secretary for the Department; we expected to receive it from the man responsible, the Minister. We have drawn attention to this matter before, that statements of this kind should come from the Minister responsible. We are glad to know now from the Minister that there is to be a departmental inquiry so far as the Department of the Interior is concerned. That is something we did not know before. Sir, perhaps the most disturbing thing we have seen from this hon. Minister is his attitude to the importance of this Commission&#x2019;s report. This is the report of a much respected Judge of our courts, and it has brought in the gravest findings of incompetence, as the hon. the Minister has himself said, &#x201C;in some Departments&#x201D;. So much is this so that newspapers throughout the country have given this the widest publicity, and the hon. the Minister had the nerve to suggest that if this had not occurred in relation to such an important man, we virtually would never have known of these matters and no publicity would have been given to it. This is a most serious state of affairs because all the indications are that if a similar inquiry had been made in regard to the death of some quite unknown person, the same state of affairs might have been revealed. There is nothing to suggest that this is a particular situation relating only to this one particular alien. So although this Minister has been in charge of this Department for only a short time, I suggest that he already has forfeited our confidence completely. So far as the report itself is concerned, and the negligence during the period when the hon. the Minister was in fact in charge of this Department, he attempted in this House to give us an explanation for it. In regard to the relevant period, this is the actual finding of the Commissioner. He says that under all these circumstances it is clear that the delay from 14th December, 1965, to 6th September, 1966, is indefensible. The Minister has attempted to defend himself, but we have the finding that it is quite indefensible.</p>

<p>This whole question of the incompetence of the Government, if it rested on the findings of this Judge alone, would be more than justified. But when this motion was moved we actually had a reaction of mirth from many Ministers opposite, even from the hon. the Prime Minister. There have been countless cases of this incompetence brought home and now in this report we find many more. We find in regard <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_0156"/>to five important actions of state that there has been serious incompetence in certain departments. First of all in November, 1963, in regard to the permit for temporary sojourn; in January, 1964, in regard to the permit for permanent residence; in June, 1964, in regard to the visa to go to Rhodesia and Mozambique and back; in March, 1965, in regard to the question of the re-entry at Durban and in 1966 in regard to the removal order. Mr. Speaker, in regard to all these matters it is most distressing and disturbing to find that there has been action falling far short of the standards which we have come to accept from our Public Service. Often this has clearly been due to bad procedures of earlier times under this Government.</p>

<p>Apart from the Departments of Immigration and Interior, which are affected by the points I touched upon previously, we have heard the hon. member for Transkei point to serious ineptitudes on the part of the Department of Police. I should like to add an additional one to these. It was accepted by the highest person in the Security Police that he and his Department had a responsibility for the security of the Prime Minister. Who should have known better of the possible dangers to the life of the Prime Minister than this very department? I say that they therefore surely owed a high duty to the hon. the late Prime Minister to take special steps for his protection and to warn any officials in this House of any special danger.</p>

<p>There are not any findings in this Report upon the point, but there certainly are suggestions to the effect that the Department of Labour also was at fault. It is not clear that the Department of Labour sent this man to Parliament but it is quite clear that as late as a month before he came here, he was in fact being sent to positions by the Department of Labour. We have had it here this afternoon from the hon. Minister himself who says that at the time he signed the order in August, 1966. he was not aware that this man was working here.</p>

<p>It is quite clear from the evidence set out in this Report and in the light of the answers we have had that there are several Ministers responsible for most serious neglect and most serious failures. There have been dreadful lapses that have had dire consequences and I suggest that in the circumstances it is only right that those responsible should see the seriousness of these lapses and the consequences, and tender their resignations. If there is any resentment at this, I can only say that anything less would be an indication that there is a falling of standards. There is no doubt that in a situation like this, where we in South Africa have come to expect and demand the highest standards of our Ministers, it is only right, whether it was they or those in their Departments who have let them down who were responsible, that they should attest to those standards by offering their resignations. In this connection one thinks of the previous and the present Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Immigration and, I regret to say, the then Minister of Police. Mr. Speaker, nothing less than that will show the seriousness of the revelations of this Report and will adequately indicate that the Government approaches these in the shocked way that the country does. If the Cabinet and members opposite are quite complacent, it is only a more shocking testimony to this fall in standards. In Japan people who let their country down would in the old days have committed hara-kiri. In the western world Ministers offer resignations, and we wait to see them come.</p>

<p>The Van Wyk Commission rendered a considerable service to South Africa. Its greatest service will only bear fruit if in fact the Cabinet wake up and see that their various departments give the work and service of which they are capable. I am not encouraged by the response to think that there will be a sufficient waking up and shaking up in this regard; but it is most necessary. Apart from that, this Commission has done valuable things. It has certainly killed many rumours and wild stories. It has killed the rumour and story that there was some master brain or organization behind this matter. The Commissioner has found that it was probably the act of Tsafendas and of no one else.</p>

<p>This Report touches upon the countless factors which may have played upon this madman&#x2019;s mind but if there is one thing that the Commission has done, it certainly has given us a close look at Government departments and given us warnings that things cannot go on in them as they are at present. The hon. the Minister of the Interior virtually said that had it not been such an important man, there would have been no inquiry and that none of this would have come out. But it is most important and it is a service that we have been able to have this revealed because it gives us a chance to put our house in order again as it should be. People who have had to wait long periods of time to receive answers from Government departments will not be surprised by some of the findings in this Report and it is all too regrettable that this type of situation had to occur. I do not know whether this is due to staff shortage. In the Report there is evidence that there is a shortage of staff. There is evidence that the work has increased greatly since about 1961-&#x2019;62 and that no staff increases have been made. There is evidence too that apparently the staff are not working overtime in these particular departments. It is very difficult to know exactly what the position is, and I suggest that this is a matter which requires the most urgent attention. It may well be that we are not paying the right salaries to attract the people we need in these most important and vital positions in the service of our country, namely our State Service. It may well be that we are paying not nearly enough to the top men so that they will have the skill to evolve the techniques and the organization and the methods which will make anything of <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0157"/>this kind a thing of the past. We have got to get those men and we hope we have them.</p>

<p>We probably have in many cases but we have got to be sure that they will be there tomorrow as well as to-day. I suggest that here is a most serious onus upon the Government to look into this matter.</p>

<p>This Report reveals many things which are disturbing, the least of them perhaps is the individuals who neglected to do their duty. In this case, serious though it was, these can perhaps be errors and to err is human. But it is worrying that in so many cases and apparently with so few exceptions we have found these errors in this particular case. I referred to the temporary permit, the permanent residence, the visa to go out, the return and the deportation order. One might say almost all the activities that related to Tsafendas&#x2019; movements were attended by incompetence and neglect. This aspect certainly points to the need for greater efficiency and a drive for greater efficiency in all departments.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a second aspect, namely that the methods revealed in this Report are such that one department is taking decisions when it does not have vital information which other departments have. It is as if the right hand of Government does not know what the left hand is doing. Even within one department itself we have the position that they do not know the full picture. We have the case where files upon a man are called for, and only some available in one particular department are brought forward. This has been shown in part to have been due to bad filing systems. This is a great responsibility for the Minister at the top, namely to see that his methods are right. It is in part due to inefficient operation of the filing systems. There was the omission to enter cross-references which led to files being overlooked, and all that type of thing. There was the failure to give instructions that there should be cross-referencing. The Commissioner states that there were at least three occasions when, had there been correct practices, they would have led to our being rid of this man. These three occasions are quite apart from the three occasions where there was error on the part of the individual officials, which I have mentioned. Even the Security Police had trouble in finding the file on this man, which was in their very own building at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the third aspect is the inordinate delay in relation to the removal order. Again, had that delay not been there, this man would have been out of the country. We find that from the 21st January, 1966, to the 1st July, 1966, nothing whatever was done in regard to this man&#x2019;s removal, notwithstanding the fact that there had been a recommendation for his removal by the representative of the Department in Cape Town. No wonder, Sir, that the Commissioner says that this total delay to which I have previously referred, namely from the 14th December, 1965, to the 6th September, 1966, is quite indefensible.</p>

<p>Lastly there is the failure to call for the Police report, which the Commissioner says is most essential, and the disregard of the regulation requiring the birth certificate. Both of these matters, if attended to, would have prevented this sad occurrence.</p>

<p>It is clear that several departments are implicated, namely Interior, Immigration and Police. As regards Labour, it is not certain exactly what their position is. The Commissioner did not have time to go into every aspect. But the probability seems to be that this man was going to seek work at places indicated to him by the Labour Department. There is the statement in the report that it is likely&#x2014;I think &#x201C;probable&#x201D;, the Commissioner says&#x2014;that in this case Tsafendas thought of the possibility of getting a situation at the House of Assembly through other unemployed people at the Labour Department. But again, if the Labour Department had had the knowledge which other State Departments had, there would surely have been a note on the file of the Labour Department that this was a man that must be watched, indeed deported, and therefore there would have been no question that he could have been sent to previous jobs at the instigation of the Labour Department.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have indicated that there is no reason whatsoever to be complacent. There is nothing here to suggest that this is a sole exceptional case. To our horror it seems likely to be extremely prevalent. One knows that in fact staff move from one department to another, and so, if there is inefficiency at one place at one time, it can move. The methods of filing are probably similar in departments, and one wonders whether the practices are any better in different departments. I have mentioned how the public often have to wait for a long time before they receive replies to letters.</p>

<p>There was some scoffing in this House when it was mentioned that the Johannesburg City Council had employed an expert from outside to inquire into efficiency. I would say that one is a fool if one will not seek the advice of the best consultants. The country has done this in regard to its road systems and in many other things. I suggest that there may well be a case for it to be done here. In fact, we know that an investigation has been going on in the Department of the Interior for three years. It is being done by an officer of the Department. He may be a very good officer, but it does not add to one&#x2019;s confidence to know that this matter has been dragging on for three years. It seems to have been occurring at a time of great inefficiency. It does not appear to have remedied the defects that are there.</p>

<p>There is one small mystery&#x2014;it may be an important mystery&#x2014;which I should like the hon. the Minister or another Minister to clear up. On page 11 of the Report of the Commission, in paragraph 69, there is this important disconnected statement:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_0158"/>On 17th June he (Tsafendas) was examined by Dr. Kossew, the district surgeon, whose finding was that he was suffering from a serious form of schizophrenia.</block>

<p>This was the district surgeon who did the examination. He found that there was a serious form of schizophrenia. Less than a fortnight later this man was able to come into employment in this House. What I would like to ask the Government is, why did the man Tsafendas go to see the district surgeon on that day? It is not explained or probed into anywhere in the report. Who sent him? What department perhaps sent Tsafendas to see the district surgeon? If Social Welfare and Pensions sent that man, then I should like to know too what happened to that report of the district surgeon, acting as a Government official in this capacity, and why it was not acted upon and what was done in relation to it? What action was taken on this report? This is a serious finding that was made. It is one which may have required immediate incarceration. This seems to be an aspect of Government incompetence which is not touched upon in this report, probably because it was in some way thought not important to the main theme. But I can well believe that it can be most important to establish incompetence on the part of the Government. I should like very definitely to have a reply on that point. Because, after this finding, this man appeared to have carried on in the ordinary way. He carried on. He walked about. He sought employment. There is no sign of any action taken following that report. Indeed, he came seeking a job at this very House of Parliament, and in fact he was taken on 14 days later.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one can move to a conclusion. I think that we can certainly as a country know that a job has been well done in this Report.</p>

<p>Not every point could be covered&#x2014;clearly it would have taken too long. In fact, the hon. Commissioner brought in his Report very swiftly, and in many places he says that he was not going into other things.</p>

<p>There is one important thing that he says which, I think, we should also take to heart when we are increasing security and reacting powerfully to the advice of this Report. As the Commissioner says, &#x201C;One should not in future see a potential assassin in every person.&#x201D; It would be wrong for us to be driven to that other extreme and in any way lose the fine balance which was preserved by the country immediately after this dreadful deed.</p>

<p>With that statement of the Commission one can agree in full. But equally we must admit&#x2014;and the Government, above all, must admit, and their supporters must cheer them on and, if they do not admit, jeer them on&#x2014;that there are some very bad and worrying things contained in this Report. I was very glad to hear the hon. member for Innesdal admit this. If the hon. member admits it, then they truly are there.</p>

<p>We trust that the Government will at once start grappling with the recommendations contained in this report and the faults which it says were found. But better still, Mr. Speaker, let the Government admit that they are a government of old and tired men and let them make way for others younger keen and able to do the job.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand the hon. member for Pinelands at all. He is, like me, a member who is relatively young in years, and it is beyond my comprehension that he levelled the charge at the Government in his speech that this was a Government of old men who should make way for young men&#x2014;apparently young men such as the hon. members occupying the front benches opposite.</p>

<p>What did the hon. member try to do in his speech? Throughout his speech he tried to create the impression that the Minister of the Interior and the Government did not take a serious view of the negligence in various Departments referred to in the Report of the Commission. That is what he tried to imply even after the Minister of the Interior had expressly said in this House that every disciplinary action would be taken when necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>What the Commissioner had found, according to his Report, was merely that type of negligence occurring in a Government Department from time to time, negligence on the part of various people. This is not only true as regards the Tsafendas case, but there are also other cases. There are always cases of negligence in the Public Service in respect of which the Department concerned takes action against the offenders. This is not only done once in a while but repeatedly. As regards the Public Service, the hon. member quite rightly pointed out that its activities had increased tremendously during the past number of years, while, in actual fact, a restriction had been placed on any extension of staff. He said that it was a pity that that was so, especially where he had learned that the people did not work overtime. The worst problem with which we are faced in the Public Service at the present time is the fact that a large number of inexperienced beginners, or otherwise pensioners, have to be employed in many instances, and that the senior staff, those responsible for supervision, have to work overtime on a tremendous scale virtually without exception, and that without additional remuneration.</p>

<p>The burden on the supervisory staff in the Public Service is simply becoming too heavy and it is becoming too heavy for the very reason that the Government has tried to save on its expenditure in that regard over the past number of years. If there is indeed a problem, that problem is to be found in the <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0159"/>fact that supervision is not what is to be desired, and that is so because it is physically impossible for the senior staff to give the necessary attention to the activities of the individual officials in their Departments, something which is of course to be desired.</p>

<p>For that reason, Mr. Speaker, one has to accept that in a developing country such as ours there will from time to time be cases of negligence in the departments on the part of junior officials. This happens from day to day and one tries to combat it as far as one possibly can.</p>

<p>It is not true that the Government views this in a less serious light. Every time any form of carelessness or negligence is revealed, the official concerned is called to account by the Department and by the Minister. Mr. Speaker, the entire argument advanced by the hon. member was merely a smoke-screen to envelop the arguments of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I actually rose in my seat to deal with the speech made by the hon. member for Peninsula the other day. The hon. member is a senior member of this House, both in years and period of service in this House. However, the hon. member made a speech here the other day which was not worthy of any backbencher making his debut in this House. I am now going to deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments one by one and to the best of my ability and I am going to point out to him that if he wants to make allegations in this House, allegations receiving a great deal of publicity in South Africa and abroad, he should first of all make sure that his facts are correct.</p>

<p>The hon. member began his speech by alleging that because of its proclamation of group areas and the re-settlement of people, the Government was offending communities and disrupting the lives of people who had been settled in certain places for many years, without affording them an opportunity of being heard. But that is not the case. In every single instance of the proclamation of a group area, proposals relating thereto are advertised prior to such an area being proclaimed and all interested parties are invited to make representations after such advertisements have appeared. In other words, every one who wants to make representations is afforded the opportunity to do so. What more does the hon. member want? Does the hon. member want that we should go to every Coloured, to every White, to every Indian and to every Bantu who may be affected personally and ask him for his individual opinion? Surely the hon. member knows that something like that is quite impossible. The truth of the matter is, Sir, that every one who is going to be affected by the proclamation of a group area has the opportunity to give evidence before that area is proclaimed a group area. To allege here that they are not heard, is not true.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that. I said that there was not sufficient consultation with the leaders of the Coloured people of the villages concerned and I challenge you to prove that there was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The leaders of the Coloured communities of the places mentioned by him, and every other place, have had every opportunity to put their case when evidence was being heard. They have had every opportunity and in most instances they have also done so. I do not know whether that happened in those specific instances, but if it did not happen it means that those people have not made use of the right which they have. Then he cannot blame the Government for that.</p>

<p>Let us examine the instances to which the hon. member referred. He mentioned two villages, namely Sir Lowry&#x2019;s Pass Village and Temperance. Both these places are small villages inhabited by a small number of persons, who under the circumstances would never have been able to have the elementary facilities in their residential areas, facilities which any community is entitled to have in its residential area. Those people are living in slum conditions. The hon. member wants to perpetuate those conditions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He wants to deprive those people of the right to be absorbed into a community where they can obtain the facilities, the privileges and the benefits to which a community is entitled.</p>

<p>Take the case of Temperance. It is a small private township where the owner&#x2019;s farm labourers lived originally. He subsequently let it to Coloureds. There one finds absolute slum conditions, conditions under which the Coloureds can never obtain ownership. We are now going to place them in a group area for Coloureds where they can obtain ownership, where they will have a bioscope hall in their vicinity, where they will have communal facilities, where they will have a church and a school, where they will eventually be able to take a hand in their own local authority, things which would never have been possible in Temperance. I do not think I need go any further into that.</p>

<p>I now come to other matters raised by him. He said that the Government was indulging in petty apartheid in the implementation of its policy and he mentioned certain instances. He mentioned the instance of the cricket teams which played at the Green Point Stadium not so long ago, namely Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira&#x2019;s cricket team and the invitation team of the Western Province. He alleged that in spite of the fact that there were hundreds of Whites and hundreds of young White boys who would have liked to attend such a match to watch Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira, who is a good cricketer, this Government was so shortsighted and so petty that it only issued a permit for 30 persons to attend that match. I have here with me the letter of application; <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0160"/>two applications were received in actual fact. In the first place the Western Province Cricket Union for Coloureds applied for permission to play at the Green Point Stadium and to admit Coloureds there. That permit was issued to them immediately. The organizer, Mr. Bansda, subsequently wrote a letter to the Department in which he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On behalf of the above cricket board I wish to hereby apply for 30 permits to allow Europeans to attend the big cricket match at the Green Point Track on the 21st and 22nd January between Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira&#x2019;s Invitation Eleven and a Western Province Invitation South African Eleven. The 30 guests will be drawn from the leading sportsmen of the Western Province&#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, they only asked for a permit for 30 invited Whites whom they wished to admit. They never asked for a permit to admit White spectators. If they had asked for such a permit I would have issued it because in Beaufort West, where they did not even play a cricket match, but only gave an exhibition, they asked for a permit to admit White spectators which I granted without another word. In this case I would have granted it without another word if they had asked for it. However, if an organization such as this tells me that it wishes to invite just 30 selected Whites to a function, I am not going to compel it to open its gates to Whites; it is that organization&#x2019;s concern whom it wants at its function.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<p>Is it not a fact that nearly 1,000 Whites were refused admission?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not my fault. It is the fault of that cricket organization, the Western Province Cricket Union, because on various other occasions that organization asked for permits to admit Whites to matches where Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira was playing, and I granted those permits in every case. They did not have the slightest reason to think that I would have refused, because if there are separate facilities for such matches, permits are granted. It is completely unfair at this stage to want to blame the Government or to want to blame me.</p>

<p>Let us proceed; the hon. member referred to the case of the Eoan Group, about which he had written to me. I want to give a brief outline to this House of the history of the Eoan Group&#x2019;s presentation of &#x201C;Oklahoma&#x201D; in the Alhambra Theatre. On 24th August my Department received a letter from the management of the Eoan Group in which it was, <i>inter alia</i>, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As part of the programme, the Group, working in concert with the Trust, is planning to present at the Alhambra Theatre in Cape Town, a suitable musical production of high quality over a season of two weeks. The Alhambra Theatre with its accoutrements and facilities is the only real theatre equipped to meet the requirements of a musical production such as envisaged by the Group. Most present-day musicals require no less than 10 to 12 scene changes demanding immense technical resources, features which are non-existent in other venues not originally designed as theatres.</block>

<p>Now, the following is what is important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All performances at the Alhambra Theatre will be to White audiences only but consideration is being given to the possibility of the same production being performed for Coloured audiences only at the Luxurama Theatre at Wynberg&#x2026;</block>

<p>This is their original letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but this, no doubt, will have to be on a much reduced scale for reasons as stated in the preceding paragraph.</block>

<p>On the grounds of this I issued a permit to them at their request allowing them to give a performance for Whites in the Alhambra Theatre and added that to my mind it would be unreasonable and unfair of them to have a performance for Whites only; that they should go out of their way to have performances for Coloureds as well. In pursuance thereof the Department again received a letter from them on 19th October, in which they requested a permit to use the Alhambra because the City Hall was the only other available hall and because it would be too expensive to present it there. In this letter they stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Investigations have revealed that the Luxurama Theatre is not available due to previous reservations and that apart from the Alhambra Theatre the only other suitable venue is the City Hall, Cape Town.</block>

<p>I thereupon instructed my officials to negotiate with the owner of the Luxurama and on 24th November I instructed them to write as follows&#x2014;;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been ascertained that the Luxurama Theatre is still available for the 24th, 30th and 31st January and the 1st February.</block>

<p>Nowhere in their letter did they ever use the argument that the Luxurama was not suitable and that it would be too expensive. It was only afterwards, after that hon. member had written to me, that the argument was advanced that it would be too expensive to <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0161"/>use the Luxurama. But what has happened in the meantime? The hon. member addressed this House on Wednesday and in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Wednesday evening the following advertisement appeared &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Luxurama: Booking now open. The Eoan Group presents Roger and Hammerstein&#x2019;s &#x201C;Oklahoma&#x201D; with a cast of over 70&#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the entire production, &#x201C;not reduced&#x201D; as they had originally said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; for two shows only, January 30th and 31st.</block>

<p>That was Wednesday evening. I shall now quote from last night&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Luxurama: Monday and Tuesday, 30th and 31st January, sold out.</block>

<p>You must remember, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member said here that the Coloureds could not get to the Luxurama; that there was no transport for them to the Luxurama&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Due to the fantastic demand for seats we are compelled to have two extra performances on Wednesday and Thursday, 1st and 2nd February.</block>

<p>Consider what I have done. I refused to allow them to give one evening performance for Coloureds at the Alhambra, where 1,931 Coloureds could attend the performance, and I forced them&#x2014;and that is what they did&#x2014;to give a performance for four evenings in the Luxurama Theatre, where a total number of 5,400 seats are available to them. This is the injustice we are doing the Coloureds, according to that hon. member! Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell you this&#x2014;I think that hon. member already knows it. I am not talking now of the Trust of the Eoan Group of which that hon. member&#x2019;s son is a member, but what I am saying is that the management of the Eoan Group has dissociated itself from that hon. member&#x2019;s conduct in regard to the Eoan Group. I think the hon. member is aware of it. I understand that the hon. member is engaged in important discussions; he is free to leave the Chamber now.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Durban (Point). The hon. member discussed housing here and accused the Government of having failed to provide housing for Whites, particularly in the lower income groups. He said that building costs were too high for the family man to acquire a dwelling and that the number of dwellings which were being provided were not even sufficient for immigrants entering the country, and on those grounds he tried to build up a strong case. Subsequently he also tried to prove his statements with a wealth of figures. Let me put it clearly that the State, through its National Housing Commission, which is responsible for the provision of housing for the lower income groups, or more accurately, which renders assistance in connection with the provision of housing for the lower income groups, is not responsible for the provision of housing for the entire population, White or non-White in South Africa. The State can never accept responsibility for that. The responsibility of the State does not go beyond assistance in respect of the provision of housing for the lower income groups. Recently I caused a demographic survey to be made which revealed that 64 per cent of the Whites fell within the category of those to whom assistance is rendered by the National Housing Commission. But of that 64 per cent it is not every one who appeals to the State for assistance in regard to housing. Many of those people see to their own accommodation or live in old existing dwellings which are already available. Experience has taught us that approximately 30 per cent of the population in the urban areas calls on the Department or on a local authority for assistance in regard to housing. I must emphasize again that it is not the State only which is responsible for housing.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that rates of interest and building costs were too high for the ordinary family man to acquire a dwelling. I have already said by way of interjection that building costs were decreasing; it has been my experience in the Department of Community Development as well as in the Department of Public Works that tenders have begun to reveal a downward trend in recent months. To bring about a downward trend in tender prices by means of building control, etc., is something we have been striving for in recent years.</p>

<p>In respect of houses as well?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in respect of houses as well. A downward trend is now beginning to reveal itself whereas there was an upward trend in the past. Because we are aware of the higher housing costs and because we are aware of the fact that people are finding it more difficult, in view of the higher rates of interest and higher building costs, to help themselves, we raised the qualifications figure in August of last year. Where the income of a family with two children used to be fixed at a maximum of R180 per month in order for such family to qualify, we have raised the maximum to R220 per month. And for a family with more than two children we have raised it from R250 to R300, but that the hon. member omitted to mention.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the hon. member omitted to say that we took those very <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0162"/>steps at that time in order to provide in those needs. The hon. <b>member tried to prove that</b> we were not doing enough for the lower income group and he maintained that over the past five years we had only built 12,000 dwellings for Whites, and 170,000 dwellings for non-Whites. What is he trying to achieve? It is the old story that this Government is doing everything for the non-Whites and is neglecting the Whites. But what he omitted to say was that the percentage <b>of non-Whites falling</b> within the income groups for which, by statute, the National Housing Commission should make provision, is far greater than the percentage of Whites, and for that reason it is inevitable that one has to make more provision for non-Whites. He also omitted to <b>men</b>tion that it was we who had to clear the slum conditions we inherited from them. We had to clear Cato Manor and Windermere and Sophiatown and all the other places, and we had to accommodate thousands of those people before we could make provision for a small number of Whites in those places. That is the reason why those removals had to take place before one could make <b>a start with White development there. But let us glance at</b> the figures. He said that we had constructed 12,000 houses only over the past five years. He had the statement supplied by my Department at his disposal, but even so he could not even <b>add up the number of years correct</b>ly. It is not five years but six. I said here last year, and so did my predecessor, that a shortage of housing had developed because the local authorities had neglected their duty and the State had to step in to spur them on. Just consider this figure of 12,000. In the four years between 1960-&#x2019;61 to 1963-&#x2019;64 the total built by the State and local authorities was 5,629, not with subsidies from the State as he maintained, but with full loans from the State. That is an average of 1,400 per year. But between 1964-&#x2019;65 and 1965-&#x2019;66, i.e., since the commencement of this Department activating programmes, its crash building programme, 6,972 or an average of 3,500 per year, were built. [Interjection.] The hon. member is looking at the wrong thing again. He is only looking at housing provided by local authorities. He is not looking at the second page. I mentioned both. The hon. member wants to imply that the rate at which we are building houses is 12,000 over a period of six years, but that is not true. The rate at which we are building is far more rapid at present, precisely because we spurred on the local authorities and told them that they must build straight away and if they did not do so we would take the land from them and do so ourselves. Just consider the planning for Whites only in Durban alone for the coming year, 1967-&#x2019;68. There the local authority is going to build 488 units at R2¼ million and my Department is going to build 570 units at more than R4 million. Within one year we are going to make available 1,000 houses for Whites only in Durban alone. But he wants to create the impression that we have only built 12,000 houses in six years.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>Is it true or not that you have built 12,000 houses in six years?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is true. The hon. member spoke of the first four years, namely 1960-&#x2019;61 to 1963-&#x2019;64. But those were the years when they, as prophets of doom, told the world that South Africa was heading for bankruptcy, and when our economic development was standing still. It was only after this Government had stimulated the economy and we started getting immigrants and development began to take place, that the housing emergency started, and for the past two years we have been building at a rate of 3,500 houses per year, which rate will be accelerated this year. The hon. member should not tell a truth which creates a distorted impression. If he uses facts of this nature he should use all the facts.</p>

<p>He also created the impression that my Department was building expensive houses. He said, &#x201C;Just imagine, houses of R 16,000&#x201D;. But my Department never built those houses. Those are the houses of Indians which have been expropriated because they are in White areas, large houses on large sites which have been converted. In the questions he put to me he was careful enough never to ask how many houses of a value of less than R6.000 had been built and made available. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I trust the hon. the Minister will forgive me if I do not follow his trend of argument directly. There are one or two matters in connection with his speech I should like to deal with, but I shall do so in chronological order.</p>

<p>May I say that in a debate of this sort, concerning the incompetence and ineptitude of the Cabinet, one would have expected the Government to rush in, particularly the back and front benches, with example after example of the efficiency and competence of the Ministers concerned. Instead, apart from two members of the Cabinet and a few Deputies, we were treated to one attempt after the other to try and distract attention from the attacks made upon the Government, and attempts to drag in other matters. I think it is most significant that this opportunity was missed by the rank and file of the party opposite. Some of them, supported by their own Press, complained because I had not talked of other things. It was even suggested that in this debate I should have raised the question of Rhodesia and South West Africa. One hon. member suggested that I never mentioned the question of Rhodesia since March 30th. He must have been absent from the House when I discussed it during the last session and when I made certain suggestions to the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of which, I am glad to say, he has acted. Sir, why should we discuss <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0163"/>South West Africa in the light of the events, when the Prime Minister and I independently have come to the same conclusion concerning the resolution taken at UN and in respect of our attitude towards the Committee of Thirteen? Then there were others who wanted declarations of policy. Sir, they will get declarations of policy on everything at the right and proper time which I shall dictate. I want to say that it was only the Ministers who really acknowledged how serious this situation in respect of inflation has become. Dealing with incompetence and ineptitude, I raised particularly the question of inflation and how it was combated in South Africa, and its effect on the gold mines, on the agricultural community and on the fixed income group. We have had, I am happy to say, a sense of responsibility from the Ministers concerned, although the hon. the Minister of Finance did not seem to want us to talk about inflation. They seemed very anxious to hear what remedies we might have to deal with the situation. What has been their reply to my criticism of their handling of the situation? First of all, we have been told that it is a world-wide phenomenon which South Africa has contained better than most other countries, but of course worse than others. The figures they referred to were only up to 1965. If we add the figures for 1966 I am sorry to say the picture is not nearly so good, and unless the position in other countries has changed a lot we stand fairly low down on the list. That is the reason for this matter having been raised in this debate. What interested me so much about their explanations that this was a world-wide phenomenon in respect of which South Africa was doing so well was the reference in their own economic development programme on page 143 where those responsible for drawing up the programme say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is, however, little reason for satisfaction if account is taken of the price rise from February, 1964, to August, 1966, when the South African consumer price index advanced at the rate of 2.5 per cent per annum.</block>

<p>Of course, in the next month it went up a further 1.2 per cent. If you take the period September, 1965, to September, 1966, it is a rise of 4.6 per cent per annum. If you take that figure and look at the comparative figures given here as to combating inflation, then South Africa is third from the bottom. It is quite clear that those responsible for writing this document are certainly not handing out any Oscars to the Minister of Finance and the Cabinet.</p>

<p>The second matter in connection with this question of inflation being a world-wide phenomenon is the suggestion that the experiences we are having are due to a large extent to the influence of prices in other countries upon South Africa. I accept that they have an influence, but it must be a limited influence because here again, in the economic development programme at page 155 we find it stated that in 1965, however, the prices of the latter group, i.e. the goods produced internally in South Africa, increased by almost twice as much as import prices, thus proving that the recent inflationary tendencies were mainly of local origin. That, to a large extent, seems to dispose of the argument of the Minister of Economic Affairs in regard to the influence of external forces upon the inflation here.</p>

<p>Then there was a second excuse offered to my criticisms, and that was to blame the inflow of foreign capital into South Africa particularly during the third quarter of 1966. What is interesting is that this matter was discussed in the House in August last year. I then drew attention to the fact that where you are imposing restrictions on credit for local companies you can expect their parent companies overseas to finance them and that will lead to an inflow of capital; and where you have a change of government in Britain you can expect a flight of capital from that country to South Africa. I asked whether that inflow had not been anticipated or should not have been anticipated, and I asked why, if it was harmful, it had not been limited. What happened? Here we are, four months later, and we are still given the same excuses. The real trouble is, as the hon. the Minister of Finance will I am sure testify, that they really do not know what type of capital is coming in, whether it is long-term or short-term or medium-term. They do not have the necessary statistics or the necessary information despite the fact that there have been pleas from this side of the House for over 18 or 20 years for better statistics in respect of matters of that kind.</p>

<p>The third excuse is that inflation is a delicate matter and that they did the right things at the right time. This is very interesting. First they froze interest rates for 16 months and one of the biggest factors in combating inflation was put out of action. Then they unfroze interest rates. It is very interesting to note the comment of even an organization like the South African Agricultural Union in respect of this matter. They deal with the steps taken by the Government to combat inflation and they say that &#x201C;notwithstanding the measures taken under items 1 to 3 and as a direct result of the measures taken <i>inter alia</i> under items 4 and 5, one of which is freezing interest rates, the danger of inflation in our country has by no means receded and deflationary measures may still be expected to last for several months&#x201D;. I wonder whether that was the right thing at the right time. The last Budget was stated by the hon. the Minister at the time to be an anti-inflationary Budget. When that Budget was passed, hon. members opposite knew about this inflow of capital from overseas. It was taking place at the time and we debated it in the course of those discussions. It was said to be an anti-inflationary Budget. How is it that we on this side of the House could <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0164"/>warn that it was going to have inflationary effects? How is it that we could draw attention to the fact that this was an inflationary Budget and not an anti-inflationary Budget or a deflationary Budget? How is it that we found these comments in the <i>Financial Times</i> at that time:</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Dönges in presenting his worst Budget has given almost as much impetus to inflation as did his colleague Mr. Schoeman a few days earlier. His attempt at a deflationary Budget has largely failed and in many directions he has created a situation whereby prices will shoot up. Wage demands will follow all too swiftly.</block>

<p>How true that forecast was! How is it that that should come from the <i>Financial Times</i>? The hon. the Minister though warned proceeded in his headlong course towards further inflation in South Africa. There was another financial statement in another financial paper, the <i>Financial Mail</i>:</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Dönges has set his face against inflation and hit just about everyone in sight: yet the Budget could still be inflationary if the loan programme failed.</block>

<p>Well, events have proved the Opposition and those commentators correct and the Government wrong. How can they say to us that they did the right things at the right time when, knowing the difficulties, they proceeded to introduce a Budget with effects of that kind? Events have proved them wrong. The cost of living has risen, it has rocketed since that Budget and they themselves having realized that they have failed, had to take additional steps in December of last year. I do not think much of that argument.</p>

<p>Then there was another argument from hon. members opposite. They say they went to the experts and I cannot show anything that they did that they should not have done. I seem to remember the reports of the Governor of the Reserve Bank from time to time about the manner in which Government spending is nullifying the efforts to combat inflation in South Africa. I remember particularly the complaints by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on the way the Government was financing its spending &#x2014;how it was restricting credit and how the restriction of credit in the private sector was building up large credits for the commercial banks which were being borrowed by the Government and used by it at short-term loans to finance its programme of expenditure. What the then Minister of Finance was at the time doing is that he had his hand in the till and he was taking out money and leaving I.O.U.&#x2019;s behind. Sometime or other those bills had to be met. The meeting of those bills has had an inflationary effect upon the economy. What they were doing was financing long-term projects with short-term money. I wonder which experts advised them to do that? I wonder which economist in South Africa advised them to do that, namely to finance long-term projects with short-term money? The hon. the Prime Minister said that they consulted the experts and what did they do that they should not have done. Can anyone suggest that the Railway Budget of last year was disinflationary? I do not think that anyone can suggest that. We saw the effects on transport costs&#x2014;on sugar, on cement, on petrol and agricultural commodities all over the country. We saw the snowballing effect and the ripple effect. We have had the excuse from the hon. the Minister when I raised this matter in the debate that he had to find the money to pay higher wages to the amount of R33 million, R13 million for extra costs, R10 million for good measure and for a surplus. He needed R56 million extra and he had R55 million in the Rates Equalization Fund. We suggested at the time that there was another way of financing it. The hon. the Minister went his way&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think in retrospect that it would have been a rather smart way of doing it and I believe that it would have had very much more beneficial effects on the economy. I also believe that most economists to-day would have preferred to have seen it done that way. They were consulting the experts and doing nothing that the experts told them not to do. I wonder what experts they consulted when they let the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs loose? Can anyone suggest that his actions in the Post Office have not had an inflationary effect, costing the public another R10 to R14 million, an increase of approximately 40 per cent in local call charges. I wonder whether the Prime Minister consulted experts in this regard and who they were. What a record, Mr. Speaker! And these are the people who have been telling us that they are handling inflation efficiently and competently here in South Africa. Let us look at the <i>Barclays Bank Review</i> which came out a few days ago:</p>

<block name="quote">Consumer and wholesale prices during the 12 months ended September, 1966, a period in which stringent anti-inflationary measures were in operation, have increased at a rate the South African economy cannot sustain. The upward movement in consumer prices during this period was for example 4.6 per cent.</block>

<p>They go on, Sir, to show what is happening in this period compared with the previous 12 months. The question arises whether their present steps will succeed. It is interesting that though those steps have been discussed by several speakers on this side of the House, <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0165"/>there has been no detailed defence of them by members on the other side of the House. Certainly they are open to criticism but one is a little anxious about criticizing them for fear one commits one of the unforgivable sins of which the Minister of Finance talks when you are dealing with inflation and criticizing anything the Government is doing. The best the</p>

<p>Minister of Finance can say so far is that the battle as yet is not lost.</p>

<p>Sir, as an old referee, I can tell the hon. the Minister that he is behind on points. So far he is well behind on points. In fact, Sir, I believe he is in a worse position than Bobby Simpson and the Australians. His difficulty is that he is still without the necessary statistics which have been asked for for so long and which are asked for in almost every chapter and paragraph of this report of his own economic development programme to know exactly what is happening to be able to take the steps timeously to put the situation in order. Hon. members opposite in explaining their actions, say the steps they take must be balanced. I wonder what they mean by &#x201C;balanced&#x201D;. What is the balance that they hope to achieve? One eye on the electorate and one eye on the economy? Is that the balance they are hoping to find? Then, Sir, the hon. gentleman tries to frighten us with talk that if the steps were too drastic we might have had a recession. We might, Sir, but why should we have a recession when the Government has the power of spending in its own hands to rectify the position, as has been shown very largely over the last year or two? Is it necessary, if there is proper long term planning and proper handling of the situation? We are told that they have handled this matter so efficiently. If you look at the constant changes in policy you see how difficult they have made it for commerce and industry to plan ahead.</p>

<p>First you have freezing of interest rates and then unfreezing. You have a sort of see-saw in respect of import control, sometimes tightening and sometimes relaxing. The hon. the Prime Minister said he took advice. I wonder at just what stage he took the advice. It seemed to me, as far as we could see the situation, that up till 30th March the advice they were taking was from the electorate. They were thinking not of economics. They were thinking of votes. Then, once the kitty was empty, they started taking advice. But they had spent almost everything by then. Then after the general election they started to tighten the screws. Because they had been so slow in applying the classical methods to combat inflation they are now having to take extraordinary measures like freezing rents, limiting building, threatening price control and things of that sort. I only want to say that I hope that in the future there will be no more shilly-shallying in dealing with this matter. I do not think that this is a record of which any Government can be really proud and I do not think it is an example of efficiency or competence.</p>

<p>I told the hon. the Prime Minister during the last session of Parliament that what we wanted was evidence that he could control this situation by this session. So far he has failed in that test. I instanced what the effect of all this was going to be on the gold-mining industry. I am happy to say that the importance of that industry was generally conceded. It was also conceded by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs that a peak had been reached and that production was likely to decline. Undoubtedly, Sir, the position is serious when you consider the hiatus which will have to be filled if it declines very materially. The hon. the Prime Minister, and I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, suggested that the only way to prolong the life of the mines if there was no increase in the price of gold was to reduce salaries and wages or to replace Europeans by non-Europeans. I am happy to say that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was more hopeful and more realistic. He speaks of increased productivity and he speaks of considered reorganization in the industry&#x2014;&#x201D;oordeelkundige reorganisasie&#x201D;. He does not like ideas about subsidies or tax relief. I want to tell him that he may have to consider steps of that kind. I believe that the situation developing here is much more serious than is generally realized.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman says it is being considered. I was glad to know that. I believe that was so. But is it being considered with the necessary imagination and the necessary determination to see to it that something is done to ensure that that low-grade ore does not go waste in South Africa and that the life of our gold mines is prolonged adequately? I hope that we are not once more planning to do too little too late and sacrifice the future of South Africa because of lack of courage at the present time. I am still left with that doubt because so far there seems to be no constructive suggestions coming forward as to how this matter should be dealt with other than those <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0166"/>which have come from this side of the House. In this regard, Sir, I have noted with interest the remarks of the Minister of Labour regarding his proposals to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. I do not want to become involved in that matter at all, save to say that it is essential first of all that peace is maintained in the industry and secondly that greater productivity is achieved in one way or another in the hope of reducing or maintaining costs at a reasonable level.</p>

<p>Sir, I also have instanced the unfair effect of this handling of inflation upon the agricultural industry. There was a reply from the hon. the Deputy Minister in which he set me certain questions which, with great respect, have nothing whatever to do with the matter. He wanted to know whether I was in favour of limiting the wages of mechanics working on agricultural implements or tractor operators or people of that kind. No, Sir, of course I am not. They must get a square deal just as the farmers must get a square deal and are not getting under this Government. He wanted to know whether I was prepared to see the price of ground fixed. Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to see the price of ground fixed. I do not think it is necessary for steps of that kind to be taken to meet the troubles with which we are faced. What I am objecting to is the accusation made very clearly in the report of the South African Agricultural Union. I am going to deal with it under two heads. The first is set out in the report as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">An aspect which, however, causes real concern is the fact that the absolute contribution of the agricultural sector to the gross national product reflected no net increase during the years 1961 to 1964. The year 1965 did in fact reflect an increase of 5.8 per cent, but bearing in mind that this increase actually represents the growth over a period of four years it is evident that also in absolute terms the agricultural sector did not participate in the prosperity experienced by the national economy during this period.</block>

<p>That is my complaint. Mr. Speaker, that is the one the Deputy Minister never bothered to answer. The national economy expanded by no less than 31 per cent over the same period. And then they go on:</p>

<block name="quote">Taking account of the fact that the total agrarian population, Whites plus non-Whites, is on the increase, it can be proved that the <i>per capita</i> income in the agricultural sector has under present circumstances shown a decrease over the past 15 years.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is what I am complaining about. Agriculture has not had its fair share. It has been hit by inflation harder than many other sectors and it has not been protected by this Government in respect of prices. Then, Sir, there is a second complaint which I have. They speak about the increase in the value of agricultural production in 1965, not its volume.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Although the increase may be regarded as encouraging, it should be viewed against the background of the agricultural producer price structure obtaining over the past ten years or more, from which it is evident that in the aggregate the producer prices for agricultural products did not nearly keep pace with the depreciation in money values over this period.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In other words, Mr. Speaker, the price increases have not kept pace with the depreciation in money values. That is why I say the farmers have not had a square deal from this Government. That is why I say that in the manner in which inflation has been combated by these hon. gentlemen the farmer has not had a square deal. I warned that one of the things to which attention was going to be directed was complaints by the Agricultural Union in respect of the technical services and the research available to them. Here is an article written as a result of an interview with Professor Tomlinson, head of the Transvaal Region, and Mr. S. P. van Wyk, assistant head of the Division of Agricultural Economics and Research. This is what these two gentlemen are reported as saying:</p>

<block name="quote">Volgens hulle word boerdery verder gestrem deur onvoldoende landbounavorsing en voorligting, Landbou-ekonomiese navorsing, byvoorbeeld, wat nog meer as ander navorsingsinrigtings van lewensbelang is in toestande van snelle verandering vorder baie stadig, en dit kan net nie bekostig word nie. Die ongewenste toestand is grootliks te wyte aan die voortdurende wegvloei van ervare personeel.</block>

<p>They go on to show that in the division of research only 63 per cent of the technical personnel have had more than two years&#x2019; service, and that less than 9 per cent have been there for longer than ten years. That is what I was complaining about, and that is what I was complaining about in respect of the treatment of the agricultural sector and the handling of inflation in South Africa, and the difficulties with which the farmer is being faced as a result of something for which this Government must take responsibility.</p>

<p>Then we spoke of the effect of inflationary tendencies upon the position of those with fixed income. We warned during the last session of Parliament and I warned again on Monday, that, while there had been great responsibility shown among trade union leaders in South Africa, the time was coming when they would no longer be able to control their own people. Bacause, Sir, the cost of living was rising so fast that many of these people <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0167"/>have a sense of grievance, and they felt that they were being sacrificed. I do not know what the railway workers tell the hon. the Minister of Transport, but I know what they tell me, and I know how dissatisfied they are. I know what difficulties there are when people are moved from one place to another on transfer, either among the civil servants, or amongst the railway staff. I want to say that unless this Government can give some guarantee that they are going to be able to control the cost of living in a reasonable manner, or bring it down to some extent, they are heading for trouble with their own employees. I am afraid that they are going to be faced with demands for wage increases throughout the country. How much better off would these people not have been under the old United Party system of cost-of-living allowances, instead of having to wait for an election before there were increases in wages, increases which have been frittered away in almost 12 months as a result of the rise in living costs.</p>

<p>Then we had the situation in respect of the Departments of the Interior, Immigration and Police, as indicated in the report of the Van Wyk Commission. This matter has been dealt with&#x2014;I think brilliantly&#x2014;by the hon. member for Transkei. We have had a reply from the hon. the Minister of the Interior, but we have had no reply from the other Ministers concerned. The hon. the Minister of the Interior concedes that there has been negligence, negligence in no less than four instances by officials of his department. He does not try to excuse them, but he does try to play down the seriousness of the whole situation. The Minister of Community Development also tries to give an explanation and stresses how difficult it is to obtain efficient service in these departments. These four actions which are indicated by the Judge concerned as being negligence are undoubtedly serious cases. They have had tragic consequences, and for that reason the limelight has been fixed upon them, as the Minister said. What I want to know is how many other instances of similar neglect are taking place in these departments from day to day that we never hear about and which are never brought to the public notice. What I want to know is: Can we go on running departments with this low level of efficiency and have satisfactory government in South Africa? Our security measures have been undermined, through the negligence not of one official, not of two officials, but of four separate groups. Mr. Speaker, there is an old tradition, and that is that the Minister in charge of a department takes responsibility for the inefficiency of that department. The hon. the Minister of the Interior has tried to defend his predecessor by indicating what his attitude was to the department, and reading out a letter calling for more efficient service. For how long was he in charge of that portfolio? For how long has this state of affairs been going on? There are certain things here that are inexcusable. How do we know that they are not going on in respect of other people still at the present time?</p>

<p>Then we have a most extraordinary situation in respect of the decision of the Immigrants Selection Board. They seem to have treated an application for permanent residence almost as a formality. A police report is apparently not called for. They do not obtain a birth certificate. They do not receive answers to the questions which they raised. But yet they grant permanent residence. Is that going on regularly? Is that the sort of thing that this Board does? Is that the way it conducts its business? Is that what we must expect of it in the future? Can we be satisfied with that sort of thing?</p>

<p>We have the action of the security police who accept responsibility for the safety of the Prime Minister. I want to say that I am far from happy about the steps which they took and the half-baked manner in which the matter was handled.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with it, Mr. Speaker. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that the officer in charge called for a list of the personnel in the House in 1963. He screened them. He thought it was necessary to do so. He never applied for any additional names that came on to that list thereafter.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not a different matter. That is where I think the weakness lies, and I am pertinently drawing the attention of the Prime Minister to that. I think I have a right to say that, because here we find a situation in regard to which the explanations given me so far are, I must say, totally unacceptable. What is happening? Clearly we have examples now of lack of efficiency. Clearly we have examples of lack of proper methods in the divisions concerned. We have also an admission made by the Minister of Community Development that we have to deal in the civil service with many very inexperienced people. He says himself that it is physically impossible for the supervisors to supervise them adequately or efficiently. He admits it.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, we have a most extraordinary lack of co-ordination. We find that this man was examined by the district surgeon, and he apparently gave a report to the effect that he was a schizophrenic and was unsuitable for employment. When that happens, is that information not passed on to somebody? Is there no liaison between one department and another? Having decided that about a man, is he just let loose again?</p>

<p><span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_0168"/>These are things which I do not think have been adequately explained, and things which leave much unhappiness in the minds of people all over South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to say once again that it is an old tradition that the Minister takes the responsibility. We do not attack civil servants in this House; they cannot defend themselves here. We attack the responsible Ministers. I want to say to the Prime Minister: In the light of this evidence is he satisfied with the efficiency and the competence of the Ministers concerned in respect of this matter? One is left with the impression that if you had a few more independent tribunals examining things, a lot of other things might come to light. I wonder what would happen. I set myself the pleasant task this morning of wondering what an independent tribunal would find in respect of the Government&#x2019;s action in freezing interest rates for 16 months; whether they would find that it really was in the interests of the economy or not. I wondered what they would find in respect of the failure of the Minister to heed the warnings of the Governor of the Reserve Bank that Government spending was nullifying their attempts to attack inflation in South Africa. I could not help wondering what an independent tribunal would say about the complaints made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank in several reports on the methods by which the Minister of Finance was financing Government expenditure at the time. I could not help wondering what an independent tribunal would say about allowing inflationary rises in the Post Office at a time when we are supposed to do everything to combat inflation in South Africa. I could not help wondering what an independent commission would say about the steps that have not been taken so far to extend the life of the gold mines and whether they would be satisfied with what has been done up to the present time. I could not help wondering what an independent tribunal would say on the appeal to the small man to make further sacrifices in curbing inflation in the light of what the Government has been doing.</p>

<p>Sir, it is quite clear that we are faced with a great deal of inefficiency in many Government departments, inefficiency for which the ministers concerned must take the responsibility. I wonder, Sir, now that we have heard so much of this business of Organization and Method Studies, whether it would not be wise at this time to appeal to the Government to make sure that the reports of the Organization and Method divisions, which I believe exist as a result of the pleas made by the hon. member for Constantia to the late Mr. Havenga when he was Minister of Finance, should not be Tabled in this House so that members can have sight of them and see what is going on. I believe that they certainly would assist to promote efficiency. I wonder, Sir, whether we should not consider the creation of an overall Organization and Method division to coordinate the work done by the separate divisions, if it does not exist already, and whether the report of that division should not be Tabled in Parliament. I wonder, thirdly, whether the Public Service Commission should not be asked to prepare a special report on all staff matters, including shortages and new staff taken on. If we are going to have an Organization and Method Division, may I appeal for the assurance that the methods which will apply will be the very latest methods and not the antiquated methods which seem to be applied in certain Departments at the present time. I believe that steps of that kind could do more to control expenditure and promote efficiency than a lot of the things that we have been talking about over the last three days.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I would direct attention again to the desirability of increasing productivity in South Africa, the desirability of tackling our manpower shortage, and the vast importance of promoting an export market so that our industries can have the benefit of large-scale production. We have appealed for these things before, but nothing ever seems to happen. Ministers sit back in great comfort while prices go up and the cost of living goes up; wages have to go up and then prices go up again. The Cabinet gets bigger and bigger but there is no sign of increased efficiency or greater competence. Therefore I have no hesitation in moving that this House have lost confidence in this Government because of the inefficiency and ineptitude of its Cabinet.</p>

<heading>MINING RIGHTS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>This Bill relates to precious metals, base minerals and natural oil and may be regarded as the second leg of the revisory and consolidatory legislation of the Department of Mines. The first leg, namely the consolidation of the diamond laws, was completed during the 1964 session when a single Precious Stones Act was substituted for 16 earlier laws and enactments, while this Bill contemplates the repeal of a further 47 Acts, parts of Acts and Amendment Acts, which will result in two Acts only being substituted for a total number of more than 60 different enactments.</p>

<p>It is paradoxical that more than half a century since Union, South Africa, a vital young giant amongst the mining countries of the world, still does not have a complete set of modern legislation relating to minerals which is applicable throughout the country. As the largest producer of gold in the world, South Africa at present produces approximately 75 per cent of the free world&#x2019;s gold and it is also one of the world&#x2019;s leading producers of gem diamonds. In addition we are the second largest producer of vanadium, vermiculite, metals of the platinum group, antimony, manganese and chromite, and the largest known reserves of chromium and manganese in the world are situated within the borders of the Republic. Also as regards certain other minerals such as uranium, asbestos, lithium and mica we are among the leading producers. South Africa has gained this prominent position in the field of mining really more in spite of than with the aid of its mineral laws, because some of the most important of these laws date from colonial days and many are antiquated and of provincial application only. Most of them have an English version only and in addition some of the laws are out of print, and you will realize that the public is demanding their substitution. This, of course, is a very undesirable state of affairs, particularly in a major mining country such as South Africa. In addition some of these existing old laws are based on principles which are in direct conflict as far as the various provinces are concerned, a position which is not merely illogical but also very confusing. For instance, in the Cape Province, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State the right to prospect for and mine base minerals on private land is vested in the private holder of the mineral rights, while, as far as Natal is concerned, this right has to be acquired from the State in accordance with the provisions of the Natal Mines Act, 1899. On the other hand, as far as precious metals are concerned, the Cape Province is the exception as regards gold, silver and platinum. In this province the holder of the right to precious metals may exploit the precious metals as he deems fit, whereas the right to exploit precious metals in the other three provinces is vested in the State, irrespective of the status of the land on which those metals are present. Then there are also, in spite of amending legislation and patch-work over a period of more than half a century, considerable deficiencies in the present laws. For instance, in the Cape Province there is not even legislation in terms of which control can be exercised over trading in unwrought precious metal. This is a deficiency which is also being rectified now. The legislation before this House to-day required many years of hard work and numerous interested parties were consulted. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the officials of the Department of Mines who undertook this major task as well as to the representatives of the Chamber of Mines and to all other interested parties who exchanged views with the officials and made contributions, and I naturally also want to address a special word of thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Justice and to the other members of the Select Committee which was subsequently converted into a commission for the purpose of examining this legislation. What we therefore have before this House to-day is the result of many years of work and consultation and of several years of co-operation between both parties in this House. What we consequently have here to a large extent is legislation about which agreement has been reached and in connection with which a considerable number of technical problems have been smoothed out on the level of this Committee and the Commission. Therefore this Bill is not really so much a consolidating measure but is more specifically aimed at substituting uniform and modern legislation for obsolete and disparate legal provisions. Well-tried principles have been retained as far as possible and have been made applicable throughout the Republic. Where it has been necessary in the process to effect changes in some provinces for the sake of uniformity, principles contained in the more recent and advanced legislation in operation in the Transvaal and/or the Orange Free State have been followed. In terms of the proposed new legislation Bantu will now for the first time be enabled to acquire prospecting and mining rights within their own areas. As yet nothing has been detracted from the competency of Whites to acquire prospecting and mining rights in Bantu areas. But except where such land has been proclaimed as public diggings, the Bill gives the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development the necessary authority to approve applicants for rights on Bantu land. Because the Bill is aimed at uniformity throughout the country it will, from <span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_0171"/>the nature of the case, bring about numerous changes&#x2014;most of which, however, will not be of a drastic nature&#x2014;in the existing legal position in the various provinces. A memorandum dealing with all the clauses of the Bill has been drawn up by my Department and copies have already been made available to hon. members on both sides of this House who have made inquiries. In addition many of the clauses are thoroughly discussed and elucidated in the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Bill, which report was tabled on 3rd August, 1966. Therefore I shall confine myself to some of the more important changes contemplated.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want to refer to the new definition of &#x201C;base mineral&#x201D; contained in clause 1 of the Bill. In the present Gold Law (Act No. 35 of 1908) of the Transvaal&#x2014;which is also applicable in the Orange Free State&#x2014;&#x201C;base mineral&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;any mineral substance other than precious metals or precious stones &#x2026; or water&#x201D;. This definition is very wide and has caused considerable concern amongst land-owners and lessees on settlements who are not also the holders of the mineral rights, because it is not clear to what extent ordinary agricultural land is included in this definition. In the new definition surface soil, <i>inter alia</i>, which can only be used for agricultural purposes and which has no commercial value otherwise, will not be included in the term &#x201C;base minerals&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In connection with the term &#x201C;prospecting&#x201D; it is at present provided in the Gold Law that &#x201C; ‘prospecting&#x2019; shall include all work which is necessary for or incidental to the search for precious or base minerals&#x201D;, which apparently means that virtually any action relating to the search for minerals&#x2014;however indirect that may be&#x2014;amounts to prospecting. In terms of the proposed new definition contained in clause 1 of the Bill only prospecting operations which are carried out in such a way that they disturb the surface of the earth will be held to be &#x201C;prospecting&#x201D;. Surveys from aircraft or with instruments which do not disturb the earth physically will not be prospecting for the purposes of the new Act and that will generally simplify matters. In terms of section 12 of the present Gold Law the holder of the mineral rights may prospect for precious metals on land in respect of which he holds such rights, without it being necessary for him to take out a prospecting permit. He need only inform the mining commissioner in writing of his intention to prospect. In terms of clause 7 of the Bill all persons who wish to prospect for precious metals will now have to take out a prospecting permit at R2 per annum. The Chamber of Mines did not want any change in the present position to be effected because such a change would have resulted in an additional administrative requirement&#x2014;the issuing of the prospecting permit&#x2014;which might give rise to delay. For the sake of uniformity, however, the Department prefers prospecting permits to be taken out in all cases. It will not be possible to refuse permits. The periodic issue of such permits will keep mining commissioners better informed about prospecting for precious metals in their mining districts than the former notices of intention to prospect and, as regards the possibility of delays, my Department gives the assurance that the necessary permit will almost without exception be issued on the same day as that on which the mining commissioner receives the application. The same change was effected by the new Precious Stones Act, 1964, and no difficulty has been experienced up to now and this Act has been in operation for a few years. The Commission of Inquiry regarding the Mining Rights Bill considered this matter thoroughly and was unanimous in its support of the idea that the holder of the right to precious metals, like other prospectors, should also take out a prospecting permit.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State non-Whites cannot acquire rights under the Gold Law and for the greater part that is also the position in Natal where the Natal Mines Act, 1899, is applicable. As hon. members will notice from clause 7 of the Bill, it is now the intention to enable Bantu and Coloured persons to acquire prospecting rights in their own areas while it will also be possible for Coloured persons to continue prospecting on State land in the Cape Province. The latter is a right which they already enjoy in the Cape Province. The definition of &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D; in the Bill is wide in order to include any person who is not a White person or a Bantu.</p>

<p>At present prospecting areas are not transferable and they also have to be repegged annually after the holder has obtained a new prospecting permit. This causes considerable inconvenience and may result in the loss of valuable assets, because it has happened that a prospector who wished to peg his area on the day after the date of expiry of his old prospecting permit found that someone else had pegged the area during the previous night. The same thing may happen where, say, A removes his pegs in favour of B for a consideration whereupon C gets in first and pegs the area. These occurrences will be eliminated by making provision for the renewal of prospecting permits and for the transfer of prospecting areas, as is envisaged in clause 9.</p>

<p>In terms of existing legislation the State itself may investigate the possible presence of base minerals and natural oil on any land. In clause 11 this power is extended to include precious metals as well. In this connection I should like to give the assurance that it is not the intention at all that the State itself should join the ranks of gold producers, but only that it should have the power to make its own contribution to prospecting for precious metals, for instance in cases where private concerns are not able to do so, or where they do not regard the prospects as being sufficiently promising.</p>

<p><span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_0172"/>Because prospecting for natural oil requires large monetary investments as a rule, the necessity of giving the prospective prospector assurance at an early stage as regards his rights and obligations in case he should make a paying discovery of natural oil is generally recognized. It is the practice in other countries to give such an assurance, and prospective prospectors make it a requirement that we should do so too. On the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry a provision has therefore been included in the Bill&#x2014;it appears in clause 14 (3) of the Bill&#x2014;in terms of which the most important terms and conditions to which oil mining will be subject may already be embodied in the prospecting lease. The assurances which the large oil prospecting companies want, however, do not relate only to matters which are normally governed by the mineral laws, but also to matters such as tax obligations, customs and excise concessions, the marketing of oil, etc. Consequently it is provided that such terms and conditions may include terms and conditions agreed upon in consultation with any other Minister on matters falling within the purview of a Department of State administered by such other Minister, and in addition it is provided that all such terms and conditions shall notwithstanding anything in any law contained be binding upon the State.</p>

<p>Another departure from our customary pattern of mining leases as far as natural oil is concerned&#x2014;as is evident from clause 30&#x2014;is that no provision will be made in natural oil mining leases for the payment to the State, in addition to income-tax, of a share in the profits, royalties or other form of compensation in respect of mining leases, but that all payments which are due to the State in terms of such a mining lease will be collected in the form of income-tax so that all payments to the Republic by overseas companies may be claimed as deductions as far as the payment of taxes by them in their homelands is concerned. Because it is in the interests of the country that the proposed agreements with regard to natural oil be finalized as soon as practicable it is provided in clause 189 of the Bill that the provisions which are applicable to natural oil shall immediately come into operation on the date of promulgation of the Act and need not, as will otherwise be the case with the Act, be put into operation formally.</p>

<p>There are often cases where the mineral rights in respect of land are held by a number of persons in undivided shares and where some of them cannot be traced. The result is that the co-holders of the mineral rights who want to exploit their mineral rights are prevented from doing so. Clause 15 (2) of the Bill now contains provisions in terms of which the Minister will be able to come to the assistance of such persons. Then there are also cases where the State and other persons hold mineral rights in undivided shares. Existing legislation does not make any provision at all in terms of which prospecting operations may be carried out on such land even if both the State and those other persons want prospecting operations to be carried out on that land. Clause 16 of the Bill now empowers the Minister to grant prospecting leases to the co-holder of the mineral rights or, with his consent, to other bodies and persons.</p>

<p>Act No. 55 of 1926&#x2014;and now also the proposed new Act&#x2014;grants the owners of land held with a reservation of mineral rights to the State the sole right to prospect or cause to prospect for those minerals and to receive mining leases. Notarial deeds whereby such owners transfer those rights to other persons &#x2014;often companies&#x2014;are registered in the office of the Registrar of Mining Titles, Johannesburg. It often happens, however, that owners demand such a high compensation from nominees that the State, the real holder of the mineral rights, has to be satisfied with a paltry compensation from mining leases when mining leases are granted to the nominees, because if the State should claim its rightful share in such cases, it would simply not be possible to exploit the lease sites at a profit. In order to prevent the State from suffering losses in this way clause 19 (2) of the Bill now provides that the Registrar of Mining Titles should refuse registration of the notarial deeds if the Government Mining Engineer has expressed the opinion that the terms and conditions contained in the deeds are to the detriment of the State&#x2019;s interests.</p>

<p>It often requires prospecting operations over a period of years before the presence of minerals in paying quantities is proved and provision is now being made in clause 21 of the Bill&#x2014;particularly to accommodate persons or bodies who are not well-provided with capital&#x2014;to grant permission to prospectors to dispose of minerals lawfully recovered by them in the course of prospecting operations upon payment to the State, where deemed necessary, of the share of profits, royalty or other consideration determined by the Minister.</p>

<p>As you have most probably noticed from the report of the Commission of Inquiry one of the major, initial points of difference between my Department and the Chamber of Mines was the fact that the old mijnpacht principle was not embodied in the Bill again and that in its stead provision was made for the direct granting of mining leases to the holders of mineral rights. This matter was thoroughly investigated and I am pleased that I am able to say that the Chamber of Mines is no longer opposed to the proposed change. However, I do not want to elaborate about this matter at this stage because my colleague, who was the chairman of the said Commission, will have more to say about the matter.</p>

<p>In terms of the existing Act No. 55 of 1926 lessees of land on settlements in respect of which the State holds the mineral rights, and who have exercised the option of buying the land, also have, like the owners of such land, <span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0173"/>the exclusive right to prospect or cause to be prospected on the land but they do not have any claim to the mining leases until such time as they obtain the title deed, something which may take many years in many cases. In terms of the Bill such lessees will now also have a claim to mining rights but it is provided in clause 28 that the mining lease shall lapse if the lease under the Land Settlement Act lapses before the land has been paid in full and also that the lessee of the holding may not cede or transfer the mining lease if he has not yet paid the purchase price of the land in full. This precautionary measure is necessary to prevent a lessee on a settlement terminating his lease under the Land Settlement Act and possibly retaining a valuable right, namely the mining lease, over the land.</p>

<p>In terms of section 31 of the Gold Law, land which has been proclaimed a public diggings for precious metals may only be deproclaimed if the Government Mining Engineer has certified that precious metals were no longer being found on such land and that in his opinion there were no reasonable prospects that such metals would be found in paying quantities on such land. In practice it is often impossible&#x2014;particularly on account of the second requirement&#x2014;to issue such a certificate and as a result land which is urgently required for other purposes is sometimes locked up even if it no longer is in the interests of the mining industry. In terms of clause 44 mineralization or lack of mineralization in itself will no longer be the only or decisive factor as regards deproclamation but it will be possible to recommend and effect deproclamation if it is considered in the public interests to take such a step. The responsibility of making a recommendation in this connection will no longer rest on the Government Mining Engineer but will be entrusted to a committee consisting of the Secretary for Mines, the Government Mining Engineer and the Director of Geological Survey.</p>

<p>Under section 32 of the existing Gold Law only Whites can obtain claim licences to peg claims on proclaimed public diggings. In terms of clause 48 of the Bill Bantu and Coloured persons can now also obtain such licences in respect of land situated in their own areas, and as far as Coloured persons are concerned, also in respect of State land situated in the Cape Province. As has already been stated, the term &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D; in the Bill includes any person who is not a White person or a Bantu.</p>

<p>For those of you who represent constituencies on the Witwatersrand and vicinity, the new provision in the Bill relating to trading on the mines will be of particular interest. A great deal of close attention was given to all representations received from the various organizations promoting the interests of dealers on mines and we found it feasible to make quite a number of concessions to them. In this connection legislation which is at present in operation in the Orange Free State and which is much more modern has been followed to a large extent. The chairman of the Commission will try to give an indication here what the points of difference were, but agreement has been reached.</p>

<p>In terms of section 41 of the Gold Law exemption from the payment of the State&#x2019;s share of claim licence moneys must be granted to the holder of a mining title if, since the previous payment of those moneys, the holder has carried out work in connection with the mining or development of his land which, in the Mining Commissioner&#x2019;s opinion, was necessary or sufficient. This exemption may be claimed even if the undertaking concerned is yielding large profits. Under the proposed new clause 178 of the Bill, the mining commissioners will have wider discretionary powers, as regards new mining undertakings, to grant exemption only in cases where assistance of this nature is really necessary. As a result of representations received from the Barberton Mining Association and on the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry it has been decided, however, not to deprive existing mining interests of any exemptions or privileges to which they have been entitled up to the present time by virtue of the provisions of the Gold Law and in this respect clause 178 has been amended in a way which meets with the approval of the Barberton Mining Association and which will most probably also be acceptable to other interested parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have tried to explain the most important amendments which will be effected to the present Gold Law and mineral legislation as well as to the Natural Oil Act. They cover a wide field but general consent has been obtained and I trust that when this Bill has been placed on the Statute Book it will assist in bringing legislation into agreement with the mining practice of South Africa.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I firstly take this opportunity of expressing the profound regret of this House at the death of nine mineworkers on the E.R.P.M. Mine over the week-end. I am sure that all hon. members will join with me in extending our sympathies to those people who were affected by this terrible disaster.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the efforts of the Minister to explain this very heavy piece of legislation which has been placed before us to-day. This Bill which has only three words in its title, namely the Mining Rights Bill is probably one of the largest Bills ever to be tabled in this House. It is a document of 223 pages. It has 189 clauses. It has four schedules which alone cover ten pages. It is consolidating and amending. It repeals 43 laws totally and four laws are partially repealed. It has 17 chapters and covers a great variety of subjects, such as pegging, prospecting, mynpachten, mining leases, surface rights, water rights, trading and industrial sites and dealing in precious wrought metals. It deals with matters dating as far back as the Precious <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0174"/>Minerals Act of 1898 and matters as recent as the Base Minerals Act Amendment Bill of 1966. This Bill was originally introduced in 1965 and even to-day we find that this Bill is the third edition of the Bill which came before us in 1965. It is substantially the same Bill but one or two minor alterations have been brought about. The Commission of Inquiry which followed the Select Committee studied the Bill very carefully over a long period of time and adopted it as an agreed measure. We on this side of the House will give it our blessing and we wish it well.</p>

<p>The history of the discovery of minerals and the subsequent development of our great mining industry over the last 100 years has also in a large measure been the history of South Africa. When one turns to page 212 of the Bill now before us, one can almost see mirrored in the formidable list of laws mentioned in the Third Schedule, the long and difficult road travelled by us over the past century in the way of mining legislation in this country. It is a fascinating history. What we have gone through in the past century in mining presents itself as a vast panorama of activity and progress upon which South Africa has been able to build, bolster and sustain its economy. We hope that what has been the result of development in the past will continue in the future. We pass from the days of the lone prospector, always adventurous, always optimistic and very often disappointed, who travelled the country with his pan, his pick and his hammer. He was very often disappointed but was always persevering and always hoping for better things. We pass from those days to the present day when we have the financial giants with all their help and everything that science can give in assisting them in the search for whichever precious or base metals or precious stones they are after. They have geologists, physicists, chemists and the latest and best scientific equipment. But even so these people, with all the help they have available, are still very often in the same position as the lone prospector, and they also have their disappointments, as we have seen recently in the search for oil.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I am sorry, but I cannot allow hon. members to converse at the top of their voices.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>The days of the pick and shovel are virtually gone and to-day we have the days of the bulldozer and the giant rigs taking the place of these people who worked so hard to build the foundations of this vast industry of which South Africa is so very proud. From the few ounces of gold that were originally found and used for trading purposes, we find to-day that we measure production by millions of tons of crushed ore and millions of ounces of gold&#x2014;almost the lifeblood of our country. We have passed from the scratching of base metals in remote areas to the vast undertakings of Phalaborwa. That has been a wonderful experience for people interested in mining in South Africa and I think what we have learnt here we have passed on to the rest of the world and many countries to-day seek our assistance in the development of their mining industries. At this stage I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister, and his Department, and especially, if I may be permitted to mention their names, Mr. Viljoen, Mr. Uys and Mr. Coertze for the long trek that they had undertaken to bring this legislation to us here. It has been an immense task and I think that they have done it well. I feel that all of us must compliment them on their efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, even as it is placed before us to-day, this Bill is not one of the gems of lucidity. It is clearer than many Bills that have gone before but it is not an easy Bill to understand. It is still a very complicated measure and it requires careful study by those who wish to become fully acquainted with all its provisions and their ramifications. One cannot, of course, consolidate and modernize so many laws and provide for the protection of so many existing types of rights, as is being done in this case, and at the same time produce a simple and uncomplicated consolidated mining law. As existing rights are replaced by or converted into rights under the new Mining Rights Act, however, the position I hope will gradually become simplified and it may therefore take a few years, as I see it, before the real value of this big step forward which we are taking to-day will be fully appreciated. An example of the complication has been briefly mentioned by the Minister but I would like to read paragraph 3 of chapter 1 of the Report of the Commission to show how complicated and interwoven and at times at cross-purposes the laws have been&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore, the Commission came across an unusual position, namely, that the provisions of some of the older laws were based on opposite basic principles. In this way, for example, the right of prospecting and mining for base minerals on private land in Natal is vested in the State, with the result that these rights have to be acquired from the State in accordance with the provisions of the Natal Mines Act, 1899, whereas the same rights in respect of private land in the other three provinces are vested in the holder of the mineral rights so that he is able to prospect and mine for base minerals on the land concerned without having to obtain any form of authorization from the State. In connection with precious metals, also, there is an important difference between the provinces in that the right to exploit precious metals on any type of land in three of the provinces is vested in the State, whereas, in so far as private land in the Cape Province is concerned, this right is vested in the holder of the mineral rights. There are also annoying deficiencies in the older laws such as, if an <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0175"/>example may be cited, the fact that in the Cape Province no legislation exists for exercising control over trading in unwrought precious metal.</block>

<p>That is just one example of how these laws have been complicated in the past, and I am certain, even though I have read this passage, that most hon. members are still unaware of how difficult it is to interpret that type of law from province to province.</p>

<p>There are difficulties with the mynpachten. One of the other hon. members on this side of the House who is going to speak will deal with that subject.</p>

<p>Mineral exploitation is a terminatory activity, and we have already come so far on the road of mining development that one is inclined to wonder whether this piece of legislation has not come too late to be of much benefit to our country, and we may well ask why it was not introduced decades ago. I know, however, that some earnest attempts were made in the past in this direction, but these were nullified and set back for two main reasons, namely, firstly the last war that we passed through, and secondly, since then we have had this great shortage of manpower, and perhaps, also because of lack of the will to undertake this type of work. There had to be a driving force and there had to be people who could be found to do this arduous task, and I am pleased to say that it has to-day been carried out successfully.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am not one of the prophets of doom; I am not a pessimist. As we have found great deposits of a variety of metals, both base and precious, in the past, so do I think that the future holds great things for us. When one mine closes, we will find another one to open up. To me, Sir, South Africa has only had the surface scratched so far as its riches are concerned. I hope that this Bill will be of great use to us, and that we will be able to use it from time to time, as the years go on. There is sure to be conflict of opinion about what is going to happen in future and, in all probability, after this legislation has been in existence for a year or two, it will have to be amended again. But we will be prepared for that and I am sure that we will be able to overcome the difficulties that are going to be presented to us.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to one or two specific provisions in this Bill, as the hon. the Minister did, and I want to say that we on this side of the House, after studying the Bill, are not going to oppose any of the clauses contained in the Bill. One of the provisions in which I have taken an interest is clause 15, which prescribes the steps that may be taken when land can be conveniently exploited by an adjacent existing mine, but the holder of the mineral rights in respect of the land concerned is not prepared to agree to such an arrangement, and yet does not avail himself of the right to exploit his own minerals. I have taken a special interest in this clause because, while I agree in principle that in such cases it should be possible for alternative steps to be taken in the national interest, as provided for in this clause, great care should also be taken to ensure that the holder of the mineral rights, although he is unco-operative at the time, is nevertheless treated as fairly as possible. I am glad to say that I am satisfied that this will indeed be the case if we follow the provisions of the Bill. He will first have to be called upon to prospect his land, or cause it to be prospected. He must be given at least three months&#x2019; notice and an opportunity to make representations, and, if after that, a prospecting lease is granted to another person, he, the holder of the mineral rights, will be entitled to a rent to be fixed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Mining Leases Board, made after having considered any representations by the holder of the mineral rights. If a payable discovery is made, and mining rights exercised under clause 25 (1) (e), the holder of the mineral rights will, under clause 31 (1), be entitled to an amount equal to one-quarter of the moneys received by the State as lease consideration. He will receive one-quarter of the moneys received by the state as lease consideration, that is the share of the profits, royalties, or other considerations. This must be regarded as quite generous, after having regard to the fact that no expenditure will be incurred or capital risked, by the holder of the mineral rights in question.</p>

<p>As the Minister said, we on the Witwatersrand are indeed concerned about the provisions of the Bill in regard to trading on mining ground, as embodied in clause 139, and we feel that, on the whole, they are fairly satisfactory from everybody&#x2019;s point of view. I personally welcome the abolition of the form of prohibition against the mine trader having an interest in more than one mine trading store. Some of these traders are facing difficult times, and I feel that this relaxation in their favour is fully warranted.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of activity at some of the mines&#x2014;and some of these mines I have visited myself&#x2014;one finds that housing on mining property has become derelict. They have become an eyesore. I feel that, in view of the fact that there are very many of these houses on mine property, they should not be allowed to deteriorate and with the shortage of housing that we find to-day, I feel that mining concerns ought to be made to keep their houses in good repair, so that those people who wish to hire them will have the chance to go into them if they so wish.</p>

<p>On one mine particularly there is a large housing scheme, and this mine is what is termed to-day a marginal mine. I wonder whether the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister of Social Welfare and the Minister in charge of housing, cannot see whether it is not possible to convert one of these housing schemes on one of the marginal mines into an area where we can house those elderly <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0176"/>people especially those who are being hounded out of their small rooms and flats in the centre of town, because the buildings in most cases are coming down, or, alternatively, where the rents have gone up to such an extent that they have been unable to pay the rentals demanded. Steps should be taken to see if they cannot be accommodated in these houses which at times stand empty on mine property. It is something which is well worth going into. The ground is available and a shopping centre could be built around these houses, and these elderly people, especially pensioners, could be given the opportunity of staying there. There will be a community of interest. You will find all the elderly people living there having some interest in one another and I am sure they will be very happy if such a scheme can be developed.</p>

<p>The same applies to the demolition of the mine compounds for Natives. I think before we knock any property down which can house people we should see whether it cannot be converted to more suitable accommodation. Rather than destroy the existing homes, I think we should rather clean them up and use them for Bantu homes there.</p>

<p>I am a little perturbed about what is going to happen in the Bantu homelands as far as mining activity is concerned. The Minister has touched on it, but these are points I would like the Minister to explain to us in his reply. The Bantu Trust would probably be asked to undertake the development of a possible mining area in one of the homelands. If that is the case, how will the Trust go about it, with this talk of separate development, and the opposition by the Government to our statement that in this type of development you cannot help but have economic integration? How is it possible for the Minister to develop any of these possible mining areas without White capital and White &#x201C;know-how&#x201D; and White technicians, and where are these White people going to live? Will they live in the homeland, or will they be put in the border areas and become virtually migratory labour in the homelands? That is the sort of thing I would like to know. [Interjection.] This is a simple question and I just want to know how it will work. The Minister probably has the reply to that. There is a strong possibility that oil may be discovered on the continental shelf and it may be round about the Zululand coast or the Transkei coast. If that happens, could I please have an explanation of how the White man is going to help the Black man to develop that without White capital; and remember how much the mining houses have to put in to start a mine and how much the oil companies have to put in before they find oil. It is a simple matter for the Minister to explain to us how it will work and I look forward with interest to his reply.</p>

<p>Those, briefly, are the matters that I wanted to bring to the notice of the House. Once again, my congratulations to those responsible for this Bill. We will not oppose it and we wish it well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As chairman of the Commission which examined the Mining Rights Bill I should like to express a few thoughts at the Second Reading, but before doing so you will allow me, Sir, to express my appreciation towards the members of the Commission who had to perform a very difficult task under very difficult circumstances. I am saying the task was a difficult one, but the circumstances were even more difficult in fact because, as it will appear from the report, the Commission had to carry out its task on the eve of a general election; but more than that, it was also a general election which was preceded by a number of party nominations in which various members of the Commission were involved and which made their task so much more difficult. As a matter of fact, one of the members of the Commission was eliminated at such a party nomination. Another one of the members was eliminated in the election itself. In this way it came about that all three hon. members who were nominated by the Opposition to serve on the Commission fell by the wayside in the election and the preceding nominations. From a party political point of view, of course, I cannot deplore that fact, but I want to say at this juncture that from the point of view of the Commission I am very sorry that Messrs. Ross, Taurog and Gorshel are not here this afternoon to share in the discussion of this measure. I want to pay them the compliment of stating that they were very zealous members and that their cooperation with us was most cordial.</p>

<p>The task allotted to the Commission itself was equally difficult. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that with the exception of a few officials from the Department of Mines and a few experts from the Chamber of Mines there were few people who really had a proper and thorough knowledge of this subject. For that reason one can imagine how difficult it was for the Commission, how much time the members had to devote to it and how much preparation they had to do in order to acquaint themselves to some extent with the subject with which they had been charged. Fortunately they had the guidance and support of the officials of the Department, and I am thinking here in particular of Mr. Uys, who was mainly responsible for the drafting of the Bill. I am also thinking of Mr. Coetzer, the Secretary, of Mr. Viljoen and Mr. Marais and Mr. Van der Walt, as well as various other people who were a very great help to the Commission. I want to convey my appreciation to them across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>To a very large extent the measure is an agreed measure, on which all the parties have been consulted over the years, the Department of Mines itself, the Chamber of Mines, the S.A. Agricultural Union and various other bodies. It is to a very large extent an agreed measure. However, it then came about that a number of items remained which could not be agreed upon. It was chiefly with a view to these items that the Bill was referred to <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0177"/>the Commission in order to take evidence and ultimately give finality.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to a few of these matters. The first one is the question of mynpachten. The Department of Mines felt that mynpachten were part of an obsolete mining rights system; the Chamber of Mines, however, felt that they would very much like to retain the mynpach, because, as they put it, it gave the owner intrinsic mineral rights. The history of mynpachten is a very interesting one. It dates from the previous century and the days of the Transvaal Republic, which adopted the attitude that the owner of the mineral rights was and remained the owner of the precious metals but that at the same time it was only the State which had the right to exploit those precious metals. As compensation for this curtailment of his rights it was then decided to allow him to mark off for himself a so-called mining right which was originally one-tenth of the surface area. In those days it was one-tenth of a farm&#x2014;and in those days farms were large, large enough to accommodate a self-supporting mine. But as sub-division took place with the passage of time it occasionally became necessary to increase the mynpacht and where it had initially been one-tenth it was increased to one-fifth by the passing in 1908 of the Transvaal Gold Act, which was also made applicable to the Free State. By 1934, also as a result of further sub-division, the farms were so small that it was decided to increase it still further from one-fifth to one-quarter of the mineralized area. Subsequently it was found that even this was not enough; that a further additional area had to be given to the mynpacht holder in terms of mining leases. That was subsequently done and it took place on condition that he had to surrender and forfeit his mynpacht. Since it has become very clear that the matter is a complicated one and that the mynpacht no longer functions effectively to-day, the Department has come forward with the proposal that it would be much better and much more effective if one were rather to give the owner of the mineral rights the absolute right to a mynpacht, which is what is being included in this measure now on the recommendation of the Commission. The owner of the mineral rights is granted an absolute right in regard to mining leases on condition that a paying quantity of precious metal is found on condition that the Minister is satisfied with his plan of exploitation and on condition that he has the necessary pecuniary resources at his disposal. I am glad to be able to say&#x2014;this was one of the key issues between the Department on the one hand and the Chamber of Mines on the other &#x2014;that the Commission (including hon. members on the opposite side of the House, such as Messrs. Ross, Gorshel, Taurog) recommended unanimously that the mynpacht be done away with and that we accept this new mining right, i.e. that an absolute right to mining leases be granted to the owner of mineral rights.</p>

<p>I then come to the second matter in regard to which there was a considerable difference of opinion. Strangely enough the Chamber of Mines and the Department of Mines were in agreement on this but they encountered strong opposition from the mine traders. The Chamber of Mines and the Department proposed that the mine owners be allowed to maintain what they called a dry goods canteen in the compounds in order to sell food, toilet articles and various other commodities to the Bantu. There was another proposal, i.e. that the owners, occupiers or lessees of land should be allowed to sell their wares, including livestock, on proclaimed land. There was fierce opposition on the part of the mine dealers and various other bodies, such as the concessionary shop owners, to these particular provisions which were being inserted at the suggestion of both the Department and the Chamber of Mines. The Commission acknowledged that the mine traders and the concessionary shops were right. The Commission&#x2019;s major consideration was the fact that the concessionary shop owners had paid an expensive price for their rights and that the mine traders had over the years built up businesses where they relied on the patronage of the compound Bantu. Consequently Section 139 was amended and accepted in its present form.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to prospecting mining leases. The previous legislation made provision for a prospecting mining lease. It is a prospecting agreement which one enters into and in which one includes in final form what the terms and conditions will be of the mining lease to follow upon that agreement. It was a reasonable absurdity because, as one can understand, a mining lease is based in the first place on whether or not the discovery will be a paying one and, in the second place, on the depth of the excavations which have to be made and, in the third place, on the expected life of the mine. It requires little imagination to realize that it is an impossible task for the mining lease board to determine in advance, perhaps even before a single borehole has been sunk, what all these conditions would be. Strangely enough the Chamber of Mines were eager to retain this right although little use had been made of this Section. The Commission found against it, but the Commission with a view to the search for oil and with a view to the fact, as the hon. the Minister has already said, that people want to know in advance precisely what the terms will be, subsequently saw fit to recommend that the prospecting mining lease should continue to exist, and it was then included in clause 14. I am grateful for the fact that the hon. the Minister has further seen fit to extend this particular clause in order to give better effect to the Commission&#x2019;s intention.</p>

<p>The Commission also paid very particular attention to another matter which was concerned with two requests made by the Chamber of Mines&#x2014;questions which arise when a mining right lapses or when land is deproclaimed. It had become customary for a mining right owner to surrender the major part of his mining right, retaining only a small <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_0178"/>portion thereof. In that connection he then retained all his surface rights intact. The Chamber of Mines intimated that they would like this state of affairs to continue. They would like their surface rights to remain intact in case the gold price should be increased. They would then be ready and waiting and would be able to continue operations immediately because the installation would still be there. After hearing evidence the Commission came to the conclusion that it would be very unfair towards the surface right owners. Their land has perhaps been occupied for the best of 30 or even 40 years and now it has to be occupied for an even longer period as a result of the retention of his surface rights. He then pays only this small amount in respect of the mining right which he retains. We felt that it was unfair and I think the House will agree with us in our recommendations. The Commission consequently recommended that whether a portion was surrendered or whether the entire mining right was retained, the mineral right owner would pay the surface right owner his 30 cents per morgen per month over the whole of the mining right. That remains a written provision. It is a tested provision and the Commission has approved of it as such.</p>

<p>There was another objection on the part of the Commission to this request. I want hon. members to follow this point very carefully. If a particular mining company is in possession of all the surface rights and a small portion of the mining rights and the gold price were in fact to be increased, with the result that a new mining lease would have to be negotiated for the rest of the property, that mine owner would be in a particularly favourable position. He would practically be able to enforce the mining lease on his own terms, for another company wishing to enter the picture would simply not have the opportunity to do so because there would be no surface right possibilities. There would be no room for the other company for housing, slime dumps, etc. It was then felt that, since he would be in such a strong position, the provision would have to remain as it was in the previous Act. There was a further request to which the hon. member for Rosettenville referred. The request was to the effect that with the deproclamation or cancellation of the mining rights the holder of mineral rights be allowed, in respect of as much of the surface area as he needed in order to maintain houses and ensure their occupation, to expropriate that land at the value it would have had had it been unimproved land. The Commission gave this matter its very careful attention for the very same reason the hon. member for Rosettenville mentioned. There is a shortage of housing and one wants to maintain as much housing as it is possible to maintain. Once again, however, it became apparent how unfair this would be to the owner of the surface area. His land had already been occupied for many years. Now, after it had already been occupied for 30 or 40 years, he was being compelled by means of expropriation to give up that land at its unimproved value to the holder of the surface rights permit. Fortunately it is a problem which exists only on the Rand, i.e. on the old mines. In respect of the new mines in the Free State and those which have been developed in the Klerksdorp and the Kinross areas, the mining companies have adopted another attitude. They first purchase the land and subsequently erect houses instead of merely obtaining a surface right permit in order to carry on with their housing schemes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to create the impression that everything proposed by the Chamber of Mines was simply pushed to one side by the Commission. The fact of the matter is that the preparation of this legislation took place over a long period of time. During the preparatory period the Chamber of Mines was continually consulted and many concessions were made to them at their own request.</p>

<p>The Department felt that in regard to these few cases which I have mentioned they could make no further concessions. After the commission had considered it and gone into the matter very thoroughly it also conceded that the Department was right. There are various other provisions, I do not want to refer to all of them, but there is one which is very interesting and I nevertheless want to mention it.</p>

<p>Representations were received from the Association of Building Societies in respect of damage to mortgaged properties during prospecting work or during mining operations. On their representations the Commission decided to recommend&#x2014;and this has been inserted in the Bill, I think it is in Clauses 17 and 33&#x2014;that any compensation arising from any suit for damages to a property as a result of prospecting work or as a result of mining operations would constitute a first liability against any mortgage on such property. I think that this was a very useful and fair provision. Where a building society or any private person holds a mortgage on a property and that property is damaged by prospecting work or mining operations then his claim has priority in respect of the property in question.</p>

<p>Sir, that is more or less the subject in regard to which there was a difference of opinion and on which the Commission gave finality. I have mentioned to the House the reasons why they did so. In conclusion I merely want to say that I think that the legal profession will welcome this measure very cordially. In the past when a client had to be advised in regard to one of these matters&#x2026;</p>

<p>It makes it easier for the lawyers. Mr. Speaker, in the past when a lawyer or any member of the legal profession had to advise his client in regard to a mining right, he had to pick his way through 30 or 40 acts, some of which were not even available. He was taking a big chance if he advised his client without first consulting the mining commissioner for the area. That has been the case in the past and we can <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0179"/>readily admit to it. In future the Mining Rights Act will be available in one document. It will be available in both official languages. I think the legal profession will welcome it. I want to appeal to the legal profession to make an immediate study of this Act when it is placed on the Statute Book in order to acquaint themselves with its provisions. I do not agree with the hon. member for Rosettenville where he has stated that it is still very obscure. I believe that anybody consulting this Act in order to determine what a particular provision is will in fact find it very thoroughly set out in this measure. I am very grateful for the work which the Department has done. The Commission was only able to add a small amount to what had already been done. I am therefore very grateful for the work which the Department has done in this connection.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should first of all like to thank the hon. the Minister of Justice for the words of appreciation in respect of the three members of the Commission who are no longer members of this House, Messrs. Taurog, Gorshel and Ross. I am sure that they will feel the same satisfaction as the other members of the Commission and the other people who have taken part in the preparation of this Bill when this Bill is finally passed by this House and becomes an Act.</p>

<p>The Bill as such will certainly be welcomed by all those who are engaged in the seeking for and winning of our natural underground wealth. One wonders why it has been so long before a Bill of this nature was introduced because if one reads the Report of the Commission, one finds that it says that:</p>

<block name="quote">It is amazed at the fact that the Department of Mines has up to now been able properly to fulfil the administrative duties emanating from the existing obsolete and divergent legal provisions for which it is intended to substitute new legislation. As regards the existing divergent mineral laws, it appears to the Commission that to-day there are only a few people, mainly senior officers in the Department of Mines and people who have been connected over a considerable period with the mining industry, who can make their way with reasonable ease through this legislation.</block>

<p>It is almost unbelievable in the context of remarks such as this and the fact that some of the legislation was out of print and some of it was in high Dutch and not understood by many people to-day, that the mining industry managed to make such fantastic progress in the past. This Bill is partly consolidating and partly consists of a number of improved procedures and some of the changes do give rise to a certain amount of nostalgia. The hon. the Minister of Justice dealt at great length with mynpachte and I am glad that he did so because the term mynpacht in itself has a sentimental attachment for a lot of people who were interested in mining in the early days. I myself can remember hearing as a youngster uncles who were interested in mining talking about the mynpacht. This was the cornerstone on which the family wealth was going to be established. This was something which was dear to everybody. It was a right which belonged to the owner of the mineral rights. But its use has disappeared over the years and during the past nine years only 25 mynpachte were registered. It is one of the historical things of the past, which has got to make way for modernization. Although this Bill was unanimously adopted within the Commission, it was certainly not a completely agreed measure amongst the parties who were interested in it. Those interested parties however did not have ample opportunity, as the Minister of Justice has told us, for presenting their views and being heard. I think one can say when one reads the Report of the Commission and tries to read the Bill intelligently, because it is still a very difficult Bill to understand, that the Commission did, to a large extent, maintain the balance between the divergent points of view and helped to produce a Bill which was realistic and fair.</p>

<p>The Bill covers an enormous amount of ground. It is a sort of &#x201C;cradle to the grave&#x201D; of mining. Every aspect of mining from prospecting and leasing to trading rights and the protecting of trading concessions and the eventual termination of the mine is dealt with in the Bill. Of course those parties who had different interests quite naturally tried to see that their point of view was upheld in the discussions that took place. I think that the Bill as it finally appeared as a Bill which is fair. Some of the new provisions will I think be more welcome than others. The old provision that only a certain number of claims could be pegged, as is rightly said in the Report, had become a farce. One could in effect peg as many claims as one wanted and the position has now been treated realistically by giving a person the right to do so. Another good provision is the one that provides that the Minister can ask for additional claim licences if claims in his opinion are not being adequately worked. We do not want the mineral wealth of this country to lie fallow; we want it to be used for the benefit of the country. Particularly interesting is of course the inclusion in a mining district of any portion of the sea as defined in the Seashore Act and the inclusion of the continental shelf. The sea and the continental shelf are areas which are going to concern us more and more as time goes by. I think that it is fairly generally accepted today, perhaps wrongly, that if there is a possibility of oil wealth in this country, it is likely to come from our continental shelf. It is something in which we have been able to interest people from abroad and some of the biggest organizations in the world are coming to South Africa to help in the search for oil.</p>

<p>The new clause 14 (c) is, I think, a realistic clause. I think that we have had to take cognizance <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0180"/>of the fact that international financing and international development take place in a pattern of their own. People from abroad, when they have to invest millions of rand in possibilities and not probabilities, want an adequate reward, a safeguard and assistance before they get started. As the hon. the Minister told us this afternoon it was necessary for him to deal with such matters as customs, taxation, repatriation of funds and other items such as immigration and labour, as they are all factors which have to be dealt with in international agreements where large amounts of capital are being spent on possible potential. I was also glad to hear from the hon. Minister that although the Government is now given power to mine for precious metals, it is not the intention of the Government to do so except under very exceptional circumstances. I suppose one can infer from the remarks of the hon. the Minister as a natural corollary that despite some remarks one hears from National Party benches, there is no intention of nationalizing the gold mines.</p>

<p>I think I must add my congratulations to those already voiced in respect of the Department of Mines. I do not think that this Bill could have seen the light of day without the work of these officials. They are the experts and the people with the necessary experience. They have associated themselves in producing this Bill with the other side of the picture, viz. the Chamber of Mines and those interested in mining, and so we have a Bill which is going to make it easier for people to operate mines. It is a Bill which is going to make it easier for people who want to continue or start exploring the potential of our underground wealth and it is going to make it easier for the natural resources of this country to be developed. We look forward to the continued development of our mining industry and we wish this Bill well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is quite a good deal of unanimity as far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned. The most important points of unanimity are of course that this Bill is a comprehensive measure and is also one which is very complicated. That is why it is of course difficult for anybody who does not have the necessary legal background to understand all the implications of this measure. An attempt is here being made to introduce modern and uniform, and perhaps I should also say, simplified legislation for the obtaining of prospecting and mining rights in the Republic and to provide for the many matters incidental thereto. Nevertheless when studying the Bill one finds oneself time and again in a maze. However, there are a few aspects of the Bill which have stimulated my interest and which I should like to bring to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>We find that there is a lot of ground in the Republic, the surface and mineral rights of which belong to different persons. This state of affairs usually leads to a conflict of interests and can also be conducive to much dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>Now it is the case that in order to be able to mine effectively the mining company must acquire the right to be able to utilize the surface area of the land for a variety of purposes. The State must see to it that the mining company acquires those rights and it is in the interests of the company as well as of the State that it acquires those rights, otherwise the exploiting of minerals or gold can be made difficult or even impossible.</p>

<p>On the other hand the land-owner also has rights which cannot be given away summarily. In this Bill an attempt is being made to strike a sound balance between the various interest groups. An attempt is being made here to ensure, and to a certain extent to entrench the rights of every interest group. In this regard I should like to refer to the fact that where ground is held under mining title in the Transvaal the State as it were appropriates to itself the trading rights on that particular land and then sells it by public auction.</p>

<p>In the Free State again another system is in force. It has been applied since 1936 and presents no problem. In the Orange Free State the owners of proclaimed private land have the sole right to trade on that land. The Department of Mines is only concerned in reserving in its favour the trading site.</p>

<p>In this Bill the Free State system is now being made applicable throughout the entire Republic, but it is being done in such a way that existing rights in the Transvaal which have been bought from the State are protected. This amendment will eliminate a great deal of confusion and ensure the rights of the landowners.</p>

<p>In the second place further important amendments are also being proposed in regard to owners&#x2019; reservations. The owners&#x2019; reservations are being insured and entrenched in the provisions of clause 47 of the Bill. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>(There shall,) subject to the provisions of this section, be reserved to the owner or lessee of the land concerned and his successors in title the use&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) of any homestead on the land and its curtilage;</li>

<li>(b) of all buildings capable of beneficial use, cemeteries, silos, threshing sites, dipping tanks, reservoirs, watering troughs and kraals situated outside any such homestead and its curtilage&#x2026;</li>

<li>(c) for agricultural purposes or purposes incidental thereto, of all land which has been under <i>bona fide</i> cultivation for the two years immediately preceding the date of the notice given to the owner or lessee in terms of section 46, or which was placed under <i>bona fide</i> <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0181"/>cultivation not less than two years immediately prior to such date but which has been rested or allowed to lie fallow during the whole or part of the first-mentioned period of two years as part of a recognized system of cultivation followed in the area in which the land is situated&#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>The provisions contained in this clause are of major importance to the land-owner. It happens quite frequently that when a land-owner sells his mineral rights he also relinquishes certain surface rights which as owners&#x2019; reservations could have been of great value to him.</p>

<p>On the other hand provision must also be made for the mining companies to acquire the essential surface rights. Provision is made for that in clause 90. For these surface rights&#x2014;those in connection with mining and allied rights&#x2014;the mining company pays nothing. The land-owner receives compensation out of the rent paid by the mining company to the State, rent which is paid in respect of mining rights. This rent amounts to 30c per morgen per month.</p>

<p>Under the existing Act, which we now hope is going to be replaced, this rent was payable with effect from the date on which the leasehold was signed. This provision sometimes caused the land-owner much discomfort and damage because, for understandable reasons, it could sometimes happen that a very long period of time elapsed before a mine-lease was signed. In the meantime the mining company had wanted to make preparations on the land so that working operations could be proceeded with as quickly as possible. A start could be made with shaft-sinking, roads could be made, compounds erected and so on. The land-owner had to experience all the inconvenience. He no longer had the use of those portions of his land but he did not as yet receive any rental because there had been a delay in signing the mining lease and payment of that rent was only compulsory when the mining lease had been registered.</p>

<p>In this respect this Bill offers the land-owner a greater degree of protection because it is now being provided that the date of commencement of payment of rent be stipulated by the Minister. In order to protect the mining company this date may not be earlier than the date on which the company is notified in writing that its application has been successful. What it amounts to is that the land-owner is compensated from the moment that mining activities on his farm commence. That is why one welcomes the change envisaged in clause 26 (1) (a) and (4) in terms of which the Minister will be able to lay down an earlier date of commencement for the payment of rent.</p>

<p>In addition the rights of settlers are also taken into consideration thoroughly in this clause. Reference has already been made to this by the hon. the Minister in the speech he made here.</p>

<p>In clause 26 (1) (b) (ii) it is provided that the rent shall be paid over by the mining commissioner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; if it relates to land held by a lessee, to the Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure who shall cause the amount in question to be credited to the lessee&#x2019;s account&#x2026;</block>

<p>That is a right which the settlers do not have in terms of existing legislation.</p>

<p>This measure affords sound protection of the interests of the land-owner as well as of the interests of the mining company or of the exploiter. An effort has been made to strike a sound balance, and, in view of the scope and the complicated nature of the Bill, the Minister and the Department of Mines is deserving of praise and appreciation for the Herculean task which they have accomplished.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill, which has been a long time in its making, appears to meet with the approval of both sides of the House. My contribution to-day is to inquire into the thinking at the back of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind as to why the perpetuation of discrimination against the Coloured man is going to be carried on in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>We are dealing to-day with mining rights. This Bill claims to regulate prospecting and mining for precious metals, base minerals and natural oil. I cannot understand why, in the year 1967, where this measure is supposed to be a consolidation of old Acts, some of which were in a language which is now a dead language and which could only be followed by persons in the department with long and varied experience, why these discriminatory clauses were not abandoned.</p>

<p>I refer particularly to clause 7, which says that a prospecting licence cannot be given to a person under 18, nor to Coloured persons or to Bantu, except in the case of Bantu in their own areas and in the case of Coloured persons in their own areas and on Crown or State land in the Cape Province. Now that sounds a nice and happy thought, and when this particular clause was drafted I think there were people who thought that things should just be left as they are. But, with the experience the Coloured people have had in connection with prospecting for diamonds, I am beginning to wonder what sort of a deal the Coloured people are going to get in terms of this Bill which deals with the prospecting for minerals and precious metals. I see also that we are dealing here with the discovery of oil or natural gas. The Minister knows that in Namaqualand no Coloured persons were permitted to go in there to prospect, although it was their own area, and that White persons got the prospecting rights, the concessions. I do not want to cover all this ground again or to rake over old embers, but I can assure the Minister that this type of legislation fills the <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0182"/>Coloured person with alarm. Not only is he unaware of the fact that it existed in the old legislation in the Transvaal and the Free State, where they were absolutely excluded, and in Natal where they were partially excluded from anything of this type but he now sees himself excluded again. The fact remains that Coloured persons to-day are intelligent. They have ideas and the same ambitions. Without any doubt they would make discoveries themselves. I went to the trouble of ascertaining what would be the procedure if a Coloured man made a discovery of anything which is of any value to the country, and I discovered&#x2014;and I should like the Minister to confirm or deny it&#x2014;that the best he can expect, if he is not in a Coloured area or in an area which has already been given away by way of concessions, to White consortiums or companies, would be to get a discoverer&#x2019;s right. When one goes back in the history of this country, one realizes that many discoveries of precious stones, minerals and metals have been made by Coloured persons. I can give the famous example of the Kimberley Mine, where the Colesberg party led by Rawstone were sitting on top of the mine but did not know it was there. It was a Black man or a Coloured man who came along on a Sunday morning and pointed out what there was there. As a result we have the great Kimberley Mine, which was the making of South Africa.</p>

<p>What is the White area? I went to &#x201C;White South Africa&#x201D; last evening and I was surprised to see that nine out of ten there were Coloureds. However, I do not want to introduce a controversial note, I would just like the Minister to give us some indication of the thinking behind this provision that Coloured persons should be so excluded. Who are the people who go round to make these discoveries and who sit on the koppies and in the dongas and see these formations and wonder what they are? The discovery at Bells-bank was made by a Coloured person, as we know. Under this Bill, if a Coloured man discovers anything, that is the limit of his interest. He then has to go to some White man and ask him to see what he can do. I feel this is a mistake in this modern age when the country is doing its level best in every possible direction and spending millions, to exclude a whole section of the people from looking for wealth, the material we need so badly. Who is to know that every goldfield has already been discovered? Who is to know that every diamond discovery has been made? Who can say that every other precious metal has already been discovered? Who is to say that a hole in the middle of Athlone cannot produce oil or gas? In my humble opinion, that is the most likely site to look for it, because it was once under the sea. I do not in any way disparage anything in this Bill, because I have gone to the trouble of finding out the background to it and I know the people involved in it. It is a good piece of legislation for one group of people, but for the other section it is thoroughly bad. For 3 million Whites there can be nothing better; it can win an Oscar.</p>

<p>The hon. member should investigate what is happening on State land in regard to the diamond concessions. Then he would not talk so much. Those of us who work among the Coloured people look at all this type of legislation with a microscopic eye, but one does not have to use a microscope to see the trends of thinking. I can well understand that before Union the Free State and the Transvaal particularly excluded Coloured people by legislation, but why do we perpetuate this ancient idea? Why do we humiliate these people by specifically saying that they should be excluded? Because that is what we are doing. I appeal to the Minister to accept <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0183"/>an amendment at the appropriate stage where we can delete references to Coloured persons. If a Coloured person is sufficiently enterprising and can raise the money&#x2014;and many of them can&#x2014;to conduct prospecting operations, and he makes a discovery, let him have the benefit of it. I can tell you this, Sir, that many farmers are only too glad when Coloured prospectors say: &#x201C;I think there is such-and-such a thing on your land; may I have a look&#x201D;. That has happened before, and it will continue to happen. But now we are going to legislate them out, finally and conclusively. In the past I do not think the position was very serious because we had not got ourselves into the position where it was so essential and so necessary to make every possible discovery that we could.</p>

<p>To conclude my remarks, I would just like to say to the hon. the Minister that I do hope he will use his influence to persuade his colleagues in the Cabinet to forget this compartmentalized thinking and to leave the Coloured man alone and to stop mentioning his name on every possible occasion in order to have him excluded from this, that or the other thing. That type of thinking is out of date. The hon. the Minister may have a good reason. I would like to hear it. Finally, I would like to say this to the hon. the Minister: Will he please accept an amendment to delete the references to Coloureds. If he does delete them, this will be a first-class piece of legislation which can be a credit to him and all those associated with him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to reply at once to the hon. member who has just sat down, because I do not think it is necessary to reply to him. He tried to create the impression that he had made out a grand case. But I shall leave it at that. I want to confine myself to this legislation, which I regard as a measure of tremendous value to South Africa. It is an exceptional bit of legislation, or should I rather say, chunk of legislation. It deals with the largest single industry in the country, i.e. the mining industry, which is of decisive value in our economy. In the past century the development of mining has reached unprecedented heights, and it actually goes without saying that the legislation regulating it should keep pace with it, and I may therefore associate myself with those who have expressed their surprise at the fact that there were so many laws regulating these matters in South Africa and that uniform legislation in all the Provinces had not been placed on the Statute Book long ago.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s common law derives from the countries of our origin, and in those countries of origin there was virtually no noteworthy mining industry. Holland. the country from which our common law derives, Roman-Dutch Law, mined some coal on a small scale. Rome, the other part from which our common law, Roman-Dutch Law. derives. had quarries where marble was extracted, and silver was also mined on a small scale. The bit of law relating to minerals which is contained in all the various sources of Roman-Dutch Law can be written down on one sheet. But fortunately Roman-Dutch Law laid down certain basic principles in respect of ownership and its system of proprietary laws, which provided a sound foundation on which we could continue building our legislation in South Africa in order to formulate laws relating to minerals. The present measure will offer a rich source of study to law students who want to determine how the old Roman-Dutch Law with its system of proprietary laws and personal laws has penetrated in the regulation of our law relating to minerals, as contained in this measure. This measure is not so much a consolidating measure; nor is it a measure consolidating the legislation of all the different Provinces. In point of fact it is legislation which merely substitutes laws already in existence. In the Cape Province there is legislation, the Mining Leases Act of 1865, which is still in existence, and then there is the Precious Minerals Act of 1898; these are the two principal Acts relating to mineral law in the Cape Province, but both of them are Acts formulated in correspondence with the English Law system. In Natal there was the Natal Mines Act of 1899&#x2014;the principal Act in that Province&#x2014;which was also in accordance with the English laws. But in the Transvaal we had the Precious and Base Metals Act of 1908, and that Act is still in force to-day, in the Orange Free State as well. All those Acts laid down divergent regulations on the subject, and it goes without saying that the various Acts of the different Provinces were conflicting in many respects; they were not founded on the same basis at all, but the basis of this Bill&#x2014;and I should like to emphasize that&#x2014;is the Transvaal Precious and Base Metals Act of 1908. It is also of great significance that our legislation will now be founded on that old Transvaal Act, because in that Province the development of mining and the mining industry reached the greatest heights, and it goes without saying that the experience gained as a result of that legislation must be decisive in laying the foundation for this measure, which will now be of application to the entire Republic of South Africa. But the Precious and Base Metals Act of 1908 of the Transvaal, which is now also in force in the Orange Free State, was in turn based on two Acts of the old Transvaal Republic, i.e. the &#x201C;Wet op Onedele Metale&#x201D; of 1897, and the old Transvaal &#x201C;Goudwet&#x201D; of 1898. If one studies the provisions of those two republican Acts, one is astonished at the skill of the old legislators of the previous century in incorporating the principles of Roman-Dutch Law as soundly as it was in fact done in that legislation. I want to pay tribute to their wisdom and their knowledge of Roman-Dutch Law, which formed the basis for the old Transvaal &#x201C;Goudwet&#x201D;, as it was taken over in 1908. In the present measure the Select Committee endeavoured to give the spirit and value of that inheritance unadulterated to posterity, and I was honoured <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0184"/>to be a member of that Select Committee. I should like to give one small example of that. In terms of the proprietary law of Roman-Dutch Law the land-owner is the owner of everything on the surface of his land, up into the sky into infinity and down below as deep as he could dig. That right of land-owners is recognized in the measure we are discussing to-day because he also remains the owner of the minerals under his land. But gold, for example, is a precious metal; oil is a strategic mineral, and in terms of this legislation mining rights are conferred upon the State. Ownership had to be reconciled with the State&#x2019;s control over that precious metal and that strategic mineral. How does this Bill do that? I shall try to set out the position in ordinary everyday language. It does it in a quite simple fashion: The private law proprietary right to property is left unabrogated in the hands of the owner, and the public law right is conferred upon the State in order that it may have control over mining. In other words, no private law right is conferred upon the State; what the State gets is the right of control, like any public concern. It has no right to my motor car, but it has a right of control over the way in which I shall drive my motor car on the road. The State gets no right to my minerals, but it tells me how I can and may mine my minerals. I want to emphasize that concept because it is basic to this measure. In order to understand this measure one must have a proper grasp of that concept.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to refer to a second basic principle of the present measure, i.e. the principle of undivided ownership or the ownership concept of Roman-Dutch Law. Under our common law the ownership of a person is sole and indivisible. I cannot have ownership in a business while my neighbour has ownership in the same business. We do not have that concept of English Law by which ownership can be split. Ownership is sole and indivisible, but we do have the concept of Roman-Dutch Law that ownership can be restricted by a proprietary law. Those other rights relating to the restriction of the proprietary laws is a legal pattern which is also found in the measure under discussion to-day. There are many people who think that the owner of the land is the owner of the surface only, and the holder of the mineral rights the owner of the minerals under the land. That is not the case at all, nor is it stated like that anywhere in this Bill. That same principle of our common law is also incorporated in the legislation under discussion this afternoon. The land owner who is the owner of the surface, is also the owner of the minerals under that land, but the holder of the mineral rights receives a right which entitles him to prospect for minerals and to extract the minerals under that land although the minerals remain the property of the owner. As soon as he has separated those minerals from the land in terms of his right to extract them then, and then only, does he become the owner of those minerals. That is the concept contained in our Roman-Dutch Law and it is a basic concept incorporated in this legislation. That brings me to the dispute that arose with the Chamber of Mines and which the Select Committee had to deal with, i.e. the abolition of the mynpacht. The Committee resolved that the mynpacht was to be abolished and that it was to be substituted by a system of mining leases only, and that that was to apply in future. The Committee may perhaps be accused of violating the principle of Roman-Dutch Law by the abolition of the mynpacht because it has abrogated a very important proprietary law of the old Transvaal &#x201C;Goudwet&#x201D;. But actually that is not the case, because a mynpacht, as its Dutch name indicates, is also only a lease. The word &#x201C;pacht&#x201D; in Dutch means &#x201C;lease&#x201D;. The Dutch name is therefore also merely a kind of mining lease. If we bear that concept in mind, we shall also see that where the mynpacht is now substituted by mining leases, the old principle in Roman-Dutch Law is not violated. A mynpacht in terms of the Transvaal &#x201C;Goudwet&#x201D; implies that the holder of the mineral rights at the proclamation of public diggings has the exclusive right to exploit one-quarter of the mineralized area as a mynpacht. In terms of the old &#x201C;Goudwet&#x201D; of the Transvaal, as the hon. the Minister of Justice pointed out, it was then one-tenth, because at that time the farms were very large and the mining industry only a small undertaking. Under the system of mining which was in force at that time a sound mining proposition could be developed on one-tenth of a large farm, but later, when the farms became smaller and mining as such expanded and underwent a gigantic and phenomenal development, one-tenth was too small. In 1934 this Parliament increased that one-tenth to one-fifth and later even further, to one-quarter. In South Africa the development as such caused the system of the mynpacht, in terms of which only a certain portion of the mineralized area could be exploited, to become outdated. As a result of that development we have to substitute it by something larger. After the development in the Free State it so happened that the mynpacht was not allocated at any of those mines in the Free State. That indicates that all those companies applied for mining leases and not for mynpachten. It is a clear indication that the mynpacht has served its use in South Africa. The Chamber of Mines wanted the mynpacht to be retained. They think it gave them a more substantial right, but the crux of the matter is that by doing so they wanted to get a tail with which they could later wag the dog. What is the difference between the mynpacht and the ordinary mining lease of to-day? The difference is merely that the mynpacht lays down a specific area as a right which the mineral holder can claim, whereas his right under the mining lease merely means that the mineral holder can claim a contract to lease and exploit an area which is an economic proposition, according to a determination by the Mining Lease Board. The legal <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0185"/>pattern is the same in both cases. In both cases it is in actual fact merely a proprietary right which is obtained to the ownership, and one is smaller in scope than the other. Apart from the fact that history has proved the mynpacht institution to be redundant, as the past 25 years have shown, the Registrar of Mining Titles made certain comments as long ago as 1937 which I want to read here, because they are significant as far as the abolition of the mynpacht is concerned. Even at that time he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The abolition of the mijnpacht practice will eliminate a lot of uncertainty regarding the interpretation of section 20 and 20<i>bis.</i> The following were a few doubtful points:</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) the need for a definition of the unit of area of a mineral right holder&#x2019;s land for purposes of determining the size of the mijnpacht to be granted;</li>

<li>(ii) a definition of the moment when a mijnpacht accrues.<br/>He then refers to a case which was heard in the Transvaal in this connection</li>

<li>(iii) when the full extent of the mineralized areas has not yet been determined, can more than one mijnpacht be granted? If so must additional mijnpachten be contiguous to the first one, or most it be situated on that portion of the mineralized area in respect of which it was granted?;</li>

<li>(iv) must adjoining farms, the mineral rights of which are held by the same person but by separate titles be treated as one or separate areas of land?;</li>

<li>(v) may a lessee of mineral rights be granted a mijnpacht?;</li>

<li>(vi) must the mineralized area be beaconed off and a diagram thereof be submitted so as to enable the Surveyor-General to approve or confirm a mijnpacht diagram?</li>

</ol>

<p>You will therefore see that quite a few other difficulties arose from the existence of the mynpacht as we came to know it, in its present form. In fact, the past years have shown that it is a redundant system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to deal with some other points. Unfortunately I cannot elaborate too much on points in this Bill, because one can elaborate very far on this Bill. One can only touch on certain principles here and there. I may refer to the question raised by previous speakers as well, that the owner of the land should also get a prospecting permit. It strikes one at once that it appears as though the owner is now no longer the master of his own farm because he has to go to the authorities to get a permit to go prospecting. At first glance it appears as though the Government is in fact infringing his ownership in that respect. But this is actually not so, because his ownership keeps that control in his hands. He can decide whether he wants to prospect and whether someone else can prospect on his farm. He merely has to obtain a permit from the authorities, and there is a very good reason for that, because the Department of Mines must know what is happening in the mining industry. In such a large and vital industry as the mining industry it is essential that the Department and also the Minister of Mines should know what is happening in the country and where development is taking place and where prospecting will be undertaken. Mr. Speaker, in terms of this provision, if an owner cannot exercise his prospecting rights or his exploitation rights, the State can appoint someone to do the necessary. He retains his rights as owner because he will still reap the benefits of that exploitation or prospecting, which is preserved for him in the Bill. But, Sir, the mining industry is so important to South Africa that the State must be able to take a hand in such cases.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further question, and that is the position if the existing surface rights lapse. If the mining title lapses through the deproclamation of the land, what will the position be then? In the Committee various suggestions were made in this regard. The Chamber of Mines made two proposals. The first related to mining plant. Obviously their proposal would have suited them very well. If land is deproclaimed because its surface is no longer exploited, they retain a small portion of the land in terms of their mining title. They relinquish up the rest. But then they still retain all the surface rights attached to the mining title. They then retain surface rights to which they should actually not be entitled. They actually pay nothing for those rights. They do not pay the owner for the plant erected there. In my opinion the Committee made a very sound arrangement in this connection. The Committee said that they will have to compensate for all land occupied by such plant, and that the owner of the land shall be protected during the term of their activities.</p>

<p>Their second proposal related to houses erected by mining companies. When the land is deproclaimed the structures, i.e. the houses, must be removed within six months. If the houses are not removed within six months they accrue to the surface owner. The situation that arose then was that there was a head-on collision, a stalemate. One concern would not give way to the other. They wanted to retain ownership of their houses, and the landowner naturally wanted the right to his land. It was proposed by the Chamber of Mines that those people should be compensated only for the value of the land. They would then retain and sell the houses as a township. Then the poor <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0186"/>landowner, who for all those years enjoyed virtually no benefits because the surface owner enjoyed the benefits, would ultimately have to forfeit his land as well. They went even further. They proposed: If the surface owner cannot expropriate the land within three months at that price, it should be possible for the landowner to buy them out at the value of the buildings on that land. That means that the small man, the landowner, simply cannot compensate for all those houses, because they cost a lot of money. That would simply have meant that the surface owner would ultimately have gained the advantage in that regard as well. Consequently the Committee considered this matter at great length and then decided that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained. If they insist on keeping the houses they will have to come to an equitable agreement with the landowner, and if they cannot come to such an agreement, they will have to remove the houses as provided by the present legislation.</p>

<p>I now come to the last point I want to raise this afternoon. It is a point which was raised by two previous speakers, i.e. the hon. member for Rosettenville and the hon. member for Karoo. It relates to the rights of Bantu and Coloureds in terms of this legislation. As far as the hon. member for Rosettenville is concerned, what he raised was a matter of policy; in point of fact, a matter which has nothing whatsoever to do with this legislation. This legislation is quite clear. It is making a very big change, and a very big concession to the Bantu in South Africa. He referred to the Bantu only, and I therefore want to deal with the position as regards the Bantu only. To them it means a very great privilege and very great progress. Under the existing legislation a Bantu could obtain no prospecting rights in South Africa; neither in his own area nor outside his area. Nor could he obtain mining rights inside or outside his area. Now this Bill entitles him to obtain those rights inside his area. There he can prospect and exploit.</p>

<p>Now that hon. member went somewhat further and said: But they are ignorant and they have no money. They are not strong in capital. He wanted to know from the Minister how that exploitation would take place within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s present policy that no White capital may be utilized in the Bantu areas. Our policy in this matter was formulated very clearly in the course of past years by the previous <b>Prime Minister, Dr. Ver</b>woerd, who said that such exploitation would be done by way of agency. The agent could be anybody appointed by the State. He mentioned the Bantu Trust, which would undertake the exploitation. Let me tell him that the Bantu Trust is nothing but a Native in terms of our legislation. If the Native had not been able to exercise those powers previously, he would not have been able to do so now. But now we are making this change. Is it desirable that the Trust itself should exploit? I do not think so, Sir. I think it is in accordance with the policy formulated by the late Dr. Verwoerd that such exploitation should not be undertaken by the Trust or by the State but by way of agency. We know that mining demands a great deal of capital. Only an undertaking that is strong in capital can venture into mining nowadays. Therefore mining in the Bantu areas will now also be undertaken for the Bantu and to his benefit by an agency. We shall have to decide on a later occasion who that agent will be. These are matters of policy, however, and have nothing to do with a consolidating measure such as this one. It is a matter we can discuss in open debate on the relevant Vote. It has nothing to do with this legislation.</p>

<p>Then I want to reply to the hon. member for Karoo, who spoke about Coloureds. I am surprised and astonished that any man can be as ungrateful as the hon. member for Karoo. He made all kinds of allegations and statements, as though he owned all the wisdom in the world, as though he is the only man who knows what is right and just on God&#x2019;s earth. We are becoming rather tired of the hon. member for Karoo, of the things he says and the allegations he makes across the floor of the House. It is time the hon. member reconsidered and cultivated a sense of balance. They say old age mellows, but it seems to me as though that will never be the case as far as he is concerned. Perhaps it has happened to me. The Bill before us at present grants important rights to the Coloureds. They receive the same rights as the Bantu and somewhat more. They receive somewhat more, because the Bantu cannot go prospecting on State-owned land. He may go prospecting only in his own area, whereas the Coloured is given that right. He may prospect on State-owned land. He may exploit on State-owned land. Now the hon. member would have it that the Coloureds were the only prospectors in South Africa, for according to him the Coloureds discovered diamonds. According to him the Coloureds discovered gold. History taught me that it was a little boy&#x2014;a White boy&#x2014;who picked up the glittering stone and showed it to other people. Now he would have it that it was the Coloureds who discovered it. Mr. Speaker, those people may prospect in their own areas. They may do all the prospecting they like in their own areas. They will get those rights and when there is State-owned land on which prospecting can be done, they may also apply and they will also be allowed to prospect there. They will also get the mining rights there, because in terms of this legislation, if a prospecting right is allocated to a person then, as the hon. the Minister of Justice said, that person gets an inalienable right to get the mining lease as well in respect of the place to which he held his prospecting rights.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Parktown has stated here that one may well wonder why such a comprehensive piece of legislation as the one we are <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0187"/>dealing with here to-day was not introduced much sooner. It is a fact that it would have been of great value if the hon. the Minister and the Department could have come forward with such a comprehensive piece of legislation sooner. However, it is such a tremendously great task which has now been accomplished that one would rather see the Bill completed at a later stage in order to ensure a sound piece of legislation than to have had it appear sooner in a half-baked and ill-considered form.</p>

<p>The writer-philosopher Aesop told of a man who was a little worried about the lack of diligence and industry on the part of his sons. On his death-bed he called them in and told them of a treasure buried somewhere on his farm, a treasure of, let us say, precious metals, with which incidentally this Bill is concerned. However, he deliberately omitted to say precisely where this treasure was buried. After his death his sons began diligently to search for the treasure and in the process they dug up the soil on the farm very thoroughly. The result was that the crops which they planted grew very well and yielded good harvests. The writer tells us that the sons never found the treasure but as a result of their diligent searching they reaped good crops and thus became rich. But another important result of the sons&#x2019; inability to find the treasure was that, because there was no dispute over the treasure, they did not fall out with one another over the farm.</p>

<p>This measure which we now see before us is an attempt to divide the treasures which lie hidden beneath the soil of the Republic of South Africa so fairly that there can be no dispute over it. That then is the reason, in reply to what the hon. member for Parktown said, why this Bill could not be introduced earlier. Great care had to be taken to ensure that the treasures beneath our soil were divided fairly amongst those who were interested in it. Dividing these precious metals and other treasures fairly is a tremendous task. This measure, of course, only deals with certain of those treasures. It does not deal with diamonds, etc., but only with precious metals, semi-precious minerals and natural oil. Over the years a long list of minor Acts have been placed on the Statute Book with the purpose of dividing up these treasures as fairly as possible. According to the Schedule of the Bill there are 47 Acts which are now wholly or in part being replaced by this Bill. Laws have been made on this subject since as far back as 1865, that is for more than 100 years. This measure is a consolidation of all these laws, but it is more than just that. It also attempts to eliminate inconsistencies and keep pace with changing ideas and customs of our time. To do all that was a tremendous task and I, as an uninitiated member of the Commission, was very soon impressed by the tremendous scope of this task.</p>

<p>That is why. together with the hon. the Minister of Justice, I want to pay tribute to the officials in the Department of Mines who performed this task for us. Everywhere one encounters conflicting interests which have to be reconciled with one another. Yet the Department has succeeded in reconciling almost all these conflicting interests with one another, and it speaks volumes for the Job-like patience and Solomon-like wisdom of the officials. I want to pay this tribute to the dedication, patience and wisdom with which these officials have completed such a tremendous task. This brilliant work considerably facilitated the Commission&#x2019;s task, but it was nevertheless a comprehensive task for the members of the Commission as well. Since the Commission could ultimately give unanimous decisions on almost all the points at issue, this fact again speaks volumes for the chairman of the Commission. That is why we are not at all astonished to find, so soon after the completion of this task, that he has been called upon to assume greater responsibility.</p>

<p>Throughout the negotiations of the Department and the consultations of the Commission, the principle of private ownership was strictly adhered to. The two exceptions which I have just referred to are in fact concerned with the question of private ownership. In both cases there was only one member of the Commission who differed from the rest of the Commission. Let me at once associate myself with what the hon. the Minister of Justice said&#x2014;he was chairman of the Commission&#x2014;where he also pays tribute to the three members of the Commission who are no longer present in this House. The three members were nominated by the United Party to serve on the Commission. These three members not only lost their seats at the election; some of them had already been eliminated at the Party nominations. A person sometimes wonders whether hon. members on the opposite side do not commit errors in their nominations, because it appears to me that the best members have not returned. Nevertheless those three ex-members really performed valuable work on that Commission.</p>

<p>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, one of the Commission members differed from the rest of the Commission on two points in particular, and both these points relate to private ownership. The Commission as well as the Department adopted the attitude that private ownership would in fact be respected. We are thinking here, for example, of the request from the Chamber of Mines to the effect that the owner of the mineral rights should have the right to acquire the land on which the houses are standing. As the hon. member for Heilbron indicated very clearly, it is a principle of Roman-Dutch law that the owner should retain those rights. The Commission therefore conceded the point made by the Commission member in question, namely Mr. Taurog.</p>

<p>The other point on which Mr. Taurog differed from the rest of the Commission was in connection with the disclosure of borehole results. When a prospecting company obtains <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0188"/>borehole results and does not subsequently proceed to exploitation, he wanted that prospector to be compelled, after a certain period of time, to disclose those results so that when that prospector did not himself want to undertake exploitation, a smaller company which would in fact be prepared to do so could proceed to undertake exploitation.</p>

<p>But here too the Commission acknowledged that the Chamber of Mines, which raised objections to the request, was right because one does not readily tamper with the rights of someone who has obtained those rights at great cost. That is why I want once more to associate myself with the hon. Chairman of that Commission and pay tribute to those officials of the Department who have presented us with such a colossal piece of work, a piece of work which will in fact stand as a monument to their Job-like patience and Solomon-like wisdom.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I want to express my appreciation to the hon. members who participated in this debate, to the hon. members who served on the Commission as well as to hon. members opposite. They have had to make a study of this Bill and the report. They have not had the opportunity of sitting on the Commission, but have made a very thorough study and have acquainted themselves with the merits of the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville referred to a number of matters. One of these was the case of an existing mining lease where it was economically feasible to extend such a mining lease to adjoining land and where problems arose because the owner was unwilling to transfer his rights to the mining company. He said that such a party should be treated fairly. That is correct. This legislation makes provision for that. Notice will be given to such a party, etc. The Mining Leases Board may then determine what compensation should be paid to such a party. Throughout the legislation the important role played by the Mining Leases Board since the existence of laws relating to mining leases, has been retained and I think that we can only say that this Board, in the form in which it has existed over the years, has fulfilled a very important function in allocating the royalties or compensation accruing to the owners or to the holders of rights or to the State. The Board consists of the Government Mining Engineer, the Secretary for Finance, the Secretary for Inland Revenue and the Registrar of Mining Titles. I think that in the course of years the Board has gained sufficient experience to enable it to know approximately what amount will constitute a reasonable compensation, and in this case too it can see to it that the proper compensation will be paid.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to White housing which may exist in the case of mines which were closing-down and also to compounds. This is a real problem because one would not like to see valuable housing being lost in a country where there is still a large demand for housing. I notice from section 80 of the report that the Commission too gave attention to this aspect. Basically the problem is that a large percentage of the housing erected by mining companies does not stand on the companies&#x2019; own land. They only have a right to erect houses on such land. The owner of the land is not usually the owner of the mine as well. The mine effects improvements with its capital on another man&#x2019;s land. Common law provides that the rights and privileges are of a person who effects improvements on another man&#x2019;s land. He has to remove such improvements before the expiry date of the lease and if he fails to do so such improvements will pass to the owner. This is a real problem and it often happens that the parties fail to reach an agreement. Such property cannot be expropriated without difficulty. The Commission investigated the aspect of whether there should be a right of expropriation but decided against it because it would have resulted in the valuable part of mining land, the housing part, being expropriated while the owner would have been left with the mine dumps or the shafts and the silt dams after the valuable part had been expropriated. The best thing, of course, is when the mining company and the owner can come to an agreement. There are cases, such as that of Dominion Reefs, which are of a similar nature. I can tell you that when it was decided to transfer that property to the State, Government Departments, Defence as well as Community Development, thoroughly investigated whether it was possible to take it over but did not see their way clear to do so and the property was eventually taken over by a private company. There is also another problem and that is that mining companies usually erect the buildings on the land without having to make sub-divisions or declaring such land a township. Therefore, if the property has to be sold I think that it will be necessary to survey the land, declare it a township and to make provision for water, lights, etc., which is not always such an easy thing to do. However, even the Commission felt that further attention may be given to the matter and I think we shall all agree that it will be the right thing if that housing could be preserved. But we shall have to leave that to private initiative which will perhaps be able to find the best solution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville also referred to what the position was in the Bantu homelands, on land which belongs to the Bantu Trust or is tribal land or private Bantu land. As far as those rights are concerned, this Bill effects no amendment to the existing legislation. The present position is that there are 30 mining leases in respect of land belonging to the Bantu Trust, 46 mining leases in respect of tribal land and 13 in respect of private Bantu land. There are also 82 prospecting rights in respect of those lands. Therefore the position there is not being affected and no changes are being effected as regards the <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0189"/>future and the policy which will be implemented there. A Commission of Inquiry, under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Heilbron, investigated this matter and if there is to be any change of policy it will depend on the Minister of Bantu Administration. As far as this legislation is concerned the position therefore remains unchanged. In Bantu areas Bantu companies may apply and such applications will be considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown referred to the provisions relating to prospecting for oil contained in this legislation. I think we all agree that it is important that they should be contained in this legislation. For that reason provision is being made for the provisions relating to oil to come into operation as soon as this legislation is passed. I can only tell the hon. member that at this moment contracts are ready and waiting, contracts to be entered into with companies in respect of prospecting on the continental shelf, something on which many millions of rand will be spent. As soon as this legislation is passed, those contracts will be entered into immediately.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo referred to discrimination against Coloured Persons and asked why that was necessary. It is true that there is a certain measure of discrimination. As far as Bantu are concerned, they can only obtain prospecting rights in Bantu areas. As regards Coloured persons, they can obtain those rights on State land in the Cape Province, as well as on private land where Coloured persons have a controlling interest. In the first place, I want to point out that this is an extension as far as Coloured persons are concerned. In the past Coloured persons could only obtain such a right in the Cape Province in respect of private property in which they had a controlling interest. That restriction has been removed and they can now obtain that right in all provinces. Therefore, as far as that right is concerned, this is an extension.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that there is another type of land. Apart from State land and private land there is alienated State land and as far as alienated State land is concerned the position is that the owner of alienated State land may for a consideration cede the prospecting rights to any person. As far as alienated State land is concerned it is possible for a Coloured person, like any other party, to obtain prospecting rights in respect of such land upon payment of a consideration. There is no restriction as far as that is concerned. I also want to point out that as regards State land Coloured persons cannot prospect on such land in other parts of the country but in the Cape Province there are 1,872,000 morgen of State land. When Coloured land is added to that there are more than 2 million morgen of land, mainly in the North-Western Cape, on which Coloured persons may in fact prospect. This is a large area. The hon. member nevertheless asked why there was discrimination in respect of other land. I can only say that I find it a pity that the hon. member raised this matter at this stage. This legislation was first introduced in 1965, was on the Table in 1966 but that matter was never brought to the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill. The Bill was referred to a Select Committee and was investigated by a Commission and invitations were extended to submit evidence but the hon. member, who is a representative of the Coloureds, never submitted any evidence to the Commission to the effect that there was discrimination and that it should be eliminated. If the hon. member felt so strongly about the matter he most certainly has had many opportunities for making representations to which consideration could then have been given as such representations would have had certain implications. Just consider the definition of a &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D; in the legislation. A Coloured person is someone who is not a White person or a Bantu. That means that for the purposes of this legislation such a person may also be an Indian or a Chinese. The question is whether you wish to grant that right in certain areas. There are questions of principle about which no decision has been taken or which have not even been considered. However, a principle which has never been departed from in our mining legislation is that the person who obtains a prospecting right also obtains the mining lease. That means that if this discrimination did not exist Coloured persons could prospect anywhere and would be granted mining leases in White areas when they made discoveries. You will realize that this too has certain implications which must be considered. For those reasons I am sorry that the hon. member raised this question at this late stage whereas there had been many opportunities to do so during the past number of years after the legislation had been announced.</p>

<p>I think I have now replied to the most important points, and I move the Second Reading.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill is not so much to introduce a new dispensation in regard to the registration of mining titles, but to adapt existing legislation to present-day circumstances in the best interests of the interested parties, and to make provision for the requirements relating to registration which will arise at the commencement of the Mining Rights Bill which has just been disposed of. It will make applicable uniform registration provisions, modelled to a large extent on the principles of the Deeds Registries Act, No. 47 of 1937, as amended, in all the provinces. Similarly this Bill does not envisage establishing a new registry office, but adaptating the present office of the Registrar of Mining Titles in Johannesburg <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0190"/>to changed circumstances. Initially the Mining Titles Office, to which reference is made in clause 2 and which was established by section 3 of Act No. 25 of 1909, of the Transvaal, only had jurisdiction in the Transvaal. However, the registration powers of the office in question were extended gradually by subsequent Union legislation so that certain rights originating in other provinces may at present also be registered in the office in question. Examples of such subsequent legislation are: (a) Act No. 55 of 1926, which is applicable to land in respect of which the State has reserved to itself the mineral rights; (b) the Orange Free State Mining Metal Act, No. 13 of 1936; (c) the Base Minerals Amendment Act, No. 39 of 1942, and (d) the Natural Oil Act, No. 46 of 1942.</p>

<p>However, in spite of these adaptations, valuable rights still exist and orginate at present, particularly in terms of the older mineral legislation which cannot be registered in the Mining Titles Office, and such a state of affairs is, of course, undesirable. Apart from this the present Registration Act, which has been in existence for more than half a century, presents certain administrative problems and no longer meets present-day needs. Simultaneously with the commencement of the new mining rights legislation in substitution, <i>inter alia</i>, for the above-mentioned mineral legislation, it is also the intention, in order to surmount all these problems, to put into operation a new registration Act which will grant the Mining Titles Office the required greater registration powers and which will bring about uniformity in all the provinces.</p>

<p>The Bill, which provides how and where the Mining Titles Office will operate, what rights will be registerable in that office and how registration will take place, is, as I have said, based on the existing and well-tried principles of the Deeds Act, with the necessary adaptations to provide in the particular needs which exist in respect of the registration of mining titles and allied rights connected with prospecting and mining. Holders of mining rights and experienced conveyancers with an intimate knowledge of the registration of the sort of right involved in this Bill, plainly intimated that the Bill met with approval and expressed the hope that it would be placed on the Statute Book soon. Use was made of proposals received from the Association of Law Societies of Southern Africa, and it may therefore be accepted that the Bill will also enjoy the support of that body.</p>

<p>The interpretation of terms in Chapter I is self-explanatory and does not require separate motivation, but I should like to point out that the interpretation of the concepts &#x201C;notary public&#x201D; and &#x201C;conveyancer&#x201D; is such that for the purposes of this Bill it eliminates the provincial jurisdictional limits which obtain under the Deeds Act. This is being done to obviate inconvenience and to prevent Transvaal notaries public and conveyancers from being favoured above those in other provinces, in view of the fact that in this case there will only be one central Mining Titles Office. This step is being welcomed by interested parties; as a matter of fact, the Association of Law Societies made representations to this effect.</p>

<p>As regards Chapter II, it is merely being provided that the office of the Registrar of Mining Titles will remain in existence, the required greater registration powers and duties being added. However, it is appropriate to point out that, in order to remove any doubt which may have existed previously as regards the possible registration of mining titles in both the Mining Titles and Deeds Offices, it is being provided now in subsection (3) of clause 2 that a right to mine which is capable of being registered in the Mining Titles Office, will not be deemed to be a lease of a right to minerals for the purposes of the Deeds Registries Act and will therefore not be registerable in the Deeds Office. It is also necessary to point out that, just as in the case of the Deeds Act, provision is also being made now in clause 9 for the establishment of a Regulations Board on which two conveyancers, recommended by the Association of Law Societies, will hold office. The regulations made by the board in regard to matters over which it is being granted jurisdiction in clause 10, will be subject to the approval of the State President.</p>

<p>Chapters III to X contain the more general registration provisions which will be applicable in the Mining Titles Office. The clauses are self-explanatory and the chapters, just as in the case of the previous chapters, adhere, with the necessary adaptations, to the general principles and even the appropriate wording, where practicable, of the Deeds Act. In our country the Deeds Act is the basis of registration and serves as proof of registration to the rest of the world. It is a well-tried measure, and in the main the provisions of that Act are now also made to apply to the registration of mining titles.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The 1967 edition of this Bill is a great improvement on the 1966 edition which we had before us a year ago, and we on this side of the House are prepared to support the Bill as now introduced by the hon. the Minister. It is quite clear that in the interim the Minister has had the opportunity of receiving representations and suggestions, both from the Association of Law Societies and from the Chamber of Mines, and to the extent that these have been included in the Bill now before us, the measure has been considerably improved.</p>

<p>Sir, while dealing with this aspect of the matter, I might once again draw attention to the fact that the Minister in this instance might have been saved considerable time and worry had this Bill been published a little earlier so that there would be an opportunity for professional and other bodies to consider the draft before it was actually presented in this House. Sir, there are still some matters under <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0191"/>this Bill as we now have it before us which would appear to need further consideration, and I merely raise them at this stage so that they can receive the consideration of the Department. I refer first of all to the definition of &#x201C;prospecting contract&#x201D; in clause 1. While the definition which appeared in the first edition of this Bill has been amended by the addition of the words &#x201C;or tribute&#x201D; in line 59, it still does not conform to the definition of &#x201C;prospecting contract&#x201D; as contained in the Deeds Office Registries Act. Although it is correct that under section 2 (3) of the Bill to which the hon. the Minister made reference prospecting contracts, if they fall within this definition, would appear to be registerable only in the one office, there may still be prospecting contracts which fall under the old definition which may still be registered in the Deeds Registry. It seems that there is a possibility of some confusion arising if this position is not corrected.</p>

<p>Then the second point is the possibility that registration in the Central Registry may lead to some considerable delays in the actual registration of agreements or contracts which are registerable under this particular Bill. I refer to the fact that the Central Titles Office which is presented with a title deed and, for instance, a prospecting contract for registration, is then obliged to send the title deed with the prospecting contract to the Deeds Registry in which the property is situate. For instance, if there were to be a prospecting contract registerable over a property in the Cape area, the Registrar in the Mining Titles Office is now obliged to send a copy of the contract which he is registering, together with the title deeds of the property, to the Registrar in Cape Town in order that an endorsement can be made on the Deeds Office copy of the title deed in Cape Town. I understand from those who deal with this type of registration that in practice it takes an inordinate length of time before the title deeds are returned from the second registry office. It may be that this procedure is followed as a precaution in case the copy which is presented to the Registrar of the Titles Office is perhaps a mutilated one, one which has been altered in some respect or other and should be collated with the copy in the Deeds Office in the other centre. But it is a matter which gives practitioners a good deal of trouble and leads to a good deal of delay.</p>

<p>The third point is that under this particular Bill there is no possibility of registration of participation bonds which have been brought into operation under the 1964 Act. Participation bonds cannot be registered under this particular Act and I think that is a defect. It may well be that participation bonds might have to be registered in relation to the various mining titles which will be registered under <b>this particular Bill.</b></p>

<p>Then finally, Sir, this Registration Bill is linked to the Administration of Estates Act of 1965 which, as the hon. the Minister will be aware, is not yet operative and one wonders what arrangements are being made to ensure that when the Mining Titles Bill is promulgated, the new Administration of Estates Act will be brought into operation contemporaneously, otherwise it may well be that persons looking at this Bill when promulgated as an Act, will then have to take cognisance of the fact that the 1965 Administration of Estates Act has not been promulgated and look for some corresponding provision in the old Administration of Estates Act which is still applicable. I know that these are administrative matters and I realize that the hon. the Minister may not be able at this stage to react to the suggestions which I have put forward, but I put them forward as matters which could well be considered by the Department. In the meantime this Bill meets with the approval of this side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>It is to a large extent a natural tendency and because of administrative endeavour that we have before us to-day this Bill in its improved form. It facilitates the administration of this matter considerably for the Department. It is strange or paradoxical rather, as the hon. the Minister said in regard to other legislation, that the legislation under discussion has not been smartened up since 1909, but I think that in this case it is attributable to the lengthy processing which any good legislation has to undergo before it can be introduced in this House.</p>

<p>I understand that this Bill was circulated amongst those taking an interest in the matter, people in various practices, in the mining industry and particularly in legal firms connected with it. Comments and suggestions were obtained by the Department from all legal firms in Johannesburg and elsewhere, firms which for the most part do legal work for the mining companies, and where their suggestions were practicable, they were incorporated in the legislation. It was encouraging to hear that this Bill was received very well. I obtained from the Department of Mines the following excerpts taken from the comments received from various firms&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The draft Bill is comprehensively drafted;</li>

<li>(b) We consider the measure long overdue and hope that it will become law;</li>

<li>(c) We have perused the draft Bill with great interest and venture to express our approval and appreciation of same. We hope that the Bill will become law.</li>

</ol>

<p>These few quotations indicate very clearly that a need existed for more modern legislation of this nature, legislation which will be applicable on a uniform basis throughout the Republic, and that it is welcomed by notaries public and conveyancers everywhere. It is really a miracle to think that we in the Republic of South Africa have different legislative measures for the same item with which notaries public and conveyancers throughout South Africa have had to work. One finds that the legislation <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0192"/>in the Transvaal, Natal, the Free State and the Cape differs slightly, and for that reason this Bill will, of course, make it so much easier for our officials in the various Departments as well to deal with mining titles. It is a wrong and probably also dangerous state of affairs that many important mining rights granted in the Cape Province and in Natal in terms of the existing Mineral Legislation, cannot be registered in a central registry-office. It was gladdening to see in the Mining Rights Bill, which has already been dealt with, that provision was being made for retrospective registration&#x2014;that is, in accordance with the Registration of Mining Titles Bill&#x2014;of the numerous base mineral leases and mining claims granted in the Cape and Natal respectively during the past decade. Just as in the Transvaal and in the Orange Free State, it will be possible to mortgage such rights, and for this reason, too, proper registration is essential. This is the very point I do not quite understand, the point raised by the hon. member for Green Point, because here the mortgaging of these leases are specifically taken into account. As regards the general provisions of the Bill, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we are not dealing here with new principles, but that, as the hon. the Minister has already indicated, the relevant provisions in the Deeds Registries Act, 1937, were followed virtually throughout. Therefore, on glancing through the Bill, one finds that, as the provisions read at present, a large number of them follow exactly the same wording as those of the corresponding sections in the Deeds Act. To summarize therefore, one can say that one finds relatively few provisions in the Bill which do not already appear in the Deeds Act of 1937, and for this reason there seems to be no necessity for going into the individual clauses. Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that this legislation, just as the sounds of a new mine, is sound which comes from and has its origins in the native soil of our Fatherland. It fits in with and it is in the spirit of new developments in other spheres of national life and in the sphere of our legal practices which are connected with the mining industry, and I believe that the hon. the Minister and his Department can be very proud of this, the fruits of their labour.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am glad that this supplementary legislation also enjoys the support of the entire House. The hon. member for Green Point pointed out that it would perhaps have helped a great deal if this legislation had been published earlier. I can only say that the very reason behind the introduction of this Bill at an earlier stage last year, was with a view to publication; otherwise it would have entailed double publication. It would have had to be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and once again later, when it was introduced in the House. As you know, it appeared on the Order Paper for the best part of the year but it was not dealt with further at that time. The hon. member made reference here to the definitions of mining lease. It is correct that the prospecting rights are not the same in the two laws. But I think that they are in fact intended to be two separate registrations. The requirements laid down for both of them are not equally severe, if I may put it that way. However, there cannot be a confusion because of the provisions of the Deeds Office. It is a pity that the same requirements are apparently not laid down, but I think this is more as a result of practical problems which exist. The hon. member referred to delays which took place when deeds had to be sent to and fro. I think it is an administrative matter which may perhaps be improved upon, and the Department will follow up the suggestion made by the hon. member for Green Point to see whether the process cannot be expedited. As regards the registration of participation bonds, I want to say this: Initially there was an attempt to make them registerable as well, but it was particularly the Chief Registrar of Deeds who had misgivings and objections to such a step. As regards that aspect, it was subsequently decided to act on his suggestion by not making provision in this Bill for such bonds. The hon. member also referred to the fact that the Administration of Estates Act of 1965 had not yet come into operation. Well, it will only be possible to apply this Act, the Registration Act, after this new Mining Act, in respect of which the Second Reading has just been agreed to, comes into force. A considerable number of regulations have to be drafted still to supplement the Mining Rights Act. It will therefore take a considerable time before that part of the Act comes into operation. However, it is a good thing that the hon. member pointed that out. By that time the Administration of Estates Act will probably be in operation. Then the problem will not exist. However, we shall consider that matter thoroughly when this Act comes into operation and see to it that no confusion will arise.</p>

<heading>MAINTENANCE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>.</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Now that the Maintenance Act, 1963, has been in operation for some time and there has been an opportunity of observing the application thereof, it would appear that the provisions in terms of which action is taken against absent and recalcitrant witnesses in maintenance courts are cumbersome and ineffective. As hon. members of the House are apparently aware, persons against whom maintenance orders are required are summoned in the same way as witnesses and a <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0193"/>maintenance court cannot itself take action against absent or recalcitrant witnesses and consequently also it cannot do so against fathers who try to evade their responsibilities by disregarding summonses. Separate criminal proceedings must in every, case be instituted against such persons if action is to be taken against them. In the meantime of course the inquiry by the maintenance court in question cannot be proceeded with, with the result that those whose maintenance is the subject of the entire matter, often have to endure great hardships.</p>

<p>But what is more, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that the institution of criminal proceedings owing to failure to be present at a maintenance inquiry, does not necessarily ensure the presence of the person in question at a later session of the maintenance court. When the criminal proceedings against him have been disposed of, he can, as does in fact happen in practice, continue to remain absent from the sessions of the maintenance court in spite of any punishment imposed upon him. Neither are there any statutory provisions in terms of which he can be arrested and brought before the maintenance court. The proceedings of the maintenance court in question may therefore be deliberately delayed, to the detriment and discomfort of those persons requiring maintenance. Another aspect I want to touch upon here is the case of recalcitrant witness. As you know, a person who is responsible for another person&#x2019;s maintenance, can be summoned to give evidence at an inquiry into his obligation to maintain that person. It is particularly necessary that the person who has to pay the maintenance should be called as witness in those cases where he, as often happens, is the only person who can give evidence as to his ability to maintain his dependants. However, it does happen that such a person sometimes refuses at the inquiry to furnish details of his financial means, with the result that the proceedings of the maintenance court are thereby obstructed.</p>

<p>The fact that summary action by the maintenance court in question cannot be taken against such recalcitrant witnesses strengthens the latter in their irresponsible behaviour and leads to the proceedings of maintenance courts not being regarded with the necessary respect. Mr. Speaker, hon. members will understand that I cannot allow the administration of justice to be thwarted in so flagrant a fashion or that young children should be exposed to starvation as a result. As it appears to me, short shrift should be given to those who deliberately obstruct the proceedings of maintenance courts, and it ought to be made possible for maintenance courts, as in the case of other courts of justice, to institute a summary inquiry into the failure of a person to be present at, remain at or reply to questions at the proceedings of a maintenance court. Hon. members will also note that in clause 1 of the Bill which is now before the House it is the intention to make the provisions of section 211 and 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> in relation to persons summoned under the maintenance act to appear before a maintenance court, and to endow the maintenance court with the necessary powers in this connection. I believe that the acceptance of the proposed amendments will mean the end of our problem in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when a person fails to comply with a maintenance order, criminal proceedings can be instituted against him in terms of section 11 of the Maintenance Act. At the hearing of such a person, however, it is necessary that the particulars of the maintenance order made against him be proved. The only legal way in which that can be done at present is to call an officer of the maintenance court where the order has been issued as witness to hand the order in question in to the court. The maintenance court which issued the order and the criminal court which is trying the person in question in terms of section 11 are not necessarily always situated at the same place, with the result that officers have from time to time to undertake long journeys at Government expense, and at the cost of considerable disruption in their offices, in order to hand in such orders. The particulars of maintenance orders are seldom, if ever, disputed and there seems to be no sound reason why the handing in of certified copies cannot serve as <i>prima facie</i> proof in the said criminal cases. Such an arrangement will also to a large extent eliminate the delay experienced with the hearing of those criminal cases, and clause 2 of the measure makes provision for this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has the wholehearted support of this side of the House, and those of us who practise in the courts will bear out what the hon. the Minister has said that the situation in the maintenance courts has become somewhat absurd in that the courts do not have the powers that an ordinary court has to ensure that they can get down to the job of discovering what the facts are. I am sure, Sir, that the fact that the loopholes in this Act are now closed, will be welcomed by the whole community. As the hon. the Minister said, in the interests of those persons who are involved, who are usually small children, the extension of the operation of sections 211 and 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act, will provide a smoother, quicker and much more efficient method of enforcing maintenance. These courts, after all, Sir, are courts in the sense that they are there to decide what the facts in dispute are and as to what judgment the court may give as to what amount of money should be paid, and when, and how. It does seem rather extraordinary, Mr. Speaker, that these tribunals are somewhat emasculated in that firstly they could not, up to now, ensure that they obtained the evidence that was called for, and in the second place that when the witness who was to give evidence, was there, it did not have the power to force him to give evidence. And so, Sir, the <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0194"/>application of section 212, which provides that a recalcitrant witness can be imprisoned if he does not give the information required, is also to be welcomed. One is just surprised perhaps that these provisions were not put into the Maintenance Act of 1963, but we are glad that they are being put in now, and we do hope that this Bill and the extension of these powers will produce a much happier state of affairs than those which exist in the unfortunate circumstances of these courts.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>The Bill now before the hon. House is, I believe, a measure on which hon. members will not differ with me. Nevertheless, I want to discuss briefly with hon. members the considerations which gave rise to it. As you know, magisterial districts are divided, in terms of the existing legal provisions, in as many justice of the peace wards as the Minister of Justice may deem fit. The number of justice of the peace wards into which a district is divided is usually determined by practical considerations, and there is no uniform formula of application to all districts. There are certain urban areas, for example, where the entire district is demarcated as one ward, whereas certain rural areas are divided into quite a few wards.</p>

<p>The system under which justice of the peace wards are established dates from before 1914, when the Cape Province, for example, was divided into 80 wards as against the present 109 magisterial districts. Division of districts into justice of the peace wards serves no actual purpose, and because they are no longer announced in the <i>Gazette</i>, particulars concerning such wards are not known to the public either. What is more, however, is that, in the entire magisterial district in which the ward of a justice of the peace is situated, he holds all the powers and performs all the duties conferred or imposed upon justices of the peace by any law which is in force in that particular district. In exercising his powers and performing his duties he is therefore not restricted to his ward. Every time a new magisterial district is established, the boundaries of the justice of the peace wards in the particular district or districts from which the new district is constituted must be demarcated anew, as also those of the justice of the peace wards of the new district. For the Department of Justice and for the Surveyor-General this entails a considerable deal of work which actually serves no useful purpose.</p>

<p>In particular I want to bring it to the attention of the hon. members that the number of justices of the peace who may be appointed in respect of a magisterial district is not restricted, although it has been endeavoured until now to appoint no more than six justices of the peace in respect of any ward. This policy lends itself to anomalies, however, for in terms of the existing policy 60 justices of the peace may be appointed in respect of a rural district such as Vryburg, with its ten wards and a relatively small population, whereas only six justices of the peace may be appointed in respect of an urban district such as Germiston, for example, which consists of only one ward and has a much higher population figure than Vryburg. The number of justices of the peace required in respect of a district and the areas in which their services are required, can be determined with equal ease without the division of districts into wards. Consequently the provisions in terms of which magisterial districts are divided into wards and justices of the peace are appointed for wards, are now repealed in clauses 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Hon. members may want to know why the provisions relating to field-cornets are being repealed. In this regard I may just mention that as far as could be ascertained there are no longer any legal provisions, except in the case of shipwrecks, in terms of which powers and duties are conferred or imposed upon field-cornets or assistant field-cornets. The provisions relating to shipwrecks are obsolete and are no longer enforced. Consequently the reference to the powers and duties of field-cornets, etc., in section 3 of the Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act, 1963, is now deleted by clause 3. For the rest, clauses 3 and 4 contain certain consequential amendments which have become necessary with a view to the provisions of clauses 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Another matter with which I want to deal for a moment is the list of offices the holders of which are <i>ex officio</i> justices of the peace. It appears that the list is incomplete in certain respects, because it makes no provision for the holders of posts in the section of the Chief Law Adviser or in the section of the Attorney-General. Furthermore, the offices held by officers of the Prisons Service are not included in it either. The holders of the offices in question occupy the same position and enjoy the same standing as the holders of the offices included in the list at present and by virtue of the offices held by them they are preeminently fit to perform and exercise the duties and powers of justices of the peace. In view of all these circumstances the relevant list is therefore amplified accordingly. Hon. members should not, however, be misled by the fact that the entire proposed list is underlined. I can give them the assurance that clause 5 <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0195"/>contains only the existing list plus the additions to which I have referred. It was considered advisable to underline the entire list because the order in which the offices are mentioned in the list has been changed considerably.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 6 are essential with a view to the amendments proposed in clauses 1 and 2 and therefore need no further explanation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is necessary that I should mention to the House that there is a number of legal provisions contained in pre-Union laws which relate to justices of the peace. <i>Inter alia</i>, those provisions affect the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the duties and powers of justices of the peace to maintain public order;</li>

<li>(b) the terms of notice to be given to justices of the peace of the institution of actions against them, and the terms within which such actions shall be instituted;</li>

<li>(c) indemnity of certain persons against claims which may arise from actions taken during the execution of a warrant signed by a justice of the peace;</li>

<li>(d) evidence and awarding costs in civil actions instituted against justices of the peace.</li>

</ol>

<p>The matters regulated by the provisions concerned are at present either regulated by other legislation or are unserviceable and therefore redundant. The relevant provisions are consequently now repealed in clause 7.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has said that he believed that we would not differ from him. Indeed we do not and accordingly we shall support this measure. In doing so, I should like to thank the hon. the Minister for the careful exposition he gave of the limited number of clauses there are, and indeed for giving us explanations on one or two points which were quite interesting but which he might conceivably have thought not necessary to do. We are glad for these explanations. They have thrown a good deal of light on what might be regarded as small and unimportant aspects.</p>

<p>We were glad to have his reasons for this change. We can see the good sense of it ourselves. It seems to accord with the present-day situation. One can imagine that in the old times, when it was difficult to have transport, it was necessary to have smaller sub-divisions of magisterial districts.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned the inequality in the numbers of justices of the peace in the different magisterial districts, and we ourselves are, naturally, concerned about that. He will now, in terms of this measure, have complete power to appoint as many justices of the peace as he wishes in any magisterial district. We imagine that he will inevitably appoint far more in a very populous area than in a sparsely populated area. There are these various duties that justices of the peace have in connection with the maintenance of law and order, and other tasks, and clearly in a very populous area it is necessary to have more justices of the peace to take care of these duties.</p>

<p>It was interesting to have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment on the very minor duties still left to a field-cornet. I had personally not been able to discover that it was only in connection with shipwreck that they had their great function. It is a good thing that it has been recorded and brought to our attention to-day. When one is reminded by the hon. the Minister of this interesting old duty of the field-comet, it is interesting, perhaps, for our public to know that justices of the peace have quite considerable powers and duties, particularly in connection with arrests. These powers are set out in section 22 of our code of criminal procedure. As set out there, there are 13 instances where he may arrest without warrant. To enlighten the House I propose to refer to some of them. He may arrest&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) any person who commits any offence in his presence;</li>

<li>(b) any person whom he has reasonable grounds to suspect of having committed an offence mentioned in the First Schedule;</li>

<li>(c) any person being or loitering in any place by night under such circumstances as to afford reasonable grounds for believing that he has committed or is about to commit an offence;</li>

<li>(d) any person found in any gambling house or at any gambling table, the keeping or visiting whereof is in contravention of any law for the prevention or suppression of gambling or games of chance.</li>

</ol>

<p>Those are four examples of instances where a justice of the peace, like any other peace officer, has a power and, indeed, a duty and a discretion to arrest without warrant.</p>

<p>Other powers of justices of the peace can also be gleaned from certain regulations made in regard to them. I think that some of these, too, will be of interest&#x2014;and perhaps amusement&#x2014;to the House. From the regulations made under the 1963 Act we can see that they had duties in regard to births and deaths registration. Incidentally, for each form that they complete in this regard, they receive five cents. They also have duties in regard to parliamentary elections and registration. The position in regard to their transport is most interesting in this present time. Their transport can vary from bicycle, to animal transport, to a motor car. It is interesting to note that for every mile done by bicycle the justice of the peace is entitled to charge 2c. On the other hand, for every mile done by him by means of animal transport, he can charge 3&#x00BD;c. For every mile <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0196"/>completed by him in a motor-car of ten horse power and under he can charge <i>2&#x00BD;c</i>, whilst for every mile done in a motor-car of over ten horse power he can charge 6c. If he goes by motor cycle he can charge <i>2&#x00BD;c</i> per mile.</p>

<p>Lastly there is the aspect which the hon. the Minister mentioned, namely the extension of the number of posts whose incumbents are <i>ex officio</i> justices of the peace. We are grateful for the Minister&#x2019;s explanation that in fact only three categories are added, notwithstanding the indication on the Bill before us. These, as he said, are fully justified, because they are offices of at least as high honour as the others which are at present <i>ex officio</i> justice of the peace offices. We accordingly also support this aspect of the Bill.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to say that I would be glad if the Minister could in reply perhaps give us some indication of the criteria which he uses in the appointment of justices of the peace at the present time. I would also be glad if he would confirm that, where the quality of the men justified it, he would favourably consider appointing far more justices of the peace in the case of a populous city area, particularly in a magisterial district where there is a very vast population.</p>

<p>With these few words, Sir, we on this side of the House support the measure.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands has given us some interesting information in regard to the power and duties of justices of the peace. I want to direct the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the part that Coloured men can play in filling this very important office. I know of no Coloured justice of the peace. The Minister might say that I have not been able to trace them all, if there are any at all; I can find none. I notice that the Minister now intends to amend the Act so as to appoint justices of the peace for a magisterial district. I can tell the Minister that from my experience Coloured people who have to have documents attested by a justice of the peace find it very difficult indeed, due to many factors, like the distance they have to travel, and probably they do not even know where to find the justice of the peace and so they go to the police station. I notice now that in the amended Schedule on page 4 the Minister has included a commissioned officer of the S.A. Police, but I would like to suggest that in the Coloured areas the Minister should consider somebody of a lesser rank than that.</p>

<p>But my main point is to plead with the Minister to consider the appointment of Coloured justices of the peace in areas which are predominantly Coloured. Let us take the magisterial area of Wynberg. That is a tremendously large area. Athlone, which is a completely Coloured area, falls within that magisterial area. It is a long distance away from the main Court and probably it is also a long way away from any justice of the peace who may be appointed for that area. But it is a predominantly Coloured area and I do believe that there are sufficient Coloured people learned enough to occupy that position. I am fortified in my appeal to the Minister by clause 3 (c), where it says &#x201C;to render all assistance possible in suppressing disorder or disturbance in such magisterial areas&#x201D;. Where would it be more proper for a Coloured justice of the peace to render assistance in time of disturbance than in Coloured areas?</p>

<p>I do not think it is intended that the White justice of the peace should act in that area when you can have people within that area, belonging to that group, who can render that service. I make a very strong appeal to the hon. the Minister that in view of the Government&#x2019;s policy to create these areas completely populated by Coloured people, this should be done. Here I want to refer also to the magisterial area of Stellenbosch. It stretches very far. You have areas like Firgrove and other places which are 90 per cent occupied by Coloureds, if not completely. I believe that the Minister can appoint Coloured persons, and I think he would be doing a great service to the Coloured community if he does so. I do not think I need stress my point. I think the Minister knows what I am trying to get at. I feel this is a glorious opportunity for the Government to show its <i>bona fides</i> to the Coloured people and not to exclude them in the areas where they can best serve the Coloured people, which I think is the intention. I hope the Minister will consider it and see what he can do about it. I have read the Act of 1957 and I find that in the Schedule there is no reference to the Department of Coloured Affairs, and I do not see any reference to it in this Bill. It may be that it has been amended, but I see no reference to it at <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0197"/>all in this book of mine which may not be annotated. I do not think there is a law at present which includes the Department of Coloured Affairs, and I think the Minister should do so in this amending legislation. I think the Minister might also consider an amendment to appoint justices of the peace where the Coloured Affairs Department have their regional offices. They have one in Bellville and the Coloured people have to go there. That also applies to areas like Genadendal and Pniel. If the people of Genadendal, which is a completely Coloured area, require the services of a justice of the peace, they must go all the way to Caledon and I can assure the Minister that it is not easy for them to travel that long distance. I believe that where the Coloured Affairs Department have established their offices, the Minister might consider the appointment of a justice of the peace. I know that some of them are commissioners of oaths, but they do not have the power of a justice of the peace, nor the higher status. There are certain documents which only a justice of the peace can sign and not a commissioner of oaths. I think the duties carried out by a justice of the peace should be extended to Coloured persons particularly in the Coloured areas. I feel sure that my appeal will not fall on deaf ears and I look forward with happy anticipation to the Minister&#x2019;s reply.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank hon. members on the opposite side for the way in which they received this measure. I just want to tell the hon. member for Pinelands that at present, under the system of the demarcation of wards, the Minister may of course appoint as many justices of the peace as he likes. It is merely a cumbersome method, and I have pointed out the anomalies to which it may give rise. He asked me what the position would be in future. I cannot tell him exactly at the present moment, except that I shall have to see to it that where there is a thickly populated region an adequate number of justices of the peace will be appointed to be able to serve the public properly. But at the same time I shall also have to take the surface area into consideration. In sparsely populated regions with long distances I shall be compelled to appoint a justice of the peace in respect of a smaller number of people. In other words, I shall have to take into consideration the density of the population as well as the surface area. Field-cornets and shipwrecks, such as the recent wreck of the <i>Seafarer</i>, have been mentioned. In the past it would have been the work of a field-cornet to stand guard there. At the moment the police do that.</p>

<p>Concerning the plea of the hon. member for Boland, it is my information that Coloureds have in fact been appointed as justices of the peace, although not many of them. It is of course an office which enjoys a very high standing and therefore in future, as in the past, there will be discrimination in the favourable sense of the word when such appointments are made. The hon. member made a plea for the appointment of Coloureds as justices of the peace in thickly populated Coloured residential areas. If there are Coloureds of outstanding quality and good character in a place such as Athlone, there is nothing that prevents them from being appointed as justices of the peace.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to column 2 of the schedule. I believe that under the various amendments made from time to time the Secretary for Coloured Affairs is in fact already a justice of the peace, but if he is not, the hon. member should actually plead with the Secretary for the Interior that he be appointed a justice of the peace, because this is an Act which is administered by the Minister of the Interior.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>There is an old Afrikaans saying that death must have a cause, and if there is no clarity about the cause of a death, then in terms of the legislation of virtually all civilized countries the authorities have to investigate until that cause has been determined. If the cause has been determined and it appears that the deceased person died as a result of natural causes, particulars of the death are recorded in official registers and all interested persons can then obtain a certificate indicating the relevant particulars, including the cause of the death.</p>

<p>In the Republic our legislation provides that it is the duty of every person present at a death to give notice of the particulars of that death, including the cause of the death, in the prescribed manner to the district registrar or assistant registrar of births and deaths, who shall register the death if he is satisfied that it was due to natural causes. If the officer concerned is not satisfied that the death was due to natural causes, it is his duty to report forthwith to the magistrate such facts concerning <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0198"/>the death as are known to him, and he may not register the death until the magistrate has authorized it, which is frequently done only after protracted investigations. In addition, cases frequently occur where the police investigate the death of a person who presumably died of unnatural causes. In such cases, too, a death may not be registered until the investigations, which are sometimes very lengthy, have been completed.</p>

<p>As a result of these inquests there can, firstly, be no registration of the death, and, secondly, no death certificate may be issued. In terms of the existing legislation, i.e. the Registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths Act, 1963, no official proof other than a death certificate may be issued in proof of the fact that a person has actually died. As a result it is frequently not possible to administer estates until the inquests and eventual prosecutions have been disposed of, and as a result the dependants left behind by the deceased person frequently suffer want of bread. Pursuant to thorough consultation between the Department of Justice and the Association of Law Societies of Southern Africa, it is proposed in this Bill that provisional death certificates shall be issued in cases where the cause of the death is not indicated. Such provisional death certificates may then be used purely as proof that the person concerned is in fact dead. The Association of Law Societies, the Department of Justice and also my Department are satisfied that such provisional death certificates will not give rise to malpractices which cannot be eliminated. A magistrate will give provisional notification of death to the district registrar of births and deaths of the district in which the death occurred, only when he has been satisfied in respect of the identity of the deceased person and the date of the death. That officer will record the relevant particulars and issue provisional death certificates to interested persons until such time as the inquests have been disposed of and the death registered.</p>

<p>The proposals contained in this Bill are, therefore, intended to meet persons who are in difficult circumstances through no cause of their own and to spare them undue hardship at a time when they already have a great deal to endure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House accept this Bill because we believe that this measure, whilst not absolutely necessary for the winding up of an estate, will most certainly expedite it by ensuring that claims are settled, insurance policies paid and the like. We feel that anything that can hurry the settling of estates will be a good thing. In most cases the person affected is perhaps a widow who is probably dependent upon the money from her husband&#x2019;s estate to be able to carry on the ordinary business of living. On that basis we believe that the establishment of the principle of a provisional death certificate will be of benefit. However, there are one or two queries that do arise in my own mind; they might not be very serious but I think this is the time to put them forward. Sir, this Bill is very simple and very straightforward but one wonders whether perhaps one or two consequential amendments should not have been made. I have not gone into this matter very thoroughly but let me mention to the hon. the Minister the sort of thing that I mean. Section 5 of the Act prescribes the duties of a district registrar and the assistant district registrar on receipt of notice of a birth or a death. The section provides for only one notice. It is obvious that in the case of an inquest the registrar is going to receive two notices. He is first of all going to receive the notice on which he will issue a provisional death certificate; then when the inquest proceedings have been completed and the cause of death has been determined he is going to get certain extra details from the official who conducted the inquest. I do not know whether provision has been made here or not for the handling of those extra details and whether in fact the provisional certificates will tend to be in fact the only registration of a death for a considerable period. I should like the hon. the Minister to go into the matter. If he cannot give us the answer now he can do so at the Committee Stage. This would be a good thing for us to have.</p>

<p>The other matter which comes to mind is whether&#x2014;it is a minor thing but I feel that we should also have this assurance from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;this procedure of issuing a provisional death certificate will not tend to stall the holding or the completion of inquests. I think that the hon. Minister might give us his assurance about this point. When once you have taken away the necessity to give a death certificate quickly for winding up and dealing with estates or perhaps the payment of an insurance policy, will not the urgency disappear? That is now all dealt with by granting a provisional certificate. But what about the procedure of holding an inquest for determining the cause of death? The urgency is then to a large extent taken away. I believe that the hon. Minister will have to keep his eye on this because if he does not do so I think there might be a tendency, under pressure of work, for these proceedings to be lengthened, to be shelved or to drag on for a period which would be far too long. We would therefore like the assurance of the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think there are any grounds for the hon. member&#x2019;s fears in respect of the question asked by him i.e., whether this temporary notification of registration&#x2014;it is not registration but a document issued to the effect that the person is in fact dead, in cases where the cause of death is not clearly apparent and known&#x2014;will eliminate the inquest, because that is not so in all cases. The amendment provides explicitly that the <span class="col_363-364" refersTo="page_0199"/>magistrate shall issue the provisional certificate only in those cases in respect of which he is satisfied that it is not sufficiently clear and if an investigation has to be instituted. But I want to assure the hon. member that it is also issued on the understanding that the actual permanent certificate must follow and must be issued later, when the causes of death are known after all the particulars and factual circumstances have been determined. It will then have to be registered. This provisional document is not registered as such and does not obviate the other. The other one, following the inquest, must be issued even if the registration has to be duplicated. That is absolutely essential. It is not intended to have it substituted.</p>

<p>The second point relates to that possible consequential amendment. I shall go into that matter with the assistance of the legal advisers, and see whether it is essential.</p>

<heading>ANIMAL DISEASES AND PARASITES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agricultural_and_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL AND WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the object of the Animal Diseases and Parasites Act is to safeguard our country&#x2019;s livestock against diseases being brought into the country from beyond our borders. For that reason it is probably one of the most important Acts to our farming community, and to the stockfarmers in particular. Although the provisions of that Act impose numerous obligations on the farmers, it has enabled the Veterinary Services Section of my Department to exercise the necessary control over animals coming into the country, and in so doing to act as the guardians of our livestock. The success these officials have had in combating animal diseases is well known, and one can only pay tribute to them for the unselfish manner in which they are rendering and have in the past rendered this great service to the Republic. The measure which is before the House for discussion now, contains only two principles, and they are two very briefly-worded principles.</p>

<p>The first principle is to make provision for the payment in advance of the remuneration in respect of the tending or feeding of animals which have to be detained at quarantine stations, and to extend the powers of the Minister so that he may dispose of animals in quarantine stations in cases where the owner or importer fails to pay the relevant remuneration in advance. All animals which are imported are subject to being detained at a quarantine station for a certain period to prevent them from bringing animal diseases into the country. The owner of such animals is compelled to compensate the State for expenses incurred in connection with the tending or feeding of such animals while they are detained in quarantine. It often happens that importers fail to compensate the State for the tending or feeing of the animals after the prescribed period of quarantine has expired, or that they even leave the animals, usually pets, at the quarantine stations and that one never hears from them again. By making it compulsory to pay in advance one will not only eliminate quite a number of administrative problems but also avoid fruitless expenditure being incurred by the State in respect of costs in connection with the tending or feeding of the animals or the tracing of owners. As explained, if an owner or importer fails to meet his obligations the animal will remain in the possession of the State, and the Minister will have the power to decide how the animal will be disposed of.</p>

<p>The second principle is to increase the fines payable in terms of section 28 of the principal Act. The fines prescribed in the Act at present, are still precisely the same as those prescribed in the Diseases of Stock Act, 1911. As a result of the decrease in the value of money since 1911 it means that the fines which may be imposed in terms of the 1956 Act are extremely small and do not serve their purpose because they no longer serve as a deterrent for those who contravene the Act. In view of the foregoing it is now proposed that the amounts of the relevant fines be increased to the amounts proposed in order to make them more realistic, and also to serve as deterrent so that the provisions of the Act will be complied with more meticulously.</p>

<p>I have already said that although this is a short Bill, it is one of the most important Bills because it deals with the protection of our livestock in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House takes pleasure in supporting this Bill, but I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to what may be regarded as anomalies in the Act at this stage. Dealing with Clause 2, I want to say that it is almost customary for the clearing agents to pay the cost of the quarantine of the animals on behalf of the importer. It will not make much difference whether he pays it at the end of the month or at the beginning of the month; consequently we gladly support the Bill. I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister that in most cases the feed is provided by the clearing agents themselves and that the compensation is based more on the daily cost of keeping the animal in quarantine, that is to say, for watering and tending the animal. For the information of the hon. the Minister I may just mention that it sometimes does happen that animals are imported into this country without their being accompanied by an export permit and a health certificate issued by the country exporting the animals. It happened in Durban recently that a herd of Hereford cattle remained in quarantine long after the quarantine period had expired because <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0200"/>they were not accompanied by a veterinary certificate issued by the country of export. In such cases the importer is faced with great problems in this connection and has no means of recourse.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 3 of the Bill and I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that in the existing legislation the wording is not the same in the English and Afrikaans texts. The English text reads as follows, and I read section 28 (a) (3) of the principal Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who with intent to spread disease moves or uses any animal infected with disease or any infectious thing&#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, I just wanted to draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to that. If the interpretation is that the animal should be moved, we have no objection to the penalty clause, but it is particularly severe, because if the owner of an animal removed from quarantine or infected with an infectious disease, such as lumpy-skin disease or foot-and-mouth disease, should merely &#x201C;move&#x201D; such an animal he would be guilty of an offence. He would be subject to a fine, and I am sure that the Minister will go into this at a later stage, perhaps during the Committee Stage of the Bill, so that we may have clarity in this connection and may know whether it should be interpreted as &#x201C;remove&#x201D; or &#x201C;move&#x201D;, because in the English text the word &#x201C;move&#x201D; is used while in the Afrikaans text the word &#x201C;verwyder&#x201D; is used. I have drawn attention to a few points, and I declare that this side of the House is prepared to support this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while I agree that there should be increases in the penalties, I do think that the penalties appear in this case to be rather vicious and severe. In respect of clause 28, dealing with pedigreed animals lawfully brought into the Republic, and which have been through quarantine stations, a problem is brought to mind, and that is what happens when those animals break out in some infectious disease which happens to have been brought in from outside? I have in mind a particular breed of pedigreed sheep. I should like to mention as an example the Hampshire Down fat lamb sheep. We know that many of those sheep were brought in not recently, but many years ago, from Hampshire, a county in the United Kingdom. Farmers bred pedigreed stock for fatlamb production, but now discover through our veterinary surgeons that these sheep have in fact been carrying a disease imported with the stock, a disease which we in this country call &#x201C;scrapies&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister may possibly know about it. My question is: Does the Department reimburse these farmers who had to destroy their flocks and have suffered severe losses? Does the Department only reimburse on a percentage basis, or is the whole flock reimbursed according to the valuation of that flock made by a veterinary surgeon? This is something which is worrying many of us and I would be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister could give us an answer in regard to this problem. I have been through the Act and I do not see a solution, nor do I see anything relating to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the quarantine stations. Many years ago, Sir, we had a quarantine station serving the North-Eastern Cape area in East London. It was during the Second World War that that station was done away with for various reasons.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to clause 18, which deals with quarantine stations. To-day we only have two quarantine stations serving the whole country, namely in Cape Town and Durban. There is no station between Cape Town and Durban.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>I just wanted to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he did not think it was time that we had a quarantine station in East London to serve the Native territories, the Transkei, the Ciskei, in fact the whole of the Eastern Cape and the Border areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is true that the clearing agent provides feed, but sometimes one finds that the clearing agent provided no feed and then the Department has to feed the animals. We are making provision for that now. In the second place, the hon. member wanted to know what the position was in the case of stock which <span class="col_367-368" refersTo="page_0201"/>entered the country without a clearance certificate issued by the country of origin, stock which are subject to a veterinary certificate. Stock falling in that group usually enter the country illegally. For that reason they will have to remain in the quarantine station for a longer period and until such time as we are sure that they may indeed be cleared under a veterinary certificate. The importer will have to pay for that longer period of detention as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of the words &#x201C;verwyder&#x201D; and &#x201C;move&#x201D;. If he will read the English text, he will see that the word &#x201C;move&#x201D; refers to animals being removed from the quarantine station. If, however, he fears that the wrong word was used in this case, I shall have the matter investigated.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Verwyder&#x201D; is also correct. Another hon. member said that the penalties were too severe. I repeat: This legislation is one of the most important pieces of legislation for protecting the livestock of South Africa against, for example, &#x201C;scrapies&#x201D;. For that reason the penalties can hardly be too heavy, because the penalties are there for the protection of the entire stock-farming industry in South Africa. Secondly, the hon. member asked whether the Department would compensate people whose stock had to be destroyed as a result of diseases which had broken out, including stock which became ill after they had already been released from detention. This is not a law relating to production. It is a stock protection law. People who import stock suffering from these diseases do not do so at the recommendation or at the request of the <b>Department.</b> They do so entirely on their own responsibility. For that reason this Government cannot compensate people in respect of animals which may possibly be infected with diseases. We simply cannot do that. As regards diseases which break out afterwards, for example &#x201C;scrapies&#x201D;, the disease the hon. member has mentioned, this is the very reason why we are so strict and why we also require the health certificate issued by the other country. The other question asked by the hon. member is not relevant here. He may put the question during the Budget debate.</p>
