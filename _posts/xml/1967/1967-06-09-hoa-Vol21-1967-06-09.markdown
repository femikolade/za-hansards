<heading>DEFENCE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 12:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This is the clause which provides for the continuous and non-continuous service which must be done by members of the Citizen Force. As we pointed out during the Second Reading debate, we are agreed on the extension of the overall commitment to a spread of ten years. We accept that position in so far as other ranks are concerned, who will continue to do a maximum actual period in camp of not more than 12 months spread over that period. However, we feel that the commitment which is imposed upon potential leaders of a camp every year for nine out of the ten years of their commitment is placing an unnecessarily heavy burden upon those who are selected as leaders. We accept the need for them to do more training than would be required of other ranks. We accept the need for a greater commitment, and to that extent we have no objection to the extra month which is proposed during their first year. We also recognize that in the subsequent periods there should be additional training for officers and N.C.O.&#x2019;s over and above what they will do when they are called up for their normal 26 days&#x2019; camp. But we feel that to ask them to attend a camp for nine out of ten years means that they will have no opportunity during the first ten years of their lives after school to enjoy a normal holiday and to take their families away if they are married unless they are prepared to take unpaid leave from their firms. Therefore, although we recognize the need for making additional demands on them, we propose to limit this demand to two years out of every three. I therefore move the amendment standing in my name on page 587 of the Order Paper, which gives effect to this proposal. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 21, to omit &#x201C;nine&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;seven&#x201D;; in line 24, to omit &#x201C;five&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;three&#x201D;; and in line 27, to omit &#x201C;sixteen&#x201D; and substitute &#x201C;fifteen&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It in fact takes the Minister&#x2019;s period of 15 months for officers, which he outlined in the original second reading debate and places that in the legislation. The Select Committee placed a limit of 16 months in the proviso to subsection (3). The Minister stated in his introductory speech that the intention was that officers and N.C.O.s should in fact do 15 months. We accept that statement by the Minister. We accept that that was and is the intention, namely to have an overall limit of 15 months, and therefore we move to put it in the legislation so that we do not have the Minister saying 15 months and the law saying 16 months. In this case we therefore move to delete &#x201C;sixteen&#x201D; and to insert &#x201C;fifteen&#x201D;. In regard to the non-continuous period of training, our amendment deletes two of the five 12-day periods to which officers and N.C.O s will be subject, meaning that they will then do seven camps in the ten years of their commitment. I do not want to argue it any further at this stage in case the Minister has reconsidered the matter and is prepared to accept this amendment, which still gives additional training to officers and still keeps them on the 10-year commitment, but which enables them in one year out of three to know that they will be completely free of any camp commitment in that year. I shall be interested to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to my amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. J. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that if one calculates the total period laid down in this clause during which an officer or a non-commissioned officer has to receive training, one finds that over a period of ten years it amounts to 16 months and 18 days. The officers who appeared before us on the Select Committee made it quite clear to us that they regarded this period as the minimum, or at least that the period of 15 months <span class="col_7489-7490" refersTo="page_1006"/>mentioned by the Minister in his speech was regarded as the minimum period they needed to train an officer who might be in charge of a regiment if trouble broke out; in other words, we need at least 15 months to train an officer before he reaches the stage where he is ready to take the field. Members of the Opposition have now asked that we should limit this period to 15 months. The only objection we have to that is that the Defence Force is given no latitude in case they want to train certain officers for a slightly longer period and want them to receive a little more specialized training. We were prepared to give way as regards the question of one month, in other words, to say that we give way as regards the question of 18 days and to fix it at 16 months in order to allow that latitude of one month. But I think it is unreasonable of the hon. members to deprive the Defence Force of this latitude of one month for which provision is being made in the Bill in case one would like to train an officer for a slightly longer period. I think it is wrong to argue about a matter of one month and 18 days which may possibly be used. I think we are splitting hairs while we are considering a very important matter here. For that reason I feel that we should stick to the apeal that is being made, namely that we should grant the Defence Force this latitude. We cannot really achieve anything by removing it from the Bill. I just want to say, too, that it does not mean that the full periods which are mentioned here will be used. We have been told that in certain years people will be allowed not to be called up, but this is the maximum which is laid down in the law and I am of the opinion that we should stick to that maximum.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We have not suggested that this is not a maximum period which will be available to be utilized by the Supreme Command if it thinks it desirable to do so, but while the clause stands as it is now there is no certainty that at any time during the ten years of service a man will have one year free from continuous camps. But I want to ask the Minister to deal with this from another approach. Is it realistic at the moment to legislate for these camps which are for every man who is on service in the armed forces, and not only officers, because this clause applies to the whole force&#x003F; Let us assume that the annual intake is 9,000 new men in the Citizen Force alone. If we pass this legislation as it is, after ten years there will be 81,000 men who must be in camp each year and for whom facilities must be provided, in addition to the 9,000 intake who will do the full nine months or ten months during that particular year. That will be the effect of this legislation in ten years&#x2019; time. I do not think that is what is envisaged.</p>

<p>I believe that one of the reasons for the reluctance of men to serve and to continue serving and to accept responsibilities in the Citizen Force on a purely voluntary basis is that this threat is over them, and will be in future even more so than it is at the present moment, the threat that they will not have one year free, in which there will not be a continuous camp. Therefore I ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to this request&#x2014;which is a very modest one&#x2014;of the hon. member for Durban (Point). It is to allow the man to know that one year out of every three he will be free to make his own domestic arrangements about his leave and his vacation and what he is going to do in that particular year when he is free. I do not think it is an excessive request and I do hope the Minister will see his way clear to accepting this amendment for the sake of a build-up of a better morale amongst and better support from those men to whom we are looking to serve in the Citizen Force.</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. the Minister will give favourable consideration to this request of ours. All of us have to admit that the officer and the non-commissioned officer who are leaders in the Defence Force should receive additional training. But in terms of this legislation our men will be committed for ten years. It is very important that the officers and the other leaders who have to serve the extra time accept it in good spirit. They should be keen to serve for this extra period. They should not want to do everything they can to evade their obligations. If our amendment is accepted it will mean&#x2014;as has already been shown&#x2014;that the persons concerned will be free one out of every three years. They may then attend to their own affairs. In the first year the men will be called up for one year. In the second year they will be free. In the third year they will have to go to camp for 12 days. In the fourth year they will have to go to camp for 26 days. The following year they will be free again, and so it will go on. That is the effect the amendment will have. Whereas in terms of our proposal they will be free every third year and will not have to go to camp in that year, they will be free for only one year out of ten in terms of this legislation. We should bear in mind that particularly during the last few years of this ten-year period many of the men who receive training will be men with families. They will have childeren. They will also have other obligations to meet.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria West said that the first period of training would last 12 months. In practice, however, it will never be 12 months. It simply is the position that from about the 15th of December and during the first week or ten days in January not much is done as far as training is concerned. That means, therefore, that we can only rely on approximately 11 months&#x2019; training during the first year. We know it is the object of this legislation to provide only ten months&#x2019; training during the first year to the class of person we are discussing now. I would prefer us to make more use of this first period of 12 months if more time for training is needed. Let us then rather call up the men for 11 or for a maximum of 11&#x00BD; months&#x2019; training, instead of for <span class="col_7491-7492" refersTo="page_1007"/>ten months. Whether a person is trained for ten or 11 months, he has lost a year in any case. I ask the hon. the Minister to view the matter in this light. I would be the last person to deny that more training is necessary. Let us therefore provide more training in the first year. After all, the person is committed to his training for the full year. Then he may be given the opportunity to be free every third year.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.Chairman, the original Bill in effect provided for a period of 16 months and 18 days. That was not laid down specifically, but that was the effect of the measure. After the Select Committee had considered the matter, they felt that a maximum period should be laid down, and that is why this Bill now provides for 16 months. The hon. member says he regards this period as unfair. I want to appeal to the hon. member not to use terms which are too strong in this connection. The whole spirit of this Bill is one of flexibility.</p>

<p>Although I may not refer to evidence which was submitted to the Select Committee and which has not been published, I want to state that the fact that the Chief of the Army appeared before the Committee was reported. I accept for myself that he informed the Committee of his problems. The Chief of the Army has certain practical difficulties, which I now want to mention for the sake of the record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is what I am going to do now, Mr. Chairman. I accept, however, that what he has told me he would also tell to other people particularly when he was examined by the Select Committee. For the sake of the record I now want to put the matter very clearly, because I do not want any confusion about it to exist in the country. I do not think we should by our attitude create the impression that we are acting in an unfair manner.</p>

<p>Now, what are the facts&#x003F; The facts are that every person will serve for one period of 26 days in every cycle of three years. In practice that means that the total number of available men must be divided by three. Only when we have built up an overall strength of 100,000 men&#x2014;something which can only be done gradually, as hon. members probably accept&#x2014; shall we call up approximately 33,000 men every year, which is more or less the number of men we now call up every year for training. This is the first significant fact; every person will serve for one period of 26 days in every cycle of three years. I now want to state very clearly why we cannot do away with the five compulsory periods of service of 12 days each during the nine years following upon the long period of continuous service in the first year. I want to mention this for the sake of the record so that we shall be absolutely clear as to what the attitude of the Defence Force is. During the first ten months of service all that the Army can do is to train a useful but still inexperienced young assistant field-cornet. During the next nine years he has to be trained further so as to be able to serve as a captain or a major in the Citizen Force at the end of the period of ten years for which he is liable to serve. After that, as at present, we shall have to continue to rely on voluntary extended service in the Citizen Force in order to train commanders and other relatively senior officers of our Citizen Force. If we bear in mind that in every period of 12 days there will be at least one weekend and that time will be lost in admitting and discharging the men, we realize that only eight effective days will be left for training purposes. The intention is that part of the training should be done by means of correspondence courses, for the very reason that this period of training is so short. For that purpose special departments dealing with correspondence courses have already been established at Army Headquarters. It forms part of the process that in theory the person is already being trained by means of correspondence courses. The hon. member for North Rand will know of the department which is already being established. During the first period of 12 days the young leader&#x2019;s theoretical knowledge will be increased. During the next 12 days he will be afforded the opportunity of applying his theoretical knowledge further in practice by handling full-time or Permanent Force units. In the third year the junior officer and officer should be able to command their own units with greater self-confidence and competency during the period of 26 days he will attend the camp, and ought to be ready for promotion to higher rank. During the second cycle of three years the process has to be repeated for training to higher ranks, so that officers may, for example, during the second period of 26 days in which they will attend a training camp, be prepared for promotion to the rank of captain. The same process repeats itself during the last cycle of three years, with the result that some officers may be promoted to at least the rank of major at the end of that period, that is to say, after ten years&#x2019; service in the Citizen Force.</p>

<p>If these requirements are taken into account, it is clear that a reduction in the short periods of 12 days will create practical problems as far as the training programme is concerned, problems which can be overcome only by relying on voluntary service. In practice this has proved to be impossible. This is the attitude adopted by the Chiefs of the Army and with which the Supreme Command agrees. I think we should allow ourselves to be guided by these people, who have to deal with the practical problems&#x2014;in any case, it would be preposterous for us to take it upon ourselves to regulate these practical matters on the basis of a discussion lasting only a few minutes when this Bill has already been examined by <span class="col_7493-7494" refersTo="page_1008"/>a Select Committee. If we were to do so I do not think we would be acting in a responsible manner. The obligation is being imposed on the corps of leaders in order to prevent employers from compelling Citizen Force leaders to use their vacation leave for the purposes of military service. If a Citizen Force leader should in future prefer to use his vacation leave for that purpose he would be doing so out of his own free will. In view of the particularly short periods of training during the years in between those years during which the men will have to attend training camps for longer periods, it cannot be seriously alleged that these commitments will cause severe hardship. Moreover, non-commissioned officers and officers receive better remuneration than privates, although, as I said yesterday, serious consideration is being given to the possibility of granting increases in pay on the basis of the number of years of service. That is an undertaking I have given the hon. member.</p>

<p>In view of this exposition, which really represents the attitude of the Chiefs of our Defence Force, together with the undertaking we are now laying down in the Act, namely that it will not be more than 16 months, I think we should allow the Army to have that latitude. We shall try to apply it as equitably as possible. For us to place a restriction on it at this stage without our being able to foresee precisely what results it would have, would be rather irresponsible of us. For that reason I regret that I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, however much I should like to meet him. I therefore want to leave it at what I feel we should first test in practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The arguments of the hon. the Minister in favour of the provision as it stands are arguments which I can understand should apply to junior officers. The problem of getting sufficient officers voluntarily for the Citizen Force is one which we recognize&#x2014;in other words, I can see the difficulties here. But once an officer has reached the rank of captain, there should be no shortage thereafter of people willing to serve of their own free will in higher ranks. We need have only one major for a larger number of junior officers and, furthermore, we need not have the same number of majors, captains, lieutenants, and second-lieutenants&#x2014;it is a pyramid, i.e. building up to the top. This means that as the rank goes up the number of incumbents decreases. The period of training of 12 days during the first cycle will bring officers up to the rank of first-lieutenant. Then there will be a camp for bringing them up to the rank of captain. But by then you would need less captains because you have already got your lieutenants trained as potential captains. Surely, from there onwards we can rely on volunteers&#x003F;</p>

<p>When we argue over the period of 15 or 16 months it is academic. We have taken the figure of 15 months because the Minister used it. He said that was what was wanted and what would be done. So we accepted that figure. The real argument, however, is whether we should have three or five years of 12-day camps. The Minister&#x2019;s arguments are strong in so far as the earlier periods are concerned. But I fail to see why every lieutenant, or field-cornet, has to be trained for 10 years for the rank of major. Surely, by the time we have established our officers corps and have created the right spirit and the right atmosphere, we are going to have more than enough competition for the higher ranks&#x003F; We are not trying to sabotage the intention of this legislation&#x2014;we are merely trying to ensure that when we make demands upon our youth&#x2014;which we do without any hesitation&#x2014;we should try to limit those demands to the essential minimum. Here, of course, it is a question of a difference of opinion between what the Army regards as being essential and what we of the Opposition regard as essential. The Army is setting a higher target than what we regard as being absolutely essential. I don&#x2019;t blame them for it&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I would do exactly the same if I were chief of the Army: I would go for the best which in my judgment was necessary.</p>

<p>Because we in Parliament are not concerned solely with the ideal&#x2014;we are also concerned with what is right and what is best. So, it is our view that sufficient training can be given in the period proposed by us. Furthermore, it will not detract in any way from the effectiveness of the legislation or from the efficiency of the Army&#x2014;we are simply trying to limit something which now goes a fraction too far. It is, therefore, purely a question of degree and not of principle. The principle we accept. It is the degree on which we differ. Our proposal amounts to giving two more free years&#x2014;the equivalent of one in every cycle. Alternately, let a man do all his 12-days camps in the early period of his training so that if in the latter part of 10 years he has a wife and family to look after he can have two clear years in between his last two months&#x2019; camps. It is, therefore, not a difference of principle. We are, in other words, not totally opposed to what is being proposed now&#x2014;we only feel that it is not entirely essential. Seeing that we are calling up many of our youth we want to try to limit the demand wherever we feel it is possible to do so without harm to the Army.</p>

<p>Whilst on my feet, I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to another provision, a provision on which we should like to hear his views. Subsection (10) lays down that no service for a shorter period than the liable period shall be recognized unless with the approval of the Minister. And there are similar provisions in later clauses right through the Act. I will rather deal with it here under one head. Where a person has done service and towards the end of his service period, on compassionate grounds or for medical <span class="col_7495-7496" refersTo="page_1009"/>reasons or for any other reason, he then gets deferment or leave for that period, I should like an assurance from the hon. the Minister that where most of the service has been done or a reasonable proportion of it, that it will in fact be recognized. Your service is compartmentalized, in other words your basic training, your unit training, and so forth. Where a person has completed a cycle I feel that he should be entitled to recognition for it.</p>

But rather than frighten people off by putting in front of them a picture of a greater commitment than in fact is going to be asked for, I will rather give them what is actually going to be asked for.

<p>The hon. member is persisting in the attitude he adopted, even now that the hon. the Minister has given his reply. I want to point out that we have to use very complicated weapons in modern warfare. In other countries the periods used for training are much longer than those we propose here in South Africa. We know that in Britain voluntary service was abolished completely. To-day Britain relies solely on a full-time army because it is said that it is no longer possible for volunteers to be trained well enough for the specialized warfare of today. In view of the fact that a large proportion of our youth is going to serve in our Defence Force&#x2014;100,000 men&#x2014;we cannot afford to entrust them to the care of officers who have not had a thorough training. Seeing that the Defence Force now says that this is the minimum period it needs and that it wants this latitude in case it becomes necessary, I cannot see why the hon. member persists in this attitude. I think we owe it to the people to appreciate and to uphold this attitude adopted by the Defence Force. We would not want to send scores of our young men to go and fight while our officers are not well trained. For that reason I want to make an appeal that we should accept this clause as it stands.</p>

On behalf of this side of the House I may say that he inspires great confidence. We therefore do not want to tell him at this stage how he should carry out his duties.

<p>Just a minute, Mr. Chairman. There is one other matter that was raised by the hon. the Minister and to which I should like to draw his attention once more. The hon. the Minister explained that as far as the 12-day period was concerned it was the intention to afford the officers and other ranks the opportunity to prepare themselves for the next camp. The Minister mentioned an important point there, namely that during that period of 12 days quite a few days are virtually wasted with the men arriving and departing. It is a very short period. The hon. the Minister indicated clearly that he was not going to accept our amendment. Now I just want to ask him to submit the following point to his Defence Force Chiefs, and that is to see whether it would not be better for the men to go to camp for three periods of 20 days, instead of for five periods of 12 days. Then they would in any case have them for a course&#x2014;a longer period&#x2014;a year before the camp is due. However, the period will remain 60 days. I hope the hon. the Minister and his Department will give the necessary attention to this matter and that he will perhaps accept this suggestion in the Other Place.</p>

<p>I referred to selection boards during the Second Reading debate. I will just say briefly what my objection is to the clause as stated here. I think it is not sufficiently precise to say &#x201C;&#x2026; not more than four other members&#x201D;. That is not sufficient. Here we are dealing with selection boards and they are subject to the criticism of public opinion. These members are representatives of the public generally. I think a clause of this kind should indicate the bodies of citizens from whom these members will be chosen, or better still, by whom they will be nominated. The following are the bodies I have in mind, namely the South African Legion&#x2014;I am not <span class="col_7497-7498" refersTo="page_1010"/>giving a complete list, and there are many more that can be added&#x2014;and city councilors. Here I am speaking on behalf of my own area, the Witwatersrand. Then there are trade unions, teachers&#x2019; associations and I am sure that hon. members could add another dozen. I think a clause of this kind should be added.</p>

<p>I personally do not like the proposed section 67 (3). We in South Africa are privileged to belong to any church we like, we can follow any denomination we like. In this clause, however, certain persons who belong to certain religious denominations are exempted from military service. Supposing we all join these churches, who is going to do the fighting&#x003F; Are we all going to sit back peeling potatoes and cleaning camps&#x003F;</p>

<p>To serve our country when we are at war should not only be regarded as a duty but as a privilege, and I cannot for the life of me see why anybody should have the moral right, for any reason whatsoever, whether it be political or religious, to say, &#x201C;I am not prepared to serve&#x201D;. Why should my son be obliged to go forward and face the enemy when other young men stay at home&#x003F; I do not believe that this is necessary and although, being a good democrat. I will not vote against it, I want it to go on record that I do not agree with it. Sir, I hope that we will not be involved in the near future in a war, but if a war breaks out and the Minister cannot use me for anything more useful I hope he will put me in charge of these boys. Sir, I will keep them busy; they will do good work and they will like it, and waging war will be like a Sunday school picnic in comparison with what they will have to do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington referred once again to the question of the constitution of the selection boards. We cannot lay down in the Act that certain group interests should be represented, because circumstances differ from one place to another.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Pofadder is a small village which probably lacks many of the group interests referred to by the hon. member, and for that reason one has to be guided by the circumstances of the specific place in appointing the selection boards. There is the question of distance and area and all the factors which have to be taken into consideration. There is also the question of the availability of people to serve on the selection boards. For that reason I think it will be very risky to lay down here which group interests shall be represented and to bind ourselves by doing so. I think we should rather make the provision flexible. We shall give thorough consideration to the constitution of the selection boards, because a great deal is going to depend on the selection boards. I feel very strongly about that. Right at this stage I want to say that I hope the selection boards will not allow themselves to be misused by people who want to evade their obligations. The Defence Force knows that I feel very strongly about that. The selection boards will have to be very strong. They will have to consist of people who perform their duty with the utmost diligence, but the constitution will differ from one place to another.</p>

<p>I can see the difficulty under clause 40. It is not only the young man himself; it is his home environment, his parents and their outlook on life. Naturally a young man has to have that in mind. I have known cases where the young man himself would like to serve but in deference to the wishes of his parents he is not prepared to do so. The suggestion I made in the Second Reading debate would cover these cases. Everybody would be subject to the basic 12 months&#x2019; training before being put into special courses. If you have a man of this kind he would serve in another capacity in civilian life in the interests of the country. That was my suggestion but I will not pursue it. This difficulty will always remain as long as you have compulsory service.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Sir, this clause is before the House at the moment.

I respectfully submit that we have before us a clause for discussion and that we are being asked to approve of this clause as amended.

<p>Clause 48:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This clause makes provision for any person to participate voluntarily in the activities of the commandos. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that now that the commandos are being turned into proper units and they will have officers appointed and not elected and that they will be part of our Defence Force in the true sense, this idea of associate membership should be done away with and instead there should be established, under the aegis of the Department of Defence, shooting clubs which will perform the function of providing an opportunity for people to learn and to practice shooting. Into this organization could be brought existing shooting clubs, which are purely private clubs at the moment, so that they could have the benefit of purchasing ammunition and becoming conversant with the use of weapons. Those people will all be of use to South Africa in an emergency because they will know how to use weapons. To those clubs could belong those who to-day use the commandos simply as a shooting club without being part of it in the military sense. They could form a very valuable link in the Civil Defence organization for which the Minister is also responsible, whereas a person who participates as a voluntary member, almost as a spare wheel to the commandos, not only undermines the concept of the commandos as a real military unit, but he sets a bad example to those who are forced by law to participate fully in the activities. They see one person enjoying the privileges without the unpleasant side of it, without the compulsory side of it. They ask why he should have these benefits when they have to go to camps and do guard duty. If you took the voluntary shooting aspect <span class="col_7501-7502" refersTo="page_1012"/>away completely and assisted the shooting organizations under the Civil Defence legislation, that would make this clause unnecessary. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that it would be in the interests of those who like shooting and who are useful to the country and it would also be an improvement to the commando system as such.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to comment briefly on this clause, and what I have to say ties up with what was said by the previous speaker, although we may perhaps see the matter slightly differently. In any event, we have the interests of the same people in mind. With regard to what the hon. member said, there is this problem. To establish these independent shooting clubs, means that those people must have ranges, and to build ranges costs a great deal of money. What the Minister and the Supreme Command have in mind here is to afford an opportunity to these people who are still interested in shooting, and I think people who have completed their service, and people who would like to render service but are unable to do so, such as M.P.&#x2019;s and Senators, to continue practicing shooting. But the advantage is that this division is still under the control of the Defence Force, under the control of the commandants of such a commando, and it also enables these people to use those Defence Force rifle ranges, because all the rifle ranges of the commandos come under the Defence Force. Now a Defence Force range is used under the supervision of Defence Force men, but private shooting clubs may not practice shooting on Defence Force ranges, and in such a case there would be no supervision. What also ties up with this is that the South African National Target Shooting Association is also a statutory body which comes under the Defence Force, and I would prefer it if the hon. the Minister could consider extending this clause in order that wider powers may be given to the South African National Target Shooting Association. I should like to support this clause very strongly. Through this clause an opportunity is afforded to every man in the country who wishes to practice the art of shooting.</p>

<p>But I should like to go even further, and I want to make this suggestion to the Minister and to the Supreme Command. Should it not be considered that every member who is subject to commando service &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>As regards the attitude of the hon. member for Durban (Point). I want to say that this is a clause on which I have very strong feelings, and I myself was at pains to have it inserted like this. I have many sentimental reasons for doing so. I think we should take care. There are some of our older people who can no longer serve as commando members under the present system and who can no longer be active in the ordinary sense of the word, as members of the Defence Force under the ordinary provisions of the Act. But we shall have a rebellion among those older people if we simply push them aside. I know of many such cases. To establish a separate organization would simply mean that one would take the extra responsibility on oneself to have them organized. But in the second place, for many good and also sentimental reasons one wishes to allow those people to participate in something in which they still want to take a part, namely in handling rifles and shooting. Then I think we should at least see to it that this same discipline which applies to the commando on the rifle range should be applied to those people, otherwise one would have chaos. And it must be the same people who enforce that discipline. That is why I thought this would be the best way of doing it.</p>

<p>Clause 57:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to waste time repeating arguments we have had in the Second Reading. I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 45, after &#x201C;or&#x201D;, where it occurs for the first time, to insert &#x201C;in regard to national security&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I only want to add, that the hon. the Minister in his reply to the Second Reading debate gave as his reason for this clause the need to protect the security of South Africa. We accept that and that is why we have worded our amendment quite differently from the one which was moved in the Select Committee. This now means that all that it will be necessary to show to prove the commission of an offence is that the report in fact created a danger to our national security. It will not be necessary to go into details or to disclose secret information. But we cannot accept a blanket provision which we believe would create suspicion and seal off our Defence Force from the people of South Africa. We do not believe that the amendment we have proposed in any way takes away from the requirements which the hon. the Minister has <span class="col_7503-7504" refersTo="page_1013"/>outlined. It gives him the power he wants, but it does not prevent legitimate and normal reports. These may be detrimental and may refer to matters which are not always pleasant but it is in the interests of South Africa that the public should know about them. That is preferable to rumours growing and spreading, and becoming distorted as they spread.</p>

<p>I should like to give an example which the Minister and his staff will remember. A year or two ago Durban was seething with rumours. It was said that deaths were occuring by the dozen; first ten and then 20 men were supposed to have died in a military camp. I took the matter up immediately. The reports were naturally denied and the Press were able to publish the facts and the denials. An investigation was held and it was found that there had indeed been a foundation of fact on which many of the rumours had grown. But it was the disclosure in the Press which enabled that spate of rumours&#x2014;almost of panic &#x2014;amongst parents to be destroyed. Had this measure been in force then those rumours could not have been disproved because all that the public would have received would have been an official hand-out which they, frankly, would not have believed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Why not&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Because the official handout given in this case I refer to was a denial that any of these things were true. Only after a full investigation was it found that in fact some of the allegations were true. People do not accept hand-outs. We must have a degree of freedom in the Press which gives the public confidence. The same position obtains in our information services. We just do not get official statements across to other countries. In the same way official statements do not put people&#x2019;s minds at rest. There must be free discussion. The public must have the right to go to the Press to put their complaints and to put their point of view. We accept&#x2014;and that is why we on this side have moved the amendment as we have&#x2014;that they should not be able to say things which will harm the security of South Africa. But where security is not involved, where it is a grouse or a grumble, something which is of no importance to our security, the public should have access to the Press&#x2014;the right to put their complaints and to have them aired publicly in the Press. If a mother is worried about her dear little boy who is not getting the right food in the camp, let her write a letter to the Press and say that &#x201C;My poor little boy is not getting the sort of food that he is used to at home&#x201D;, or &#x201C;he is not getting put to bed by his mother and his pillow straightened for him&#x201D;. Let them complain and they will soon be ridiculed by other people who will then put the facts as they are. I do not see why we should close our Press to the person who wants to make use of. for instance, the correspondence columns of a newspaper to express a complaint.</p>

<p>We on this side feel that provided security is protected we should leave the door open to other reports which do not affect security. I want to say to the Minister that in all the discussions that have taken place on this clause three instances only have been named as examples of why this clause is necessary. Those three instances were quoted by different people in different circumstances. But it is always the three instances only. The one case concerned a false statement about a ballotee, then there was a false report about troop movements, and the third instance had something to do with South-West Africa.</p>

<p>If that is all that has happened in all the years that we have been living in crisis-times, if that is all the harm that has been done to South Africa by this sort of report then are we not taking a sledge-hammer to kill a nit or a gnat&#x003F; We are putting on our Statute Book powers which I believe go far too far, and therefore I move the amendment standing in my name.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as one who was a practicing journalist for many years and who frequently had to write on military matters, I want to admit right at the outset that this is a far-reaching prohibition. We admit on this side that it is a drastic measure. But now the hon. member for Durban (Point) should have regard to the particularly unique circumstances of South Africa. I want to say at once that I am glad that the hon. member has shifted his ground somewhat since yesterday. He now admits that it is necessary; that the net should be spread very widely as regards the prohibition on information which can be published and which is harmful to the country.</p>

<p>Our position is quite different from that of overseas countries, for example America and Britain. The hon. member mentioned the example of America specifically. America is a large country, of course, and it is understandable that a leak of military information could occur much more easily in that country than in South Africa. In addition the rights of the Press are also safe-guarded by their constitution, as the hon. member knows. Circumstances in America are therefore quite different from those in South Africa.</p>

<p>As far as we are concerned, I feel that to place a far-reaching measure on the Statute Book is better than to deliver ourselves knowingly to our enemies, in our difficult and vulnerable circumstances. For example, we simply cannot allow the same to happen to us that happened to Israel and Egypt during the past few days. We saw how the front pages of newspapers set out very prominently exactly what the strength of the defence forces of the various countries was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>You do not really think our enemies do not know what our strength is&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from><span class="col_7505-7506" refersTo="page_1014"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but why should we spread it about by enabling the Press to broadcast this information in the finest detail&#x003F; I simply cannot see why we should allow anything of the kind. The hon. member should also bear in mind that our methods of warfare have undergone drastic changes in the past few years. Thus military information can now leak out much more easily through indirect channels, for example by deduction, than previously. Our Defence Force people must now be much more mobile. They now move over much larger terrain than in the past, when only conventional combat methods were applied.</p>

<p>I now want to give a hypothetical example. Say, for example, an American soldier is involved in a motor-car accident near Peking. The question may then be asked why he was near Peking. Was he there on a secret mission&#x003F; What was he doing there&#x003F; If that is true of America, surely it is also true of South Africa&#x003F; All kinds of deductions may be made from a simple report in the newspaper. Nowadays there are spies everywhere, and they are wide-awake. In a small country like the Republic, which is very vulnerable, we have to see to it that as many loopholes and leaks as possible are closed up.</p>

<p>On top of this there is also the fact that the Communists and the Pan-Africanist Nationalists have taken an oath to destroy South Africa. I therefore feel that we simply cannot afford any leaks.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Kroonstad pointed out very clearly yesterday, it is stated quite clearly in this legislation that no prosecution can be instituted except on the written authority of the Attorney-General. I therefore fail to see why the hon. member for Durban (Point) should be worried that trivial matters will be taken up. During his Second Reading Speech and again yesterday the Minister said repeatedly that he would appoint a Press liaison officer. It is my hope that he will be a trained journalist and a person who also knows the politics of the country, so that he may always contact the Press as quickly and efficiently as possible, and without delay. Dissatisfaction may possibly arise in this regard if the newspapers of South Africa request permission from the Defence Force to write an article on the Defence Force and a month or even longer passed before they achieved finality. I therefore want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to enable the Press liaison officer to act quickly, if it is at all possible.</p>

<p>In the last place the hon. the Minister stated very clearly that a list of topics would be drawn up. Because the Minister told us that this Act would be applied in a flexible way, I am convinced that from time to time he will make additions to the original list which is now to be issued to newspapers with regard to cases which are brought to his attention and where the national security is not jeopardized. And I think it is in this spirit that we should accept the section, and I think it is also in this spirit that the newspaper owners did not object to this section, in public in any event, through their official organ, the Press Union, but explained the implications of the section to all the different members of their organization, the different newspapers, by way of a circular. As far as I know, it was generally accepted. I therefore hope that the Minister will not make a concession in this regard and that we will keep the section as it stands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to support the arguments of the hon. member for Durban (Point) in this matter. I think hon. members must appreciate that we have in this clause agreed to an immense extension of the blanket of secrecy. Previously the only secrecy was in time of war. Now at one fell swoop we as a House, and we are unanimous about this, have agreed to preserve the selfsame secrecy in time of peace as in war. I think once one has said that, one must immediately realize that one should scrutinize whether in time of peace in fact it is necessary to have quite so much secrecy as in time of war. The limited qualification which is being suggested by the hon. member for Durban (Point) is, I suggest, the very least we should do to preserve our balance in this situation. I go so far as to say that l believe the advantage of a measure, certainly the measure pleaded for by the hon. member for Durban (Point), far outweighs any disadvantage that could befall our forces as a result of any publicity. It must be remembered that limited publicity enables the forces themselves to realize where there is perhaps error or neglect or criticism, and it enables them swiftly to counteract that. If one is operating in a complete vacuum of secrecy, matters can develop which can go far further than is healthy. And I do not believe that they come to the attention of the authorities so well. People are, it is true, prepared to go to their public representatives occasionally, but in general that is considered a fairly drastic sten. They are much more inclined perhaps to write a letter to the Press, or something of that kind. If there is this limited publicity, as I say, it enables the services themselves to remedy these matters before they go too far. You will never be able to eliminate rumour completely and if rumour actually comes forward and gets to the distance of being in the Press, that then can be nailed. If it is not brought into the open in that way, it can continue and do far more harm. Take this one example given of this ballotee in South-West Africa. The report in connection with this ballotee was apparently quite false, and the fact that it could be denied and shown to be false went, I would say further to restoring confidence than any harm that was done originally. If people have the feeling that the activities of the forces are behind this wall, I believe that we can lose a great deal. The hon. the Minister said that he would release certain topics that could be discussed <i>ad lib.</i> But surely in time of peace that is going very very far. It serves to cut the people off from the forces, <span class="col_7507-7508" refersTo="page_1015"/>it serves to create in people&#x2019;s minds the suspicion that something may be going on about which they know nothing, and that all may not in fact be well. And so, Mr. Speaker, I do hope that even if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept this particular amendment, although I do hope he will accept it, he will search hard for an appropriate loosening of this secrecy in order to preserve the benefits of discussion. I want to stress that in many countries, indeed in this country too, we strongly believe that the light that can be thrown on matters through the Press and the other ways mentioned, has inestimable benefits. And I want to stress that if we pass this clause without any qualification, this will place one Government department virtually, one section of our executive arm, in a position completely different from all the other sections of the administration. We have the Police in respect of whom nothing, anything like so extensive operates, and yet they are in fact carrying out very extensive operations in South-West Africa, most need fully. I do believe that this goes very much further in time of peace than is required, and I do hope that we can have still the fresh air of publicity on these matters of relative importance, always subject to the overriding security which we fully accept.</p>

But he was engaged that afternoon and could not come. Then I called another hon. member who had also served on the Select Committee. I gave the hon. member examples. I have therefore gone out of my way. Would hon. members now force me to illustrate this kind of situation by examples, here in public&#x003F;</p>

<p>It affects it directly. I have gone out of my way with this Bill, and I have taken hon. members into my confidence. But hon. members are now making it difficult for me. Because the impression is being created that I want to be a small dictator over the Press, which I do not want to be. I have said this repeatedly. I appreciate the tremendous responsibility I am accenting. I appreciate that it is a drastic measure. For that reason I have given one undertaking after another that we will meet the Press as far as possible. We will create machinery through which we can feed the Press. We do not want to exclude the Press from our activities. But for the sake of the security of the country there must be control over reports. Now the hon. member says that we have mentioned only three examples. But we have mentioned three examples to substantiate our case. I could continue and give the hon. member at least half a dozen other instances which occurred in the year I have been dealing with Defence. There are things which involved us in the greatest difficulties on the international level. Afterwards we had to remedy matters on the diplomatic level. These were matters which were bedevilled by Press reports.</p>

<p>No, also South African Press reports, because they were initiated here. And get this quite clear, I am not accusing the Press men. I am not holding it against them. I think it is part of their work. But naturally I cannot tell the whole story to every newspaperman who calls me at half-past eleven on Saturday night&#x2014;and they call me as late as that, and I have no objection to it&#x2014;and give him all the facts of the matter, whole delicate negotiations on the matter are perhaps in progress. And if I show the slightest hesitation, a whole sensational report is published on it, as has happened in the past. These are things which have landed us in serious difficulties. This kind of thing is not child&#x2019;s play. If the hon. member had given me an opportunity to inform him when I invited him&#x2014;I appreciate that he was engaged that afternoon, and I do not hold it against him, but I do think that he could have created a later opportunity&#x2014;and if the hon. members had accepted my invitation, namely that I would inform the hon. the Leader of the Opposition properly, this debate would not have been necessary. I regret that I am compelled to say this. But I have gone out of my way to obtain co-operation, also on this particular clause. In the light of that I hope hon. members will act wisely and not raise any dust now. Let us accept that there are no motives here other than the interests of our country. Secondly, let us accept that the spirit of co-operation with the Press will be confirmed. Thirdly, we shall not try to create absurdities in terms of this provision. The mother who wants to complain about her son&#x2019;s food will still be able to complain as much as she likes. That is not what this clause is about. But the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion is not going to meet my problems, because then the Minister would have to prove it, and for very good reasons he is sometimes unable to use those proofs. Surely that should be clear. I therefore want to make a serious appeal to the members of the Opposition now, to act in this respect in the spirit in which they have so far acted in respect of the rest of the Bill. I have not the slightest doubt that if I make this anneal to them they will still accede. I do not mind their voting against the clause. I have not the slightest objection to their voting against the clause. That is their right. But do not let us ascribe any motives and make an issue of a matter which should not be made an issue of.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to deal immediately with the statement of the hon. the Minister for the sake of the record. The hon. the Minister is fully aware that he sent a message that he would like to see me at a time when I was engaged in a debate and could not leave the Chamber. He saw another member on our side of the House and had discussions with him. I appreciate the problems which he put at the time. I do not wish to take it any further and all I want to say is that we have specifically gone out of our way to meet the Minister in regard to the problems which he has. We have specifically and deliberately so framed our amendment so that it does not in any way cut across the difficulties which we accepted were real ones. I do not wish to deal with those difficulties any more than the Minister does. We had no intention whatsoever of blocking legislation to deal with real problems. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will now give blanket permission to the Press under this clause which will enable it to disclose and deal with matters affecting individuals in their training camps and in their day to day life in the Army, without reference to him&#x2014;also matters like their treatment, their food and their conditions. Is he prepared to allow those things to be written about without reference to him. That I think is the test. That is the test of whether this clause is solely to <span class="col_7511-7512" refersTo="page_1017"/>deal with security which we accept and over which we will not argue. Is this clause basically to deal with security or is it being broadened to create a blanket to close off the Defence Force from any sort of publicity. If the hon. the Minister will give clear authority now that he will not regard as an infringement of this clause criticisms and reports which will reflect on the Army but which do not in any way deal with military activities, with security, with movements of troops&#x2014;i.e. with South Africa&#x2019;s security in any way&#x2014;that there will be no limitation on reports on normal things which have always been regarded as free to be reported, then I think we can reconsider our attitude. I repeat that we are not opposed to limitations being placed on reports on any matter affecting South Africa&#x2019;s welfare or South Africa&#x2019;s security. All we are not prepared to accept is a legal provision which would enable abuses to be hidden from the light of day. That is all that we are seeking in the amendment we have moved here.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Both the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. member for Pinelands based their arguments on three points. The first is to keep the way clear so that rumours may keep circulating; the second point is that they underlined the words &#x201C;in peace-time&#x201D;, and the third point is to throw light upon Defence Force matters. If it is attempted to clear the way for people and to help them to circulate rumours, I just want to say that it is not nearly good enough. In terms of this clause any newspaperman who hears a rumour has the right to approach the Commandant-General or the hon. the Minister and to have the rumour investigated, in order to get to the truth. Therefore that point falls away.</p>

<p>As regards the argument advanced by the hon. members of the Opposition on the question of &#x201C;peace-time&#x201D;, they forget what the hon. the Minister said yesterday, namely that in these times there is virtually no dividing line between war and peace. Where do they want to draw the line&#x003F; They do not define it. As regards their third argument, that Defence Force matters should be brought to the light of day, I should like to illustrate my reply by referring to an article which appeared in the latest <i>Sunday Times.</i> I want to ask the hon. member for Durban (Point) whether he read it. Here a fine article was written by Mr. Carol Birkby, with photographs by James Soulier, a very neat piece of journalism which cannot be improved upon. The readers as well as the members of the air force who appear in this article must have derived great pleasure from it. No matter how well-meant this article was&#x2014; and I am not criticizing the newspaperman; he was unaware of it&#x2014;it released certain basic information which in my opinion should not have been released. Mr. Chairman, during the past week we have read many newspaper reports on military operations in the north, where an enemy air force was wiped out on the ground as a result of information which was disseminated, and the good use that was made of it. That merely shows how effectively information which is obtained timeously can be used by the intelligence branch of a defence force. What does this article tell us, scattered in between the lines&#x003F; Here we are told that the helicopter squadron is called &#x201C;Squadron 17&#x201D;, that its headquarters are at Ysterplaat, outside Cape Town&#x2014;the precise location is indicated&#x2014;that its commander is Major Tatham, that the squadron has two wings, one at Bloemfontein and the other at Swartkop; that the helicopters in use are the French Alouette Ill&#x2019;s and the Alouette III&#x2019;s, designed for rescue work, patrols and anti-guerilla operations.</p>

<p>It is information needed by enemy spies, and the hon. member for Durban (Point) may laugh if he wishes. The article also mentions that the Westland Wasp is used from the decks of our Navy frigates. All this is information that spies would very much like to have, on the deployment of our very important helicopter squadron. In times when there is such a thin dividing line between peace and war, the hon. member wants this information made available, squadron for squadron and regiment for regiment, to give the enemy a complete picture of the make-up of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>The attitude of the hon. member gives me very serious doubts about the sincerity of the Opposition&#x2019;s intentions in claiming that they support this Bill. I want to ask the hon. member whether this practical co-operation and assistance which is now to be given to the Press by the authorities, as the hon. the Minister said, will not be much better than leaving these matters uncontrolled in order that all kinds of rumours may circulate. The hon. the Minister has made it very clear that the necessary channels will be established. The only practical difficulty I foresee is to find a suitable person for the post of military liaison officer. A combination of an experienced newspaperman and an authority on military matters is something rare, but since the hon. member for Durban (Point) has become so National in recent times and knows so much about the Press &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I conclude. I know that with a few exceptions the South African journalists cherish the interests of our Defence Force and of our country.

I am convinced that with the sincerity and goodwill of both parties, i.e. both the Defence Force and the Press, this apparently stringent legislation, as far as the Press is concerned, will stimulate the quality of military reporting rather than to detract from it, as the hon. member believes, particularly if the newspaper staff selects a special responsible man for their military reporting, and if the Defence Force authorities remember that the great enemy of the newspaperman is the clock&#x2014;the &#x201C;deadline&#x201D;&#x2014;and that nothing frustrates a newspaperman as much as a series of meaningless &#x201C;no comment&#x201D; replies all along the line, even to the most trivial routine inquiry.</p>

<p>That is so. The hon. member for Tuffontein, who is an experienced journalist, told us that this clause was very wide and very drastic. Well, we accept that. We should not create the impression that we want to make a secret of everything relating to our Defence Force. I would go further; I should like to see the Press give our Defence Force as much publicity as possible. There are many matters regarding our Defence Force that we should keep a secret, but the more one makes a secret of any matter relating to our Defence Force, the harder the enemy agents try to obtain that information. It is the most difficult thing in the world to keep anything of real value a secret. The hon. member for Pretoria (District) told us what has happened in the last few days, but he was wrong. The information to which he referred and which was made known to the world was not the cause of what we may describe as the &#x201C;Pearl Harbour&#x201D; inflicted on the enemy forces. The information available to us is still very confused, of course, but it is quite clear that what happened was that the Israelis found certain gaps in the screen and exploited those gaps. If there is anything that should be kept a secret and that any responsible person will keep a secret, then it is in fact information of this nature.</p>

<p>I mention this, Mr. Chairman, just to show how difficult it is to keep secret anything which is really valuable.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think the hon. the Minister was quite fair to the hon. member for Pinelands or to this side of the House when he said that this amendment of ours did not meet his difficulties. We ask in our amendment that the words &#x201C;in regard to national security&#x201D; should be inserted after the word &#x201C;or&#x201D;. Surely that covers everything&#x003F; If certain information which affects our national security is published, action can be taken, of course. We say that this provision is a drastic provision. It creates the impression that we want to permit no criticism of our Defence Force. I repeat that what I should like to see is as much publicity as possible for our Defence Force. The other day, in his Second Reading Speech, the hon. the Minister mentioned the case of a certain supply depot on which a report appeared in the newspapers, and he said that that could not be tolerated. The hon. the Minister is correct; that should not be so. But does the hon. the Minister think for one moment that if we built a large oil tank, for example &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, when I read the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North) I was amazed at his moderation. I <span class="col_7515-7516" refersTo="page_1019"/>came to the conclusion that since he has been on that Select Committee he has suffered a &#x201C;sea-change into something rich and strange&#x201D;. He has become a different kind of man from what he used to be. What is he asking&#x003F; He is simply asking for the insertion of the words &#x201C;in regard to national security&#x201D;, and why the hon. the Minister should become emotional about it I do not know. I expected him to say immediately &#x201C;I will accept that amendment&#x201D;, because the addition of these words makes his own clause stronger. I would have liked to have criticized this clause but in deference to the wishes of my colleague I am not doing so. Sir, what does this subsection we are discussing say&#x003F; It says, &#x201C;it must not be calculated to alarm or depress members of the public&#x201D;. I will give an example of what hon. members on the other side have said that will alarm and depress members of the public. They keep telling us, from the Prime Minister down, that we are fighting a cold war. But it does not seem to alarm or depress them; it seems to elate them from what I can see; they seem to become more cheerful. People are not narrow in this way when they are considering their patriotic duty. A Prime Minister once said: &#x201C;I offer you blood and tears, toil and sweat.&#x201D; What was the response of his people&#x003F; They said: &#x201C;We are in the final now; all the other teams have been knocked out.&#x201D; This kind of thing that the Minister talks about here does not alarm or depress people. Why the Minister cannot say right away that he accepts the amendment I do not know, because the words are &#x201C;in regard to national security&#x201D;. I appeal to him to accept the amendment and let us get on with the work.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Kensington behaved so nicely, and see what he is doing to-day! He has also undergone a change since yesterday. It is not only the hon. member for Durban (Point) who has undergone a change. What does this amendment say&#x003F; It says: &#x201C;In line 45. after &#x2018;or&#x2019;, where it occurs for the first time, to insert &#x2018;in regard to national security&#x2019;.&#x201D; In other words, the newspaperman himself may now decide whether he thinks it relates to national security. He may write about it, and if he is taken to task, he will say he is sorry but that he did not think it related to national security. Then, if action is taken against him, the onus of proving that it related to national security rests on the State, and then it may be that in the process the State will have to furnish certain information which it is not very eager to give. That is the point, and for that reason I cannot accept it. In the first place the responsibility to decide whether or not it affects the national security is taken away from the Minister and placed in the hands of the newspapers; and, secondly, the Minister is then forced, if he takes action, to reveal the very things which he did not want to reveal. [Interjection.] Now the newspaper knows that it has to get permission, and I said I would meet the newspapers by telling them in advance what topics they could write on. The hon. member asked me a question. They may write on food and on complaints about food, and on the marriage, but the newspapers know now that if they come across a borderline case, they are running a risk and they should first obtain permission. That is the difference. I think hon. members will in all fairness appreciate the fairness of this attitude.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to my modest contribution, and notwithstanding the fact that he said he would not speak again, I do not propose to refer to his rather surprising reaction to a reasoned argument. But what I do want to stress, more particularly in the light of the Minister&#x2019;s statement now, is how extremely limited our amendment is.I think hon. members opposite should have their attention drawn to this. This qualification of national security relates to one aspect of one subsection and I want to let hon. members know that in regard to all these aspects that I shall mention now there is no limitation whatsoever, and then I should like to deal shortly with the limitation that we have suggested. There is no limitation suggested at all in regard to subsection (1), which says that no person shall publish (a) any information relating to the composition, movements or disposition of (i) the S.A. Defence Force or any auxiliary or voluntary nursing service established under this Act, or any force of a country which is allied to the Republic: or (ii) any South African or allied ships or aircraft used for naval or military purposes; or (iii) any engines, rolling stock, vehicles, vessels, etc. All those things this qualification does not touch at all. Let me state, furthermore, how little does it touch even para, (b), the paragraph which we have sought to qualify to a limited extent. It will also continue to be an offence to publish any statement, comment or rumour relating to any member of the S.A. Defence Force. We put no qualification on that either. So, strictly, it will not be permissible, as I understand it, to publish that a member of the Defence Force has been in an accident. Notwithstanding that it is so wide, we make no qualification there at all, and so it remains as it was originally.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. As it stands here, no person shall publish by any means any statement, comment or rumour relating to any member of the S.A. Defence Force or any activity of the S.A. Defence Force or any force of a foreign country calculated to prejudice or embarrass the Government in its foreign relations. So far as I have read now, there is no qualification or limitation whatever upon the powers that have been asked for here, and that covers just about everything one can think of. The sole provision where we have sought to impose a limitation is the one I shall now read, namely to <span class="col_7517-7518" refersTo="page_1020"/>publish anything &#x201C;to alarm or depress members of the public&#x201D;. In regard to that single provision only, we wish to insert &#x201C;or in regard to national security&#x201D;. So it relates solely to statements (apart from those enormously wide provisions I have already mentioned, and which are not affected) which go a further distance. These statements are a separate category, i.e. statements which, as I say, have this effect of alarming or depressing the public (separate from those which relate to a member of the Defence Force, etc., whether they alarm or depress or not). [Interjection.] Only there do we say that the qualification in regard to national security should be inserted. So I do want to stress that it is a most limited field, and that there is the greatest protection in regard to all those aspects. One might say that this provision which we qualify is almost redundant. I will not be surprised if almost every category could be brought within those others I have already quoted.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister touched on the question of the Attorney-General&#x2019;s refusing to prosecute. I concede that that is a safeguard against a foolish prosecution. But at the same time members of the Press are members of an honourable profession, and particularly when it comes to a question of national security they will not want to harm the country. They would want to remain within the law. They will not be satisfied to commit a breach of the law and then to trust to it that the Attorney-General will not prosecute. Therefore it is desirable that they should know exactly what they may or may not publish, and preferably it should be dealt with in the Bill. I know the Minister has said that he will tell them what they can publish; this undoubtedly will guide them. But one cannot help feeling that he will be obliged (because he will accept no limitation on the clause) to allow publication of matters which strictly by the terms of the provision the Press are prohibited from publishing.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit the proposed section 146 B.</block>

<p>I will deal with this matter briefly, because the hon. member for Durban (Point) and others referred to it during the Second Reading debate. I base my suggestion that the hon. the Minister should give serious consideration to the acceptance of this amendment on several factors which I believe are material to the efficient building up of the Citizen Force. I do believe that particularly in the junior ranks&#x2014;and these are really the persons with whom we are concerned&#x2014;it is the enthusiasm and the leadership of the individual officer that is a matter of vital concern. I believe this is particularly so in the case of the N.C.O. and the junior officer who have direct contact with the men under their respective commands. Command in the Forces, whether as a junior officer or as an N.C.O., carries with it responsibility, and in time of war it carries with it responsibility for the lives of the men, be they a section, be they a squadron or a platoon, who are under the command of that particular officer. In peacetime the effectiveness of the training will depend upon the willing acceptance of responsibility by the person who, as a commissioned officer or a non-commissioned officer, is entrusted with the task. I cannot for one moment believe that any purpose can be served by compelling an individual serving in the Citizen Force to accept promotion unless he is prepared to accept the responsibility. A man of that sort will become a passenger or worse. He is a man who can frustrate the whole of the training of a unit or portion of a unit, and can in that way become the weak link in that unit.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of looking at one individual, but to have an unwilling or an unenthusiastic junior officer in a regiment is as bad as having an unwilling and unenthusiastic hooker in a rugby scrum. That whole scrum will be of no value because of the unwillingness of the hooker, and so it will be in a regiment. When persons are compelled to accept promotion which they are unwilling to accept, that same weakness will arise. I want to know from the Minister in what manner a person of that nature can be disciplined, with all the force of the Military Discipline Code&#x003F; It has been said that the officers will be required to do a correspondence course during the course of service. They may do that and fail every examination, but how can it be proved that any man deliberately failed the examinations and did not merely fail because of incapacity on his part to pass&#x003F; Who will be the judge&#x003F; I believe that in fact this clause will not be used in practice, because of the consequential dangers which will arise to those who are under the command of such a person in time of war. I want to ask the Minister rather to let our junior officer corps and the non-commissioned officer corps consist of men who are willing to serve in that capacity, and not because they have been dragooned into doing it. I hope he will see his way clear to remove this section from this Bill. I am sure that will have the desired effect of encouraging men to join the corps of officers because they will not be with others who will merely have been dragooned into that position.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. J. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that one of the problems with which the Defence Force was faced under the voluntary system was in fact in the officer category. It was in that category in particular that there was a serious shortage in the Citizen Force <span class="col_7519-7520" refersTo="page_1021"/>and in the commandos, a much more serious shortage than in the subordinate ranks. This clause was inserted in the Bill because we found that under the former position, where we relied on voluntary service in the officers&#x2019; ranks, it was not possible to keep them up to strength; it was not possible to keep the units up to strength. That is why this clause was inserted, so that there would be an obligation. I am quite satisfied, as I said yesterday too, that we shall not be able to compel a person to do something against his will. I think one must accept, however, that there has to be some measure of obligation in order to enable us to supplement our officer corps so as to ensure that we will not have to rely on volunteers only. That is the object of this clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think the comparison the hon. member for Pretoria (West) has made is a good one. Under a ballot system men serve voluntarily after their period of service. I quoted yesterday a reply of an hon. Minister of this Government, who was not prepared to grant facilties. In other words, they had difficulties with employers and they had difficulties throughout the country on those grounds. Now this is a different story. They will all have to serve. The question is: Who is going to accept promotion&#x003F;</p>

<p>We have all heard that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. I do not agree with that, but I do think that an officer who wishes to be promoted and who accepts promotion is certainly worth half-a-dozen who are pressed into it. I do not think the Department should become a new modern press-gang, saying to a man, &#x201C;You must accept that responsibility&#x201D;, if he is unwilling to accept it. We shall have men who are unenthusiastic, we shall have those in training who will say, &#x201C;Now look here, be very careful here; do not become a success at this game or you will be promoted&#x201D;. Instead of a man getting C.B. or detention, he will be warned, &#x201C;You had better be careful&#x2014;they will make you a sergeant if you go on like this&#x201D;. Fancy saying to an hon. member on that side: &#x201C;If you are not careful in the House, if you talk too much and you show ability here, be very careful&#x2014;they might make you a Minister!&#x201D; Imagine such a thing happening! On the other side hon. members are all very anxious to accept those positions. They are all very keen even to be appointed to a control board. It shows a very good spirit, and that is the spirit we want in our forces. We want our men to come along voluntarily and say they will serve. But to compel a man to accept a commission, when it is the most serious step in his life, whether he is a civilian or a soldier, is wrong. Any man who has held a commission knows what a serious responsibility it is. He knows that in the old days he could resign his commission. I have heard one of the senior officers in the Force saying, &#x201C;If I were asked to do that, gentlemen, I would resign my commission&#x201D;, which was the most extreme step he could take. But what this Bill does is to say, &#x201C;Do not resign it&#x2014;do not ever get it!&#x201D;</p>

<p>I think the Minister must accept the amendment on the Order Paper and delete the section. There is no need to have it. We cannot compel men to become good soldiers in this way. I think it is a great mistake. If we had a system of equal sacrifices where every man served for 12 months as I suggested yesterday, then it might be a different story. But under the system which this Bill provides for, I think this section should be deleted. We do not want these press-gangs.</p>

<from>Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now reached the stage where this Bill before us will be enacted and where we will have a better Act administering the Defence Department than we have had in the past. The hon. the Minister told us that this piece of legislation is better than the one we originally had before us and that it is better mainly as a result of the deliberations of the Select Committee. I think the Minister will agree that it was a very wise move to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. I think there is another point of great importance as far as the Select Committee was concerned, and that is this. <span class="col_7521-7522" refersTo="page_1022"/>Those hon. members who had the opportunity of serving on the Select Committee had the opportunity of coming into contact with our defence chiefs and of talking to them. In the result I think very useful contacts have been established. The heads of our services who appeared before the Select Committee were very frank and, if I may say so, they acquitted themselves very well.</p>

<p>This measure is a better piece of legislation for this reason. Under the present Act&#x2014;which is now being replaced&#x2014;the ballot system was most unsatisfactory, and the reason why it was unsatisfactory was that while we were doing national service far too many people got away without doing service. Far too many people escaped doing their training. That was unsound. When we have national service then we must have national service and everyone must be hooked in.</p>

<p>The service chiefs have indicated to us that they will produce a better defence force. In this measure we are giving them all the provisions they asked for. and we have every confidence that they will now produce this better army which South Africa needs. I want to say at once a citizen force army is not the best way in which to train an army. Modern warfare requires highly specialized people and highly trained people. One can really only produce them in a permanent army. Although many so-called experts advocate a large standing army for South Africa, there are obvious reasons why we cannot have such an army. The manpower shortage and also economics are in issue. We feel the citizen force army is the army on which we shall have to depend. What is more. I think the citizen force army will be able to take care of us, to look after us. Only this week we have had an instance elsewhere in the world of a citizen army who did all right&#x2014;it annihilated its enemy despite superior numbers and a stronger army. Well, if they can do it, we can do it too. We are training our army not for aggression but for defence and while we cannot achieve the ideal of a standing army I am sure a citizen force army will serve us quite well in coping with any problems with which we might be faced in future.</p>

<p>There remains for us an important task&#x2014;to popularize our defence forces. In the past too many of our young people were looking for all sorts of excuses to avoid being called up. In addition, there were too many people busy behind the scenes trying to get exemption or deferments. I think we must try to get the public of South Africa to realize that we have national service and that to serve one&#x2019;s country is not only a duty but also a privilege. We are living in a good country and it should, therefore, be a privilege and a pleasure for each of us to do our share in its defence.</p>

<p>The Minister told us that this Bill will mostly affect our young people. But that is not entirely correct. It is going to affect every sector of our economy, every sphere of our public life; parents, workers, in short everybody shall have to make sacrifices. But primarily our youth is affected and if we could get them to accept this obligation with goodwill, instead of looking at it as a distasteful obligation, we would have gone a long way towards creating the right attitude towards training.</p>

<p>But the Government too can do a little more in the way of making life bearable for these trainees. Let me just mention a few things for the Minister to bear in mind&#x2014;privileges which these young people should enjoy whilst they undergo training. There is, for instance, the question of free train journeys over week-ends or during periods of leave. Why cannot they be given free rail passages&#x003F; In addition to making the life of these youngsters easier for them it will eliminate many evils. Another instance: Why cannot they enjoy free postal facilities&#x003F; I say: Let them post their letters to their friends and their parents free of charge. It is these and other small perks with which we can facilitate life for these youngsters. Another important factor is their remuneration, especially in the latter years of their 10-year training period. By that time many of them will be getting on in life and will have to shoulder responsibilities towards families. For them then to go to camp at a very low rate of pay might cause them hardships. Employers too shall have to make sacrifices. But I do not think these sacrifices should be too much for them. After all, it is the security of our country that counts and this is their contribution towards maintaining that.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to see that this legislation makes provision for the training of immigrants. I do not think they can grouse about that. This is more or less in line with the practice in other countries with a large number of immigrants. In any event, if this country is good enough for an immigrant to come to for a living, he can be expected to carry his share of the responsibilities towards the country. The Minister has stated that other arrangements will be made for those who indicate that they do not want to become citizens of the country. Against that I have no objection. But at the other end of the scale there are those who did do their share and did undergo military training. Let us facilitate their becoming citizens&#x2014;sooner or easier than those who did not undergo training. This is merely a thought which I want to leave with the Minister.</p>

<p>This Bill also makes an attempt to put our commandos on a proper basis. I think all of us will admit that in the years gone by our commandos could have been improved upon. Now I think the military authorities will be able to make good use of them and get value for the money spent on them. As far as their training is concerned, this left much to be desired in the past. This could be improved upon.</p>

<p>All in all, great demands are being made by the defence of our country, although we should not look upon it as a demand because it is our duty to defend our country. Therefore we must accept that sacrifices are necessary. Therefore I should like to express the hope that everybody who will be affected by <span class="col_7523-7524" refersTo="page_1023"/>this legislation will accept their new obligations with good grace and in good spirit.</p>

<p>By way of courtesy I want to thank hon. members for agreeing to take also the Third Reading of this Bill now. I am very glad about that. I do not want to create any illusion that the practical application of this legislation is not going to present any problems&#x2014;as a matter of fact, it may still occasion a good deal of brain-racking. I therefore hope that hon. members will exercise patience when we start applying the new scheme in practice. We must not jump to conclusions. Many of these provisions still have to be tested in practice.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to better facilities for men undergoing training. The hon. member knows, however, that we are already moving in that direction and that we shall do what we can within the financial capacity of the country to arouse the largest possible measure of enthusiasm for training. I already dealt with the new positive approach to immigrants yesterday. I hope that I shall have the co-operation of everyone here in arousing enthusiasm among the parents as well for the training which their sons have to undergo.</p>

<heading>REMOVAL OF RESTRICTIONS BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill is the result of protracted consultations. In the first place, consultations were held among Government Departments, the four Administrators and the United Municipal Executive over a period of two years. Eventually the Bill was considered by a Select Committee of this House and complete agreement was reached on an amended Bill, one which is acceptable to me. After the amended Bill of the Select Committee had been published, I received further representations from the legal advisers of the provinces in regard to a few minor amendments merely for the sake of achieving greater clarity. I shall consequently move these amendments in the Committee Stage. At this juncture I also wish to express my thanks and appreciation to the chairman and members of the Select Committee for the thorough work that was done.</p>

<p>There are two reasons in particular why this Bill is necessary. Firstly, obsolete restrictions still apply in many parts of the country, and in many municipal areas there are restrictions which prohibit modern building methods from being used. We already have statutory authority to remove these restrictions in cases where housing schemes are built by the National Housing Commission. With the rapid development of modern requirements and techniques in the building industry, particularly as far as building methods making use of factory-constructed units are concerned, it has become essential for obsolete provisions which have a hampering effect, which retard development and which impede the provision of housing to be removed. Effective town planning and provision of housing cannot be allowed to be impeded and interfered with by obsolete restrictive provisions imposed on land many years ago. This Bill creates proper machinery for removing those provisions.</p>

<p>Secondly, this measure is necessary to clear up the legal confusion which has arisen as a result of court decisions. Prior to 1945 the Transvaal had an ordinance which authorized its Administrator to alter conditions, including those which had not been imposed by him. In 1945, however, the Appeal Court declared this provision invalid. The Transvaal made urgent representations to the Government, which passed Act 48 of 1946 in order to rectify the position. The Act was purely a matter between the Government and the Province of the Transvaal at that stage, and was aimed at granting certain additional powers to the Administrator, but under the supervision of, as was the case at the time, the Governor-General. The other provinces were not consulted about the matter, but the Act did make provision for them to request that it be made applicable to them as well. Up to 1927 the Cape Province had had no legislation on townships. During the period from 1927 to 1934 the Cape Province did have a townships ordinance. but it contained no authority for the removal of conditions after they had been imposed. It very soon became clear that it was simply impossible to allow future development to be hamstrung by inflexible conditions. In 1934 the Cape Province then obtained its existing Townships Ordinance, No. 33 of 1934 It contains provisions (sections 18 (3) and 3 <i>bis)</i> which authorize the Administrator to alter conditions imposed in terms of the Ordinance, but no other conditions. In 1948 the Cape Province got into difficulties in connection with the removal of conditions in respect of certain land which it had bought specifically for school purposes, and it had to ask that Act 48 of 1946 be made applicable to its area as well. That was done. Legal advice confirmed that Act 48 of 1946 granted the province additional powers to those which it possessed in terms of Ordinance 33 of 1934. In 1950 the Cape Supreme Court confirmed this statement in its decision in the case of Garden Cities vs. Registrar of Deeds. Up to 1962&#x2014;that is to say, for 28 years&#x2014;the relevant Ordinance of 1934 and those of other provinces had legal force and effect. Then the Appeal Court gave its decision in the well-known case of Ronnies Motors v. Van der Walt in 1962, declaring the action of the Administrator <i>ultra vires.</i> The Appeal Court found that the Ordinance concerned did not authorize the Administrator to remove conditions of title upon the application <span class="col_7525-7526" refersTo="page_1024"/>of an owner for his own benefit. What that amounted to was that what had been accepted as right for 28 years and what had been confirmed by legal advice and a decision of the Supreme Court, namely that Act 48 of 1946 granted an Administrator additional powers, was set aside by the Appeal Court, with the implication that Act 48 of 1946 had in actual fact deprived Administrators of powers which they had formerly possessed.</p>

<p>I want to make it very clear, Mr. Speaker, that I am not discussing the pros and cons of the matter here&#x2014;we may safely leave that in the hands of our courts&#x2014;but that I am merely giving you a historical survey of events.</p>

<p>This decision, which did not at the same time declare <i>ultra vires</i> the relevant section 18 (3) <i>bis</i> of the 1934 Ordinance, caused great confusion, which was aggravated by a series of conflicting legal opinions. The legal position was so confusing that the Deeds Office simply refused to accept any authority for removing any condition in terms of the section concerned before a further decision had been given by the court. In an attempt to save the situation, Act 48 of 1946 was amended so as to make it applicable in all areas where town planning schemes were in force, whether or not the schemes had been finally completed. Several legal opinions subsequently confirmed that &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; as defined in section 1 of Act 48 of 1946 had to be interpreted in its broadest sense and included aspects such as conditions regarding the height of buildings, cover, building lines and so forth. The Administrators and the State President acted in terms of this and dozens of proclamations were issued. In August, 1966, a directly opposite legal opinion was given, to the effect that &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; had to be interpreted in its most limited sense. What had been confusion then became chaos. To mention only one example: In the case of a large plot which is subject to a condition that only one building may be erected on it, the condition may be altered so as to allow a huge block of flats to be erected on it or to have business premises erected on it, but no authority may be granted for subdividing such a large plot to make provision for two dwelling houses. Legal doubt exists as to whether, if such a condition is altered so as to make provision for the erection of business premises on such a plot, it is legal also to adjust the building lines, cover and so forth to comply with the new &#x201C;purpose&#x201D; for which the land is going to be used. Absurdities of this nature, and there are many of them, simply cannot be allowed. This measure is also aimed at putting an end to this, and that is the second reason for the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<p>Seeing that the Bill has been considered by a Select Committee and interested parties and members have had ample opportunity of studying it, I do not intend to give an explanation of all its provisions now. However, there are three features contained in these provisions to which I want to refer. Firstly, this Bill provides for a clear and accurately defined procedure which is to be followed before an Administrator or the Minister may remove or alter a restrictive provision or condition. Amongst other things it is also being made compulsory for every owner or interested party who may possibly be affected by that, to be notified personally and, if he wants to lodge an objection, to be granted an opportunity of doing so. Previously notices were published only in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> but everybody does not read the <i>Government Gazette.</i></p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended, I was referring to three features contained in the provisions of the Bill. The first is that persons who are affected by possible changes have to be notified in person so that they will be able to lodge objections if they wish to do so. Secondly, clause 4 (4) provides that if an objection has been lodged against a proposed removal, suspension or alteration of a restrictive provision by an Administrator, the Administrator may not act without my approval. The existing Acts provide that such an alteration may only be made with the approval of the State President. The procedure that has been followed is that the provincial administration refers the matter to the State President through the Department of the Interior. The State President, of course, acts upon the recommendation of the Government&#x2014;in this case the Minister of the Interior. But that Minister and his Department have no machinery for carrying out investigations, or professional officers who can decide about the desirability or otherwise of such a proposed alteration or removal. Consequently it has been decided that the final decision here should rather rest with the Minister of Community Development, who has a Department which is equipped to investigate and decide about the desirability or necessity of any such alteration or removal. I consider this provision to be an improvement, because by reason of its activities my Department is orientated to protect the interests of the ordinary house-owner in particular, while at the same time being in a position to judge proper town planning.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I want to refer to clause 5 of the Bill, which authorizes the alteration, suspension of removal of restrictions or obligations at my request. As the Bill was drafted originally. it seemed as though arbitrary powers would be conferred upon me without there being any need for proper investigations beforehand. I myself was not satisfied with the original provision and had already had an amendment framed in more or less the same terms as those of the present provision before the Bill was referred to the Select Committee. It has always been the intention to do it in this way. The legal draftsmen&#x2014;and hon. members must bear in mind that the original Bill <span class="col_7527-7528" refersTo="page_1025"/>was prepared by my Department in conjunction with the officials of the four provinces&#x2014; deemed it unnecessary to define the procedure in clause 5, because it could be arranged administratively. I agree, however, that it is much better to define and incorporate the procedure in the Bill itself.</p>

<p>I just want to say a few words about the necessity for this clause, which may seem superfluous to many by reason of the fact that my Department can approach the Administrator in the same way as an ordinary applicant can. There are several reasons why this provision is necessary, but I want to mention one only. As I indicated during the discussion On my Vote, we are on the eve of large-scale slum clearance and urban renewal schemes in South Africa, schemes for which the Government, acting through my Department, will have to make available hundreds of millions of rands in the next few years. I consider the matter as being so important that I have decided to undertake an extensive tour overseas together with the two most senior officials of my Department in September or October this year, if all goes well. We shall visit France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Italy, England, the U.S.A. and Canada to make a study of the following matters: (1) The way in which residential premises and/or units for single dwellings and flats (with right of ownership) are made available to the lower and middle income groups, and problems coupled with that, such as transportation problems and the high cost of providing services. (2) The role that authorities and private entrepreneurs can fulfill in respect of (1) above. (3) The measures taken by the authorities to prevent urban areas from deteriorating. (4) Urban renewal, particularly in respect of (a) methods applied in order to modernize backward urban complexes; (b) methods of financing slum clearance and urban renewal; and (c) the way in which private entrepreneurs are mobilized and brought into these processes. (5) Modern trends and methods in connection with prefabricated construction. (6) Metropolitan development of urban areas and the extent to which the Central Government should play a part in that.</p>

<p>With your leave, Mr. Speaker. I wish to add that I am taking an official of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions with me and that he and I shall investigate the following matters: (1) The part played by welfare departments in socio-economic state planning. (2) The way in which preventative and remedial rehabilitation work is co-ordinated with after-care. (3) The way in which the social care of communities which are resettled from slum areas is undertaken and/or co-ordinated and controlled. (4) The way in which the &#x201C;Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance&#x201D; and &#x201C;Medi-care&#x201D; schemes of the U.S.A. originated and developed and what the future policy in that regard is. as well as a study of the advantages and shortcomings.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, since we regard slum clearance and urban renewal as being of such great importance, we are trying to obtain the co-operation of the local authorities through the establishment of state committees for every area that is tackled. So far we have had outstanding success in this regard. We shall have to have many town planning schemes altered in the process; restrictions will have to be altered, removed or suspended, and seeing that millions of rands, money which has to be provided by the State, are at stake here, I cannot make the State (and therefore the Minister) subject to decisions given by Administrators. I personally do not believe that it will ever be necessary for me or my successors in this Department to act contrary to the advice of Administrators. I believe we shall always reach agreement through negotiation, but if that does not happen, the hands of the State may not be tied through lack of authority, where tens of millions of rands may already have been invested in a project.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that these are the most important provisions of the Bill, and since the Select Committee has done a thorough piece of work, I trust that I shall receive the unanimous support of the House to place this measure on the Statute Book.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>In spite of the reaction that came from this House, I am glad that the hon. the Minister and certain of his officers are to proceed overseas to investigate the possibilities of providing houses and to investigate all the things covered by the terms of this Bill; because I believe that what has happened up to now is that the Minister, by way of group area proclamations and slums clearance legislation has accumulated for himself a huge number of areas which are to some extent like hot potatoes. He does not quite know what to do with them because he is encumbered by a mass of legislation, in many cases old legislation and in many cases legislation which should have been taken off the statute book years ago. We on this side of the House believe that those areas should be developed as quickly as possible for the benefit of the people who are crying for houses. I just want to quote one example to the Minister and I hope he will then get on with the job. During the last year or so I bought a little house and we were going to let a friend stay in it during the recess, but that friend has now decided not to stay in it and my wife went to the estate agent to ask him whether he could let it. Do you know. Sir, that a queue followed her up the street from the estate agent to get possession of this house&#x003F; I quote this merely to accentuate to the Minister the need for the speedy provision of housing. That is why we are supporting this Bill, because we want to sweep out of the way all those old restrictions applying to land which have in many cases taken months and sometimes years to remove. This is what we want to do because we believe that the main objective of the government, which is what this Minister represents, is to provide for the needs of the community in regard to housing, and at the moment this <span class="col_7529-7530" refersTo="page_1026"/>Minister is concerned more especially with the needs of the community in regard to housing. [Interjection.] The suggestion has come that he should be, but I believe that he is. I will credit the Minister with that because I believe that the Minister wants to do his job. At the moment we read one Press report after the other saying that from 70,000 to 100,000 houses are required. I want to disregard these for the moment and I want to believe that the Minister in fact wants to get on with the job of providing houses. I am not being dramatic, I hope, when I say that I want to believe that the Minister wants to provide housing. We on this side of the House want to place at his disposal every facility possible to help him to do that, and I believe that this Bill helps him to do just that. All we ask of the Minister in return &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I would be only too delighted to go. I might also say that on my return I might have an equal contribution to that of the Minister to make towards the solution of this particular problem, because it is only with the prodding and the help of the Opposition that anything at all has been achieved over the last 20 years.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the actual provisions of this Bill. I sincerely hope that this Bill has been a lesson to the hon. the Minister and to his colleagues as to the value of Select Committees of this House. When this Bill came before us in its original form I think I am not going too far when I say that it was repugnant to this House; it was repugnant to the Opposition because it was designed to give the Minister powers which rode roughshod over everything we had previously considered as important in regard to the removal of restrictions on the use of land and property. But we asked the Minister to send the Bill to a Select Committee. He had no idea of doing that, but he responded and I give him full marks for that, because it was the finest Select Committee of this House on which I have had the privilege of serving. Out of this Select Committee has come a Bill which is acceptable to both sides of this House and to the rest of South Africa. That is the point I want to make, because we know and the Minister knows that everyone wanted some sort of measure which would remove the tedious process through which one has to go at the moment to remove one stupid restriction. For example, we had a letter this morning, long after the Select Committee finished its work, which says that a building society has problems in a place like Nelspruit, where in a whole street every house has offended against the building line which was laid down. At the moment there is no legislation available which can remove that and allow those houses to remain there without the threat of being knocked down. There are at the moment, I understand from this same report which I have not read thoroughly, problems in connection with a township which was laid out to accommodate houses on stands of one acre. Because the stands were so big, it was agreed that a 40-foot building line should be observed. Since then it has been decided that that was quite an unappropriate area for acre stands. It was decided then by all concerned that those stands should be subdivided into smaller stands, I believe of a quarter-acre, but I am not sure. But there is no power to remove the building line of 40 feet. You can imagine, Sir, what it would be like if you had to build to a building line of 40 feet on a stand of a &#x00BC; acre. The position is just absurd, and one wonders how we have lived through the years with these peculiar restrictions applying. I can only think that we have existed because we have not observed them, but now of course when it comes to the notice of the Legislature, obviously something has to be done about it.</p>

<p>I want to comment on one particular aspect which I touched on earlier. This Minister, by way of group areas declarations and slum legislation, where he will clear up slums and rebuild them, and by urban renewal schemes, must have come into possession of an enormous amount of housing land. At the moment I accept the fact that apart from the difficulty of replanning these areas he must be frustrated, because he has to go through a process of removing certain restrictions which have applied since the year dot, before replanning and re-using this land, and providing housing for people who are waiting for houses. We are agreeing with this Bill because we want to help the Minister in doing this, but I want to sound one note of warning. I sincerely hope that the Minister, in proceeding to use this land and to renew these areas and to do away with slums and to provide housing, will show a measure of speed, of willingness, which far exceeds that shown by the old Group Areas Development Board, because there we had examples one after the other where houses stod empty after the board had acquired them and after they had been declared for occupation by a particular group of people. They stood empty for months and when eventually they were acquired by a member of the group entitled to occupy them, they had been desecrated by vandals, guttering had been torn off in many cases, the lead piping had been removed, the windows had been smashed, the floors had been torn up, to such an extent that they were no longer fit for habitation. These are the experiences we have had. We have backed this Minister all along the line. His proclaimed effort is to provide housing for people, housing which is so vitally necessary at this moment, but we have seen unfortunately that in certain instances he has not taken adequate advantage of the provisions we have given him. He has not used the sword with which we have armed him. We want to make a plea to this hon. Minister to please get on with the job of providing the housing which this Bill will enable him to do.</p>

<p><span class="col_7531-7532" refersTo="page_1027"/>In addition to this I accept that this will help the ordinary owner of land to remove restrictions which are inhibiting him. I think that in the overall picture this will apply largely to the efforts of the State to get on with the job of planning and replanning and the provision of houses. This is what the hon. the Minister is interested in. We support this Bill wholeheartedly in spite of the fact that we have just passed the Physical Planning Bill. The Physical Planning Bill makes us ask this question: How many people are going to deal with the land in the provinces and in the areas of the local authorities&#x003F; In the case of the Physical Planning Bill the question is different. That Bill is to all intents and purposes going to freeze the use of land for industrial purposes and the establishment of industries. I hope that this hon. Minister does not have one thought in his mind about industrial land. I hope that his one thought is the establishment of housing and other buildings where our people can live so that the people who are brought out to this country to do specific jobs for industry and others have housing available and do not have to move from one city to another. These are the aspects I want to lay before the hon. the Minister. Although we support this Bill wholeheartedly I feel that we must emphasize the fact that we are doing so for a specific reason, namely to provide housing for our people and to provide it quickly.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am on my feet to express my appreciation to members on both sides of this House who served on the Select Committee and jointly presented a piece of legislation to this House which ought to be acceptable to all parties concerned and which ought to give satisfaction. It is true that this legislation largely originated from requests made by the Administrators to assist them to overcome certain problems, as detailed by the hon. member for Umlazi, with which they were faced in the past. The Administrators and the provinces gave this legislation their strong support. There were certain misgivings in regard to the legislation originally referred to the Select Committee. As you know. Sir, the provinces are very concerned about their rights. The Province of Natal in particular is allergic when it comes to the granting of certain powers to Ministers. I am pleased to say, however, that with a little consultation and a little ironing out of difficulties, we have succeeded in presenting an agreed measure to this House without having abandoned any principle underlying this legislation and without having watered down any principle originally contained in the legislation.</p>

<p>I just want to call attention to one aspect of this legislation which to my mind is the real merit of this legislation. That is that we are creating machinery by means of this legislation for the removal under certain circumstances of restricting obstacles as far as effective town-planning is concerned when it is in the public interest to do so. This ought to enable local authorities, the provincial authorities and the Department of Community Development to finalize town-planning schemes much more rapidly under certain circumstances. Since the hon. member for Umlazi appealed to the hon. the Minister and his Department to get on with their jobs, I want to say to the local authorities, seeing that they now have this legislation, &#x201C;let them also get on with the job&#x201D;. They have, in the first instance an obligation towards their communities when it comes to the provision of housing. This legislation will expedite town-planning and will remove many of the obstacles with which the local authorities, the provinces and the Minister had to cope in the past and will increase the availability of building sites available to a larger extent. That in point of fact is one of the major bottle-necks which is being experienced at present in our attempts to provide housing at a more rapid rate as well as to provide cheaper housing.</p>

<p>It is hardly credible that in this country of ours with its wide spaces there is such a dire shortage of land and sites for the provision of housing in and about our cities. This causes the prices of existing sites and stands to soar. That makes housing terribly expensive, so expensive that the man in the street cannot afford it at present. By means of this legislation we have succeeded in removing certain restrictions and obstacles which existed for the local authorities and for the Provincial Administrations so as to enable them to establish townships more rapidly. We have given powers to the Minister to act more rapidly and to make sites available. We hope that this will assist us in our attempts to overcome these problems with which we were faced in years gone by. I gladly support this Bill because I regard it to be a major step in the right direction.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to make two points only. The one concerns the question out to me by the hon. member for Umlazi in regard to the connection between this Bill and the Physical Planning Act. It is not the intention to use this measure in respect of industrial sites. I must say. however, that where we are concerned with the replanning of a large area it may be necessary for a portion of that area to be zoned for light industries or for commercial purposes. Industrial sites may. in fact, become involved in the matter in that respect only. I want to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member for Umlazi and the hon. member for Parow that it is a matter of absolute necessity for us to make progress with this enormous task. Unfortunately it is true that a backlog has developed over the years in regard to the entire process of slum clearance in particular. Now I am not speaking of the provision of housing. Slum clearance and town renewal are things which were neglected in South Africa in the past. We are now faced with a situation which has made all our local authorities aware of this <span class="col_7533-7534" refersTo="page_1028"/>problem. They are not working everywhere with as much speed and as nicely as I would like to see them do. In spite of that, I have to point out that this is not a process which one can tackle to-day and simply complete within a very short space of time. Replanning an urban area involves the proper replanning of the entire area. That cannot be done over-hastily, because the replanning has to be such that the rebuilt area will not revert to a slum area within the space of a year or ten. We must have proper planning and that takes time.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but that is essential. We must ascertain what method is the best. As far as several areas are concerned, we have appointed advisers and firms of consultants but we find that we simply do not have sufficient people in South Africa who have knowledge of the replanning process. Therefore we want to ascertain what methods we can discover and what methods we can employ for expediting this process.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to mention another important matter. Once we have replanned an area we can begin to interest private initiative in that area. I am very pleased that I am able to say that there is tremendous interest on the part of the private sector to obtain properties and to erect building complexes in the areas which are being replanned. This will facilitate the task of the State and the local authorities to a considerable extent. As far as the State&#x2019;s contribution is concerned, I want to say that there are large schemes which will have to be tackled in virtually every large town in our country as well as in many of our smaller towns. Because there are housing shortages, and because all the town councils are now waking up, the demands made on the State in regard to the provision of funds are assuming such proportions that I can use every cent which I can get from my colleague, the Minister of Finance. That figure will depend on what the national finances will allow in the future. I can give hon. members the assurance that I on my part will leave no stone unturned to obtain the maximum amount which it is at all possible to obtain for this purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The object of this Bill is, <i>inter alia,</i> to implement the concessions in respect of social pensions and allowances announced by my colleague, the Minister of Finance, in his Budget speech earlier this year. Hon. members will recall that in the case of Whites the additional allowance which had been payable to the recipients of social pensions and allowances was consolidated with the basic pension in 1965. That resulted in the means test being relaxed to a considerable extent and in the virtual elimination of the difference between the income of persons who just qualified for a pension or allowance and the person who did not. <span class="col_7535-7536" refersTo="page_1029"/>In 1966 it was decided to give further relief to the recipients of social pensions in the form of a bonus of R24 per month which was paid to such persons.</p>

</speech>

<p>Per month&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am sorry. It was R24 per annum. I wish it could have been R24 per month.</p>

<p>In clause 14 it is now being proposed to increase this bonus in respect of Whites by R12 per annum to R36 per annum. The additional allowances are still being paid to Coloureds, Indians and Bantu and in order to give these people some relief these allowances are being increased by R6 per annum in respect of Coloureds and Indians and by R3 per annum in respect of Bantu. The same concession is being made to war veteran pensioners in that the additional amount which will be payable to them will be increased by R12 per annum in the case of Whites and by R6 per annum in the case of Coloureds and Indians. These concessions will come into operation as from 1st October, 1967.</p>

<p>In addition it has been decided to pay social pensions and allowances to Chinese as from 1st April, 1967. As hon. members will see in the Bill, Chinese will be treated in the same way as Coloureds and Indians.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that I recently announced during the discussion of the Vote of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions that war veterans&#x2019; pensions will henceforth also be paid to permanent and voluntary white members of the military units who performed duties during the Zulu Rebellion in Natal in 1906. At that time I also furnished details in connection with this rebellion, which is known as the Bambata Rebellion. Clause 9 authorizes the payment of such pensions with effect from 1st April, 1967. So much as regards clauses 1 to 14.</p>

<p>The other clauses, except for clause 16, contain no new principles and can, if necessary, be explained individually during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Clause 16 deals with the pension rights of certain members on the establishment of the Munitions Production Board. When this Board was established in 1964 a number of officials of the Public Service was transferred to the service of the Board. One of the conditions subject to which they were transferred was that officials would not be entitled to poorer pension benefits on account of the transfer than those to which they had been entitled prior to the transfer. In terms of the Associated Institutions Pension Fund Act, 1963, the Munitions Production Board was declared an &#x201C;associated institution&#x201D; and all employees of the Board automatically became members of the Associated Institutions Pension Fund. However, the persons who were members of other State-controlled funds at the time of their transfer felt that it could not be ascertained beyond any doubt that on their retirement they would receive better&#x2014;or equally good&#x2014;benefits from the Associated Institutions Pension Fund as would have been the case had they remained members of the funds to which they used to belong.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 16 will enable them to elect to have their former pension rights restored. These are the most important provisions of this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, this Bill brings about relief to a deserving section of the community, and obviously we on this side of the House wholeheartedly support this measure.</p>

<p>This Bill grants alleviation to various sections of the community. The first 14 clauses, bar the first two clauses, deal with social pensioners and contain amendments to the various Acts pertaining to the payment of those pensions. There are one or two points on which I believe the Minister could give further clarification. Firstly I think there is disappointment that the Minister is not extending the benefits and privileges contained in this Bill to a greater extent.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member cannot deal with that now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend dealing with it, Mr. Speaker, but I intend dealing with the provisions contained in this Bill and certain aspects of those provisions, for instance, the amount that the bonus is increased by. In addition to their bonus white social penioners will receive R1 per month more in terms of clause 14. Allowances for Chinese, Coloured, Indian and Bantu social pensioners are to be increased in terms of clause 4 of the Bill. There is an important difference here. We realize that proportionately the other racial groups are to receive an increase, with the Coloured, the Chinese and the Indians receiving an increase of 50c per month and the Bantu 25c per month. The Minister mentioned the amending Act of 1965. In that measure the consolidation of the allowances brought about a relaxation of the pensions plus means limitation. However, that only applied to the white group, to the white social pensioners. This Bill increases the additional allowances that are paid to the non-White groups I think this step is not a wise step to take in that it would be far better if the Minister gave attention to extending a similar position to the non-Whites as far as the consolidation of the additional allowances is concerned. We see in terms of clause 4 that this additional allowance is in fact in exces of the basic pension that is being paid to the non-white groups. It means that there is a vast and widening gap between those persons who just fail to qualify for a social pension and those who do qualify for the minimum pension. For example, if the Coloured pensioner can qualify for the minimum pension of R6 per month then in terms of clause <span class="col_7537-7538" refersTo="page_1030"/>4 of this Bill he immediately qualifies for an additional allowance of R102 per annum as from 1st October, 1967. Taking the maximum basic pension of R72 per annum, his additional allowance in terms of this measure will be some R102 per annum. It means that as far as the minimum pension is concerned a Coloured person qualifying for the minimum pension, because of the way in which this measure will be administered, will receive R9 per month. On the other hand, those who just fail to qualify will not receive any benefit at all. The amending legislation of 1965 narrowed that gap between those who just failed to qualify and those who were paid a minimum pension, and the consolidation of the allowance with the basic pension did not mean that there was such a great gap. However, the Minister delegates his powers for the non-White group to the responsible Ministers concerned and we never have an opportunity of discussing that in any detail because legislative power is taken in terms of this Bill. So I do hope the Minister will be able to give an indication as to the reasons why the additional allowances will be continued to be dealt with in this manner as far as the non-Whites are concerned.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of this Bill which I believe deserve greater consideration. For instance, clauses 9 and 10 deal with amendments to the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act of 1962. We find for the first time that the Chinese group are defined as a group as far as these pension benefits are concerned.</p>

<p>We realize that the Aged Persons Bill, which has already passed through this House, also defined the Chinese group as a separate group for pension purposes. Sir, in terms of clauses 9 and 10 we find that the Chinese group is now included in the definition of war veteran. The term &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; now includes Europeans, Coloureds, Chinese and Indians. An important omission here is that the Bantu are not included in the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;. I think it is a pity that the hon. the Minister did not take this opportunity of further extending this definition so as to cover persons of all racial groups who have served their country. Sir, the advantages of being classified as a war veteran in terms of the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act are shown in paragraph (b) of clause 10 of this Bill, which shows that the additional amount paid to the white war veteran is to be increased from R120 per annum to R132 per annum. As far as Coloureds and Indians are concerned, the additional war veteran&#x2019;s pension is to be increased from R54 to R60 per annum. Members of the Chinese group will also receive R54 per annum until the 1st October, 1967, when the amount will be increased to R60 per annum. All these groups therefore will receive the benefit of a war veteran&#x2019;s pension.</p>

<p>This Bill also contains a new provision which extends the rights of persons who served in the Zulu rebellion of 1906, known as the Bambata Rebellion. Sir, those of us who represent the Province of Natal particularly welcome this provision. We have been urging for the past two years or more that this provision should be placed on the Statute Book, and it is indeed pleasing to see that the necessary provision is now being made in this measure.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Well, perhaps we will get a great deal more as time goes on. There is a great deal of ground still to be covered. Sir, there are persons who for various reasons were unable to serve in subsequent wars. They were therefore not included in the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;. The inclusion of this provision means that if these people are at present receiving an old-age pension, they will now receive an additional R8 per month. I should be glad if the hon. the Minister can give us some indication as to how this provision will be administered as far as proof of service is concerned. Several of the veterans who took part in these old campaigns experience great difficulty in proving that they served in those campaigns. Anglo-Boer war veterans and the so-called &#x201C;Protesting burgers&#x201D; of 1914 all experience great difficulty in proving that they served in those wars. The same will apply to many people who served in the Zulu rebellion, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will give the House some indication as to what administrative arrangements will be made so that these people will not find it unduly difficult to provide proof of service.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 20 provision is made for the various dates on which the various clauses of the Bill will come into operation. In this connection I would like to mention an important point as far as social pensions are concerned and that is that the increased benefits will only become applicable as from the 1st October, 1967. It is difficult to follow the argument that has been put forward in the past that where the means test is relaxed as from a certain date, the increased benefits can only be paid as from the same date. In 1965, for example, when the means test was relaxed as from the 1st October of that year, it was decided that the increased benefits would only be payable as from that date. The argument that this is necessary in order to avoid administrative difficulties is not a very valid one in this age of modern mechanized accounting machines. There should be no difficulty in increasing all social pensions by R1 per month as from the 1st April, 1967, the beginning of the new financial year. We know that the amending legislation which was passed in the first session of 1966 provided for an increase of R2 per month to the white social pensioners as from the 1st April of that year. I cannot see therefore why the increased benefit should not come into operation as from the 1st April. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can put forward some other reason as to why it is <span class="col_7539-7540" refersTo="page_1031"/>necessary for these persons to lose the benefit of this increase for a period of six months. We know to what extent the cost of living has increased, particularly over the past two years, and it would have been of immense benefit to these people if the increases provided for in this Bill could have been introduced as from the 1st April of this year. As far as the non-Whites are concerned, the Bantu social pensioners have not had an increase since 1965. The increase that they are receiving this year is only 25 cents per month as from the 1st October, 1967.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other speakers on this side who wish to deal with certain other aspects of this Bill. We believe that the clauses which deal with the Government Service Pensions Act bring about an improvement which will be welcomed by the members of these funds.</p>

<p>Then I want to make one final point. This legislation obviously affects a large number of people. There are many people who intend applying for a pension at some future date, who are unaware of the provisions of the Act. In this connection I would like to compliment the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department on the preparation of an excellent memorandum which has been circulated to members of this House and which sets out details with regard to the means test, social benefits, welfare benefits, maintenance grants, family allowances and the various pension benefits provided for in this Bill. This memorandum will be of inestimable value to members of the House. In this connection I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to ask his Department to prepare, in a condensed form, literature which can be made available to persons who make inquiries at the various regional offices, so that amendments such as those we have before us to-day. can easily be understood by all interested parties. Applicants for pensions will then be able to see what they are entitled to and whether, in terms of the various relaxations and concessions which have been made in the past, they qualify for a social pension. I do hope that this document will be more widely circulated and that it will be possible for the hon. the Minister to instruct his Department to prepare a summary which can be freely circulated so that interested parties will know exactly what they are entitled to. Sir, we have much pleasure in supporting the Second Reading. We realize that this Bill will bring benefits to a deserving section of the community.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo referred briefly to clauses 9 and 10 and I wish to deal with them in greater detail. Before I do so. however, I wish to quote from this very excellent memorandum, to which the hon. member for Umbilo also made reference, and I wish to associate myself with his remarks. It is indeed a great source of assistance to us when we are questioned by pensioners seeking information. I want to quote the introductory paragraph which I believe is the same as the introductory paragraph in previous issues. I am referring to the memorandum that we received in the early part of the Session. The introduction says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions: The Social Assistance and Social Security schemes in the Republic of South Africa are applicable to persons of all races, i.e. to White, Indian, and Coloured persons, to Chinese and to the Bantu, and are administered by separate Departments in respect of each of the different races.</block>

<p>I believe the intention is that it should apply to all races, but I also believe that this statement is not completely correct. I am referring particularly to the point raised by the hon. member for Umbilo in regard to clauses 9 and 10 with reference to war veterans&#x2019; pensions for the Bantu. Here is a group of people who twice, when our country has been in need, have come forward voluntarily to give service to their country, and they are not receiving the same recognition as other races. I am referring to the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians, and now also the Chinese. It is interesting to study for a moment the number of people involved in so far as the Bantu are concerned. I am quoting from the South African Year Book No. 5, which deals in fair detail with this particular aspect. Reference is made to the fact&#x2014;and I quote the figures in round thousands&#x2014;that there were 147,000 Whites, 2,000 Colourd labour units and a Native labour contingent of 83,000 serving in the 1914-1918 War. When one considers where this Native labour contingent was employed in the various theatres of activity, one finds that 75,000 of these Natives actually carried out their service outside the Union as it then was. There were, roughly, 25,000 in the European theatre, 17,000 in the Egyptian theatre and 33,000 went to South-West Africa, leaving a very small nucleus of only 8,000 who remained in the Union and carried out their duties here. I have said that these people were in the main non-combatants, but the very fact that they left their home shores subjected them to a certain element of risk I believe that in certain circumstances they risked their lives, and I believe that the time has come when some consideration should be given to seeing that at least they enjoy similar concessions.</p>

<p>In view of your ruling, Sir, I shall say I listened with care to the Minister when he made his Second Reading speech. He referred very briefly to the inclusion of the Chinese and I believe I am in order in referring to that, because it is in the Bill. But he did not give any particular reason why the Chinese were included. I have nothing against the fact that the Chinese should be included, but I wonder whether the Minister can give any reason why it became necessary. According to my information, there are roughly 8,000 Chinese in South Africa and I am sure that the number who actually served in the forces in the two world wars is small. I would be glad if the Minister in his reply would tell us the reason, and also the number and the amount which will be involved in extending these additional facilities.</p>

<p>I should also like to say a few words in connection with clause 9 as far as the Chinese are concerned, and I want to tell the Minister that we really welcome that provision, but I want to support the last speaker as far as the Bantu are concerned. I do not want to elaborate on that, but I just want to tell the Minister that the Bantu whom he fails to mention here are our own people. The second thing I want to tell him is that they assisted us during World War I as well as during World War II and if we are unfortunate enough they will assist us again, and I hope the Minister will not overlook them. But I do not want to go any further than that.</p>

<p>I want to come back to another group of people whom the Minister does in fact mention in clause 9, where he refers to the veterans of World War I. Here I really thought that the Minister would help us in regard to the 10 years&#x2019; restriction, as he told us a year or so ago he contemplated doing. The Minister knows what I am sneaking about. I am speaking about the old veterans who remarried after a period of 10 years, and their widows and children. I do hope that the Minister is going to place that group of people somewhat higher on the list.</p>

<p>The third group of people who also fall under the 1914-1918 veterans are those people who participated in that war and who are still subject to the means test. That war has been over for nearly 50 years. Those people are now getting old and becoming destitute, and I ask the Minister not to overlook them either next year.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Let me begin with the last speaker straight away. I have a great deal of sympathy with the requests made by him in connection with war pensioners and the restriction on the period within which such a pensioner may marry so that his wife and the children born from the marriage may also qualify for benefits. The allocation of the money made available to us by the Treasury takes place on the basis of priorities and this year we have simply been unable to attend to that matter. I would have liked to have done a great deal more if more money had been made available to me, but this year I have been unable to attend to that matter. I have sympathy with his request.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was not my intention to say any more in this regard. Unfortunately I am unable to do away at this stage with the means test which is still applicable to war veterans, but I must point out that most of them have attained the age of 70 years at which age a very relaxed means test is applicable and at which age any personal income is not taken into account at all. I think that most of those war veterans who have any need of a pension do in fact already receive one. In any event, in this case, too, I have been unable to make any concessions this year.</p>

<p>I was asked why the provisions dealing with the concessions in regard to the additional bonus would only come into operation as from 1st October. The hon. member for Umbilo said that with mechanization we could very easily have done so as from 1st April. The hon. member should remember, however, that the authorizing legislation is usually considered by Parliament towards the end of the session only in which case we can only commence payments by July at the very earliest. That means that we cannot simply punch the new amounts on the cards used in the machines. We can do so from that day on but we have to employ clerks to do the work of paying out the arrear amounts, something which is a tremendous task. Normally this means that when we have to pay out arrear social pensions in particular, the staff have to work overtime until 10 o&#x2019;clock or 11 o&#x2019;clock at night for an average of three months in that year and we mainly have to employ women clerks to do that work. It involves enormous problems to have the staff&#x2014;who are already overworked as a result of the manpower shortage and who are already doing a great deal of overtime&#x2014;do that work after hours over a long period of months because one simply cannot do all that work within the normal working hours.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They did in fact get it as from 1st April but it was not paid out immediately. It was only paid out to them after that date and that meant additional work. That is one of the reasons but the most important reason is that if we had given it as <span class="col_7543-7544" refersTo="page_1033"/>from 1st April, that would have doubled the amount for this tax year and I was unable to obtain that amount from the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The question was asked here whether the time had not arrived for a revision in the pension scales for non-Whites. I may just mention that the Departments of Indian Affairs, Coloured Affairs and Bantu Administration are at present conducting a comprehensive investigation into the entire pension system and the social assistance schemes for the various race groups, and the Government has decided not to effect considerable changes until such time as that investigation has been completed.</p>

<p>As regards the question of adducing proof of war service, now also in the case of the war veterans of the Bambata Rebellion, I may tell the hon. member that the following procedure has always been followed in the past. If the person&#x2019;s name appears on the records, there is, of course, no problem. But if his name does not appear on the records he has to submit sworn statements made by two other persons, whose names must appear on the records, to the effect that he did do war service. I realize that this is becoming more and more difficult. I have given instructions to my Department and at the moment they are trying to devise another system. I have given some thought to the idea that it may be possible for a person who claims to be entitled to such a pension to take at least one other person with him to a magistrate and to make a statement before the magistrate. They then have to satisfy the magistrate, on the strength of their statements to him, that he is in fact entitled to such a pension. I have been thinking of something of this nature. However, the Department is still planning what may possibly be done to meet the case of these people.</p>

<p>As far as war veterans&#x2019; pensions are concerned, Bantu are excluded on account of the fact that in 1942 the then government decided that Bantu could not be regarded as war veterans because they did not do war service as defined in the Act; they had to be treated on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. There are many Bantu who in fact do receive a war veteran&#x2019;s pension on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. Because they did not actually do service in fighting units on the battle front they cannot, however, be included in that definition. In reality they themselves did not do any fighting. Consequently one can only treat them on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</p>

<p>No, not really. In any event these are the arguments used in 1942 by the then Minister of Finance and these were the grounds on which he said he could not include Bantu. For that reason Bantu have been treated on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis since that time. There are many of them who receive such pensions. Whenever there is any increase in pensions or benefits the <i>ex gratia</i> award to those Bantu is automatically increased on that same basis. That has been the position since 1942 and I have been informed accordingly. I am not an expert in this field, but I am given to understand that that is in fact the only way in which we can do so.</p>

<heading>REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON STATE-OWNED LAND</heading>

<summary>(In Committee)</summary>

<p>Recommendation No. 9:</p>

<p>The withdrawal in terms of section 9 (2) of the Forest Act, 1941 (Act No. 13 of 1941), as amended, from the list of demarcated forest areas of the Pongola Forest Reserve No. 61 H.U., in extent, 1002 morgen 368 square roods, situate in the District of Paulpietersburg, Province of Natal. (Case No. 9.)</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House shall vote against this item. Our reasons are as follows. Hon. members will see that this particular item deals with 1,002 morgen of land known as the Pongola Forest Reserve, situated in the district of Paulpietersburg. It is inherited State-owned land and was declared a demarcated forest area in 1921. In that year some appropriate authority, with the full knowledge of what they were doing, decided that it was a suitable area to proclaim under the Act as a demarcated forestry area. That was duly done. Since 1921 till the present time that has remained so, i.e. for a period of 46 years. Before the Select Committee we had certain cases where land which is in a demarcated forest area, is being withdrawn, and it is so recommended by the Select Committee. I refer particularly to cases numbers (3) and (6) which we have just passed. There you will notice that a rider was added by the Select Committee in regard to those two areas, which is to the effect that the land should be withdrawn but that it should not be alienated to private interests. In other words the Select Committee felt that it was right and fair that the land should not be alienated to private interests, meaning it is State-owned land&#x2014;although it is demarcated forest area&#x2014;and that it must remain State-owned land. The Select Committee was concerned that the land should not pass out of the ownership of the State into private interests. Here is the point on which I want to dwell for a moment or two with your approval. The world over, never mind in South Africa, country after country with their population explosion find that they have inadequate land for places of public resort, public recreation and public use of all kinds. We in the Select Committee are continually getting applications brought before us for the alienation of land for specific purposes associated with school sites, church sites and other public purposes. Each case is dealt with on its merits. The point I wish to make is this. There is continual pressure to take State-owned land for various purposes. Once it has been taken and it has been withdrawn from its status as State-owned land, it is gone and it is gone for keeps. We on this side of the House wish to emphasize the necessity of the State maintaining ownership of blocks of land which are State-owned. In the papers before us in regard to case No. 9, which is the particular case I am dealing with now, a point is made that the land is no longer suitable for forestry purposes It must have been felt to be suitable in 1921 when it was demarcated. But in the process of time and for whatever reason it may be, the competent authorities and the Department of Forestry say that it is no longer suitable. But now, Sir, here is the point. The appropriate official from the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure who appeared before the committee in dealing with this particular matter was questioned in regard to the papers before us which are not before the House. Those papers were before the Select Committee. You see here before you merely the recommendation of the Select Committee. Now, what did the papers before the Select Committee have to say. It said <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Agricultural Technical Services does not require the retention of the land as a water catchment area but has recommended that if it is disposed of to one or more of the adjoining farmers who are interested in its acquisition &#x2026;</block>

<p>Now, on questioning we elicited the fact that if the adjoining farmers had not asked for that land, the Department of Forestry would not have gone about having it withdrawn from demarcation as a forest area. The whole idea of getting it released was triggered off by the fact that adjacent farmers asked for its release. Private interests wanted it released. That is the evidence that was given before the Select Committee by the appropriate official. But there is more to it than that. In case after case where the point was put, the reply was given that the normal procedure, the ordinary way of dealing with such lands, is for the department concerned to say to other Government departments: &#x201C;We are considering releasing this land. It will go to the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure for disposal in terms of the law. But before doing that, do you as a State Department require this land for any purpose&#x003F;&#x201D; Inquiry is then made. That is the normal procedure according to our information. And amongst others they go to the four Administrators and ask them whether they require this land for their provincial government purposes. In this particular matter I want to emphasize that it is the 1,002 morgen that are concerned. This is no little piece of a corner of land. It is nearly 2,000 acres, and it is 2,000 acres of very nice land indeed, although it is a bit broken. It is land eminently suitable as a place of public resort. <span class="col_7547-7548" refersTo="page_1035"/>not with a big town on the doorstep to-day, but who knows what the development for Paulpietersburg will be in the next decades, never mind 20 or 30 years. But what is 10 or 30 years in the life of a nation&#x003F; Why should we give away 2,000 acres of land to private people alongside that area who indicated that they would like to buy pieces of land and add them to their farms, and the Department forthwith comes to Parliament and asks for this land being released&#x003F; This land is situated in an area in respect of which I have no hesitation in saying&#x2014;no hesitation whatever&#x2014;that the people of poor Paulpietersburg in that area can look forward to a tremendous development in the years that lie ahead and where this type of land will be worth its weight in gold in the years to come. And our children who come after us will wonder what their forefathers were thinking of to allow land of that kind, of that character, to be alienated and handed over to private ownership. This is what we are against. We stand for the maintenance of the ownership, the public ownership of such lands. And in the case of this particular land we are told that the normal procedure was not followed. I can only go on the evidence. We were told that they did not offer this land to the other State Departments, that they did not offer it to the Administrators. We have in one of the cases before us here, a case where the land was so offered and where in fact in my own province the Administrator indicated that he would like a certain piece of land, a much smaller piece than this one. One of these cases is here in the papers before us. He indicated that he would like it as a place of public resort where the public could be allowed to go and enjoy themselves&#x2014;a place of public resort as defined in the Ordinance. But that was not the case. In this case you have nearly 2,000 acres of land. The normal procedure of offering it to State Departments was not followed. In this particular case it is also quite clear that the instigator, certainly the person who activated this particular transaction initially, was a-private person who frankly says, that he wants to buy that piece of land. It is set out in the papers that came before this Select Comittee. And we feel that it is completely and utterly wrong, that the principle is quite wrong, and that the departure from normal, procedure was wrong because it was not followed in the case of this land.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast has been serving on the Select Committee on State-owned Land for many years. This is not the first time something like this has happened and this is a task which is normally performed by the Department concerned. Indeed, the Department is the proper channel through which this task is to be performed. The withdrawal of land is not a task of Parliament. However much we appreciate the hon. member&#x2019;s information and knowledge of State-owned land and his attitude towards this question, he can at times, like now in this case, be extremely difficult. The hon. member knows how many times this very same principle has been affected&#x2014;time after time, year after year. What is the position here&#x003F; Here it is a case of inherited State-owned land. The State inherited this land. Now one is faced with the position that the Department of Forestry found that this land could not be afforested effectively unless that was done at an extremely high cost. Now what is the position of the Department of Forestry&#x003F; The task of this Department is threefold. In the first place it has to afforest areas, in the second place it has to conserve the areas as catchment areas, and in the third place it has to protect such areas from encroaching sand. In this case the Department has reported that this land has to be protected and conserved at a very high cost without the Department ever being able to afforest it productively. It will only be possible to afforest this land at an extremely high cost and even then it will not be possible to do so economically. Now the normal procedure laid down by this House in legislation is being followed and that is that the State may advertise the land for settlement purposes by employing the usual procedure. However, in terms of a subsequent Act passed by this Parliament, State-owned land may also be used for supplementing and consolidating uneconomic holdings in order to make them economic ones. Now what has happened in this case&#x003F; What did the hon. member suggest&#x003F; He suggested the ordinary procedure followed in cities and towns. If there is any State-owned land in cities and towns it is the procedure to offer that land to other Departments first. That is both essential and urgent. But here we have thousands of morgen of land which, according to the. Department of Forestry, it has to look after at a high cost but which it cannot afforest. That land is not suitable for the purpose for which it has been set aside.</p>

<p>Now what did the hon. member for South Coast suggest&#x003F; He suggested that it should be offered to the Departments. What Department will be able to use it profitably&#x003F; To my mind only a provincial council may be able to make use of that land. The only purpose, according to the statements with which we have been furnished, for which it can be used, is probably grazing. In other words, a game reserve, or something of that nature, will have to be established there. The hon. member suggested that that land should be offered to the other Departments first. To which Department&#x003F; To the provincial administration&#x003F; Other Departments cannot be interested in that land. The procedure which has been followed throughout the years is to leave the question of the advantageous disposal of land to the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Surely the hon. member does not want that State-owned land, seeing that there is such a tremendous land hunger in South Africa, to lie idle, something which is uneconomic and costly. I think that is a crime against the South African nation. We must follow the procedure <span class="col_7549-7550" refersTo="page_1036"/>laid down in legislation by this Parliament. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure can either use that land as settlement land or consolidate it with an adjoining land or land situated nearby so that it may be used to the advantage of the country as a whole. The hon. member, however, suggested that this land should still be used for impracticable purposes for a long time in the future. To my mind the agricultural sector is entitled to the land being made available. This land which is being used so impractically at present, must be made available according to the procedure laid down in legislation and in the spirit of that legislation. Mr. Chairman, surely you cannot expect the provincial council or the State taking the only other step which is allowed, namely to afforest the land in competition with the ordinary private owner of forests&#x2014;something which will have to be done by the Department of Forestry. That is a long-term policy. Just as the State will not open a large shop in Adderley Street in competition with private undertakings, similarly the State cannot be allowed to compete with private initiative by starting a farm on that land. What farming activities can be conducted on this 1,000 morgen of land&#x003F; The provincial council may establish a game reserve there. Now we ask ourselves, &#x201C;Does Natal not have a sufficient number of reserves&#x003F;&#x201D; Reserves are dotted all over that province. You will not allow me to speak on that subject, but I think that the time has arrived for Natal to take a look at its game reserves and consolidate them. Natal must not be allowed to establish another game reserve of 1,000 morgen. That will be situated away from the other reserves. How can any Department make efficient use of this land&#x003F; There is no alternative; one must either allow the land to lie idle which is uneconomic and impracticable or one must allow the land to be transferred to a Department by means of the machinery created by this Parliament. The Department may then form an opinion and dispose of the land in terms of the resolution of the Select Committee.</p>

<p>&#x2026; then there is no objection to it being disposed of. But the point is: How must it be disposed of&#x003F; The hon. member suggests that it should be offered to the other state departments. If there are other state departments which can make good use of it then we should allocate it to them. That is the main point. The hon. member for Christiana does not seem to like the idea that it should go to the Parks Board. [Interjections.] He does not like the idea. [Interjections.] No.6 is allocated to the Parks Board and it is only 200 morgen. If that is suitable, why cannot we allocate, for instance, 1,000 morgen to the Parks Board&#x003F; It can go to them and it can be usefully preserved for posterity in our country. We have also changed what we used to do in the past by adding certain provisos, something we never did in the past. Case No. 6 has the proviso that the land must not be alienated to private interests. We are adopting that attitude&#x2014;State land should not easily be allocated to private interests.</p>

<p>What also worries me is the way in which we are going to dispose of this land. Here is a piece of land 1,000 morgen in extent, and according to the report by the Department it is not an economic unit, and therefore it cannot be allocated or sold to a farmer to farm on&#x2014; it is too small. It will then, under the circumstances, go to one or two of the neighbouring farmers. Once we have released the ground, the only people who can compete for it are the neighbouring farmers.</p>

If parks have to be established in the public interest, certain parts of that land will be made available for <span class="col_7551-7552" refersTo="page_1037"/>the establishment of parks which will then be under provincial control or under the control of the Parks Board, although more specifically under provincial control. It will be possible to keep game in those parks. Land will be given for recreational facilities. But where we have land which is suitable for agricultural purposes we are not going to ask every Government Department whether it wants to erect a building or establish a park on that land. Surely that is obvious. This land, 1,000 morgen in extent, was under the control of the Department of Forestry. It is situated a long way from any other forestry complex. The fact of the matter is that this land is uneconomic for forestry purposes because it is situated a great distance from any existing forestry complex and because it is unsuitable for afforestation. A very small percentage of that land is suitable for afforestation. The fact of the matter is that that land is not required for soil conservation purposes in order to protect sponge areas. The Department who has to exercise control over this land must see to it that such State-owned land is not misused. I do not know whether hon. members are aware of this fact but there are large areas in our country where Forestry has to exercise control over land but where control cannot be exercised in such a way as to prevent people from all over entering and using that land. And this is one of the places where one cannot exercise such control. What now happens is the following: Forestry states that the land is not suitable for forestry purposes; Agricultural Technical Services states that it does not need that land for sponge or water conservation. The land then reverts to Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. If the Government wants to give away all the land it has purchased or which it owns all over the country to local authorities or divisional councils to establish national parks or game reserves or fauna and flora reserves, they will take all that land whether or not they are able to exercise control over it. Not one of them will be prepared to buy that land from the State. Now this Department states: Because this land is unsuitable for those purposes, we want to deal with that land as though it is ordinary State-owned land which we have at our disposal. A great deal of the land in the Northern Transvaal on which farming activities are being carried on at present was State-owned land at some time.</p>

<p>This land is going to be allotted under the Act, and hon. members must not think that if there are two farmers whose land borders on that land that they can be the only applicants for that land and that they may buy it if they make offers for that land. After all, we have passed legislation in this Parliament to prescribe how land is to be disposed of. That Act provides that land may only be allotted in order to make a unit an economic one. After an investigation has been conducted by the Board and the Board has certified that the applicant does not have an economic unit, he qualifies for that land, but if he has an economic unit he does not qualify for that land.</p>

<p>The Department may also sell the land by public tender but that is not the intention. The provisions of the Act will be complied with. As I have already said, if there are neighbouring owners who do not have economic units the Board will conduct an investigation and will recommend whether they ought to get a part of that land so as to make their units economic ones. If in the case of every piece of State-owned land which becomes available we want to force the Department of Agricultural Credit, in whatever way &#x2014;in this way or in any other way&#x2014;to consult all the provincial administrations and local authorities first in order to ascertain whether they are interested, I can tell hon. members even now that what will happen will be the following: If they can get the land for nothing, they will all be interested. The Provincial Administration of the Free State will be prepared to take everything which one wants to give away and this also applies to the Cape Province and to the Transvaal. No, Sir, I think the hon. member for Christiana gave a very clear explanation of this matter. Since the land is not suitable for forestry purposes and can only be used for agricultural purposes to some extent, and since it is situated at a place where one can only use it as a game reserve or a flora reserve over which it will be difficult <span class="col_7553-7554" refersTo="page_1038"/>to exercise control, it is better to allot this land to adjoining owners or to others in that vicinity so as to place them on an economic basis once more.</p>

<p>Schedule No. 1:</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer to Item 117.05 on page 20, which we have already discussed on two occasions in this House. I am afraid that the hon. the Deputy Minister has not proved to us the correctness of his case in this matter and we are as unconvinced as ever that this is an equitable tax. Nor are we at all convinced by the arguments of the hon. member for Queenstown. This attitude which hon. members opposite take from time to time of working out additional taxation and dividing it by years or months or weeks and saying that the taxpayer will only have to pay an extra R2 per annum or R1 a month or 5 cents a week does not impress us. What are the facts of the matter&#x003F; If you take the tax on motor-cars as applied last year and as increased this year, it means that the motorcar users this year will be paying in additional tax R12 million more than they paid two years ago. I think the hon. member for Queenstown will agree with me that R12 million out of the Dockets of a sector of the community can hardly be airily disregarded. It is no use saying that we only have to use our old cars for 2&#x00BD; months longer. The position at the moment is that most of us are using our cars until they fall to pieces, anyway. Therefore I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit tariff item 117.05.</block>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to make much further response to what the hon. member for Parktown said. However, supposing that everything he said is true, the fact still remains that when the Estimates were prepared a certain amount of tax had to be found, and if one could not find the R12 million in taxes here, one would have had to find it somewhere else. What his motion actually signifies is that he does not want a tax on cars, but he wants the taxpayers of the country to be taxed somewhere else. Even if his argument were correct to a certain degree, it still remains my point of view and that of the Government that it was a question of a choice for the Minister, and he preferred to impose it here where he thought it constituted the lightest burden on the country and on the people and not, as the hon. member is suggesting, somewhere else where it would impose a heavier burden on our people. That is the only explanation I can give.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The argument which the hon. member for Queenstown has just advanced for this taxation is quite unacceptable. In fact, he admits that motorists have been selected as the deliberate target for taxation. That is what it amounts to. He says even if <span class="col_7555-7556" refersTo="page_1039"/>all our arguments are right it makes no difference because the Minister has deliberately and by specific choice singled out the motorist as a target for additional taxation, and he makes no attempt to refute our arguments. Our point is that the motorist is continually being singled out for taxation. He, in the case of easily applicable selective taxes, is the target against whom discrimination is always being applied when it comes to taxation. We felt that this discrimination has now gone far enough and that we cannot support it any longer. If there was ever justification for our case, it is the argument which we have just heard. The hon. the Minister himself, without saying it as blatantly as the hon. member for Queenstown said, implied that if he did not get the money here, he would have to get it somewhere else. It was an implied discrimination against the motorist, but the hon. member for Queenstown has now made it clear beyond any doubt what this is. It is a punitive tax on motorists and we are opposed to it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out one thing to the hon. member for Queenstown. I want to refer to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s Budget speech for this year, where he disclosed to the House that he had surpluses. It is not a question of needing this money. The fiscus does not need the money. They had a surplus last year. What have they done with it&#x003F; This is what the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To use the surpluses which have been built up in the current financial year for expenditure in the next financial year would be inflationary under present conditions. For the present it is therefore my intention to sterilize these surpluses.</block>

<p>He does not need the funds. He has decided to make an attack on the poor innocent motorist year after year, burdening him with additional taxation. Hon. members opposite and the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot make out a case for this additional taxation. Therefore, in the interests of the public, we must support this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members are objecting a great deal to the extra R6 million which is being levied by way of taxation this year. After all, they must do something before we adjourn, because so far this is the only little thing they have found to talk about this year. Other than that they have nothing. [Interjections.] I want to ask the hon. member for Parktown a question in respect of the abolition of this motor-car tax of R6 million. The hon. member knows that when the Minister of Finance introduced his Estimates this year, he announced certain concessions. For instance, there is the relief granted in respect of students. There are quite a number of cases of relief. Taken together they amount to R6 million.</p>

<p>I abide by your ruling, Sir. In respect of this tax on motorcars, I want to say that the motor-car industry in South Africa is able to bear this tax. We find that there is a record sale of motor-cars. The first thing that happens when prices are too high, is that sales decline. One does not pay an absurd price for an item if one does not consider it to have that value. Is that not proof of the fact that the price of motor-cars is still too low&#x003F; It is proved by the fact that the public still buys at this high price. If this tax had been R12 million instead of R6 million, it would still have been the same. We must impose our taxes in quarters where the public is able to bear them. That is why I say that this tax is not too high. It is just. In spite of the fact that, where possible, the Government does not want to increase taxes, certain services must be provided. This tax can cover those services.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, consequent upon speeches made about this matter, I explained last night that this tax is only a full tax in respect of people who do not buy motor-cars for essential purposes. It is in actual fact an effective tax only in respect of 60 percent thereof. It is in respect of those persons; who purchase motor-cars, and use them in connection with earning income. Across the floor of the House the hon. member for Parktown and I agreed on that matter to such a great extent that I thought that he would be sensible enough to abandon this amendment of his. <span class="col_7557-7558" refersTo="page_1040"/>Unfortunately he did not, and as the hon. member will also appreciate, it is not possible for me to accept that amendment.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we objected at the Second Reading and we object again now to the new tax imposed on Bantu beer. [Interjections.] The hon. member is quite correct. It is made from kaffir corn. We do so for three specific reasons. The first is health. It is accepted by all medical authorities that Bantu beer is a health-giving drink and that it contains vitamins and is essential for good health and in fact plays a part in counteracting malnutrition. It is one of the major problems in South Africa to ensure that all our people are properly nourished and that their health is properly cared for. Therefore we object to taxation on an item which is essential for the health of a large section of the people. We object secondly because this taxation is once again discriminatory. [Interjections.] We do not want it applied to the smaller quantities and to institutions with under 25 employees. It indicates that this is purely a fund-raising tax. It is a tax which by taking money away from the municipalities and the employers is obviously going to lead to an increase in price and therefore the passing on of this increase to the consumer. Thirdly we believe that this is wrong because it is in conflict with the pattern which the Government itself pretends to follow of encouraging the drinking of the less alcoholic drinks. Spirits which are harmful and habit forming to a greater extent than Bantu beer are encouraged by taxation on ordinary beer, Bantu beer and unfortified wines. Therefore we feel that it is our duty on this side of the House to lodge our objection to this tax and to move its deletion. This I do by moving&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to address the Committee on this iniquitous tax which has been imposed. As the hon. member for Durban (Point) has said, the consumption of this beverage has been encouraged by the Government because not only is it something traditional to the Bantu but it is also a health-giving drink. During 1964 we found that the consumption of this beverage exceeded that of all other intoxicating liquors in South Africa by over 30 million gallons. Other liquor was available to them, but notwithstanding that, the Bantu people still consumed over 30 million gallons more. This was because of the reasons given by the hon. member for Durban (Point). As regards the health aspect of this beverage, I particularly want to mention that this beverage has a very high content of vitamin B1 and a very high content of niacin which combats pellagra which is a deficiency disease. Nutrition experts throughout the world have encouraged the consumption hereof.</p>

From the profit derived from the production of this beer, R64 million was spent on the provision of amenities, on subsidized housing, and so on, for the Bantu people in the urban areas. The effect of this taxation will be that R2.6 million will this year be removed from the coffers of the urban authorities, and the Bantu people will suffer to the extent of R2.6 million during this year.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to help the hon. Opposition in their fight, otherwise they will eventually find themselves in the same position as Egypt. I just want to say something in order to eliminate uncertainty in regard to the item to which the hon. member for Durban (Point) referred. Under the sub-head &#x201C;Item&#x201D; of Schedule No. 6&#x2014;on page 44 of the Bill&#x2014; one finds the figure 609.04.10. If that whole item is deleted it will mean that a duty of 61&#x00BD; cents per gallon will in actual fact be imposed upon Bantu beer. Provision is being made here for a rebate, namely in subsection (1) in which provision is being made for the full rabate less 2 cents. In other words, this is the 2 cents that remains after the rebate of 61&#x00BD; cents less 2 cents has been deducted. Therefore, that amount of 2 cents is the duty on Bantu beer. In other words, if the hon. member wants to propose that there should be no duty on Bantu beer, he should merely move that subsection (1) be deleted.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take up the time of the House unnecessarily by giving a long explanation of the provisions of this measure. The main object of the Bill is to give effect to the taxation proposals relating to income-tax, non-resident shareholders&#x2019; tax and non-residents&#x2019; tax on interest. It also amends the Income Tax Act in order to provide for the concessions announced in the Budget Speech, including the leveling of scales for farmers in respect of taxable income derived from farming.</p>

<p>In essence there is little difference between this Bill and the Bill that was published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 10th May, 1967, for general information and for comment. Very little comment has been received and from that I infer that no real objection to any of the provisions of the measure could be found.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that the Bill before the House consists of 36 clauses and the Schedule, while the gazetted Bill contained only 28 clauses and the Schedule. Seven of the eight clauses that have been added are of a consequential or textual nature, while one, namely clause 19, effects an amendment in respect of the exemptions from the undistributed profits tax in order to remove an anomaly which came to light.</p>

<p>As a result of the insertion of the new clauses the numbers of the existing provisions had to be changed, and therefore the numbers of some of the provisions of the Bill differ from those of the gazetted Bill. For the convenience of hon. members the numbers as they appeared in the gazetted Bill are indicated in the explanatory memorandum on the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the provisions of the Bill are self-explanatory and, in addition, are explained in the said memorandum.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has indicated in the course of his remarks that new principles have been introduced in the course of the drafting of this Bill, particularly with regard to the tax on interest in the case of non-resident investors. My attention has been drawn to certain anomalies in this connection. <span class="col_7563-7564" refersTo="page_1043"/>In the brief time available it has not been possible to get information from all parties concerned but there is some foundation for the remarks which have been made to me, which briefly are as follows:</p>

<p>Many importers and exporters in South Africa make use of overseas Acceptance Credits, the majority of which are handled by London merchant bankers. The procedure in relation to an Acceptance Credit to cover imports is normally that the importer arranges for a London bank to pay for the goods being imported by him and when the transaction takes place, draws a bill on the merchant bank which is accepted by the merchant banker and discounted on the London Bill Market. The proceeds of the discount are utilized by the merchant banker to reimburse himself for the amount paid for imports. When the bill falls due for payment the importer remits funds to meet the amount due on maturity. There are two charges levied on the importer. The first is a commission charged by the London banker for his acceptance of the bill, which makes the bill discountable. The second charge is the discount which the purchaser of the bill charges for his services in holding the bill, from the date of discount to the date of maturity. In dealing with exports a similar procedure is followed, except that the exporter draws a bill on the oversea merchant bank and receives immediately cash less the merchant banker&#x2019;s accepting commission and the discount charge, the merchant banker in this case being reimbursed by the receipt of the proceeds of the goods exported directly from the buyer.</p>

<p>In the proposed section 64C (e), the more common form of financing imports is exempt, but in the case of oversea Acceptance Credits there is no bill of exchange handled by Republic banking institutions and, therefore, the transactions would not be exempt in terms of this section. From the very nature of an Acceptance Credit, the local user of such credit has no connection with the recipient of the discounting charges. Merchant bankers operating overseas would not be in a position to pass on to any non-resident shareholder the interest tax deducted since they deal with a very large number of bills, very few of which originate from South African accounts, and such bills change hands in the London market. I submit that this is an aspect which has not been taken into account. This interest tax on non-resident investors is a new principle imported into this Bill&#x2014;it is the first time that it is applied in this country; there has in the past been a non-resident shareholder&#x2019;s tax, but not a tax on the interest of non-residents. I do not quarrel with the principle of an interest tax on non-residents, because that principle is applied in many countries, but this is a particular aspect which I suggest has not been given adequate consideration.</p>

<p>During the course of the discussions in the Committee of Ways and Means we discussed the rates of tax and the scale of taxation and the Minister will see from the Bill he has introduced that clause 1 re-enacts section 5 (2) of the original Act. the 1962 Act, which was a consolidating Act. That Act has a Schedule attached to it, and this Act which we are now discussing re-enacts the Schedule. That Schedule shows a rate of taxation in respect of different income brackets, and depending on the person&#x2019;s income so is his rate of tax fixed. During the course of the Second Reading we referred the Minister to the advisability of eliminating the bulge in respect of the income tax brackets from R4,600 up to R8,000. We reiterate our protest and the necessity for the Minister&#x2019;s looking into it. I would remind the Minister that arguments have been used suggesting that South Africa&#x2019;s taxation is lower than many other countries, but I would remind the Minister that the income tax charged in the case of a married man with two children in South Africa in the bracket R6,000 and over is higher than in France. In the bracket R8,000 and over, the income-tax paid by a married man with two children is higher than in France and Germany, and in the bracket R11,000 it is higher than in France, Germany and the U.S.A. I suggest that there was some substance in the recommendation made by Mr. J. A. Kotze, the chairman of the Pretoria Afrikaanse Sakekamer, when he said that the Government should appoint a commission of inquiry to bring the income-tax structure up to date and to remove the anomalies contained therein. I do not necessarily agree with all his recommendations, but the object of the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s taxing machine is not only to collect revenue to meet the expenditure of the State. The object of his taxation proposals is also to endeavour to ensure that the incentive attitude is maintained and that there will be an incentive on the part of all taxpayers.</p>

<p>While the State is entitled to get its share of the tax there should be some incentive particularly in the professional classes and the higher income brackets for them to continue increasing their income. He gives various examples, but as I say, I do not necessarily agree with the brackets he suggests and I would not submit any alternative brackets because you cannot submit an alternative bracket unless you know the effect of that alternative. The Minister has had a motion before this House whereby the expenditure of the country has been put before the country, and therefore it is the duty of the Minister to raise sufficient by way of taxes to discharge that expenditure. What we are concerned with is the rates of tax which the Minister claims will discharge the indebtedness, and we urge the Minister to give consideration to varying those rates so that while he can get the same amount of income, he will distribute that tax in such a way as to put a more equitable burden on the taxpayers which they can share as a whole. I would draw his attention to one or more anomalies.</p>

<p>One anomaly is the case of the professional man or the private individual who is taxed whereas a company is allowed to go free. If <span class="col_7565-7566" refersTo="page_1044"/>the Minister will refer to clause 11 of the Bill, it makes provision for deductions for income-tax purposes for donations to universities. Clause 11 re-enacts the provision for deductions which was made in former years where a business firm was encouraged to make donations to educational institutions. The Minister said that the whole object of that was to encourage companies to support our educational institutions, to encourage research and to increase our productivity. I submit that if that is a good principle, and the Minister says it is, then consideration should be given to granting a similar facility to the professional man. Doctors, engineers, accountants and architects are frequently called upon by the various universities in South Africa to make donations to the various faculties, particularly those faculties concerned with their own profession. It means that if they give donations they get no rebate, but if on the other hand they are associated with companies, they can make those donations because companies get the advantage of the rebate in terms of clause 11 of this Bill. I submit that the Minister should give careful consideration to the advisability of extending this right to professional people or to any individual who intends to give a donation to a university for educational or research purposes.</p>

<p>Then there is another class of person to which I would refer. That is the divorc&#x00E9;e. I have an article here which says that since 1962 the distinction seems quite arbitrary and there is no apparent reason why it should be maintained. I know it is not public policy to encourage divorce, but there are many cases where a wife is in a position where she may be the innocent party. She has children to bring up and yet she is taxed as a single person and not as a married person. In the first place, this article says there is an inexplicable difference in the rate of taxation for a widow and for a divorc&#x00E9;e. For tax purposes the widow is still regarded as a married person, whereas a divorced woman is considered to be single and pays a higher rate of tax. Furthermore, the lowest taxable incomes differ. The widow&#x2019;s income is free of tax up to R800. but that of the divorc&#x00E9;e only up to about R500. Owing to the different primary rebates this means that in effect a widow earning up to R870 is free of tax. but a divorced woman must pay tax after she earns over R580. This represents a considerable burden on the divorc&#x00E9;e. In law a divorce ends marriage as effectively as death. I submit that this is an anomaly in the Act. This was a matter which was recognized in 1962 and it was changed by the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor. and I submit that this matter warrants inquiry.</p>

<p>I suggest that, while we can point out anomalies during the course of the Budget debate, where the time is limited, and while we can also do so in ways and means, when it comes to a question of taxation as a whole and general improvements on the Act, time in Parliament is very limited and the debating rules of the House are so circumscribed that one cannot go into detail during the course of the Session. I submit that the time has arrived, having regard to the fact that it is nearly 20 years since the last commission of inquiry was held, that the Minister should give serious consideration to ironing out some of these anomalies and appoint a commission of inquiry to go into the whole question of taxation with a view to seeing that many of the anomalies are eliminated, and that the incidence of tax is more equitably borne by the taxpayers as a whole. It should also be ensured that, while the Minister may be required to get the total amount of tax in order to meet the expenditure of the country, taxation is distributed on a more equitable basis, so as to ensure that the anomalies which I have suggested are given consideration, and also to ensure that the incentive aspects are maintained in the interest of productivity and of the country as a whole.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>We have a new Income Tax Bill each year. I want to agree with the hon. member for Pinetown that each year, instead of the Income Tax Bill removing some of the anomalies we find in the Act, they seem to be increased. This year, in terms of clause 20, we are taxing overseas loans, where interest is paid to an overseas creditor, whether the agreement for the loan is concluded in the Republic or not. There used to be a time&#x2014; probably some people will maintain that it is still the case&#x2014;when the principle of taxation in this country was the source of the income. We were not concerned with domicile, whether a person lived here or not. We were concerned with his income, where the source of the income was from the Republic of South Africa. We have moved away from that position from time to time, because circumstances have arisen where people were evading tax, for example by the registration of overseas companies, to reap the benefit of dividends from outside the country, and the investment abroad in certain types of financial institutions. Here we have a change of the fundamental principle in that source is no longer the basis on which to decide whether a person should be taxed or not. This is an anomaly which I think should be given some consideration.</p>

<p>There also is a question of medical allowances which is dealt with in clause 15. We are grateful to see that the allowance in respect of families who have children, has been increased from R200 to R300 for that year. I think there are two problems that should be considered in regard to this allowance. The first is whether it should not be a rebate instead of being an allowance. Because what is happening now, is that a person with a large income can deduct R200 from his income and in some cases, if we include the levy, save himself some 72 per cent, I think the figure is to-day, of that R200, whereas a person in the lower income group will save practically nothing. If it were a rebate the same amount would be deducted from tax in either case. <span class="col_7567-7568" refersTo="page_1045"/>That I think again is an anomaly. But further; in terms of clause 28 of this Bill we have introduced a new principle into our taxation this year, namely the principle of averaging. The farming community is now able to average its income over a period of five years for tax purposes. I asked last year that the hon. the Minister give consideration to at least averaging the allowance in regard to medical expenditure, because a person may incur an expenditure of only R10. R20 or R30 in one particular year, and in the following year, on account of ill fortune, have to incur expenditure of R400, R500, or R600. But he is limited to an allowance of R200. It seems to me that surely the average person is entitled to at least the same consideration as our estimable farmers, who can average their income and their taxation. In regard to this item of medical expenditure, it should first of all be a rebate and should, secondly, be able to be carried forward, for a period of years. If it remains as an allowance, it should be capable of being averaged.</p>

<p>Clause I of the Bill brings about a change in company taxation, and here again is an anomaly that we have not been able to get over for a long time. The hon. member for Pinetown dealt with it in brief. We used to have the apportionment system. We know that it did not function. But I think we also realize that the system as it is at the moment, where a company pays a flat rate of tax which amounts to 40 per cent including the levy, and other people pay a graduated scale of tax. there are anomalies which are unfair to a great number of people.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree that we should find a formula, so that everybody would be satisfied, and so that the imposition of the tax would be fair. I think we all want that. In the past the difficulty has been to find a formula. There are other aspects in terms of the Act which are giving us trouble. For example, we have had discussions in this House on many occasions on the question of the taxation of the married woman. The principle was accepted, I think about two years ago, that where a woman has an income, there can be some alleviation in taxation on the joint income. The trouble, of course, is that this new rule helps the alleviation to such a limited extent that only in two brackets of income is the allowance, or the saving in tax of any material value. In one case it may be R130 and in the other R240. In the case of a joint income of R9,000 &#x2026;</p>

<p>One finds the peculiar situation when there is a joint income of R9,000 and, although the taxes have now been joined together to assist married people, the saving is R9 per annum.</p>

<p>There are many other aspects which give the same problem. The hon. member for Pinetown suggested that the time has come perhaps for the Government to consider a commission. I want to bring to the notice of the House that in Canada the Royal Canadian Commission was appointed 44 years ago to inquire into income tax. It took them 4 years to investigate the problem. They spent $44 million and they produced six volumes, running into some 2,600 pages. I was fortunate enough, through the courtesy of the Canadian Embassy, to obtain a summary of Press releases dealing with this matter. It runs to some 200 pages. An enormous amount of time, money and attention has been spent, and we could make very good use of it. I think the time has come when one reads this report, for it is to become quite clear that our system wants some investigation. This commission, as a matter of interest, suggests that the present system of taxation be scrapped entirely, because it is not equitable. It is a system inherited, starting from the mother of parliaments, Great Britain, and adopted by the colonies and dominions. It has spread out and we have just taken the basis for granted. They suggest a system which is simplicity in itself, till one starts to examine it in detail. One takes a man&#x2019;s capital at the beginning of a period. Then one takes his capital at the end of the period. What is spent on himself is added on and he is taxed on the difference, because that is the increase of his wealth. It does not matter whether it comes from gambling, donations, gifts, legacies, capital profits of anything else. And it has merit I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give some consideration in the not too distant future to create an opportunity to enable us to examine all these factors of taxation which appear in this Bill every year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>To start with I think I should deal with nonresident tax on interest and in that connection I think I owe a reply to the hon. member for Parktown about a matter which he raised in <span class="col_7569-7570" refersTo="page_1046"/>the Committee of Ways and Means and which I did not reply to properly. As I explained at that time, it is a very difficult subject to discuss across the floor of the House because it is very involved and not so easy to follow. The hon. member then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is another problem which might arise in regard to which the hon. the Minister might be able to guide us. If a person who has investments in South Africa suffers an overall tax loss for the year, he will nevertheless still pay the 10 per cent on any interest that he earns in this country.</block>

<p>I did not at that time reply to the hon. member, and I would like to do it now. Firstly, the hon. member refers to investments. As I understand it an investment could really only be either in shares, or an investment of money for interest. If it is either of the two, or both, then one could hardly expect a tax loss, because you receive your interest or you do not receive your interest. And if you invest your money in shares, the least that you can get is nothing. In other words, how one can arrive at a tax loss when you have investments, I do not see. However, there is the possibility that a non-resident who live in England, for instance, may have a business in this country. Now, if it is a business run by a company, which is his company, then the company is taxed separately, so that it would not affect him either. This would only come about if he has a business in this country in his own name, in the same name that earns the interest. And although it is theoretically possible &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is the possibility of farming. That is why I say that although it is theoretically possible, I think it is highly unlikely. I think the hon. member will probably agree with me. As regards the non-residents&#x2019; tax I would also like to give hon. members the following information because very evidently they are interested. Two-thirds of the 20 countries which were members of the Organization for European Economic Co-operation in 1963 tax interest arising in their territories in favour of non-residents. Certain countries do not allow the deduction of interest in the determination of the debtor&#x2019;s taxable income unless the recipient of the interest also resides in the country and is taxable in that country. In its draft or model convention for the avoidance of double taxation the organization has adopted the principle that the country in which interest payable to non-residents arises, should be entitled to tax such interest, but the tax must not exceed 10 per cent of the amount of the interest. The country in which the recipient resides may also tax the interest and double taxation is in practice avoided by the country of residence agreeing either not to tax the interest or to allow the tax of the other country as a credit against its own tax. Apart from double taxation avoidance agreements, the tax laws of a number of the countries which tax their residents on all their income irrespective of the source of such income, provide for credits to be allowed in respect of foreign taxes.</p>

<p>*I do not think it is necessary to say any more about the question of non-residents&#x2019; tax on interest. I think I should rather continue and discuss the request which came from hon. members on that side that a commission on income tax be established. Hon. members will know that this matter &#x2026;</p>

The information I have on this matter, that is on acceptance credits, is that this matter has been investigated and as presently informed the Department holds the view that liabilities for the new tax will not arise, but if tax should arise, it does not represent an anomaly. I would now like to discuss the matter of the commission asked for.</p>

<p>*The hon. gentlemen asked once again that a commission be appointed, as they had asked on previous occasions. We will recall that previously, only last year, the matter was also raised and on that occasion the then Minister of Finance replied to it, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not prepared to think of appointing another commission to inquire into it. That is not necessary. We have acquired quite a lot of knowledge in the course of the year that this Department has administered the Act.</block>

<p>I should also like to point out to the hon. members that the Steyn Commission carried out a very searching inquiry into the scope and the functioning of the Republic&#x2019;s laws on income tax, with the exception of the tax payable by the gold mines. That was not investigated by the commission.</p>

<p>The findings of the Steyn Commission were in any event further investigated. The committee commenced its activities in March, 1949, and concluded on 12th November, 1952, when it brought out its second and final report. The recommendations in the committee&#x2019;s two comprehensive reports which appeared, were considered by the Income Tax Commission in 1953. Most of the recommendations which were not rejected by the Commission were incorporated in the Income Tax Act. Apart from those, other very important amendments have since been made to the Income Tax Act. I am thinking, for example, of the abolition of super tax, the introduction of the block rate, the concessions to industrialists and hotel owners, the pay-as-you-earn system, the system of averaging which has now been introduced. In fact, the position is that in the nature of matters the Income Tax Act is receiving constant attention. I think we may justly claim that the Income Tax Act is not allowed to become obsolete. Now the position is that hon. members come here and speak of anomalies, and on the basis of anomalies they find in the Act, they want to make out a case for the appointment of a commission to inquire into the Income Tax Act. I think everybody will agree that these few points and the anomalies which were mentioned this afternoon most certainly do not constitute a case to justify the appointment of a commission. Under the circumstances we contend that it is not justified to appoint a commission on the Income Tax Act at this stage. The hon. the Minister of Finance has informed me, however, that he is considering appointing a commission of much wider scope. The commission will not inquire only into the Income Tax Act but will inquire to a larger extent into the fiscal and monetary position in South Africa in general. Although I do not want to represent this as a definite prospect, the Minister of Finance is considering this matter at the moment, and for what it is worth, I should like to inform the hon. House of that.</p>

<p>I think I have dealt with the major matters raised by hon. members on the opposite side, and I therefore move.</p>

<p>I felt that this was not the time to discuss whether the position should continue as it is at the moment. It was mentioned here that a divorcee is assessed as an unmarried person. That is true. It was also said that a widower or a widow was assessed as a married person. That is also so. I do not think this matter is being considered with a view to a change. As for me, I think we should leave the matter at that, because this is not the appropriate time for discussing it. However, the hon. member for Parktown raised the question of married persons. I am sorry that I forgot to reply to that. The hon. member for Wynberg did not speak on that to-day, but she raised it on a previous occasion. Therefore I cannot credit her for that to-day, but I must credit the hon. member for Parktown for raising it to-day. He mentioned the instance of a married couple&#x2019;s joint income of R9,000. The position of married couples is, briefly, that it is at present provided that the income of the one with the lowest income is divided by half and added to the income of the other. The scale is determined according to the joint income, on the sum of one, that is, on the largest income plus half of the lower income. The scale is determined on that basis, and on that scale the joint income is assessed. This applies to all cases up to a joint income of R8,000. In order that it should not be cut off bluntly at R8,000, the position is that from R8,000 upwards it &#x201C;tapers&#x201D;, as we used to say in the workshops in Salt River. It decreases gradually, with the result that when it reaches an income of R9,000, of which the hon. member for Parktown spoke, it has just about petered out. That is why the difference is only R9. If the hon. member had gone somewhat further, there would have been no difference.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause provides for a deduction in respect of fees paid to dentists, medical practitioners, nursing homes or hospitals. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he is prepared to give consideration to including in this deduction the costs of medicines where medicines are prescribed, particularly for elderly people. Elderly people especially derive much benefit from modern drugs. These are prescribed pills which in many cases they have to take for the rest of their lives. This becomes a very great burden. Quite often the doctors&#x2019; bills are small. They may go to a provincial hospital, and particularly in the case of old-age pensioners, they get medicines. Of course, an old-age pensioner would not be taxed, so that is not a good example. An elderly person with a limited income will pay <span class="col_7573-7574" refersTo="page_1048"/>only modest hospital charges, or possibly no hospital charges, and very nominal doctor&#x2019;s charges.

<p>The purpose of the present amendment is to establish a single point beyond any doubt. Since the proposed amendment to section 6 (6) will afford participants the right to transfer or cede their participation only after three years it is conceivable that an individual participant will want to make use of his right of cession of his own participation in the bond at an earlier stage. Apart from the fact that an important provision of the Bill could be invalidated in this way, the undesirability of this in respect of the mortgagor and the manager, whose affairs can be disrupted, is obvious, I have been informed that the rules of the existing scheme would make such action difficult, but I thought it desirable to regulate the matter so that it is unambiguous.</p>

<p>Sir, I note that the hon. the Deputy Minister has agreed to an amendment in respect of this particular clause whereby the capital sum involved is reduced from R25,000 to R20,000. I think that this amendment which the Deputy Minister has put forward improves the Bill but at the same time I do not think it goes nearly far enough. I believe that if in this particular case the Deputy Minister had seen fit to reduce the amount to R10,000, he would also have had the backing of this side of the House in this particular matter. Let me give my reason for saying this. In the first instance I want to quote statistics relevant to some of the trust companies which operate these participation bond schemes. I refer, first of all, to a particular trust company in the Port Elizabeth area. This particular trust company has some 240 bonds totalling a sum of R1,800,000. Ninety per cent of these particular bonds are below R20,000 and it is quite obvious that in this particular case the amendment which the Deputy Minister has introduced is going to interfere very radically with the kind of business this particular trust company is doing. Then let us take another case, a case in the platteland. There you have a trust company which has some 138 bonds totalling some R2 million, all of which are also below the R20,000 mark. Therefore in this particular case too very definite hardship will result and their normal course of business will be interfered with. One finds this pattern right throughout the country. What holds good for the platteland also holds good for the trust companies that operate in Port Elizabeth, in Cape Town, in Bloemfontein and Kroonstad. The pattern of their bonds is the same throughout. We on this side of the House find it difficult to understand why the Deputy Minister has introduced this legislation which is very definitely going to interfere with the normal <i>bona fide</i> activities of these trust companies. They have been doing this kind of business for a very long period of time. They have given a great deal of assistance in financing the country&#x2019;s normal activities. I do not believe that the financing which the trust companies have done, has been inflationary in any sense of the word. I therefore think that the hon. the Deputy Minister should try to meet the trust companies in this particular regard. We on this side of the House realize that there has been a certain amount of abuse of the Participation Bond Act which was placed on the Statute Book in 1964&#x2014;we readily acknowledge that&#x2014;but the abuse has certainly not come from the trust companies who were responsible for initiating this legislation in 1964. I have no hesitation in saying that they have not abused the privileges which have been accorded to them under the Act in any way whatsoever. Many mushroom organizations have sprung up and it is those organizations which have been largely responsible for the abuse on the privileges accorded to an institution under this particular Act. I believe that for these reasons we have every right to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister seriously to reconsider his amendment and to see if he cannot meet us by reducing this figure down to <span class="col_7575-7576" refersTo="page_1049"/>R10,000, at which level I believe he will achieve his objective which is to curtail this inflationary financing against which he is legislating here. At the same time he will in no way interfere with the normal activities of the trust companies which have played such an important and vital role in the financing of housing, farming projects, small businessmen, factory owners, etc<i>.&#x2014;bona fide</i> business which by no stretch of the imagination can be described as inflationary financing. Therefore I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Walmer. Sir, this move is supported by trust companies in Bloemfontein, Kroonstad. Port Elizabeth, East London, Kimberley and Graaff-Reinet. As the hon. member has said, this type of financing particularly interests those in small businesses and farmers. Most of this business does not take business away from the building societies. This is a type of business which is not done by the building societies or by the banks. It may be done by the Land Bank but as the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, the Land Bank nowadays considerably curtails the credit facilities offered to people. This type of business has been done by the trust companies for many years. It is only in recent years that participation bonds have been receiving quite a considerable amount of publicity, i.e. after the passing of the 1964 Act. This type of business is particularly popular in the country districts where people want medium-term finance. While in the big cities such as Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town the figure indicated by the Deputy Minister may seem to be a reasonable one, the trust companies in the country districts have pointed out that not only will this seriously affect the interested parties, but that in many cases it will force these companies to close their doors. I suggest that having regard to the representations made and the very excellent case put forward by the hon. member for Walmer. the hon. the Deputy Minister should give serious consideration to the amendment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>At the outset I want to tell the hon. member for Pinetown that we are giving this matter our thorough attention. As regards the hon. member who spoke first, I want to say that he must consider that the purpose of the application of this clause and the increased amount is, to a large extent, to protect the sound business activities of the established trust companies. I do not know whether hon. members are aware to what extent this matter has got out of hand recently. I do not think the hon. members realize this. In my Second Reading speech I informed hon. members of the large amount which had already been included in the schemes, and we expect that in future an annual amount of perhaps R60 million or R70 million will be involved in those schemes. But what is also important, is the fact that the number of these schemes has increased so tremendously. I have been informed that there are cases where a scheme was initiated in an attorney&#x2019;s office last year in which more than R2 million has already been invested to-day. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Walmer whether it is not in our interests to restrict this type of business to good, established institutions such as the trust companies, because of the great risks attaching to mortgages&#x003F; [Interjections.] Hon. members who are asking why do not know what is going on. There are risks attached to this business because there is no departmental control over these matters as there is over financial institutions. Take one factor as an example, i.e. the question of security. There is no control over the security which is being accepted for these participation bonds, and if these things are not controlled and managed by responsible people it is clear that people are going to suffer losses. Then hon. members will of course say that there should have been better supervision. It is for that reason that I feel that it was never the intention that there should be a multitude of these small schemes participating in these activities. If it was a responsible and established trust company, I am convinced that it would be able to finance these small bonds out of its own funds and that it would use the participation bond to finance the larger bonds. In that way we will also be helping to see to it that we do not establish these small, unsound schemes, which would otherwise have arisen. No, we have investigated this matter carefully and we feel that we must do something in this direction. I admit that it is somewhat arbitrary to say what the amount should be, but R10,000 is probably not a sensible amount to decide on. In fact, I personally think that R20,000 is too little. Originally we thought R50,000 would be the right amount, but we have now come down to R20,000. I think the hon. member for Walmer must admit that we have already been very fair. We would be destroying the entire effort if we were to comply with his request.</p>

<p>The new clause makes provision that the period for which participants must place their investments in these participation bonds, be a period of three years and not four as was originally published in the Bill. I want to plead again here on behalf of the trust companies in South Africa that this period be reduced to two years. The position is that the trust companies for their financing are obviously using long-term investments. I would say that 95 per cent of the moneys which the trust companies are using in the participation bond schemes, is money that is there on a long-term basis. I think it is hardly <span class="col_7579-7580" refersTo="page_1051"/>reasonable to expect anybody that is investing money to bind themselves for a period as long as three years. In many cases the intention is there to invest the money for a much longer period of time, but I think it is only human nature to expect that where you have to commit yourself to leaving that money in that particular investment for a period as long as three years, that investors would be very reticent to do so. I think it must be clear that even if your intention is to invest for a long time you do not know what may happen tomorrow. Let me quote a simple case. There may be many people here who may perhaps like to send money over to Israel to assist that country in its present war effort. Now, what would be the position if their money was now tied up in one of these participation bond schemes for a period of three years. They no longer have access to it and they cannot borrow money against the strength of that investment. That would put them obviously in a very difficult position. That kind of thing may happen to any investor. No investor knows what is going to happen tomorrow. Therefore, quite obviously, he is going to be reluctant to commit himself to this period of three years. And that being so, the net result of this legislation is going to be that the normal sources from which the trust companies have derived all their funds over all these years, and which they have used so well in financing so many of the important aspects of our economic life, the sources of investment capital, are going to dry up. And that is going to have a very serious effect on the activities of these trust companies.</p>

<p>I therefore again appeal to the hon. the Minister to be more reasonable in this matter and to reduce this period to a period of two years. After all two years is a longer period than that which the deposit-receiving institutions are restricted to. I refer now to the building societies and even in the case of their paid-up permanent shares, which are only bound up for a period of 18 months. So if you take a period of two years you are exeeding the period to which they are restricted. Therefore, I feel that with two years the Minister will again achieve the objectives which he is trying to achieve through this legislation, namely to eliminate the people that are abusing this participation bond scheme and at the same time he will not affect the normal activities of the trust companies which are playing such an important part in the normal financing of the country&#x2019;s activities. I may say that when the trust companies initiated the Participation Bond Act in 1964, they had no thought of trying to invest hot money into their participation bond schemes. Their prime motive in initiating that legislation was to protect the investor.</p>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Walmer. It is true that he mentioned he wanted a reduction in the period from three years to two years several times, but in each case he gave additional reasons. Now I want to give further reasons why this period should be reduced. The general practice in Cape Town and in Natal is three years, but in the Transvaal in respect of most trust companies the period is two years. This period of two years is the conventional period for trust bonds, and in respect of trust companies in some parts of the northern Cape the period is two years. And for these additional reasons, and for those which the hon. member gave about the building societies and the building society shares, I suggest that the Minister should give his consideration.</p>

He pointed out that 95 per cent of the money which they use, is long-term money. If that is so then surely they ought to experience no difficulty in finding money for a period of three years.</p>

<p>That is what I understood him to say. He also said that this would discourage the investor or the participant in the bond. Of course that is true, and I realize it, and that is why we want to make provision for this measure. That is what we want. All we have to do is to provide a fair period, and the hon. member for Pine-town has given added support to my argument. If the period which they now want to lay down is already three years in certain cases and two years in other cases, then surely he cannot expect me to make the period shorter if it is specifically my intention to keep short-term money away there. It is after all my intention that we should not use short-term money for bonds, because for bonds one uses long-term money, particularly in the interests of the mortgagor. The hon. member spoke about building societies. Building societies can take in deposits for periods from one to five years. At the moment the longest period for which they can accept deposits, is 18 months, but they can accept deposits for periods of one to five years, and in all these circumstances I think it is not unfair if we stipulate that the period be three years, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that, when I said that the trust companies were dealing with long-term money, that was quite correct. I raised that particular point to show that they are not responsible for these inflationary tendencies which the Minister is now legislating against. But the point I want to emphasize is that where the investor is called upon to give an undertaking that he will not claim his money back for three years, he is going to be reluctant to invest his money in these participation bond schemes. These bond schemes are the very lifeblood of the trust companies. The effect of this legislation is going to be to curtail the activities of these <i>bona fide</i> long-term investors to a very great extent. It is going to do a tremendous harm to a movement that has been tremendously beneficial over a very long period to the economy of this country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to detain the House very long. However, I wish to deal with one point which was raised very pertinently by an hon. member on the other side during the Second Reading Debate. It is a matter which causes concern on this side of the House. We on this side have already said during the Second Reading &#x2014;and I do not propose to repeat what was said&#x2014;that we wash our hands of the consequences of this measure which the Government has brought forward without, in our opinion, sufficient facts being placed before Parliament. I wish to deal with a particular point which was stated by an hon. member on the other side and voiced most concisely and pertinently by, I think, the hon. member for Germiston. The point is this. In our export of canned fruit we must constantly bear in mind that there are two circumstances which determine our market, the profitability, and therefore the effectiveness of the machinery which is being established here, J refer namely to the quality and the price. This is what I want to warn the hon. the Deputy Minister against. This is precisely where we can get shipwrecked. If there are two matters which are so involved in this matter that they sometimes count for naught, it is the quality and the price. This is the big lesson which we learnt in the Select Committee 11 years ago, namely that there are other factors that play such an important part that quality and price are not sufficient to ensure our entry into any particular market. Other factors, entirely separate from quality and price, are in issue. Since our discussion here the other day during the Second Reading Debate, I have been able to discuss the matter with a member for New Zealand who is in South Africa at the present time. He is a member of one of the control boards in New Zealand dealing with the marketing of a few types of canned fruit which they produce there. There exactly the same position has arisen as has arisen here. The quality of the product is leveled down as soon as there is a central marketing organization. Quality goes down. But, as I say, quality and price are not the determining factors. I leave this thought with the Deputy Minister. Do not let us find ourselves in that position. It may well happen that the central marketing board is going to create those very circumstances where reliance will be placed upon those two assumed principles which will be found to be broken reeds as far as the marketing of our products is concerned.</p>

<p>I wish to repeat that we on this side are not quarrelling with the Government because it feels that something should be done about the markets in a proper manner. The produce of our farmers in the form of tinned products, canned products, is in issue here. The farmer can market his fruit as fresh fruit, or he can find a different market for his produce in the form of canned fruits. We wish the farmer success, we want to help him, and we believe that Parliament should help him. But it is his produce, and we in Parliament should help him to find markets for that produce. But we on &#x2018;his side are not satisfied that this Bill is the best instrument to be used in assisting the farmer to find the best market for his product in canned form. I leave this thought with the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the half-minute remaining I just want to tell the hon. member that central marketing is not being envisaged in this measure. It is not the assumption that the Council will undertake marketing. The individual canners will still be undertaking their own sales. For that reason I cannot visualize how this measure could create any problem.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to an item the deletion of which we moved in the Committee Stage. I refer to Item No. 609.04.10. I moved an amendment to delete this particular provision. The Chairman, on the advice of the Deputy Minister, ruled that the amendment was out of order. Unfortunately I did not have with me at the time the original Act and therefore I accepted the word of the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Chairman, quite correctly, the statement by the Deputy Minister that the effect of this amendment would be to remove the rebate and therefore to increase taxation. There was a lot of laughter. I do not mind somebody taking a crack at me if I slip up and make a mistake, but when the Deputy Minister makes a statement in this House, in Committee, which in fact is incorrect then I think it is necessary to place on record &#x2026;</p>

<p>What I want to point out is that the Bill before us has attached to it a Schedule, namely Schedule No. 6, which contains an amendment to Schedule No. 6 to the Customs and Excise Act of 1964. I have before me the Customs and Excise Act of 1964. Item No. 609.04.10 as inserted in 1965 is &#x201C;Bantu beer for any purpose: Extent of rebate: Full duty&#x201D;. The effect of my amendment was to remove the proposed replacement of that section in the Bill now before us and to leave the position as it stands in terms of Act 95 of 1965. If this amendment proposed to the Bill before us had been accepted, the law would have remained unchanged. In other words, there would have been a rebate on Bantu beer for any purpose, which was the object we were seeking to achieve. The Deputy Minister stated and, as I say, got a laugh out of it, that the effect of our amendment would in fact have resulted in a tax of 61 cents per gallon on Bantu beer. I rise to put the record straight and to point out that the Minister&#x2019;s statement was in fact incorrect and that the smile now should be on the other side of his face.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as hon. members have probably noticed, we are once again introducing a general measure in terms of which we are effecting a number of highly essential amendments in several laws. I am aware of the fact that some of us do not like this sort of measure and prefer the amendments of each Act to be effected <span class="col_7587-7588" refersTo="page_1055"/>by way of separate Bills instead. I also want to concede that the point of view taken by those who think that way is not entirely without its merits. However, if we were to give effect to that, it would have meant in this case that we would have had to submit at least 14 separate measures to this House, each of which would in turn have had to pass through all the customary stages. Such a procedure would be unpractical in a case such as this where the amendments are not of a drastic nature. I might as well add at once that from the nature of the case a Bill such as this one cannot be introduced at an early stage, because it is only at a very late stage of a session that one knows what provisions are to be embodied in such a measure. I know that hon. members will not blame me for the inevitable, but for the purposes of the record I thought it fit to set out the position very briefly here.</p>

<p>Hon. members will agree with me that a Bill of this nature can be discussed more profitably in the Committee Stage. Therefore I am not going to elaborate on its provisions, but for the information and convenience of hon. members I should like to outline briefly the background to some of the provisions.</p>

<p>As far as clause 7 is concerned, I may just mention that the period for which persons may be detained in terms of the relevant section often expires at night or at a time when the court is trying other cases. In such cases it is not always possible to obtain timeously a warrant for the further detention of the person concerned, the result being that he has to be released so as to avoid the subsequent risk of damages being claimed by him on the grounds of unlawful detention. What also happens in practice is that at some or other stage during the day on which their period of detention expires, the persons concerned are brought to court, where they often have to sit and wait for the cases in which they have to appear to be tried. In the meantime the hour at which they are to be released in terms of the relevant section may have arrived before a warrant for their further detention could be obtained. The amendment that is being envisaged will leave sufficient time for bringing to trial the case of the person or persons concerned on the day in question, or to obtain a warrant for their further detention.</p>

<p>As section 186 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Act reads at present, a magistrate may pass sentence upon an accused who has been convicted by, another magistrate, but he may not commit him for trial to a regional court or convert the case into a preliminary hearing, even if according to law and in view of his record a sentence which may only be imposed by a regional court or the Supreme Court has to be passed upon the accused. There appears to be no reason why the magistrate who has to pass sentence upon the accused may not be granted the same powers as those the magistrate by whom the accused was convicted would have had if he had been present. The transfer of magistrates often necessitates steps to be taken in terms of section 186 (4), and the obstacles we are experiencing in regard to the application thereof do not further the administration of justice, nor are they in the interests of the accused.</p>

<p>The amendment we are seeking to effect in clause 10 has a rather interesting history. As you may appreciate, identifying an accused person, particularly in cases of robbery, is of the utmost importance because robbery usually takes place within a few moments and under circumstances which make exacting demands on the power of observation of the witness, who is more often than not the person who has been robbed. It is in such cases, therefore, that identification parades are often indispensable for identifying the suspected person. However, in recent years it has been happening to an ever-increasing extent that robbers&#x2014;who, incidentally, are among the most hardened criminals imaginable&#x2014;are applying all sorts of techniques to prevent identification at identification parades. To-day it is no longer an uncommon phenomenon to see a robber covering his face with his jacket or another garment or even a blanket when the complainant is asked to indicate whether the person who robbed him is present at an identification parade. Others again lie down facing the ground or disguise themselves by using some means or other by which their features are concealed or made unrecognizable. In cases where a woman is the complainant, they even adopt a threatening attitude to her or the; distort then-features into a vicious or cruel grimace with the obvious purpose of frightening the complainant. And let me add that this technique is not without effect, and that the police have been experiencing a great many problems because women have gradually become more disinclined to point out their attackers at identification parades. It goes without saying that we cannot allow the administration of justice to be frustrated in the way I have just outlined to you, and that is why we now want to grant the police the necessary power in this particular regard. I may just add that the powers we are now seeking to grant the police do, of course, not imply that the rules which have so far been applicable to the holding of identification parades are now going to be thrown overboard. On the contrary, the value of any evidence in regard to an identification parade will still, as before, depend on what measures are taken so as to ensure an unprejudiced and just identification of the suspect. But it will now at least be possible to prevent a person from covering his face or attiring himself in clothes making a mockery out of identifications. Nor should we feel concerned about the fact that by exposing his features for inspection an accused will now be compelled, as it were, to give evidence against himself by implication. After all, for a long time already it has been the accepted practice here that the evidence an accused gives against himself by exposing his feature I in a court or at an identification parade <span class="col_7589-7590" refersTo="page_1056"/>admissible. Wigmore has a rather great deal of interesting things to say about this topic in his monumental work on the law of evidence, and those of us who are interested in this matter may safely consult his work once again to see what he has to say about it.</p>

<p>All the lawyers amongst us are probably aware that in cases where a collision between two vehicles can be blamed on the negligence of both drivers, it is not possible to charge them jointly for negligent driving because each of them has in fact committed a separate offence comprising various actions. The fact nevertheless remains that the evidence at the trial of both those persons is to a large extent the same, and that the trial of one of them is a virtual repetition of the trial of the other. A similar situation also arises sometimes in the case of train accidents, where the negligence of the driver or of the signalman, or of both, may be the cause of the accident. However, in <i>Rex v. Meyer,</i> 1948 (3) S.A. 145 and other cases it was ruled that section 328 of the Criminal Procedure Act could not be applied for effecting the joint trial of the parties concerned in such cases. As the relevant section reads at present, this can only be applied in a limited number of cases, in cases of immorality, for instance. In addition to that this gives rise to uncertainty, as it is not always clear what cases are affected by that. Consequently an attempt is now being made to state clearly to what cases the relevant provisions are applicable. The proposed amendment does not affect the rule that two or more accused are not to be tried jointly if such a joint trial will prejudice the trial of the one or the other. In all these circumstances I think that we shall be serving the interests of the administration of justice if we eliminated the existing obstacles, especially where, as in this case, nobody can be prejudiced by doing so.</p>

<p>I do not think that the provisions of clause 13 are obscure in meaning to hon. members, but I just want to explain briefly that although we have been doing without them up to now, it is conceivable that in time of war on our native soil or even owing to the acts of saboteurs and terrorists, it may become impossible to publish the <i>Gazette,</i> because the available printing facilities may have been damaged or destroyed. If such a situation were to befall us overnight, we shall not even be able to promulgate a state of emergency in the customary manner. The administration of affairs of state may, as hon. members will appreciate, be prejudiced seriously if the <i>Gazette</i> cannot be published. It is not in the least our intention to make use of the powers requested as long as the <i>Gazette</i> can still be published. Promulgation by way of publication in the <i>Gazette</i> is not only customary, but also happens to be the most satisfactory and, in normal circumstances, the easiest way of doing so. However, I think that we should be prepared for contingencies, although I do not expect us to find ourselves in a position to-day or tomorrow where we shall no longer be able to have the <i>Gazette</i> published.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, a parent of a child under the age of 18 years may in certain circumstances, in terms of section 60 of the Children&#x2019;s Act, 1960, be deprived of his parental powers in regard to his child. These parental powers include, <i>inter alia,</i> the power to grant consent to the marriage or adoption of the child. The question that arises, however, is whether a parent who has been deprived of his parental powers may be granted those powers again when the child reaches the age of 18 years. In terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1937 such a thing could not happen, nor should it be allowed in terms of the existing Act, since it would cause confusion. Therefore it is now being proposed to amend the definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; in such a way that for the purposes of section 60 of the Act it may also include a person who is over the age of 18 but under the age of 21.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that during November last year the hon. the Deputy Minister for South-West Africa Affairs said in a public statement that the question of the supply of intoxicating liquor to the native population groups of South-West Africa would be reconsidered by the Government. As hon. members know, it has always been our policy to administer South-West Africa in the spirit of those provisions of the Mandate that relate to the furtherance of the welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of the Territory. Nor are hon. members unfamiliar with the fact that when the Mandate came into being, to withhold liquor from the native section of the population of the Territory was regarded as a protective measure. However, time marches on and the respective population groups in the Territory have also developed, just as population groups elsewhere. For a considerable period of time representations have therefore been received from the authorities and representatives of the respective native population groups of the Territory for intoxicating liquor to be made available to the groups in question. This matter was investigated fully and the evidence on liquor-running that was received from the respective population groups was considered carefully. For the information of this House mention may be made of the fact that in assessing this matter the Government, as is its practice in considering matters relating to South-West Africa, also allowed itself to be guided by the interests of the respective population groups, and that in the light of all these circumstances it is satisfied that the time is ripe for the provisions relating to the supply of liquor to the native population groups of South-West Africa to be relaxed. Accordingly provision is being made in clause 22 of this Bill for the provision of liquor to the said groups, subject, of course, to such control as may be deemed necessary. By doing that the position relating to the supply of liquor to the native population groups in the Territory is therefore being brought into line with that in other former mandated territories where the <span class="col_7591-7592" refersTo="page_1057"/>prohibition on the supply of liquor lapsed during the post-war period.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I want to draw attention to clause 6. I do not want to repeat everything that was said about this particular provision in the past. Nor do I believe that we shall be serving any useful purpose by conducting once again a lengthy debate on these particular provisions. We all know that this concerns the detention of one man, namely Robert Sobukwe, and in this regard I just want to say that I have given careful consideration to this whole matter, including all representations I received in this regard, and that I also paid a private visit to the person concerned and recently granted an interview to his wife. However, I am convinced that at this stage it is not in the public interest that he should be released. Therefore I have no option and I must necessarily request the extension of the validity of the provisions in terms of which he is being detained. However, I want to mention here that I have decided to relax the conditions in terms of which Sobukwe is being detained so that, subject to the necessary precautionary measures, it will be possible for his wife and children to live with him twice a year for continuous periods of 14 days at a time at the place where he is being detained; this concession is over and above the visits they can pay him at present.</p>

<p>He and his family have already intimated that they are particularly appreciative of this exceptional concession, and they have already thanked me for it. This shows that we are not adopting an unfeeling or indifferent attitude as regards the detention of this man, and that we are trying to alleviate his plight as far as it is possible for us to do so. Unfortunately i cannot go any further at this stage than I have done.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister has rightly said in introducing this measure, it consists of a number of clauses affecting various other Acts. It covers a field ranging from the regulations which may be promulgated under the Commissions Act to amendments to the Suppression of Communism Act, the Rents Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. It also deals with a lot of other matters and it ends up with a provision for permitting the sale of alcohol to the natives living in South-West Africa. Sir, these measures are unobjectionable to us, except for one clause and that is clause 6, with which the hon. the Minister has also dealt. In the Committee Stage we will raise certain questions in regard to some of the other matters, including the question of the supply of liquor to the natives in South-West Africa, but we have no objection in principle to any of the other clauses. We regard this measure as consisting of a lot of different Bills and we are prepared to pass the Second Reading, but in the Committee Stage we will oppose clause 6. Clause 6, as the Minister has said, was first introduced in 1963, and because it is so drastic the then Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, accepted an amendment to make it lapse after a year as he agreed with us that we did not want a measure of this nature on our Statute Book permanently. The next year the Prime Minister, the then Minister of Justice. said that like us he too objected to the principle embodied in the clause, but felt that it was necessary to pass this legislation again. I mention this, Sir, to emphasize the fact that the Minister who introduced the original measure objected to it as much as we did but he said it had to remain on the Statute Book because he felt it was necessary. Our objection at the time was that it only dealt with one man. The hon. the Minister himself has now admitted that it deals with one man only. This clause has become known as the Sobukwe clause. The position, of course, is that in terms of this particular clause, any person under certain circumstances, not only Sobukwe, can be detained in a prison or elsewhere after he has served the term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced for the commission of a crime. The man concerned here is Sobukwe. It may be quite true that he is unrepentant and that he has not changed his ideology. But that his ideology is anathema to the majority of us is no reason for depriving him of his liberty &#x2014;unless he takes active steps to put his ideology into effect, thereby transgressing our laws. We cannot lock up people merely because they believe in the ideals of, for instance, Nazism or Communism, although we can take action against them if they tend to further the aims of Nazism or Communism by unlawful means. So, if Sobukwe takes active steps to further an unlawful objective then he must be dealt with. But there are, in fact, numerous laws under which we can deal with Sobukwe. He is in this peculiar position that he is a Bantu and that we have numerous laws dealing with detention of Bantu&#x2014;deportation for instance, or in other ways&#x2014;besides all the laws we have passed since 1963, laws entitling the police to detain people suspected of committing crimes of the nature of the crimes it is suspected Sobukwe will commit. There are other laws, such as house arrest&#x2014;as a matter of fact, there is a whole list of them and I do not think it is necessary for me to go through them now. All these laws enable the Minister to take action against a person whom he suspects may be a threat to the maintenance of law and order.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that this particular provision, as it is now on our Statute Book, does not apply only to Sobukwe, but to everybody. At the same time it is true that the only person against whom it is being applied is Sobukwe and as far as he is concerned there are many other laws under which he may be dealt with by virtue of the fact that he is a Bantu. After all our talk of having broken Poqo. the A.N.C., the communists, etc., we look ridiculous having a law of this nature on our Statute Book just to deal with one man. I am sure that if he intends taking active steps to further the aims of Communism, or to commit any other unlawful act, our security police <span class="col_7593-7594" refersTo="page_1058"/>will soon be on his track in which case he can be dealt with under the many other provisions available to the authorities. The mere fact that it is necessary, after this provision has been on the Statute Book for four years, to detain only one man is sufficient proof that a provision of this nature is not really necessary for the security of the State and the maintenance of law and order. The man Sobukwe is not important&#x2014;it is the presence of a provision of this nature on our Statute Book which matters, especially in view of the fact that Sobukwe, as I have said, can be dealt with under numerous other laws. The Minister himself has admitted that this provision affects only one man at the moment. Therefore, I want to ask whether it is not possible for us to deal with him in some other manner. Some time ago we saw that he made a request to the authorities for an exit permit. However, I think that request was refused. I do not know whether Sobukwe still wants an exit permit but I submit that if he does want it the Government should grant it to him and let him get out of the country. Our experience of others who have been granted exit permits has been that they have not really been a danger to us after they have left the country but have instead become an embarrassment to their host and to those people who have accorded them friendship. Can the hon. the Minister give us any information in this regard and say why it is not possible to deal with Sobukwe in this manner&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Minister has announced that he is going to grant Sobukwe more privileges, especially in respect of visits by his family. I am very glad to hear that because I made representations to the Minister on these lines. So I hope his wife will be able to take advantage of these extended privileges. But because of the fact that here are other laws under which we feel Sobukwe can be dealt with if he intends committing a breach of the peace or breaking the laws in any way, we are opposed to keeping a measure of this nature on our Statute Book&#x2014; an obnoxious measure, as was agreed by the then Minister of Justice, now the Prime Minister, when he originally introduced it. Under the circumstances, we shall oppose this clause in the Committee Stage.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that there really was no point in rehashing all the old arguments about clause 6 of this Bill, a clause which is really the only important clause of this Bill, a point of view also held by the hon. member for Transkei. But its very presence in this Bill makes it impossible for me to support this Bill at its Second Reading. It was for a similar reason that I opposed a similar measure last year and during the two Sessions before that. The Opposition, of course, at that stage also voted against the Second Reading.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but this also is an amendment of the Suppression of Communism Act. If the hon. member for Transkei would look at his own speech of 1965 he would see that he then said that there was nothing important in the measure then introduced except for the Sobukwe clause. He added that because he was the watchdog for the jurisprudence of this country he could not accept the measure. However, I am not interested in the Opposition&#x2014;I have given them up! One never knows what they are up to in matters of this nature. Year after year they have taken up the attitude that there was nothing offensive in these measures except for this particular clause. I have here the Hansard of 1965. The hon. member can read his Leader&#x2019;s words there on the 1965 measure. As a matter of fact, the Opposition supported my amendment when the Third Reading of the measure was proposed, to the effect that it be read a third time &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;. At the Second Reading, however, they did not support a similar amendment of mine although they voted against the Bill being read a second time because of this particular offensive clause. As has been said, this particular provision at present is being applied only to one man, namely Robert Sobukwe. But that is not the really important issue. It does not matter whether it applies to only one, or to 10 or to 15 men. As a matter of fact, it can apply to any number of men as long as the hon. the Minister can decide to detain in gaol any man who has already served the sentence imposed upon him by the courts. May I remind the House that Sobukwe was in fact sentenced to only three years&#x2019; imprisonment&#x2014;that is all. Moreover, when the judge at the time passed sentence, he himself commented that he thought the sentence was a severe one. What is more, this sentence, which the judge himself admitted was severe, was not imposed for violence, not for sabotage, not for any crime against the State&#x2014;he was sentenced for incitement against the pass laws. Hon. members may have forgotten that, but that was the crime for which Sobukwe was sent to gaol.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When Sobukwe was the leader of the P.A.C., this organization did not, in fact, preach violence. Three years later the P.A.C. turned into Poqo and thereby became a violent organization. By that time Sobukwe had been in gaol for three years and unless our prison security is very poor indeed I see no possibility that Sobukwe could have been the leading light in transforming the P.A.C. into Poqo, into a violent organization. In any event, Sobukwe has been detained since then for another four years&#x2014;four more years in gaol and by the time the proposal of the hon. the Minister with which we are dealing now has transpired he will have served five years over and above the sentence duly imposed upon him by the courts of law.</p>

<p>Like other hon. members I have also spoken to Sobukwe quite recently. Let me say at once that the conditions under which he is being held are certainly far better than those under which any normal prisoner is held. Sobukwe is in his own compound and has two blocks for his own use: Sleeping quarters and an ablution block. Moreover, he has books, a radio and record-player available to him. But to me none of this is really relevant. The cardinal point is that Sobukwe is being held prisoner, and as such is deprived of his liberty. To me it does not matter even if he were living in one of our best hotels&#x2014;the fact remains that he is a prisoner and as such deprived of his liberty. Two years ago Sobukwe offered to accept an exit permit and was prepared to give an undertaking that he would not engage in any further political activity. However, at that time the Government refused to accept his word and, accordingly, his request was refused. I do not know whether he is of the same mind to-day&#x2014;I doubt whether he is. But nothing of this is relevant. I do not know what hon. members think will happen to a man who is being kept in what is, virtually, solitary confinement, year after year. He has the occasional visitor, but by virtue of the geographical position of Robben Island it is difficult for people to get to him, particularly so for his wife and family, who live on the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>The Minister has said that he is prepared to grant special concessions to allow his wife and family to be with him for 14 days a time twice a year. That, of course, is a great improvement, an improvement for which, I have no doubt, Sobukwe has already expressed his gratitude. As a matter of fact, the hon. the Minister said so. But this. Sir. is not the same as leading a normal family life, as being at liberty after having served a sentence. It is merely a concession and does not compensate for his loss of liberty. I have asked the hon. the Minister, and I now ask him again to consider it, to arrange for Sobukwe&#x2019;s wife to have railway concessions to come and visit Sobukwe. [Interjections.] Apparently hon. members do not find it unusual that a man should still be kept in gaol four years after he has served his sentence. His wife lives on the Witwatersrand and has to earn a living for herself and her family. Financially it is very difficult for her to manage this long trip to Cape Town.</p>

<p>I should also like to point out to those hon. members creating such a fuss on the back benches behind me that the previous Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, actually went so far as to say that he would consider granting such concessions very seriously. He was not aghast at the thought of the S.A. Railways making a concession available to Mrs. Sobukwe twice a year to enable her and her family to visit Sobukwe. He was perfectly prepared to consider the matter, but before he was able to take the matter any further, the House rose and shortly thereafter he relinquished the portfolio of Justice. So, I do ask the present Minister of Justice to reconsider this matter, very seriously. I may say that this man needs visitors. After all, he is virtually being held in solitary confinement. The commandant does visit him occasionally and he has a warder standing outside his compound. Apart from that, he is alone for the major part of his time. He told me himself that he was beginning to feel very strongly that having nobody at all to converse with was definitely beginning to affect him mentally. It is not, I presume, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to keep him there for the rest of his life. As it is, his position has to be reviewed annually. But I hope one of these days the hon. the Minister will decide that in terms of common justice this man should be released as the courts decreed he should be released after he had served his three years in gaol.</p>

Perhaps he will enjoy it. I happen to be concerned now with the principles of common justice, principles which I believe are being violated by this measure. That is why I intend moving a similar amendment to the one I moved during previous years. I do not want to go any further, except to say one thing, something which it is necessary should be said. Of course, I would not have believed it, but from previous debates we have had in this House, especially the more recent debates, apparently it is necessary for me to say it. And that is that if one opposes this amendment of the Suppression of Communism Act, as I have opposed previous amendments of the Suppression of Communism Act, for example the house arrest clause, the 90-day clause, the 180-day clause in the Bills that contain those provisions, it does not mean that one is in favour of Communism. It does not mean that one is in favour of sabotage and it does not mean <span class="col_7597-7598" refersTo="page_1060"/>that one is in favour of terrorism.

<p>&#x2026; anymore, I might say, that one is in favour of criminals and crime if one pleads for penal reform and improvements in prison conditions. I read a very interesting letter or interview given to one of the Government newspapers not long ago, by an anonymous police officer who had the impertinence to suggest that I was in favour of crime because I had pleaded for improvements in prison conditions. As I have said, as far as I am concerned, I shall go on pleading for improvements in our prison conditions. I am not remotely touched by any of these insinuations or any of these accusations. I simply place on record that I am opposed to any acts of this nature, particularly the one we are considering to-day, because I consider it contains a vital principle which abrogates common justice as we know it.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a few remarks with regard to clause 6. Under ordinary circumstances no one in this House is in favour of detaining a person after he has served his sentence. I wish to make it clear that we are not re-enacting this provision in order to detain Sobukwe because he committed a crime many years ago. This re-enactment must not be viewed in that light at all. We are re-enacting this provision because we consider it to be in the interests of the safety of the State. Unfortunately new factors have arisen during the last year which constitute a danger to the State. We have the massing of terrorists on our borders who are fully armed with modern and dangerous weapons. These terrorists have no regard at all for human life. They are infiltrating our borders and so constitute a real danger to the safety of the State. In these circumstances we have the position that the hon. the Minister of Justice has come to this House with a request to extend the period of detention. The hon. member for Transkei pointed out that we have different laws under which we could detain Sobukwe in other ways. But we could not detain him in other ways so as to avoid an escape from this country. This is a possibility we must consider and I think the hon. the Minister together with the Cabinet must have considered this position that Sobukwe could escape and furthermore that he was a potential leader of the terrorists beyond our borders. And because we have the duty of safeguarding the safety of the State we must take regard of this consideration by the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet. We must also take into consideration that they have more information at their disposal than can be disclosed to this House, which is also in the interests of the State. We on this side of the House and also hon. members on the other side have no alternative but to consent to this extension after the serious request by the hon. the Minister of Justice and after the Cabinet as a whole had considered the matter. I also want to point out that the hon. the Prime Minister admitted to the House that he also does not wish to keep a prisoner in detention who has served his sentence. I think it should also be recorded that this person is given special treatment, he is allowed special facilities and that he is not treated like an ordinary convicted prisoner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Omaruru perhaps reinforces the case that the hon. member for Transkei made, inasmuch as he confirms that the principle which is contained in the Sobukwe clause&#x2014;the so-called Sobukwe clause&#x2014;is a principle of which no one is in favour. It is a principle. Sir, of which the hon. the Prime Minister, when he was the Minister of Justice, expressed himself to be against, and in respect of which he expressed himself to be in agreement with us in principle. He said that he had his troubles with the man himself and therefore had to retain him for one more year. But one wonders just what has happened here. Since Sobukwe went into gaol&#x2014;round about 1960&#x2014;we have had an enormous number of new offences created. An enormous number was placed on the Statute Book. We had the Riotous Assemblies Act and especially offences under the Suppression of Communism Act. There were all sorts of new offences which were not offences before this man was committed to gaol. We had offences relating to sabotage and offences relating to terrorism. There is no field that one can think of where a person with subversive intentions could not be dealt with. The whole field is covered by a wide variety of laws, a number of which provide for minimum penalties. There is the position in so far as dealing with them in terms of the law is concerned. More than that, we have since 1960 passed more laws to deal with the question of containing a person if he is suspected of being a potential troublemaker or a potential agitator. We have had house arrests which were not there before. We have the powers to confine people to various areas under the Suppression of Communism Act; the question of having to report to the Police; provisions relating to the interrogation of persons; <span class="col_7599-7600" refersTo="page_1061"/>the provisions relating to the prohibition of meetings; the prohibition of one person from meeting another and from attending a gathering, etc. All this fantastic number of new powers were placed in the hands of the Executive to contain the movement of a person and in the second place, as I have indicated, there are a large number of new crimes. One is therefore surprised, to say the very least, that with all these powers, with all the experience that we have gained, with all these new offences, it is not possible to contain a person like Sobukwe, or any single person at all. The question is not Sobukwe, the question as far as we are concerned is the principle of this thing, namely that this clause should still be necessary. I think that the hon. member for Transkei has made the position very clear that we are against it. Now, the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;I am afraid I must just deal with her shortly &#x2026;</p>

<p>Without being personal I am indicating what the object of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is. The hon. member talked about 1965. In 1965 the Sobukwe clause was placed for renewal in a Bill to amend the Suppression of Communism Act. At the Second Reading we were opposed to that Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because of that clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Because of that clause and because of other clauses as we indicated clearly at the time. At the Committee Stage a number of the objectionable clauses were removed and we voted against the Sobukwe clause. When it came to the Third Reading there were two clauses in the Bill that we were still against. But this was a Bill amending the Suppression of Communism Act, which we were opposed to in the first place. That was because of the arbitrary nature of the provision as it armed the Executive with so many arbitrary powers. Here the provision is put in&#x2014;and it is for the Government to decide&#x2014;in a General Law Amendment Bill. It is a General Law Amendment Bill which contains 22 principles, which is in effect something like 17 Bills. It could all have been put into 17 different Bills. And what we have to decide here is the question as to what the principle of the Bill is. Are we for or against the principle of the Bill&#x003F; What is the principle of the Bill&#x003F; We are in fact against one provision and we are not against any of the other provisions. How can the hon. member say that this is the principle of the Bill&#x003F; I am quite sure that the people in South-West Africa might regard the principle of this Bill as being that provision, namely clause 22, which provides that the native inhabitants in South-West Africa may now have liquor. I am quite sure, Sir, that they would regard that as the principle of the Bill. By the same token I am sure that those persons concerned with commissions would regard the provision that regulations may be made giving a commission the status of a court and that their proceedings may be <i>sub judice,</i> as a principle. This does not matter. What matters is how one feels about the various provisions. Our position is very clear. So far as all the other provisions are concerned, the other principles, we have no objection. As far as clause 6 is concerned, we have objections. In the right place in the proper manner we will indicate our objection and we will do what we can to have it erased from the Statute Book.</p>

<p>Mr.Speaker. I want to ask the hon. the Opposition and also the hon. member for Houghton whether they think I am detaining Robert Sobukwe for a further year because I find it pleasant. Do they think that after his wife visited me and pleaded with me I am nevertheless detaining him because I find it pleasant&#x003F; I am not doing it for that reason. I am doing it because I have a duty to this country. That is why I am detaining Robert Sobukwe. That is the only reason why he is being detained. I do not want to go into details now and say where he fits into the picture or will fit into the picture, but I want to make it clear that to release Robert Sobukwe from Robben Island at this stage&#x2014;under all the powers that hon. members said I had&#x2014;would be folly. It would be folly to release him at this stage. I am not going into further details. I just want to reply to one point. The hon. member for Transkei asked me what the position was in respect of Sobukwe&#x2019;s request for an exit permit. The fact of the matter is that he has at <span class="col_7601-7602" refersTo="page_1062"/>no time applied for such a permit. He has not yet applied for a one-way permit. His wife did in fact ask, in a letter she wrote to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;a letter which was made public&#x2014;whether the Government would consider letting him out on a one-way permit. But he has not yet indicated that he is prepared to leave the country on a one-way permit.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Two years ago he did, yes, but he has not applied for it recently. He has not indicated that, and I also want to say here and now that even if he did indicate that at the present time, I think it would be very unwise to let him go.</p>

<p>This is a case of prevention being better than cure. We are detaining Robert Sobukwe on Robben Island because he cannot escape from there. We are trying to detain him under the best possible conditions. We do not regard him as a prisoner; we regard and treat him as a detainee. As I have just made known, we have made a further concession to him as regards his wife and his children. We do so to make things more pleasant and better for him where he is being detained. But to release him at this stage is out of the question; I simply cannot do that.</p>

<p>There is one more point which has not been dealt with. The hon. member for Houghton asked that the Government should consider enabling his wife to visit him at Government expense. I did not know that the hon. the present Prime Minister had said at one stage that he would consider that. If he did say so, I am also prepared and willing to consider it without committing myself at this stage.</p>

<p>I ask hon. members please to see the matter in this light: I am not detaining Robert Sobukwe for the fun of it. I have paid a special visit to him.

<p>Mr.Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Although the Transkei Constitution Amendment Bill, of which I am now moving the Second Reading, may appear long and perhaps complex to hon. members, it actually contains only four basic matters. In the first place it contains the change in the basis and the number of constituencies for the election of the 45 ordinary members of the Legislative Assembly. In the second place it contains a change in the way chiefs are represented on the Legislative Assembly. I should like hon. members to note in particular that it merely relates to the way they are to be represented in the Assembly and not to the grand total of paramount chiefs and chiefs serving on the Legislative Assembly; their number remains at 64. In the third place it contains a clearer definition and more detailed provision in respect of sub-chiefs, as well as provision for the appointment of acting paramount chiefs, chiefs and sub-chiefs, in order to maintain the position which has always applied. Finally it relates to the transfer of movable property to the Government of the Transkei.</p>

<p>The third and fourth points, which I want to deal with first, are merely an extension of the existing legislation, and there is not much to be said about them. In 1956 provision was made in the Bantu Administration Act for paramount chiefs and sub-chiefs and acting appointments in these capacities. Since then appointments are made and have also been made in the Transkei, even after self-government was granted, but from a legal opinion it now appears that section 45 of the Transkei Constitution Act and the definition of chief and headmen in section 73 do not go far enough and must therefore be amended, as indicated in clauses 5 and 8 of the Bill. This is purely technical and no new principles are involved. The provisions must accordingly be inserted with retrospective force to 30th May, 1963, the date on which the Constitution Act was promulgated, in order to provide for the validity of appointments since that date, i.e. 30th May, 1963.</p>

<p>The proposed amendments to clauses 6 and 7, which relate to the transfer of movable property, come under the same category. This is a technical point, because although it was accepted that the authorization in section 59 of the Constitution Act with regard to the transfer of property also included movable property, it now appears from a legal opinion that this is not the case. At the time the section was of course fully debated, and it is in fact unnecessary to debate this provision again, <span class="col_7603-7604" refersTo="page_1063"/>because everybody, also hon. members on the opposite side, was under the impression at the time that section 50 included movable property, as the section was then discussed here on that basis.</p>

<p>Permit me first to draw all attention to clause 3, which relates to the change in the constituencies and which is actually the basic point in this measure. At present the nine regional authority areas are the constituencies for the election of the 45 elected members of the Legislative Assembly. There are therefore nine constituencies. The constituencies comprise the Bantu areas in 26 districts. The number of members for each constituency is determined in proportion to the number of registered voters, which varies from slightly less than 170,000 in the largest, which has eight members, to 37,600 in the smallest, which has two members. In the largest constituency, for example, the voters have to vote for eight members at every general election. Perhaps you will recall that at the first general election 33 candidates were nominated in that constituency&#x2014;that is, in the Qaukeni constituency &#x2014;and you may appreciate what confusion such a large number of candidates could cause in such a large constituency. If one vacancy arises in the constituency, a by-election for a possible electorate of almost 170,000 has to be arranged. I think the correct number of voters in that constituency is 163,000. In terms of the proposed amendment before you at the moment, there will be no delimitation and the number of members to a constituency will be proportionate to the total number of registered voters in the various new constituencies. This is the same principle as the existing one, only with a smaller entity per constituency.</p>

<p>Sound reasons may be advanced for the proposed amendment. It appears that the new system will be easier to operate and more practical. At a by-election only one single district will be involved, whereas in terms of the existing system up to five districts may be involved in such a by-election if only one member has to be elected. By-elections will also be cheaper on the more restricted district basis than they have been until now on the larger regional basis. General elections should cost the same as under the present system, but it will not be possible to avoid the cost of re-registration, which is to be defrayed by the Transkei Government.</p>

<p>The Legislative Assembly of the Transkei requested unanimously that the size of the constituencies should be reduced by taking the districts as a basis. This was a resolution adopted on a motion by the Chief Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition of the Transkei. It was adopted unanimously. The basis will be as now proposed in the new section 26. which is contained in clause 3. I do not think anybody in this hon. House could have any material objection to this request.</p>

<p>As regards the paramount chief and chiefs in the Legislative Assembly, we all know the history, namely provision was made in the Constitution Act at the time for the four paramount chiefs and a total of 60 chiefs in the various regions, as set out in section 23 of the Constitution Act. This is also clearly apparent from clause I of the Bill hon. members have before them. As it should be in the case of all forms of government, the Transkeian system is not static. It is a developing system which will constantly enter new phases, and the system must and will be adapted continually to changing circumstances. Here we now have the position that since 1963 one additional paramount chieftainship has been added, which brings the number of paramount chiefs to five, and 17 new chieftainships have been created, which bring the number of chiefs to 77.</p>

<p>The paramount chiefs are automatically members of the Legislative Assembly, of course, and as a result of the increase of one, the number of chiefs in the Legislative Assembly decreased by one. At the moment there are therefore 59 chiefs, from a total of 77, who have a seat. Only these 59 have a seat. As the Constitution Act provides at present, those 59 chiefs have an indisputable perpetual seat in that they need not be re-elected for membership of the new Assembly upon the termination of the life of a legislative assembly, but become members of the new Assembly automatically. This means that the chiefs of additional chieftainships do not get a seat. The Transkei Legislative Assembly does not want this state of affairs, because there has been a unanimous request from both the Government side and the Opposition that the position should be changed in order that chiefs should also serve only for the life of a Legislative Assembly, which is normally five years, and that the fixed number, which is at present 59, should then be elected from and by the total number of chiefs. In this way all the chiefs will be given an opportunity to serve on the Legislative Assembly or to qualify for serving on it.</p>

<p>The request also goes further. Chiefs are in fact distributed over the districts in the various regional authority areas. This distribution is not even, and the chiefs in a district where there is a majority in numbers may collude to keep chiefs in another district of the same region out of the Legislative Assembly, and in this way minority groups may be prevented from being represented on the Legislative Assembly through their chiefs. It has also been requested unanimously that the position in this regard should be confirmed as it was when the Constitution Act as drawn up, and this is done by the following three steps.</p>

<p>Firstly, the number of chiefs to represent each region on the Legislative Assembly shall now be determined in accordance with the number in each district in a region as it was in 1963, except, of course, in the case of Emigrant Tembuland, which now gets one chief less as a result of the creation of the paramount chieftainship. The numbers are clearly specified in clause 1 of the Bill, namely the <span class="col_7605-7606" refersTo="page_1064"/>proposed new section 23 of the Constitution Act. and there is no need for me to go into that in detail.</p>

<p>Secondly, section 25 of the Constitution Act is augmented in terms of the proposals in clause 2 of the Bill, to make it clear that chiefs have to be re-elected upon the termination of the life of a Legislative Assembly, it in a particular district there are more chiefs than the number which can and may serve on the Legislative Assembly in respect of that district.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the election of the chiefs will then in the first place be made by the chiefs in that particular district, and it is only if they cannot come to agreement that the election will be entrusted to a meeting of the paramount chief, if there is one, and all the other chiefs in the region in which the district concerned is situated. This procedure is clearly described in the proposed new section of the Constitution Act.</p>

<p>Hon. members will also notice that the same method of election has to be followed if a vacancy arises in the representation of chiefs and also if there is a decrease in the representation of chiefs as a result of the creation of a paramount chieftainship.</p>

<p>As I have said, these proposals on changes in the constituencies and the election of chiefs were called for unanimously by the Transkeian Legislative Assembly. Here we now have a very good example of fusion of the old and the new, in that the Bantu are still eager to retain the traditional but want to adapt it to modern circumstances and developments.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the Bill relates to the change in the constituencies to which I referred and adapts the requirements imposed on a candidate to the proposed change.</p>

<p>Clause 9 is self-explanatory. The existing Legislative Assembly&#x2019;s life terminates only next year, and the amendments which are now introduced should therefore be prevented from terminating the membership of members or the normal life of the Assembly.</p>

<p>We have no objection to the principles contained in this Bill and we Agree that the amendments are necessary, especially in regard to the new electoral divisions, because we have the ridiculous position at the moment where they have had to vote for as many as eight members of the Assembly in one electoral division. With illiterate voters, as we have there, they come there with a list of eight members for whom they want to vote. They hand this list to an official and the official will then say that he will make the crosses for them, and often they are suspicious that the official does not make the crosses in the right position, and others cannot remember for whom they had to vote out of the eight because there are so many candidates standing. The whole position was rather ridiculous. I am glad that this amendment is being made to make it much easier for the voters, but I am not quite sure about one thing. If an elected member dies before the next general election for the Assembly, how will it be decided which electoral division will be affected&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I can see that clauses 5 and 8 are deemed to have come into operation on 30th May, 1963, but I see no reference here to holding over the provisions of clause 3. But perhaps the Minister can reply to this in the Committee Stage. The only thing that was worrying me is how it is to be decided for which electoral division there will be a vacancy. But the Minister obviously has the answer. If an elected member dies before the next general election, how will it be decided for which electoral division there is a vacancy, because they represented nine or ten electoral divisions in the past&#x003F; I should like certainty on that.</p>

<p>This Bill before us is an example of cooperation between the Transkeian Legislative Assembly and this Parliament. In terms of the Transkei Constitution Act the constitution has to be amended by our Parliament, and we are doing it now at the request of that Assembly. The Minister has told us that a resolution was accepted by the Opposition as well as the Government side. I should like the Minister to tell us also whether there have been other requests from that Assembly for amendments which this Government possibly has not been prepared to entertain. The Minister says there have not been any at this stage, but we can conceive that difficulties might arise.</p>

<p>With regard to the last point, the Transkei did not put any other request to us, but I should like to correct the hon. member. I think he is confusing a request for the handing over of more functions to the Transkei Government with an amendment to the Constitution. But that cannot be discussed now. That leaves only the other question put by the hon. member, namely what the position will be if an elected member dies now. The position will be that a by-election will be held on the old basis. We cannot apply the new system to a by-election which may come in two or three months&#x2019; time. This new system cannot be applied unless the Transkei has had a general re-registration of all voters and prospective voters. I indicated that in my speech.</p>

<p>That is an administrative step which is necessary, and they make provision for the re-registration. It applies automatically that if a member dies and must be replaced by a new member to be elected, in that case the by-election cannot be held in terms of this Bill and the alteration we are making here to-day, but will still be on the old basis.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened to the explanation the hon. the Minister gave to the hon. member for Transkei on this clause. The Minister said that if an elected member died, the by-election would be held on the old basis and not under clause 3 of this Bill. But I have difficulty in following how it can be done on the old basis when one has amended the existing section which provided that there would be nine regional authority areas in the Transkei. That is now changed and the new provision is that there will be 26 electoral divisions for the election of the 45 members. It therefore seems to me that you no longer have the nine regional authority areas and therefore there is no basis on which to have a by-election on the old basis; that the only provision is the new one, and that this may be a problem the Minister will have to look at. Perhaps he feels that he has given the answer, but it does not seem to me to be correct in terms of this section as it will now be amended. If the Minister cannot give us the answer, I would be glad if he would look into it.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>I take it that it is not necessary for me to make a long speech to-day in defence of my Budget. It is neither customary nor necessary and consequently it is not my intention to do so. But I nevertheless want to avail myself of this opportunity to make a few observations in the hope that they may be of interest to hon. members.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to refer to the financial results for the financial year 1966-&#x2019;67. In my Budget speech I furnished provisional figures for the financial year 1966-&#x2019;67. Final figures are not available as yet, but according to the latest information revenue from customs and excise will be approximately R3.5 million more than I anticipated at that time. The other figures have not changed much, and consequently I anticipate that the surplus on Revenue Account will be approximately R35 million instead of R31.5 million as announced in the Budget speech. On Loan Account our estimate remains essentially unchanged, namely a credit balance of R34.5 million on 31st March.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to mention that in April we entered into an agreement with a group of European banks under the leadership of the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas for a recurrent credit of $13 million for a period of three years. Every credit will be for a period of 90 days and the rate of interest will be &#x00BD; per cent higher than the rate for loans between banks on the date concerned. There is a raising fee of &#x00BC; per cent on undrawn amounts. We have not drawn on this credit as yet.</p>

<p>In the third place I want to refer to a drawing of rands by the International Monetary Fund. As hon. members know, the International Monetary Fund is a co-operative institution. Each member is expected to make his currency available to be drawn by other members when they need it for balance of payment reasons. Until recently, only the money of the large industrial countries was drawn, but the present trend is also to use the currency of the smaller countries which are in a reasonably strong position. We recently agreed to the equivalent of $10 million in South African rands being used for a drawing on the fund by New Zealand. This is the first time that the South African rand has been used in such a transaction. Our own drawing powers on the fund are increased accordingly, in other words, if we need it, we can draw this amount on the fund over and above the amount we can normally expect to borrow from the fund.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. The Minister will forgive me if I do not <span class="col_7609-7610" refersTo="page_1066"/>follow him immediately on financial matters, save to tender him my congratulations that he should be Minister of Finance on the first occasion when the International Monetary Fund seeks to rely on the South African rand for a drawing of this kind. It is a sign of international and financial maturity which perhaps is long overdue as regards South Africa. It comes, of course, as no surprise and I think it is a very satisfactory development. It is no surprise either to find that the income which the hon. gentleman is expecting from customs and excise is going to be higher than he anticipated. At long last we have persuaded him to relax import control and it is not surprising that he is now reaping some of the benefits of paying attention to what is advocated by the Opposition in matters of this kind.</p>

<p>Sir, with those preliminary remarks I want to embark on a somewhat different discussion and say that I believe that this Appropriation debate is taking place at one of the most critical moments, internationally, in our time. I believe that had it not been for the speedy success of Israeli arms, the struggle in the Middle East might have taken on most dangerous proportions and might have developed into a crisis of so dangerous a kind that it could have threatened to involve the whole world in war once more. I think that even in spite of the speedy end to military operations, the war in the Middle East has nevertheless thrown the whole international position once more into the melting pot. I think it has convinced even the most optimistic that the United Nations Organization has failed as an instrument for maintaining world peace. I think its inability to discharge its major function must distress us all and fill mankind with foreboding as to what the future is in that regard. We in South Africa, who have often been the butt of attacks in the United Nations, have the right now to ask the world leaders to have another look at that organization, to ask themselves why it has failed, to ask themselves why it has disappointed the high hones of its founders, amongst them South Africa whose leader at that time, Field Marshal Smuts, played a most important role at the San Francisco Conference when the United Nation&#x2019;s Charter was written and when it came into existence. I know, Sir, that it has become a popular cry to-day that the U.N. is failing because small, young and inexperienced nations have been given too much say in that organization, and that they have used it as a platform to air their grievances and to press importunate demands. I think that there is truth in that reproach, but I do not think it is the whole truth. I wonder whether we should not look into the matter a little more deeply. Is it not possible that the real cause of the failure of the United Nations Organization must be sought in the fact that the Western powers, the older and the more experienced powers with the needed knowledge and authority, have failed to give that strong and decisive leadership which the world was entitled to expect from them&#x003F; Is it not true to say that those great powers have failed in discharging the responsibility which they have to teach and guide the new nations, some of which they themselves have helped to create, so that they could play a more constructive and a more worthy part in world affairs&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir. I believe that South Africa&#x2019;s interest and concern in these matters is very real indeed, not only because we are founder-members of that organization, but also because the crisis in the Middle East has once more emphasized and underlined two things, firstly the importance of the Cape route whenever Suez is threatened and, secondly, the strategic importance of South Africa amongst the comity of nations when the peace of the world is disturbed. Sir, peace is vitally important to South Africa. It is vitally important to us because we cannot escape the consequences of war, almost in any part of the globe. That is why I believe that we have a duty and a right to speak up, to express our thoughts on how international relations and organizations should be re-constituted in the interests of world peace. I believe that we have a part to play in helping to bring about such a re-constitution and I feel that that should include a reform of the United Nations Organization so that it will have a chance to play the role for which it was originally designed. Sir, it is here that I believe South Africa should speak up very firmly because we South Africans have a fine tradition and we are heirs to a great tradition in respect of this matter, heirs to men who have made a very great contribution in their lifetime in the fashioning of world affairs. One need only recall the influence that the late General Botha had at Versailles; one need only recall the influence that General Hertzog had at the time of the Falfour Declaration when the dominions received sovereign independence both in fact and in law. One need only recall the part played by the late Dr. Malan at the time of the emancipation of India and one need only recall the role played by Field Marshal Smuts as a revered member of the highest councils of the free nations of the world. I believe that when the League of Nations celebrated its 21st birthday, the council of the League of Nations adjourned in order to send a cable of congratulations to General Smuts as one of the founders of that organization. Sir, those men had the ear of the world at a time when South Africa was far less strong, both militarily and economically, than it is at the present time. I want to say that we of the Opposition would like to see the Prime Minister of South Africa, whether he comes from that side of the House or from this side of the House &#x2026; [Laughter.] Sir, the triumphs of a small nation like Israel over the vast numbers of its enemies, seem to have struck fear into the hearts of the Government party with its vast majority. I think they are beginning to fear that the walls of Jericho may be shaken, and I can quite understand that fear. Sir, I would like, and I am sure all members of the Opposition would like to see the Prime Minister in <span class="col_7611-7612" refersTo="page_1067"/>a position in which he can give leadership not only to his own country but also guidance to the world in matters of this kind. I know I can say at once that any Prime Minister who proves himself qualified to do that would have the support of both sides of the House in so far as foreign affairs are concerned, no matter what our internal differences might be.</p>

<p>Sir, there have been encouraging signs; there have been signs that the present Prime Minister is aware of how important it is that South Africa should establish friendly relations with neighbouring states on which active co-operation can be built in the future. I think he has shown signs too that he appreciates how important it is to go even further in establishing a favourable image of South Africa internationally.</p>

<p>Sir, this nervousness on the other side to-day is rather amusing. The hon. the Prime Minister has taken steps entirely in line with United Party policy to make closer contact with neighbouring States. He has given signs that he is willing to be realistic in seeking to improve our relations with our friends in the West. Sir, we are grateful for that, in all genuineness, but I think that events in the last week in the Middle East are creating and have created new opportunities for South Africa. I have no doubt whatsoever that as a result of what has happened, there is going to be a new appreciation of the distribution of power in the world that must lead to a re-thinking, and, more concretely, to re-alignments amongst the nations of the world. I believe it is already apparent that fresh attempts must be made to ensure more settled conditions in the world, and I think this emphasizes the necessity for the hon. the Prime Minister to continue on the course which he has entered, somewhat timidly, with more courage and more zeal perhaps than in the past. The Prime Minister himself and members of his Cabinet have not been slow to condemn the United Nations Organization but I have been surprised to find that there have been no constructive suggestions and no positive suggestions as to the reform of that organization. Surely this is a time when the hon. the Prime Minister should devote the energies of South Africa to a complete revision of the United Nations&#x2019; Charter and the organization as such. Although some of its specialist agencies have done good work and although it has on occasions had success in containing local conflicts, and in preventing them from flaring up into world conflagrations, things for which we are grateful, there is not the slightest doubt that as a peace-keeping force and as a mirror of world opinion, it has been a dismal failure. I think that depending upon one&#x2019;s point of view, the Organization has evoked sometimes anger, sometimes frustration, sometimes dismay, sometimes sardonic amusement but never confidence in its ability to maintain world peace, which should be its major role. Sir, its continued failure may lead to a major disaster for mankind. I think there is no doubt that there is need for an organization of some kind; the question is what sort of organization&#x003F; I believe it should be our function, and I believe that we would have the support of all responsible people in South Africa for that purpose, to suggest to the leading nations of the world that the time has come to convene a new constitutional conference for the United Nations Organization, a second San Francisco conference. Let us ask the major and mature nations of the world at that conference to accept the responsibility that history has entrusted to them and to lead the nations of the world into a new and reformed and more effective world body to take the place of the failure which is the United Nations Organization. Let them in that organization see to it that voting power is related to responsibility and get away from this utterly impractical proposition of &#x201C;one State one vote&#x201D;. We have the ridiculous situation that something like a 100 members of the Organization supply something like 2 per cent of its annual income. I believe that the major powers, after the experience that they have had with the League of Nations and with the present United Nations Organization, will not find it beyond their powers to devise a world organization which would be better equipped to achieve what I believe is the most fervent desire of us all, the most fervent desire of mankind, namely peace amongst the peoples of the world.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that a reformed world organization with the responsible nations of the world firmly in control will have very different ideas about what constitutes threats to world peace from those which are current at the United Nations Organization at the present time. Can you imagine a responsible world body with the western nations of the world firmly in the saddle for one moment suggesting that South Africa is a danger to world peace&#x003F; Can you imagine a reformed world organization seeing a danger to world peace in our administration of South-West Africa&#x003F; Is not really the answer to these problems a reformed world organization and is not an organization of that kind, appreciating its proper responsibilities, the answer to the sort of threats that have been made against us&#x003F; I believe that a very big responsibility rests upon the hon. the Prime Minister at this time. I believe that it should be the duty of South Africa, that it should be its function to give a lead in this regard at the present time. I <span class="col_7613-7614" refersTo="page_1068"/>believe that out of this conflagration in the Middle East may come some good and may come the possibility of creating something lasting and something on a firm foundation which could play a real role in maintaining world peace and not be the ridiculous debating chamber that the present organization has developed into. That is a lesson in the international sphere which gives food for thought as a result of this Middle East conflagration.</p>

<p>But I believe that there are other lessons to be learnt which are of application in the domestic sphere and which can be applied to South Africa. I would say that the first of those lessons is that those nations which rely on international organizations and even upon the guarantees of others to preserve their security in the present state of the world are building on shifting sands. I would say, secondly, that while good friends are indispensable in this dangerous world, military preparedness is the only safe shield behind which any nation can shelter. The third lesson is that a nation truly united and giving status and respect to all the citizens of which it is constituted, can bring to a crisis a united effort surpassing the power of the sum of the individuals constituting that nation. I think there are two more lessons. The fourth is that in these days of modern and sophisticated weapons highly educated troops, whether they be regular soldiers or not, are capable of an efficiency in warfare far in excess of that of the illiterate and semi-illiterate and far in excess of what illiterate and semi-illiterate nations can hope to muster. I think the fifth and the last lesson perhaps is that the military strength of a nation to-day cannot be divorced from and is in fact based on the quality of its scientists and its technologists and the strength of its economy.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, but I can assure you that it does not worry me if hon. gentlemen want to reveal their real character. It is against this background that I want to examine the record and achievements of the present Government in South Africa, and to facilitate that examination I want to draw attention to the fact that all the lessons to which I have referred relate to the security, the happiness and the prosperity of our people in the Republic at the present time. We on this side of the House in common with many responsible people in South Africa are not convinced that Government policies advance the greatest possible security of our people. Because economic strength plays such a big part in achieving security we feel strongly that the fantasy of separate development into separate states should not be allowed to limit our economic growth and our economic strength. The teeming millions of the Arab world, even when united, were no match for 2&#x00BD; million Israelis. And I believe it will be a most irresponsible act if this Government were to continue to fail to appreciate fully that our security is dependent vitally upon the strength of our economy and on maintaining our country as one economic unit, as opposed to dividing it up into a series of unities each of which may be weak in itself. I believe that we have to create a union, a national unity for our diverse population groups. I think it has been shown that a nation which is truly united is capable of tremendous effort and I believe that the strongest nations are those whose people are in fact most united and I think that the job of creating a love for one&#x2019;s country, which makes one willing to sacrifice everything in its defence, is the prime function of the Government. I believe that this Government cannot undertake that task while it is dreaming about creating an exclusive white state which it itself admits will probably be smaller and poorer than the Republic at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;safer&#x201D;. It might be safer, if you could divorce economic strength from military strength. But of course you cannot. You cannot divorce economic strength from military strength, and there is not the slightest doubt that at the moment South Africa&#x2019;s security is inevitably bound up with finding the right answer to the problem of co-operating in one state on harmonious terms with our non-white people here in the Republic. And I do not believe the Government has the answer. I believe it is turning its back on reality. They think that by creating fictitious forms of separation they can wipe out the non-white people from the picture in South Africa from a defence point of view. I think we should have new ideas, new ideas based on the certain conviction that they are right ideas for the time in which we live. Separation, as this Government envisages it. might have been possible in the time of Lord Glenelg a hundred <span class="col_7615-7616" refersTo="page_1069"/>years ago when they decided to separate South Africa from London with very little appreciation of the problems with which we were faced.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It will take some time. The federal concept recognizes not only that there are separate areas which different racial groups occupy but also that there are racial groups who do not occupy specific areas but retain their identity as a group, although geographically dispersed in the country. And they have to be given a place and a function in our State resting on their recognition as constituents of a federal South Africa. We believe that in this way we can make all the peoples of South Africa feel that they belong to one South African state. All the peoples owe loyalty to one South African state, and all the peoples of the Republic feel the at South Africa is entitled to claim everything they have in defence of our way of life. Let us make no mistake. South Africa is a multi-racial state. Eighty per cent of our labou&#x201D; forces is non-white and the number of non-Whites employed in certain sectors of our economy, like manufacturing industry and the Government service, are growing every day. The Government seems to shut its eyes to this fact and refuses to admit it. We realize that South Africa is made up of 3&#x00BD; million Whites charged with the responsibility of leading 14 million non-Whites, just as the major western powers of the world are charged with the responsibility of leading the emergent nations of the world. We believe that we have to arrange our affairs in such a manner that all of us will find it possible to live in one state on the basis of the leadership of the most civilized group, and that group happens to be the white group in South Africa. And we believe that that leadership should be maintained, but all others should be made to feel that they have a place and a part to play in the land of their birth, their one fatherland.</p>

He knows very well that the introduction of federal elements into a constitution does not mean a geographical federation of the Nigerian kind. But perhaps we will teach him in time. We all believe that there should be a large measure of self-government for the Bantu in the reserves. We also know that the Bantu in the reserves are too poor to make the creation of economically viable states possible. We also know that they are spread over South Africa to such an extent that it is going to be impossible for them all to find homes in the reserves even in the distant future. That is why we accept that we have to live together in South Africa while we accept that it is the task of statemanship in South Africa to make living together both peaceful and productive in the interests of all the peoples who live in the Republic of South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>We do not believe that we can limit cur relationship to them, on the one hand to the master relationship, as opposed to a soulless labour unit on the other.

I do not believe that we have any right to continue to regard them as a sort of faceless proletariat with no roots and no rights in the area where they work and spend most of their lives. I wish I could get the Government to see the justice and the inevitability of such a policy. Because we believe that the attitude they are taking up at the moment is giving us no answer, whereas the approach we have is an answer to the problem of living together. But what the hon. the Prime Minister is doing with the present policy he is following, is that he is endangering the safety of the Republic of South Africa and lessening its security and its power of resistance in a dangerous world. They are going to make it. impossible for us in South Africa to play our historical role of being the catalyst, which will make co-operation in the southern part of Africa possible so that all our peoples can prosper. I do not think we can do what the Government wants to do, namely to fix our sights on the little white enclave at the southern portion of Africa, waiting coyly for approaches of friendship by surrounding black states, whether we created them ourselves or not.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Is it so difficult for the hon. the Prime Minister to understand&#x003F; In the last debate we had in this House I said that all the Blacks in South Africa, in the reserves and out of the reserves, would have eight white representatives in the House. That is what I told the hon. the Prime Minister. He knows it. So I want him to think a little further to-day. I want him to be bold and think of the future of South Africa. I think that he must recognize that our strategic boundaries stretch as far north as Beira on the one side and the White highlands of Angola on the other. I believe that our policies must be such that all who live within those boundaries will not only seek the friendship of our Republic, but will find that association with us will be as much to their advantage as to ours and that eventually they will be prepared to assist in the defence of our interests as though they were their own. I believe that, as a basis for such a plan, we must devise political entities which will give us unity in diversity and maximum autonomy for the constituent elements, kept together by the protective association of close bonds between the various members. I do not believe that that can be better fulfilled than by the policy we have outlined, namely of introducing federal elements into our constitutional life, because I believe that only in such a way will we solve our internal problems and at the same time ensure our external security as well. I believe that only in that way will we bind all our peoples together with a common love, loyalty and patriotism, will we be strong enough to resist the onslaught of any enemy which may march against South Africa.</p>

<p>It is a pity that this Government is incapable of achieving that real national unity. It cannot even achieve that real national unity amongst the Whites in South Africa, because it is so riddled in its ranks with extremists, (&#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D;), that they are not seeking real national unity. They are only seeking cooperation on one-sided terms. They regard Afrikaner exclusiveness as more important than South Africanism. When people take up that attitude towards their fellow white South Africans, what hope have they of getting the loyalty and devotion for one South Africa <span class="col_7619-7620" refersTo="page_1071"/>from the non-White peoples as well. They have already admitted defeat when they tell one that they are encouraging those people to give their first loyalty to separate non-White states not yet created in the Republic. We on this side of the House have a vision for the future of white South Africa, and that is a new nation here in which both languages are accepted as part of the heritage of each South African and in which the history, traditions and culture of both the great sections of our white population will not only be accepted, but will be a source of pride and inspiration to every citizen in South Africa. We will judge the quality of citizenship by the dedication of people to South Africa and our South African problems. I believe that we can fashion the future of our non-White people in such a way that they will also have an overriding and common loyalty to one South Africa in which everybody is fairly and justly treated, but in which also, I believe, white leadership should be retained.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The word &#x201C;volk&#x201D;, unfortunately, has several meanings in South Africa. We speak about the &#x201C;Afrikanervolk&#x201D; as a distinctive people. If the hon. member means as part of the &#x201C;people&#x201D; of South Africa, of course they are part of the people of South Africa. What is more, the Nationalist Party made them part of the nation of South Africa. It gave them South African citizenship under the 1948 Citizenship Act specifically. I think that is the answer to the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>I believe that the white community of South Africa to-day have great opportunities to give imaginative and constructive leadership to the people under our guidance and care, leadership which will earn rich rewards for the white community in higher standards of living, but also greater security for White and non-White within the Republic of South Africa. As I indicated earlier, military strength is based on economic strength and on greater prosperity for all our people. I believe that prosperity in South Africa to-day is bound up with two fundamental factors: Firstly increasing the productivity of industry, and secondly, controlling inflation.</p>

<p>If we deal, firstly with the question of increasing the productivity of our labour force, particularly in industry, I think we can get our ideas straight as to what we should do about controlling inflation. I believe that we are not going to grow as fast as we should and I do not believe that we are going to have greater wealth and progress as long as we are tied to a Government which sees our development mainly in terms of the skills of only million people of an entire population of over 17 million. I know that is an unpleasant fact to swallow, when for many years the Government has been hypnotized into believing that such a course is possible. Of course it is impossible. But I shall go further and say that, if we continue in that belief, we will not only fail to solve the problem of healthy economic growth, but we will also fail to solve the problem of containing inflation and reducing the rise in the cost of living, which is such a headache to the Government at the present time and to most of our people. I believe that I could give hundreds of examples to show that. I want to give only three. The first is a statement by Mr. Kuschke, the managing director of the Industrial Development Corporation, which is as near the Government as makes no matter. Here is what he said last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Probably the most vital factor which will determine our future industrial expansion is the availability of skilled labour and management personnel. According to economic development programme estimates, we can expect a shortage of over 30,000 white workers by 1970. This disturbing fact calls for serious attention. Already the shortage is irrevocably increasing our cost structure as employers are bidding up one another in an effort to secure the services of the few available.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize the warning that this shortage is clearly irrevocably increasing our cost structure.</p>

<p>Then there was a warning on the 6th June of this year, only a few days ago, as published in the <i>Star</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A campaign to increase productivity cannot be delayed if the target set by the economic development programme is to be attained, said Dr. F. J. de Villiers, chairman of the Productivity Advisory Committee of the South African Bureau of Standards. He told the seventh annual meeting of the Institute of Organization and Methods: &#x201C;South Africa is becoming increasingly involved in keen competition on the local market and in international trade. Production costs are increasing apace. Strong inflationary forces are apparent in our economy. The growth rate target of 5&#x00BD; per cent a year was largely dependent on actual attainment of the required increased rates of productivity of 2.88 per cent every year. Even a fractional drop in productivity resulted in appreciable loss in the gross domestic product, which again meant a lower national income, and this in turn implied a lower real income per head and consequent lowering of the expected standard of living. Similarly, a fractional increase in productivity has a marked effect on economic growth. But only a quarter per cent increase in overall productivity, <span class="col_7621-7622" refersTo="page_1072"/>for example, may mean an addition of nearly R30 million a year to the gross domestic product.</block>

<p>I think that drives my point home very fully.</p>

<p>But there is one other quotation I would like to draw to the attention of the House, namely the report of the 1961 Education Panel, consisting of 22 of South Africa&#x2019;s most eminent educationalists and industrialists, entitled &#x201C;Education and the South African Economy&#x201D;. It starts from the premise that economic growth rests on three foundations, one of which is education and training. It draws up a programme for the next 15 years to ensure that education will play its part. But it emphasizes four facts. The first is that even drawing on all races to the greatest possible extent, it would be very difficult to provide enough educated people to fill the jobs which will exist by 1980. The second is that the Whites will have to surrender more administrative, technical and professional jobs for non-Whites, because there will not be enough trained Whites to go round. Thirdly, it points out that if these jobs cannot be filled, there will be less wealth available for everyone. Then it makes the final point that they do not believe, and they are the experts, that the need for more and more skilled people can be reduced by means of automation and the use of computers. That is vitally important, because we have heard so much of a reduction in labour that is going to be brought about by automation and computers. But these experts do not believe that. They say that the demand for skilled labour and technical people is going to go on growing and that there are signs even at the moment that we are not going to have enough people to fill all those jobs. So these experts prove my case against the Government up to the hilt.</p>

<p>But I want to draw attention to yet another facet of that problem, namely, that in spite of the rapid breakdown of the so-called traditional colour bar in many of our industries, the fact remains that our non-Whites, particularly the Bantu, in the training they are receiving are acquiring that training surreptitiously and not as of right. They are acquiring it by permit with a sword always being held over their heads&#x2014;the threat that they may be prevented from continuing to do the type of work they are allowed at present by virtue of permits and by virtue of the relaxation of job reservation determinations by the Government. I want to say that if the conditions under which our non-Whites work continue unchanged for any length of time, the vast bulk of South Africa&#x2019;s labour force is going to be in the position where it will be trained only sporadically and haphazardly for the jobs they are doing. Furthermore, they are going to be employed under conditions of impermanence and insecurity, conditions which are grossly unsuited to the demands of a modern labour force and of a modern industrial state, entirely unrealistic in relation to the demands of an increasingly sophisticated labour force. I believe we are going to be forced into a position, if these policies are continued, where the South African economy is going to be based on one of the most inefficient and potentially unstable labour forces in the world. This is going to be a result of these policies. The first essential for greater growth is that our labour force, consisting of all races, must be used more productively. That means training also for the non-White section of our labour force, because if we do not pull our non-White labour a rung or two up on the ladder, the gap below is going to become so large that we may slip off it ourselves into a void where we cease to be productive ourselves. The result of that may be that the standards of living of the Whites may decline, as well as their educational standards, because they will be held back to fill the gap between the standard reached by the non-White labour force and the standard of work being done by the White labour force at the present time. We believe that in causing our labour to be better trained, to be more productive, we will be making the largest single contribution towards the advancement of our standards and our security. We appreciate fully that the standard of life of the European worker must be maintained. Guarantees must be introduced to set at rest their fears that any such development is going to lower their standard of living.</p>

Sir, that hon. gentleman is to-day employing non-Europeans to do European work in many cases at a lower wage than that paid to the European worker. We, there again, want to ensure that no non-European worker will ever do work, previously done by a European, at <span class="col_7623-7624" refersTo="page_1073"/>a lower rate than that earned by the European himself. That, we believe, is the biggest protection that the European can have in South Africa at the present moment. This is something which he certainly does not have at the present time. We also believe that agreement between organized labour and organized management is another vital guarantee, subject, of course, to the rate for the job.</p>

<p>I also believe that greater resources must be mobilized for the education of our people and that to this end a higher proportion of the national income shall probably have to be devoted to educational objectives. That is an investment not only for the individual but also for the growth of our economy and the prestige of the Republic. The increase in population and the complexity of modern life make the continual raising of our educational standards of prime importance to South Africa. To enable the white race to retain and deserve its present position of leadership it is essential that our youth should be educated academically, scientifically and technically, to the highest possible degree. Therefore we should like to see special provision being made, provision which must include special schools for the unusually gifted children. We believe still far too many white children leave school, for economic and other reasons, before reaching the high standards of which they are capable and who as a result receive no education, vocational or otherwise, after leaving school. We believe it should be our aim to ensure that by the end of the next decade at least half of our children at school by then should complete 12 years of schooling and that of the white school-going population at least one quarter will receive further education after leaving school, either at the university, at technical colleges, or in vocational training schools. We realize that this is going to mean better paid teachers, more schools, more facilities for post-school education and training, changes in curricula, the greater use of modern aids&#x2014;such as audio-visual aids and closed circuit television. I hope this does not shock the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs too much. There should also be a continuous attempt to fit the type of schooling to the needs and capacities of the individual concerned. We believe there must be a greater incentive for individual excellence by way of scholarships, rewards and assistance to parents. We also believe that we shall have to take another look at our universities in order to restore them to their primary function as centres of learning and research and that we depart from this trend of making them large institutes for examination and the conferment of degrees, a trend which seems to be developing at the present time in many universities. This, in turn, will require further efforts, not only to retain our present teaching staff, but also to provide facilities whereby we shall not only encourage a larger number of our own people to join the teaching profession but also enable us to recruit successfully people overseas in order to make up the shortages we have at the present time.</p>

<p>I know that there are people who believe that the responsibility for ensuring sufficient skilled labour lies primarily with the employer in industry and manufacture. But what hope have these employers of training labour satisfactorily while this Government specifically prohibits the establishment of vocational training schools for Bantu in the areas where these are most needed, i.e. in and around the industrial complex of Johannesburg&#x003F; Furthermore, what hope have these employers of training their labour while being faced with job reservation determinations prohibiting him from using these people for more skilled work, even though they may use them only temporarily under exemption permits granted by the determination itself&#x003F; When people talk to me about employers being responsible for the training of their labour, I wonder whether this Government is helping or hindering the education and training of labour. If you look at what has been happening over the past few years one can only come to one conclusion, namely that this Government is hindering instead of helping that process. But there are still countless other examples. Other speakers can deal with that. I have, I think, established a case that in this regard the Government is not doing what it should to assist in the training of our labour force in South Africa.</p>

<p>When I said that our security was dependent on the strength of our economy I indicated that that in turn depended not only on productivity but also on controlling inflation. I suppose the best and simplest definition of inflation is &#x201C;too much money chasing too few goods and too few services&#x201D;. The result has been a rapid increase in the prices of those goods and services which are in short supply. As a matter of fact, that has probably been the main cause of inflation in South Africa over the last four years. And I think we are entitled to ask how and why this came about. What, in fact, created too much money in South Africa and what prevented a supply of goods and services of all kinds being available so as to keep prices down&#x003F; There are various reasons for this which have been debated in this House from time to time. I do not think I will be wrong if I summarized the main reasons in the following terms: Firstly, that owing to the Government&#x2019;s decision to prohibit the repatriation of foreign capital invested in South Africa at the time of Sharpeville, a great deal of money was locked up here and that by taking that measure, almost a panic measure, the Government prohibited not only the flight of funk capital from South Africa but also the no mal outflow of capital to be expected in any healthy economy. Secondly: Low interest rates arising from the abundance of money made borrowing easy and possibly too cheap. That must be coupled with the fact that investors for some years have been slow to invest and that there was a great leeway to make up. And, of course, private enterprise <span class="col_7625-7626" refersTo="page_1074"/>was no doubt encouraged by the Government to invest. We have heard the cry &#x201C;spend for posterity!&#x201D; The Government also applied import control in 1962 and encouraged replacement industries through fear that we would not be able to get supplies from the outside world. As a result the borrowing from banks and from other national institutions increased considerably by 1965 while the price of money was kept artificially low because the Government pegged interest rates on the 20th March, 1965. This meant more cheap and easy money and more investments. I believe the most important factor of all the factors which have helped to create inflation was the increase in the expenditure of the Government and other official bodies, especially over the last six or seven years. If one compares the Government&#x2019;s budget expenditure on revenue and loan accounts in 1960-&#x2019;61 with that in 1966-&#x2019;67 one finds an increase of 98 per cent over a period of six years. Clearly the Government has been spending a great deal of money in competition with private investors with this difference, i.e. that whilst the private investor has been spending his money on the production of capital goods, the money spent by the Government on the whole has been on things like buildings, roads, and things of that kind&#x2014; in short, unproductive things, not producing consumer goods.</p>

<p>Yes, and on defence. This, however, is also unproductive. The hon. gentleman should know it. However, nobody is arguing about that, but even without taking into consideration defence expenditure, the expenditure of this Government has been too rapid. It has increased too rapidly. But not only that. This Government whenever it wanted funds has been continually been putting its hands in the till of the Reserve Bank, through borrowings from the Reserve Bank instead of out of real savings by the people of South Africa. What has the result been&#x003F; The result of inflation always is a rapid rise in prices. What do we find here&#x003F; Between 1956 and 1961 prices rose by 10.6 per cent&#x2014;an average of 2.1 per cent per annum. Between 1961 and 1967. however, there was a rise of 15.9 per cent&#x2014;3.2 per cent per annum. We find the most rapid increase between 1963 and March of this year&#x2014;an increase of nearly 4 per cent per annum. The worst period has been the last two years, when there has been a rise of 4&#x00BD; per cent per annum. This is shown by the consumer price index for all items. It is almost twice the rate which is regarded as being consistent with a healthy economic development in any country. And what has the Government&#x2019;s reactions been&#x003F; Bearing in mind that inflation is a condition where too much money is chasing too few goods, what steps did this Government take to control inflation&#x003F; It concentrated on reducing the supply of money, more than on increasing the supply of goods, whilst either could have solved the problem. However, the Government concentrated on decreasing the supply of money rather than taking the positive step of increasing the supply of goods. It tried to reduce spending by the public by increasing taxation, wherein I include the loan levy, by more than R200 million in the last two budgets alone. This was done excessively at the expense of the small man. But it has done more. It has been taking money away by means of loan levies temporarily for use by the Government without indicating when these loan levies will be repaid. And I wonder when the time is going to be ripe within the next seven years. Only recently the Government decided to relax import control, but it certainly has not done enough to reduce its own expenditure or concentrating more on productive expenditure. In fact, many of the things the Government has done bears the imprint of &#x201C;too little, too late&#x201D;. For instance, it relaxed import control much later than it should have done.</p>

<p>There is very little it can do, except about things that might be productive, things like irrigation schemes and matters of that kind, schemes which can give a tremendous fillip to the national economy. We have had to wait 18 years for the Government to come to its senses about the Orange River scheme and if this had not been so we might have had a very different picture in South Africa to-day. But that is only one example. There is still the Berg River scheme here in the Western Province, a scheme which has been lying &#x201C;braak&#x201D; for heaven knows how long. There is also the Sand River scheme in the Hex River Valley, a scheme which, although started in 1946, is not yet completed. One wonders when they are going to get on with the job. There are still many other examples I can refer to.</p>

<p>As I was saying, there are other remedies for inflation. The Government, as I have said, did too little too late when it decided to relax import control when it did and curbed lending by the banks. We know how they allowed the banks to run wild for a while. What could have been done was to produce more goods more efficiently, and to come to grips with the rising cost of living. We have shown that we must have an adequate supply of trained people if we want to produce more goods. I believe the right course still is to emphasize more the necessity for an increase in the supply of goods and services rather than reducing <span class="col_7627-7628" refersTo="page_1075"/>the amount of money in circulation. Both methods are of course necessary but I think the emphasis should be on increasing production. That can be done, firstly, by relaxing import control even further and by avoiding over-hasty decisions on the establishment of import replacement industries, a factor which very often forces up costs and have no prospects, as far as we can see, of competing in world markets at any time in future. Secondly: We have to increase the supply of labour through greater emphasis on immigration, by greater employment of pensioners and by the avoidance of unreasonable interference with the supply of labour. In this regard I should like the hon. the Prime Minister to take particular notice of what is happening under the Department of Bantu Administration and Development here in the Western Cape. A third thing which could be done is to encourage established factories to increase output instead of emphasizing movement away to border areas which means new investment output and often very long delays in reaching the productive stage and higher cost to the consuming public. I also believe we could have encouraged the more efficient production of goods by the introduction of incentive bonus schemes throughout industry. We could have achieved that object by better training and better use of our labour resources and while a large proportion of our labour force consists of Bantu it is interesting to note what is going on in the field of Bantu education at the present time.</p>

<p>Here we have a picture of a great many people getting a little education and also a picture of thousands of children clamouring for education but never getting to school at all. We find that one in five leave after the first year and that 75 per cent leave school before Std. VI. Only about three per cent ever reach high school. The pupil/teacher ratio we find to be 53 to 1 and many of these teachers do not even have a matriculation standard. In primary schools one finds that children can go to school only on alternate days or in double shifts. There are even cases of several children sharing one desk and text books. How are we going to get a more efficient labour force unless more attention is paid to the education of the labour we have to use&#x003F; Look at what is being done in Japan. Look how she has built up her productivity by means of tremendous education schemes amongst her people. Also, we could have encouraged more efficient production by higher depreciation allowances for the most up to date labour-saving machinery and by the provision also of adequate up to date statistics to assist private enterprise and the Government to plan more effectively. There would also have to be measures to curb excessive spending. With that I agree. That can be achieved, firstly, by a tighter control over hire-purchase restrictions and on easy bank advances&#x2014;something which deserves the attention of the hon. the Minister of Finance &#x2014;by the maintenance of high interest rates to encourage savings and limit borrowings even for investment by industry, and by the encouragement of big business to invest some of its surplus money in educational training schemes&#x2014;something for which we have been asking for so long but which nevertheless does not seem to be actively encouraged by the Government.</p>

<p>But even more important than these is the necessity of strict measures to curb wasteful, unproductive and excessively large long-term expenditure. This, I believe, can be done first of all by demanding greater efficiency from Government Departments. In this connection I was interested to read in one of the papers which periodically supports the hon. the Prime Minister, an article calling particularly for an end to maladministration of Government Departments, saying that it is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s main task in the recess to give his attention to stream-lining the Civil Service and to make it more efficient.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Before the adjournment I was dealing with the question of containing inflation and indicated that while the Government had emphasized restricting the supply of money available, inflation could also be combated by making more goods and services available. I indicated that I believed that could be done in various ways and I outlined some of the manners in which more efficient production could take place. I reached the stage where I said that even more important than these would be strict measures to control excessively long-term unproductive and wasteful expenditure. I believe that this could be done in three ways, firstly by demanding proof of greater efficiency in Government Departments, which I thought could be achieved by insisting that organization and method reports on the various Departments be tabled in Parliament. I also believe that a Select Committee to determine priorities in Government expenditure and to determine manpower priorities in the Public Service might perform a useful function. Then I think there should be a re-assessment of the value for money aspect in respect of money invested in the border areas and hasty ideological development in the placement of industries with a view very largely to carrying out the ideological objective of ultimate independence for the Bantu areas. I want to say that I make no bones about the fact that I should like to see the Government&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council preparing two estimates of South Africa&#x2019;s economic progress. One estimate should be in regard to the development of the Bantustans towards freedom and the removal of the black workers in the white areas as the main objective; and the other should be in regard to the maximum development of South Africa and the maximum improvement in the standard of living. Those should be the two main targets. I feel that if the Government <span class="col_7629-7630" refersTo="page_1076"/>is sincere in its objectives in regard to the Bantu areas, then it is only right that it should give the white people of South Africa a choice of this kind based on economic findings of its own Economic Advisory Council. If that were done and the Prime Minister brought those estimates to Parliament, particularly if they were drawn in such a way that the public would understand the reasoning, I would like to see them left to a free vote in this House, to see what the result would be. I believe there is not the slightest doubt that we are paying a far bigger price than is realized for many of the ideological concepts of the Government.</p>

<p>Then I believe, lastly, that we could contain inflation further by reducing various Government costs and charges, many of them due to the incompetence of this Government. I believe that South Africa is a fortunate country in that it is endowed with natural resources and human material of a very high standard indeed. For that to be developed to the maximum advantage of all our people will require proper and realistic planning on the facts as they are and not as the Government would like to see them. We could be a rich country, far richer than we are to-day, if we had a more efficient Government, one which paid attention to economics rather than to ideological pipe-dreams. Not only could we be richer, but militarily we could be very much stronger if we had a Government which was prepared to look the facts in the face and not to distort its thinking with narrow sectional and ideological ideas. I do not believe that we give the lead in international affairs which is our right and of which we are capable. I have made certain suggestions in that respect and I do not propose to debate them any further. In the field of domestic policy I am satisfied that much more could be done to strengthen our economy if certain suggestions I put before the House to-day were followed. I believe that not only could we strengthen our economy, but we could raise the living standards of all our people and provide an even firmer base for those measures which will secure the safety and inviolability of the future of the Republic. I want to say that prosperity has always been a base upon which security could be built, because happiness is most easily attained where people are secure and where they have high living standards, but at the same time have a real sense of function in striving for great ideals. I do not believe that this Government is offering the people of South Africa the ideals of which they are worth, and accordingly I want to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government has failed to take adequate measures to promote the security, prosperity and happiness of the people and has through its maladministration retarded the achievement of those aims&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition divided his speech into two parts. The first dealt with foreign affairs and the second with domestic matters. As usual the hon. the Leader covered a wide field, and he will naturally realize that time will not allow me to deal with all the aspects that he dealt with. However, I do want to deal with those aspects which fall within the scope of my position.</p>

<p>I want to say at once that as regards the hon. the Leader&#x2019;s summing up of the foreign position, I want to compliment him on making a reasonably good summary, as one would expect from the Leader of an Opposition, of the speeches that I made at Potchefstroom and Vryheid. I want to tell him in all honesty that I have no fault whatsoever to find with it. Nor, for that reason, will it be necessary for me to say much in that regard. But I shall nevertheless, as I go along, deal with certain aspects thereof.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. the Leader spoilt that part of his speech by once again raising the cry, which one has heard quite often from the United Party this Session, that it is their policy which we are carrying out.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have been saying for a long time that the Opposition has no function. It is only that they have never wanted to admit it. With this argument, of course, they are specifically admitting that they have no function whatsoever. It is not only the hon. the Leader who thinks so; the general public also think so. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition put me very much in mind of a competition that was organized years ago for an essay on elephants. Various people wrote essays on elephants and then somebody produced a pamphlet to which he gave the title &#x201C;Bigger and better elephants&#x201D;. What else does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s speech amount to but that everything that we are doing&#x2014;so he says, and so he wants to make the country believe&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will do better. [Interjections.] Sir, I readily agree with that; not even the hon. member for Yeoville would go so far as to say that they can do everything better. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party did after all have an opportunity, a long time ago, admittedly, but was his party not rejected precisely as a result of the clumsiness with which it conducted the administration of the State&#x003F; Sir, surely that has become part of history; we need not even argue about it. Surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did have the opportunity from time to time of stating his viewpoint and his policy, and time and again he was rejected to an ever-increasing extent by the electorate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us first deal with foreign affairs. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out here that the United <span class="col_7631-7632" refersTo="page_1077"/>Nations had failed. He could simply have pointed out that the National Party Government had over the years&#x2014;specifically Mr. Eric Louw, when he appeared at the United Nations, and my colleague, the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, after him&#x2014;adopted the attitude that the United Nations would fail if it did not change its ways, and what the National Party Government has been warning against all these years has now come to pass. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will also concede that in those years the National Party Government did not receive much assistance from hon. members on the opposite side. At the moment I am not discussing the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s present attitude; I shall return to that later on.</p>

<p>One of our basic problems was the very fact that we did not receive much assistance from them. Sir, there are two things which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say to-day which I am very glad about and for which I thank him. The first is that he did not, as he used to do in the past, say that these conditions had arisen as a result of the policy of the Government. I am pleased that he has changed his attitude as far as that is concerned. The second thing I am glad about is that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say again&#x2014;and you will remember, Sir, that he said so consistently in the past; in fact, he never let an opportunity for saying so go by&#x2014;that if he came into power, the picture would be changed overnight. I am glad he did not say that to-day. The hon the Leader of the Opposition will know that many of our past difficulties&#x2014;and I am not saying this because I want to rake up the past; I want to enter upon a new dispensation together with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;were due to the fact that South Africa did not speak with one accord in regard to these matters. I am glad that we have now reached the stage where we are in fact able to speak with one accord in this regard. While the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now reproached us with not making any constructive contribution in respect of the constitution of the United Nations, he will remember that we specifically warned that the United Nations was going to land in this fix in which it now finds itself because it applied double standards. From time to time we on this side had a very great deal to say about those matters. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will recall how we pointed out that there would have to be stronger leadership from the great nations, particularly the Western nations, leadership which has not been forthcoming from them.</p>

<p>The basic difficulty that developed with the United Nations over the years was that it drifted further and further away from its original aims, that it began to fall, to an ever-increasing extent, into the hands of professional world agitators, if I may put it like that, who moved all the resolutions in the General Assembly, and all that the independent, responsible and developed nations could do was to move amendments so as to water down those resolutions or effect changes in them, instead of taking a stand and saying to those nations, who cannot rule their own countries but who want to rule the world, &#x201C;so far and no further&#x201D;. That is what we have been pleading for all these years. And now that I have again said over the week-end, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also did here to-day, that we believe that there will be a reappraisal, one would like to express the hope and the expectation that that reappraisal will include proper guidance to the representatives of the underdeveloped nations as to how to act in a world assembly. Once that is achieved, we will have achieved a great deal in that regard. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said quite rightly that one of the real reasons for the failure of the United Nations was the fact that no leadership was provided by the major countries; that is correct. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will recall that the National Party Government has on many occasions issued warnings in regard to this very aspect, and the reproach that was leveled at us from the other side was that we should not tilt at the larger nations. I am glad that there has been a change in this situation. I want, once more, to associate myself with the idea of a reformation expressed by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want, once more, to express the view here which I have expressed on numerous previous occasions, i.e. that one of the basic deficiencies in the United Nations, as I see it, is that majority decisions are being taken by the representatives of small, inexperienced, underdeveloped nations, while the United Nations Organization can serve a very useful purpose. One does not close one&#x2019;s eyes to the useful purpose it can serve. I believe that it will not fail in its function but will succeed if it were to deprive the General Assembly of its voting rights altogether, that is, if it were to remain merely a forum for discussion, if it were to remain merely a place where people could exchange ideas and where the representatives of the various nations could meet to discuss matters of common interest, where opposing viewpoints could be put, and where dangers could be pointed out, etc., and if resolutions, which recently have more and more displayed a tendency towards world government, were done away with altogether.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. as he has so often done in the past, made oblique reference to our in actual fact being an outcast in the world, whereas in the time of the United Party Government we were in high repute in the world. In that regard he again mentioned the name of the late General Smuts.</p>

<p>Sir, has the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ever made an analysis of our problems at the World Organization&#x003F; After all, our problems at the World Organization did not originate under the National Party regime. Our problems at the World Organization arose shortly after its establishment when General Smuts was present there in person and when the majority of the members was not made up of the underdeveloped nations who are there at present, but when our friends were in power in the World Organization. After all, our difficulties there began when there were only three black representatives from Africa sitting in the World Organization. In fact, our difficulties began with India when we were still part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Not even General Smuts, when he was at the height of his glory, was able to ward off the attacks made by India in the World Organization. He was unable to do that. In spite of all the work he had done for the British Empire, in spite of the fact that he was a world figure, which he in fact was, he was unable to ward off those attacks against South Africa. It would profit the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to go and reread the history of the period from 1946-&#x2019;8. I said on a former occasion&#x2014;and it must now be repeated here merely for the sake of the record&#x2014;that before the National Party took over the government in South Africa, the same attacks were being made on South Africa under the government of General Smuts, but immediately after the National Party Government took over it suited the Opposition of that time and its newspapers to proclaim to the world that the bad name which South Africa then had was attributable to the policy of the National Party Government. They did that although it was a matter which went back a long way and had originated at a time when General Smuts was at the height of his power.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader said that there were encouraging signs that better relations had developed. That is correct. The hon. the Leader will also recall that I had held out the prospect of these better relations last year already, just after I had assumed this office. The hon. the Leader will recall that the hon. member for Constantia asked me the question, &#x201C;How would you do it&#x003F;&#x201D;. He will also recall that my reply was:</p>

<p>&#x201C;By doing it.&#x201D; That is precisely what we have done. I can tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that I have been able to do so because the foundations which would enable me to do so had been correctly laid by my worthy predecessor. I have been able to do so because I merely had to take up where he had left off.</p>

<p>Let us consider the facts for a moment. I want to make the claim that, apart from the embargo placed on the supply of arms to South Africa&#x2014;and we all know the history of that and why it came about&#x2014;the Republic under this National Party r&#x00E9;gime has never enjoyed such good foreign relations as it is enjoying at present. What were the facts&#x003F; The facts were that in the hon. members&#x2019; time we only had relations with Britain; we had few if any relations with any other country in the world. We paid visits to Britain, but few visitors from Britain came here to South Africa. I am referring to government visits. But since the National Party came into power, since we established the Republic to which we had aspired, we abandoned the policy which the hon. gentlemen on the opposite side followed of having all one&#x2019;s eggs in one basket. We sought to establish relations as widely as possible. We have been doing so particularly in recent years. Just think of the number of visits we have had from high-ranking government representatives from other countries. We have had visits this year; in the recess we shall be paid visits by very eminent government representatives from various parts of the globe. If one considers not only our political relations but also our trade relations and all kinds of other relations, one is fully justified in saying that, apart from the embargo on the supply of arms. South Africa&#x2019;s relations have never before been as good as they are at this very moment. I believe that in view of the events outlined by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and which my hon. colleagues and I have been discussing during the past few days, relations can only improve, and must, in fact, improve.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader concluded his remarks on that aspect of the foreign relations by saying that no constructive suggestions had been put forward by us. I have already dealt with that. We have put forward suggestions over the years. We have been doing so again recently, and we shall do so again in the future. I want to repeat here what I said at Beaufort West, and that is that the time will come, if no reappraisal is made, if things are simply allowed to continue in the old vein, when we shall make a very careful examination of the balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages attaching to our membership of the United Nations. That time will definitely come. But I hope that it will not become necessary, because an international organization can fulfil a useful function. I hope that it will not become necessary for us, but that in fact all of us, just as in the case of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and myself, will see that there has been a reappraisal.</p>

<p>In his survey of domestic affairs the hon. the Leader first of all made the point that those who put their trust in international organizations. have found that they built on sand. That is true, and it has always been the viewpoint of this side over the years. To tell the truth, there was a time in our political history&#x2014;and one need only look up Hansard to see this&#x2014;when that was in fact one of the most important things which distinguished this <span class="col_7635-7636" refersTo="page_1079"/>side of the House from that side. The hon. the Leader said we must be militarily strong. He is aware of the fact that this Government has over the years left no stone unturned in keeping South Africa as strong as possible in the military sphere, considering its small size, its means and its problems as a result of the arms embargo. He referred to the need for trained persons. This topic was debated when the measure of my colleague the Minister of Defence was before Parliament&#x2014;I need not refer to it again. He pointed out that use should be made of the services of science. These are not matters that one discusses every day, but the hon. the Leader is aware that there is very close co-operation between the scientific sphere and the military authorities here in South Africa, which has already been of great benefit to South Africa and will also be of great benefit in future.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader referred to national unity. He took as his slogan: Security, happiness and prosperity. Then he immediately went on to refer to the &#x201C;fantasy&#x201D; of separate development. I agree with the hon. the Leader that South Africa, and any other country, needs security, happiness and prosperity. I am quite prepared to compare the security, the happiness and the prosperity which our people are at present enjoying with that which they had under the United Party r&#x00E9;gime. I am quite prepared to do that. What is more, we need not argue about the matter. After all, that is what everyone is seeking, whether he be a National Party supporter or a United Party supporter, namely security, happiness and prosperity. How are our people seeking these things&#x003F; Our people are all seeking them. What is more, periodically they get an opportunity of expressing their opinions on those matters. Then they must choose between the party of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and my party. As responsible voters our people have, from time to time, exercised their choice. Therefore we need not try and hoodwink them. We need not try and tell them this, that or the other thing, because at every election they make their choice. Only last year our people once again pronounced their judgment. On that occasion too the hon. the Leader came forward with his &#x201C;blueprint&#x201D;. It is not a new idea. As a matter of fact, the hon. the Leader does not come forward with many new ideas. This was an idea which was put forward throughout that election. Our people had it in front of them. They rejected the hon. the Leader more decisively than ever before. I shall tell him why they rejected him. They rejected the hon. the Leader and his party because year in and year out he had blown both hot and cold. The reason why they rejected the hon. Opposition is that our people have never known where they stand with the Opposition. They do not know even now. I want to give you an example of that. Sir. My colleague the Minister of Transport put a question very politely to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in respect of his federation. He received a cutting reply. But what are the facts&#x003F; The facts do not tally with the cutting reply furnished by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Is it not a fact that we have already had three different kinds of federation from the Opposition side&#x003F; There was the race federation. There was the territorial federation. Do hon. members remember the standpoint of the hon. member for Yeoville&#x003F; At one stage he came forward with an economic federation in terms of which people&#x2019;s voting power was to be determined according to the revenue produced by them. There were three kinds of federation therefore, an economic federation, a race federation and a territorial federation. I am not talking now about the small federation of the hon. member for Hillbrow. He still has his own idea of federations, but that is beside the point at the moment. The hon. the Leader refers so easily to his policy. Then he merely states that it is well-known and that it has been published in book form. It has been published in book form and then the argument, as far as he is concerned, is closed. [Interjection.] No, it is not the sixpence policy. This one was a trifle more expensive and came at a later stage. The hon. the Minister of Transport asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether it was a race federation or whether it was a territorial federation. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made great play of the racial aspect of the federation being merely of subsidiary importance. The main thing was the territorial federation. Then he referred once more to his booklet. But what is stated in the booklet&#x003F; This is what is stated in the booklet.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to get hold of the booklet. But let me say at once that I would also hide it away if it were mine.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had not been asleep while his Leader was speaking, he would have heard him say so just before lunch, because it is stated in the booklet. On page 10 of the booklet we read the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be noted that a race federation is not a territorial federation such as that of the United States of America or the one tried in Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It is quite a different idea. As far as the United Party&#x2019;s plan is concerned, the accent falls on the race groups and not on the geographical units.</block>

<p><span class="col_7637-7638" refersTo="page_1080"/>That is not what the hon. the Leader told us before lunch. Or does the policy vary before and after lunch&#x003F; There is a very good reason for this. The reason why the hon. the Leader gave out before lunch that the main accent did not fall on the racial aspect but on the territorial aspect is that he knows that if there is one thing that neither National Party supporter nor United Party supporter wants to have anything to do with then it is his race federation, then it is a federation in which the main accent falls on the racial aspect.</p>

<p>I also put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the respresentation in this Parliament. I put this question deliberately because I just wanted to take a pressure reading on this occasion. I wanted to see how high the pressure is to-day. The last exchange between the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I ended with a discussion on the topic of pressure. At that time the standpoint of the hon. the Leader was as follows, and I want to take this matter further with him to-day; he will remember, for the sake of the record, that he again mentioned White representation in this Parliament. I then asked him what had happened that he was no longer foreshadowing, as he had previously done, that the representatives would ultimately be black. The hon. the Leader then said that what had happened was that the pressure that had existed previously no longer existed. Nothing has done the Opposition more damage than that admission on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>You should rather leave the late Prime Minister and myself to our policy and our party. Defend your side of the matter if you can.

[Interjections.] Forget about the independence now, because we are dealing with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition now. The colour of his representation depends upon the pressure which is brought to bear on him. At that time I was rather kind to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. and referred to the pressure from the black people. He then realized in what difficulties he had landed himself with his admission, and said that it was not the pressure from the black people, but that it was the pressure in his own party. His words were: &#x201C;I know my people.&#x201D;. Who are the people in his party who want black representation&#x003F; it would give us an interesting insight into the inner circles of the United Party it the hon. member would now explain that to us.

<p>Our point of view has always been that it is wrong in principle for non-Whites to be represented in this Parliament.

Does the hon. member recall what opposition we encountered from their side when the Bantu representatives in this House were abolished&#x003F; Do they recall that&#x003F; Do they recall that that was the reason why they are now saddled with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x003F; Now that I have said that, I want to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In the course of his speech he spoke, amongst other things, about Bantu education and about the education of the Coloured groups, and he had a good deal to say about that. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition recall what opposition we encountered from him and his party, when they forced us into night sittings when we wanted to establish certain facilities for higher education for the Coloured groups in South Africa&#x003F; [Interjections.] The fact of the matter is simply that if we had not established those facilities the Coloureds would not to-day have had a higher educational institution at which to equip their people for the task they have to fulfill. If we had not established those facilities in spite of extremely bitter opposition from the United Party then the black people of the future would not have had those opportunities and facilities for the education of their leaders.</p>

[Interjection.] If that is not what it means, then hon. members on the opposite side must tell us what it does mean. I and my party stand for the retention of dividing lines between colour groups here in South Africa. Do the hon. members also stand for that now&#x003F; If they do stand for that, why are they continually arousing suspicion against separate development&#x003F; Why do they get angry, as the hon. member for Kensington got angry, when we tell them what they did in the past in this regard&#x003F;</p>

<p>The day will come when the hon. member for Kensington will claim that he was the founder of separate universities in South Africa. But I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this: Let us give this matter our serious attention for a moment. What do we achieve by attacking the retention of dividing lines on the basis of colour, by casting suspicion on the matter, by inciting people against it, if we are not prepared to eliminate them&#x003F; If one is not prepared to eliminate them, and according to the hon. member for Pinelands it is evidently not the United Party&#x2019;s policy to do so, what does one achieve by arousing suspicion in regard to their retention&#x003F; Then surely one is not serving South Africa and its interests. Then surely one is not creating the security which the hon. the Leader has stated he wants to create. Then surely one is not bringing satisfaction to the people, as the hon. the Leader has said he wants to do. Then surely one is creating a source of new agitation, and we all realize that what we want, and what we must have, here in South Africa is the elimination of friction in every sphere. But then surely one is encouraging friction. Then one is drawing the people together so that it must necessarily cause friction. The hon. the Leader knows our political history as well as I do. Is he prepared to say that before 1948 there was less friction than there is in South Africa to-day&#x003F; You will recall, Sir, that my predecessor repeatedly mentioned from this bench that before 1948 there had been many more disturbances amongst the black people in South Africa than the total number of disturbances under the r&#x00E9;gime of this Government. These are facts that we can verify; we need not even argue about them.</p>

<p>Yes, we introduced the laws relating to sabotage in order to obtain security for South Africa, but the hon. member for Wynberg was not interested in that. I would not like to have to reproach the United Party again for their actions during that period of our history. This is the choice facing South Africa: either we must decide to retain the racial boundaries, or we must decide to do away with them. One cannot retain them a little and remove them a little, if that is the next course which the hon. member for Yeoville is considering. One cannot pride oneself in practice on the fact that one is enjoying the protection, the security and the happiness brought about by boundaries that exist, and then in theory want to do away with them in <span class="col_7641-7642" refersTo="page_1082"/>order to derive dubious political advantage by that means.

<p>Does the hon. member now want to state in advance that he is prepared to implement apartheid&#x003F; [Laughter.] No, we must not waste time by arguing in this way.</p>

<p>That brings me to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Because this is the one outstanding political issue our people expect him to take a permanent decision. Either we retain boundaries or we do away with them. On my part and on the part of my predecessor, we have stated quite clearly that as far as we are concerned we not only want to retain the boundaries, but we want to develop them properly. We know that it is a long process. We know that there is still much to be done towards that end, but we accept it in all its logical conclusions. Why does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not accept it as well&#x003F; If he, as his spokesmen have indicated outside as well as by way of interjection here, also wants to retain the dividing lines, I want to ask him how one can retain them if one arouses suspicion in regard to them&#x003F; How can one retain them if one incites the various racial groups against one another, as that side has so often done, as they have done this Session, as responsible members of the United Party have done both within this House and outside&#x003F; Then it makes no difference to me whether one hides behind a figleaf, as the hon. member for Karoo is doing, who states that it is his personal point of view and not that of the United Party. I simply cannot understand how a man can sit in the caucus of a party and then state another point of view, which is not his party&#x2019;s point of view, outside. I have never been able to understand that.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that everything can be reduced to the fact that there are various pressure groups within the United Party and that the Leader of the Opposition, in a candid moment, told us here in the House of Assembly that the colour of his representation will depend on the pressure which will, at any given time, exist within the ranks of his party. The time has come for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to make a choice in this regard between the one group or the other within his party. I want to give him the assurance, because I think he knows his people just as well as I do, that his people outside, just as our people, do not want racial boundaries abolished. His own people do not want the multi-racial society which the United Party Whip, the hon. member for North Rand, wrote about in the newspaper the other day when he made a moving appeal to organized commerce for funds for the United Party to establish the multi-racial society. Our people do not want that. It is not only my people who do not want that, the hon. the Leader&#x2019;s own people do not want that either.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went further and suggested that the happiness, the security and the prosperity of our people was not to be found under this regime because we were allegedly not doing enough for the education of our children. But the hon. the Leader forgets that it was under this very Government that numerous institutions for higher education which we have to-day in South Africa were established, and that it was under this very Government that two universities have just been established, and that every development which has taken place in the field of higher education, has taken place under this Government. When the party of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was in power, as it was in the Transvaal Provincial Council up to 1949, the position was that on the entire East Rand there were only two Afrikaans high schools. In the whole of Johannesburg there was virtually no high school whatsoever, except the Helpmekaar High School. Just consider what the position was in the Transvaal and the other Provinces when the United Party was in power there. Sir, is it not this very Government which has gone out of its way with its legislation on the Advisory Education Council to draw educational resources together in order to promote education in South Africa&#x003F; And what support was forthcoming from hon. members on the opposite side in this regard&#x003F;</p>

These are facts which convey their own message to us, and they are not only facts which convey a message to us, but also facts which are known outside.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is now speaking of national unity, and with that he wants to indicate more specifically that he wants to further the relations between the two white language groups, Afrikaans and English-speaking. I listened to him, just as I listened to the previous speakers in that regard. There is only one way to further national unity and that is the way in which this side of the House has always tried to do so. It is in the first instance to appeal to our people to become bilingual. I asked the hon. member for Durban (Point) on a previous occasion to make an appeal of that nature to our people on behalf of his party, and he did not do so.

I have per heard the hon. member plead that English-speaking children should be educated through the medium of Afrikaans.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that every person who has the interests of his children at heart believes that his children must be given the best education, and in order to provide one&#x2019;s child with the best education, the child must be educated in the language which he can understand and which he speaks at home. That is the policy and the viewpoint of this side. I now want to tell hon. members of the Opposition this: If they state from political platforms outside&#x2014;and they are doing so&#x2014;that they want to bring the children together in one school, then they do not mean that seriously, then they are simply saying that because they want to make propaganda, for they never did it in practice when they had the chance to do so.</p>

<p>They simply did not do so, and if they were to come into power to-morrow, they would still not do so. They tried it once in the Transvaal, and there is not a single educationist who does not know that it was the most abject failure which any party has ever experienced in the field of education. They also know that that was one of the reasons why their own people voted against them in the 1948 election. Our people simply did not want to have anything to do with this absurdity. Sir, there is only one way of furthering national unity &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Yeoville must not argue so heatedly with the hon. member over there in regard to what their party&#x2019;s policy is; it would be better if they settled the matter in the coffee lounge. There is only one way of bringing about national unity in South Africa, and that is to accord equal treatment to Afrikaans and English as the two official languages of the country, and that is the attitude which the National Party has adopted all these years. In order to accord equal treatment to both, it is essential that our people should be bilingual and that there should be mutual respect for each other&#x2019;s culture and language in South Africa. I am aware that hon. members sitting on that side have all these years led the English-speaking people to believe that the National Party is the enemy of the English-speaking people in South Africa.</p>

<p>I only quoted the headlines of the report on the hon. member&#x2019;s speech as it appeared in the <i>Natal Mercury.</i> That appeal did not succeed, nor will it succeed in future. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition need not present himself and his party as being the people who will bring about national unity in South Africa, nor is it necessary to bring about that unity, for the <span class="col_7645-7646" refersTo="page_1084"/>National Party has already done so. The fact of the matter is that relations between Afrikaans and English-speaking people, whether it be in the business world or in the social sphere or wherever it may be, have never been as good as they are to-day, because the National Party has in practice demonstrated to the English-speaking people that it believes in equal treatment, because the National Party has proved in practice that it will not demand anything for itself, in spite of the fact that the majority of its members here are Afrikaans speaking, which it is not also prepared to give the English-speaking people. We are committed to that. We did not merely talk about it; we also applied it in practice. Sir, on a previous occasion I invited hon. members on that side to bring it to my notice if what I have just said, was not applied in practice. I have committed myself to adhere to that, and up to now I have heard nothing in that regard from hon. members on that side, nor will they find such cases, because this policy of according equal treatment is not an innovation on the part of this Government. You will see, Sir, that the late General Hertzog stated that as the policy of the National Party as far back as 1st April, 1915.</p>

<p>But what the hon. member has not explained to us is why they stabbed General Hertzog in the back when he stood for &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. The hon. member must explain that to us. Sir, Afrikaans and English-speaking people will have to enter the future together, and they will do so within the National Party and under the National Party. This was not only demonstrated to us during the last election, but it is also being demonstrated by the actions of our people at the moment. In his motion and in his amendment the hon. member spoke of security. If the matter is considered from all angles, can he, in view of the threat which was and still is hanging over us, give the people more security than the National Party has given them&#x003F; Is it not a fact that people voted for us precisely because we gave them that security&#x003F; Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not himself admit during the last election that that was the reason why people were voting for the National Party, namely that it had given them security&#x003F; Did he not do so at Benoni. and at many other places&#x003F; What does he think he is going to achieve now by talking about security here and by adopting a pious attitude in that regard, while he is aware and the country outside is aware, that it is this Government which has given them security&#x003F;</p>

<p>We do not for a moment wish to state that we have solved all the problems of South Africa, but what we do want to say is that we are solving them one after the other. We are solving them in the international sphere by means of the relations which we are establishing and by means of the relations which we will establish to an increasing extent in future. We are solving our internal difficulties in a practical way for all to see. We will have bottlenecks from time to time, as we have had inflation precisely as a result of the fact that there was over-development and, one may almost say, over-confidence in the future of South Africa. We have discussed it in all its aspects in this House. The hon. member referred to the millions spent on water conservation in the years during which the National Party has been in power. The Ministers in question furnished the full particulars in this regard in the House, and the hon. member is aware of that. Surely it is not an argument to say that this or that scheme has not been built&#x003F; Of course there are many schemes which can be built if the necessary money is available. The question is whether one has in fact built schemes. Surely the hon. member is aware of how many millions we have spent on those schemes&#x003F; If we had not done so, is the hon. member aware of what the consequences would have been for South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition thinks that our people are going to allow themselves to be caught by a lame argument, by being told that they must vote for the United Party if they want security and prosperity, if he wants to tell our people that they can acquire happiness if they support the United Party, then surely he knows in advance that he is making a mistake in that regard. In one election after another our people have, to an ever-increasing extent, given their support to the National Party, and they have done so because we have had a clear policy, a foreign policy as I have outlined here today and a domestic policy based on separate development in all its implications. Our people are aware of that, and not only are they aware of that, but they also accept it. What is more, the hon. the Leader&#x2019;s people also accept it. There is no mistrust amongst the voting public towards the National Party; there is only an increasing trust that will be reaffirmed in future, a trust which is justified because the National Party has at all times put the interests of South Africa first.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister addressed the House for nearly an hour. I am afraid that his memory is faulty at times when it comes to the early history of this country. He divided his speech into two portions, one dealing with the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s address to this House on external matters, and the other on internal matters. On external matters he said that he welcomed the change. Put can I remind the hon. the Prime Minister that it was only a few years ago that the Leader of the Opposition made a plea to the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Eric <span class="col_7647-7648" refersTo="page_1085"/>Louw, that South Africa should have representatives in other parts of Africa, and that we should attempt to have contact with other African states and even accept African leaders and politicians here as representing their countries, if that was necessary. Not only was the hon. Leader of the Opposition castigated, but he was ridiculed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and supported by all members on the other side. Now, when the Nationalist Party makes progress and the Prime Minister meets leaders from other countries, and we approve of it, the Prime Minister has the audacity to thank us for coming to his way of thinking. Have you ever seen such impudence&#x003F; Then the Prime Minister deals with internal affairs. On internal affairs he simplifies facts very easily. He forgets that from apartheid we have now come to separate development over the years. Separate development was never referred to in 1948. The slogan was apartheid. He suggests that over the years there has been no change in policy. I remember that when the Leader of the Opposition years ago referred to the fact that one day there would be independent states, the Minister of Transport howled him down. The Minister of Transport said it was absolutely untrue and that no such thing would happen. Is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s memory so short&#x003F; I heard the Minister of Transport say that in this House. He ridiculed this side of the House because we suggested that there would be independent states. But now when the Nationalist Party has that policy, they say that it has always been its policy. That is how things have changed. I am afraid the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reasoning is false. Then he comes with the proposition that one has either got to have their policy or a completely mixed society. Let us examine his policy. He says his policy is separate development. Does he mean separate development at all stages&#x003F; Does he mean separate economic development&#x003F; Because that is a logical consequence. When you have separate development you have the Coloured people having their own factories, shops, bottle stores, hotels &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>This whole border policy can be proved to be nonsense. It will lead to nonsense eventually. I think I have said sufficient to show that the Prime Minister when he wants to deal with logic has to bring a better case than he brought to-day. When he talked on the international plane, he brought a certain amount of reason to bear on this aspect in his address. But when he became the party politician fighting a soap-box election, then it was a different story.</p>

<p>I want to bring to the notice of the Minister of Finance the problem of inflation and a problem which I think is going to face the country during the recess. It is an important matter and I hope the Government is going to give some attention to it, if they do not have a solution already. According to the Press reports there are over 300 vessels at sea at the moment which may use the Cape route and not the Suez route. Although the war is over in Suez, according to the Press reports, we do not know how long it will be before a peace will be negotiated. We do not know how long it will be before the Suez Canal is opened. It may be in ten days, it may be in ten months. There is going to be a lot of hard bargaining in the Middle East over the next few weeks, or possibly few months.</p>

<p>According to the Israelis they intend bargaining with the Arabs themselves. They do not intend allowing the United Nations to interfere, just as we do not want the United Nations to interfere with our internal matters. Israel suggests that this is an entirely internal matter. Only time will tell what will happen. But in the meantime, a problem awaits the people of South Africa, because if 300 vessels come to the South African ports, they are going to buy provisions. Anyone who has had experience of the attitude of shipping companies, knows that certain shipping companies and certain shipping officials have a very high standard of ethics and adopt reasonable and responsible attitudes. But there are some companies and some officials who however are quite irresponsible. When a ship radios to one of the major ports where she wishes to obtain provisions, and the price is no object, the people provisioning those ships, the responsible ones, contact the authorities. The irresponsible ones and the racketeers can go ahead and buy all the food that is available on the market. The result is that the housewife and the ordinary worker, who does not have the means and the facilities to build up a store, will find themselves either unable to obtain food or pay prohibitive prices for the food. That state of affairs can obtain during the next few months that lie ahead for this country. I would like to know if the Government has thought of that problem. Will they have any means of meeting the difficulty&#x003F; Because it is a real problem and one which will have to be faced by every South African port. It will not affect the people inland. They will not be affected so much. But the people at the ports will be materially affected. The price inflation can do untold harm, particularly to the lower income groups. They cannot store up food and buy now in anticipation. Many of them do not realize what it is all about. It will only come home to them when they buy the provisions <span class="col_7649-7650" refersTo="page_1086"/>at the end of the week. The weekly paid Bantu in our factories in the coastal town, the weekly paid Indians and Coloureds and the Europeans who buy from week to week will find themselves in difficulty. I would like to know what proposals the Government has to meet the position. From a ship&#x2019;s point of view, harbour dues are heavy and it is not a matter of importance to pay excessive prices for food, because in many cases they can tell their companies that it is an emergency, and therefore the prices are justified. In many cases the prices they pay here, even the inflated prices they may pay here, can be lower than the prices they pay in other ports, particularly American vessels. Therefore it is a matter which will have to have special attention from this Government.</p>

<p>While dealing with this, I want to ask the responsible Minister whether the Government has thought of the importance of emergency planning. It is all very well for the Minister of Defence to talk about the arms and supplies of oil he has and the oil that has been stored. We know that we are storing large quantities of oil. What proposals have the Government for emergency planning when it comes to the storage of food&#x003F; Is there any storage of food to deal with an emergency, if any of our major cities have trouble&#x003F; Are there any plans, when there are times of surplus, to ensure that the surpluses are looked after, so that in times of emergency there will be food available for the people&#x003F; I suggest that the recent events in the Middle East have brought a lesson to a small country like South Africa. They demonstrate the importance of providing for food and providing for them at a figure which the people can afford. Because these problems are problems that are going to be faced during the recess, in the months that Parliament is not sitting and when there will not be an opportunity for us to ask these questions. It is not only the inflation of prices the Minister of Finance will have to face for his colleagues. He is still dealing with the inflation battle. He has told us that he intends to win this battle. He has told us that during the year. The Prime Minister said during the course of the debate that we have talked over and over again about inflation. We continue to emphasize the inflation problem, because it means that the earnings of the ordinary worker are being eroded. For that reason I would like to know from the hon. the Minister how he views the position, having regard to the recent suggestion of the Reserve Bank that the commercial banks will be required to reduce their borrowings from the central bank by R160 million by the end of September. Does the Minister regard that as an accurate figure&#x003F; Does he think this is essential&#x003F; Has he taken into account the effect that it is going to have on the small business man, the ordinary worker, and does he foresee any possibility that the income of the ordinary individual may be reduced, and not only a reduction of income, but also of profits of small businessmen&#x003F; Because any reduction of income and any reduction of profits will, in turn, have an effect on the Minister&#x2019;s Budget next year. So, we are not only concerned with inflation; we are concerned with the question of productivity, because productivity is also a problem which will have to be faced.</p>

<p>While dealing with productivity, I would like to ask the Minister of Finance whether he regards the recent mergers in the fishing industry, the meat industry and other food industries as contributing to the reduction of costs&#x003F; Has the Government any evidence that these recent mergers, these manoeuvres, are bringing down the cost of food, or are they making a few people richer by putting them into a more advantageous position to take a share of the market&#x003F; I suggest that the whole question of mergers and movements of this kind are matters which must concern the Minister of Finance. He is in a very difficult position, because on the one hand he is fighting the inflation battle and on the other hand one of his colleagues, through the Industrial Development Corporation, is engaged with the pushing of mutual funds. It seems a bit incongruous to us that, on the one hand, the Minister of Finance is telling the country to save and to conserve its resources, whilst, on the other hand, some of the loan funds of South Africa are being diverted to the Industrial Development Corporation, which in turn, is in the mutual fund market. I would like the Minister of Finance to tell us whether he could justify this and whether he proposes to curb this. To what extent is he going to control his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, who is concerned with investments by the Industrial Development Corporation, over which he has control. Then the hon. the Minister, in dealing with the question of productivity, must deal with the question of border industries. The Minister, through his colleague, the Minister of Economic Affairs, has made funds available for the Industrial Development Corporation to carry out the Government&#x2019;s policy of border industries. Is the Minister satisfied that the industries established on the border are all economic&#x003F; Is he satisfied that they are not only economic, but that they are producing at costs which are competitive within South Africa, and that those companies, those firms, can export and win markets outside South Africa&#x003F; Because the Prime Minister during the course of these remarks did not answer the charge of the Leader of the Opposition and the failure of the Government to provide vocational education for the non-European. Here the Government has spent hundreds of millions of rand on border industries. Can the Minister tell us whether there is one single vocational school in these border areas&#x003F; How does he expect the productivity to improve if the standard of education is not being improved&#x003F; How does he expect the country to increase its productivity and to improve the output of the Bantu worker when they are getting no vacational education&#x003F; What is happening in these factories is that these people are volunteering from the reserves to <span class="col_7651-7652" refersTo="page_1087"/>get work in these factories. They are given an aptitude test by industrial psychologists. In that way they are sorted out, selected and put into the factories.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member knew as much about Cyril Lord as I do he should know that he is quoting a very bad example, because that company is not making a profit. He should also know that in arranging labour for the Cyril Lord factory, immigrants were brought from overseas and Bantu were trained but that they were still dissatisfied with the high labour turnover. The reason for this is that people are working for a time and then leaving or are being thrown out. While there was initial training at the Cyril Lord factory and at other factories, it was initial training when the work was first started. Thereafter they were expected to get on the best way they could. If they cannot make the grade they are thrown out. It is a vastly different attitude to that pertaining overseas. If the hon. member would travel a bit instead of just staying in South Africa, and visit similar factories to the Cyril Lord factory overseas, he would find for example in the Chesro factory in Manchester a series of classrooms provided where teachers from the Manchester Technical College go to that factory and give lessons to the workers to improve their productivity. There is no such example in South Africa in any of the border industries. In fact at one of the border industries the Government has spent nearly R10 million, and not only is there no school, but there is not one single Bantu house built. Examples of bad planning and bad organization by the Government are amply demonstrated by the many examples I can quote if time were available. And here, Mr. Speaker, we have the Government let loose for another six months. For another six months it will not be answerable to this Parliament. It will have an opportunity of not being faced with criticism, and opportunity to do as it likes. Cabinet Ministers go home and some will be travelling overseas. Some of them will have a lot of headaches and the Minister of Finance particularly will have plenty. I notice that the hon. the Minister has visibly aged of late. [Interjections.] I am not surprised, Mr. Speaker. He has to face certain problems during the next six months. It is not only the problem of greater productivity that he has to face. On the one hand he has to contract the efforts of the country and on the other hand he has to make sure that the country produces more so that the costs can be reduced. We are still faced with this one urgent problem which I have dealt with earlier on and that is the question of the cost of food, the prices of food and the cost of supplies during this recess. I hope the hon. the Minister will regard this as an essential problem and I hope he will give it top priority. I say this because the people at the coast, viz. Cape Town, Mossel Bay, East London, Port Elizabeth and Durban are entitled to have some protection and the assurance that they will not be exploited by the position which is being brought about by the war in the Middle East. The War in the Middle East is going to disrupt the economy for a time which cannot be estimated at the present stage. It does not necessarily follow that we are going to be worse off. It is true that those people who supply the ships will be much better off. Some of them will make fortunes. Some of the agents will do very well indeed. Some of the more unscrupulous ones may probably make fabulous fortunes. But what we are concerned about is that the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary worker, be he Black, Coloured, Bantu, Indian or White, is not exploited by the position which is not of their making. It always happens in an emergency that it is the ordinary man that gets the worst of it. Those who are in more favourable circumstances can protect their position. They can lay in stores. I know already of cases of people who have told me that they have laid in stores to cover themselves for the next two or three months. Even those people performing that function are themselves creating a problem. Every person and every housewife who goes along and buys three months&#x2019; supplies because there might be a shortage if these ships come in is aggravating the position.</p>

<p>There is not the time to give the solution in detail. But I have had the practical experience of these things which the hon. member did not have. I did the investigation into the price racket for the British Ministery of Transport during the war. Ships came in, stores were bought up, the whole market cleared off, stuff dumped on the ships and people were making fortunes. It was only after this United Party Government had done the investigation and reported thereon that the matter was brought under control. The hon. member should know that the Minister has the power to bring it under control. He has the necessary legal powers to bring it under control. I can see this position coming and as I have been through it once before and therefore have firsthand knowledge of it, it is only right that I should, as a responsible person, bring it to the notice of the hon. the Minister of Finance and warn him now and not wait till next session and criticize him then for not doing anything about it. Now is the time to give him the warning and to tell him of the dangers. I hope that the hon. the Minister will take due notice of what I have said.

<p>Mr. Speaker, this debate on the Appropriation Bill is the last major debate of this Session. It affords us on both sides of this House an opportunity to look back on that part of the Session we have behind us and to see what has been done and what has not been done, what has been said and what has not been said. It also affords us the last real opportunity this Session to face one another in this House as Government and Opposition and for the last time to state very clearly, man to man, in a public debate, the points on which we differ. When we go from here to meet the country and to report back, we shall therefore know exactly where we stand. Up to now we have listened to two hon. members. The hon. member who has just sat down agreed with the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s argument in so far as he also spoke of productivity and said that the ideological policies the Government was following had an adverse effect on such productivity and that that was a factor which assisted in promoting inflation. In this connection I should like to discuss a major and very real difference which exists between us. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in this connection that what we needed was not fewer people but in fact more and better workers. Then he also said that there must be a reappraisal of the money invested in border industries and in ideological objectives. The hon. member for Pinetown said that the money invested in border industries was money wasted.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to deal with the subject with the discussion of which, incidentally, this Session commenced. I want to take the words of the two hon. members opposite who have just spoken and I then want to compare the policy of the United Party with our policy. I am referring to the debate on the Western Cape. The arguments I want to advance this afternoon in connection with the Western Cape also hold good for the rest of South Africa. The basic things I want to say here apply everywhere. Now what is the position&#x003F; The policy of the National Party is very clear. We say that we are going to endeavour to reduce the number of Bantu in the white areas like the Western Cape. Our policy has two legs. We are going to try to reduce the number of Bantu in the Western Cape gradually and to effect their gradual return to their own land; we set ourselves the goal of a reduction of 5 per cent per annum. This is one leg of our policy. The other leg is that we will bring about development in and adjacent to the Bantu homeland in order to provide them with employment. Before coming to economic questions, I want to deal with both matters very briefly. Now what is the position&#x003F; I want to say at once that I am asking this in view of a question asked here by the hon. member for Pinelands to which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration gave a reply on 16th September, 1966. Last year the Minister said that there were 255,000 Bantu in the Western Cape. Of that number 131,500 were solitary Bantu from the Transkei and the Ciskei who were here under contract and in addition there were 25,000 family units. The 25,000 family units therefore accounted for 123,500 Bantu and the remaining figure of 131,500 was made up of solitary Bantu. I want to ask hon. members please to make an attempt to follow this because what I want to discuss is a very important matter. The natural increase, according to the statistics of the Bureau of Census and Statistics, of these family units is 2,840 per annum. Suppose we succeed in achieving not 5 per cent but only 1 per cent of what the Government is going to try to achieve in the Western Cape, we shall at least have succeeded in returning the natural increase of the Bantu at present in the Western Cape to their homelands. And if we succeed in what we are trying to achieve, namely the figure of 5 per cent, we shall in due course be successful over a period of, admittedly, quite a number of years, in getting the Bantu settled in their own areas without, as other labour and other methods of labour become available, any disruption of the economy. Now what is the policy of the United Party and how does one relate these figures to that policy&#x003F; I want to try to be very honest and very fair. Of this number of 255,000 Bantu 131,500 are solitary Bantu. Suppose that one half of that number is married. If one has to bring the families of those 65,000 married Bantu here, in accordance with the policy of the United Party and in accordance with what the Leader of the United Party once more stated so clearly here this afternoon, one will bring 260,000 additional Bantu into the Western Cape. If the United Party comes into power to-morrow 260,000 additional Bantu will come to the Western Cape within a period of 12 months and then we shall immediately have a Bantu population not of 255,000 but of 515,000 in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Now I proceed. Those hon. members have aroused a great deal of suspicion against us in the Western Cape. They have incited agriculture and industry against us. Agriculture and industry may probably expect from them that there will at least be a reasonable flow of Bantu workers to the Western Cape under their dispensation. I have only taken a flow of 7,000 per annum which is less than 5 per cent. Now, if one brings in 7,000 per annum of whom one half is married, hon. members can make their own calculations that 105,000 will be brought into the Western Cape in that way within a period of five years. Now we already have 620,000 plus the natural increase of the Bantu who are here and whom they are not going to send back and that number will be approximately 50,000 per annum which will give one, under their policy, a Bantu population of 670,000 in the Western Cape within a period of six or seven years. If that happens throughout the country what has one done to South Africa&#x003F; What heritage have we then left our children and what will be the position by the year 2000&#x003F; What is now happening on the other side&#x003F; [Interjections.] I should like to reply to all the questions, but I really do not have the time to do so. <span class="col_7655-7656" refersTo="page_1089"/>The hon. member for Pinelands asked what would happen on the other side in connection with the second leg of our policy&#x003F; We want to take the Bantu away from the white areas and we want them to go to their own areas. Throughout this entire Session hon. members opposite have been casting suspicion on this policy and have been ridiculing it as well as the Act of the hon. the Minister of Planning by means of which we want to effect balanced development and planning in the interests of all the people in the country. The hon. member for Pinelands said that there were 1.5 million people in the Transkei and the Ciskei and that the birth figure was 40 per 1,000, in other words 60,000 were born each year. I assume that his arithmetic is correct. He then said that one had to provide 60,000 jobs every year in order to accommodate that increase. That is precisely an example, of, I feel inclined to say, the ridiculous method of arguing on that side of this House. The hon. member asked me whether we could implement our policy, but is it not true that all the people who are born do not grow up&#x003F; Some die. There are adults who also die and the young ones take their places, and had the hon. member asked the Bureau of Census and Statistics they would have told him that the increase in the Bantu population in South Africa, scientifically and statistically determined, is 2.3 per cent&#x2014;actually it is 2.29 per cent, but let us take it to be 2.3 per cent, i.e. 23 per 1,000. Now the increase of that 1.5 million Bantu in the Transkei and the Ciskei is no longer 60,000 but 34,500 per annum, or let us say 40,000 Now I want to say that for each person who is employed in a factory&#x2014;supposing that these people must all be employed through the agency of factories, which is not true in any case&#x2014;employment for a further two persons somehow come into existence outside that factory. Some of them make bricks, others help to lay water pipes and yet others make roads. That means that one will have to provide employment for one third. But had the hon. member asked the Bureau of Census and Statistics they would also have informed him that 35.5 per cent of the Bantu are active economically. That means that 35 work to feed 100 people and in order to feed those 40,000 people 14,000 will have to work. Those are the people who will have to work each year, namely 14,000, in order to feed that increase. Now one has to provide employment for one third of those 14,000 people in factories, i.e. for 4,600 per annum. Can the hon. member understand that&#x003F; But one need not create 4,600 jobs in factories to accommodate the natural increase, because it should be borne in mind that towns will come into existence in the homelands and local industries will develop in those towns. However, a service sector will also come into existence. There must be teachers, post-masters, clerks, policemen and government officials. I want to ask the hon. member to reconsider these things during the recess and to arrive at the truth, and then he may come back next year and again address us on this matter, because as yet he has not considered the matter and has not at all come to understand it. The United Party has one solution only. This year too they just spoke about the &#x201C;Reserves&#x201D;. The hon. member for Transkei spoke a great deal about the &#x201C;Reserves&#x201D;. They are also in favour of some development there but the rest must go to the white areas of South Africa to make a living. They must go on a family basis and they must go, under the policy of the United Party, to obtain ownership, the title deeds, of land in the white part of South Africa, to be the co-owners with our children of those parts for all time to come and to create problems there which will be fantastically greater than the few bogeys they see each time they speak of our policy. The hon. member for Newton Park is another who may really reconsider this matter.</p>

<p>My time is getting short and I should like to discuss a few economic matters. The hon. member for Pinetown said that inflation was with us and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the same thing. I think those hon. members would like us to speak about that only. They want us to speak about that problem only, because they would like the public outside to see that as the only factor in our economy. But there are many other things which we on this side will not allow to be suppressed. During the past six years we in South Africa have witnessed our economy developing and flourishing at a faster rate than at any other period in our history. During the past six years we have witnessed, thanks to this Government, the creation of an industrial giant with a diversified industrial structure on which we may build in the future. During the past six years we have witnessed that there is tremendous confidence in this country, in its economic and political stability and in the future of South Africa under a National Party Government. This confidence has not been confined to the local investors but has radiated to countries abroad to such an extent that people in those countries now invest money in South Africa. We have built our economy into something big and strong, so much so that the commission appointed by the U.N. presented a report that a boycott against South Africa could not succeed. We have built such a strong economy that we have been able to obtain the money from that economy to see to the defence of the country, and we have safely navigated that stormy sea of international life. Show me a South African who does not appreciate that and who will not give the Government credit for that and who will not be prepared to make a small sacrifice for those things. What have the ordinary people received&#x003F; It cannot be denied that there has been employment for us and our children. There has been work for everyone who wants to work. The rewards are good and for a person who wants to qualify himself and who wants to work hard, there are opportunities for promotion. I want to go further and I say that it cannot be denied that <span class="col_7657-7658" refersTo="page_1090"/>the standard of living of our people has been raised consistently during the past number of years. There are problems and I am not going to run away from them but we should like to revert in an orderly fashion to a more normal growth in our economy. We want to ask all our people to assist us and therefore we tell our people that we understand their problems. There is one problem of which I am fully conscious and that is that in South Africa, particularly in the cities, one has areas which are very active economically, whereas one has economically less active areas on the platteland. We must never forget what part has been played in this by the drought. If we take measures to slow down economic growth, then, proportionally, such measures may perhaps be felt more severely in those areas where the rate of economic growth already is very slow, measures such as credit restriction, those in regard to rates of interest, etc. The Government realizes what the problem is and the Government will most definitely act as and when it is in the interests of our people to do so. We realize that the cost of living is high; we do not deny that; we have never denied that. We ourselves find that the cost of living is high but the very thing we are striving for is to reduce prices and to effect a more stable growth with more constant prices. That is the very thing we want to effect.</p>

<p>To that I want to add the following: If these measures had not been taken, what would the position have been&#x003F; In that case there would have been a real danger of the matter getting completely out of hand. I also want to add that the cost of living over the past six months has increased by 1.5 per cent only, if that is any consolation to our people. That already constitutes a considerable improvement. We cannot relax our measures now. The next few months will be very important and I should like to tell the people in our country that we badly need their support. There are signs which justify the hope that an improvement will come; there may be a reasonable expectation that there will be an improvement, but the next few months will be very important. What solution has the Opposition offered us in this time of inflation&#x003F; Nothing. They asked that we should spend less money in the Government sector. We asked them where we were to cut down on expenditure but up to this day we are still waiting to hear from them. They pleaded for less expenditure and for less taxation. Last week when the tax proposals were discussed here, they once again pleaded for less taxation. They put a question here in connection with the Durban post office and the Opposition laughed scornfully when they were told that it would not be possible to build the new Durban post office next year. As in the past hon. members of the Opposition once more pleaded to-day for productivity to be increased and the only suggestion they made in this connection, through the hon. member for Parktown, was that apartheid should be abolished. That was the only suggestion they could make to increase productivity, &#x201C;Abolish apartheid&#x201D;!</p>

<p>Sir, if one looks at the pattern of South Africa and if one looks at the future of South Africa, one asks oneself, &#x201C;In what is the salvation of our nation to be found&#x003F;&#x201D; To-day we once more heard from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition about his race federation policy. He and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also told us about his race federation policy last year and I want to quote what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said (Column 4482)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of the people in the world to-day are being governed under federal systems.</block>

The Opposition has to settle this matter for us during this debate. This year they were asked here by the hon. members for Winburg, Middelland and Innesdal to tell us what their federation was. They must not wait to settle the matter until they have once more held a congress, because then we will ultimately be justified to apply the following old saying in a changed form to the Opposition, &#x201C;He who runs and fights away, will live to run another day&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, I must begin by contradicting something which the hon. the Prime Minister has now said three times with regard to me personally in this House and in the Other Place. The hon. the Prime Minister has chosen to misquote me on three specific occasions and I take this opportunity of getting the record straight. The Prime Minister has accused me of making a statement in Natal which he said proved that I was entirely against national unity as such in South Africa. I would like to say here in the House&#x2014;and I am sorry that the hon. the Prime Minister is not present to hear it&#x2014;that what I said in Natal was that it would be one of the greatest forms of treachery for English-speaking people to vote for the Nationalist Party because of the loyalty of the thousands of Afrikaans-speaking people in the United Party who had remained staunchly behind us over the years, many of whom, with their families, had even had to suffer forms of victimization because they stood by the English-speaking people over many, many years. My plea to the voters of Natal was, that where all these Afrikaans speaking people had stood by us so staunchly &#x2014;and we have them with us still&#x2014;they are the salt of the earth and we are not losing them&#x2014;it was our business to stand by those Afrikaans-speaking people who had stood so loyally by us. That seems to me to be r&#x00E8;al national unity.</p>

<p>One striking thing about the way in which the hon. the Prime Minister spoke&#x2014;I must say that it struck me very much indeed&#x2014;was his extraordinary lack <span class="col_7661-7662" refersTo="page_1092"/>of common, human generosity towards the Leader of the Opposition when the Leader of the Opposition was dealing with international affairs and dealing with them on an extremely generous and loyal basis to South Africa as a whole. All the hon. the Prime Minister did was to show what a difference in stature there is between the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and himself. I would say that the one is infinitely superior in stature and in manners to the other. The hon. the Prime Minister then went on to talk about the Opposition having no meaning at all; he said that the voters were overwhelmingly behind the Nationalist Party. Sir, the arrogance of hon. members opposite has to be seen in this House to be believed. I want to remind them that 42 per cent of the voters in South Africa are solidly behind the United Party.</p>

</speech>

<p>Not too solidly.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to remind them that only 58 per cent of the voters voted for the Nationalist Party, with the result that the 126 Nationalist members who sit here in fact bear no relation whatsoever to the voting division in the country. The fact that they Government has 126 members sitting here, with only 58 per cent of the voters behind them, while we have 39 members with 42 per cent of the voters supporting us, is an indication of some very curious political practices. Let me remind hon. members opposite that we have succeeded in bringing down their majorities in every single by-election in the last year and a half.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it is true to say that all South Africans wish the Government success when they tell us that they are determined to fight inflation but then, of course, we are entitled to hope that the Government itself will discipline itself and do something to curtail its expenditure of public moneys before enforcing harsher measures upon the working class people of this country. I do not think it is sufficient for the Government to say that South Africa&#x2019;s businessmen must curtail their activities or that the average family man must spend less. How do you spend less if you are a working man and in fact your entire wage each week is already exhausted in trying to purchase the necessities of life&#x003F;</p>

<p>The overall figures of Government spending over the past five years are a revelation to the country and to the ordinary tax payer. I think it might be as well to remind this House just what these figures are. During the financial year 1960-&#x2019;61, according to the Controller and Auditor-General, the Government spent a total of R884 million, and five years later, i.e. during the financial year 1966-&#x2019;67, it spent R1,755 million&#x2014;R871 million more, or 98 per cent more, than in 1961. Government expenditure has been increasing at the rate of 15 to 20 per cent per annum. It is most extraordinary to see that Government expenditure is growing faster than our gross national product&#x2014;in other words, faster than the growth in our national income. When the Budget for 1966-&#x2019;67 was introduced, the financial year was already almost six months old. Nevertheless the Government increased taxation by R47 million for the remaining six months of that year. For a full tax year it amounted to R93 million. As a result of the present fiscal policy the Government started 1967 with a handsome surplus of revenue over expenditure, but nevertheless it decided to milk the tax payer even further by demanding a total of R106,600,000 by way of extra taxation. All this means a tremendous sacrifice to South Africans everywhere. I wonder whether Members of Parliament realize quite how great a sacrifice it does mean to the small man. At the same time, according to its own estimates, the Government&#x2019;s expenditure during the current financial year is going to be increased by R153 million over last year&#x2019;s expenditure. Do hon. members opposite realize that the ordinary South African is not bluffed into believing that the Government is serious in its admonitions to them to spend less and save more, while the Government itself is giving absolutely no lead at all in the matter. If one looks at the consumer price index, what does one find&#x003F; In January, 1963, the index stood at 103 points; by January, 1965, it had risen to 114; by January, 1967, to 119; and by March, 1967, to 120 points in all the main centres in the Republic. According to the trade unions this is well past the danger mark. May I also remind hon. members that judgments for debt, taking the year 1965 as an example, amounted to more than R20 million, involving about 110,000 people&#x2014;mostly small people who failed to make payments on goods purchased over and above their income. The respective figures for 1966 are even higher.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown said we had failed to point out any instance where the Government overspent. I want to refer him to the position of the Public Service under this Government. The establishment of the Public Service in 1956 was 128,352. Five years later it had increased to 152,174; by the 1st January, 1966, the establishment grew to 191,946 and by the 1st January, 1967, to 202,934&#x2014;in other words the percentage increase over the decade 1956 to the end of 1966 is 58 per cent. The year 1963-&#x2019;64 was a phenomenal year in this respect because the increase in the number of posts in that year was no less than 20,000. If these figures are properly studied and analyzed in the light of educational qualifications, and if one takes Std. VIII as the criterion one finds that the Public Service employs between 27 and 30 per cent of the total white population with a Std. VIII certificate. This includes both males and females. The Public Service is, in other words, by far the largest employer in the country. What does this mean&#x003F; It means that the ramifications of Government are increasing annually and from a labour point of view and is increasingly in competition with <span class="col_7663-7664" refersTo="page_1093"/>the private sector. Of course, where this leads to increased and better services, the country cannot have any objection. But where it means the increasing application, through officialdom, of ideological projects and programmes which solve no problems and are essentially unproductive, the public has a right to object. That is what we have been doing from this side of the House. If one adds up the cost of certain items, items which taken singly do not amount to very much but which when added together make formidable reading, we have a different story. Let us take a few examples at random: The amounts spent on the annual increases in the Public Service; the cost of administering the Population Registration Act year after year; the cost of all those officials whose job it is to issue permits for the right to use halls; the Ministry of Sport and its portion in the Budget, which is a waste of money; the salaries of thousands of group area inspectors, whose job it is to pry into people&#x2019;s homes; inflated salaries for readers attached to the Publications Control Board and other boards, whose existence we have queried; the cost of the hundreds of extra policemen needed to administer our clumsy pass laws; the cost of extra prison accommodation and of the officials needed to guard the thousands of statutory offenders who fill our gaols year after year; Cadillacs of hon. Ministers, some with more than one, I understand; expensive houses for M.E.C.&#x2019;s&#x2014;so I can go on. The list is absolutely endless.</p>

<p>These are the things on which the taxpayer&#x2019;s money is being wasted. Who are the really happy people in South Africa to-day&#x003F; Just think of the pensioners. Under the present high cost of living most of these live miserable lives on a shoestring budget. Nobody can argue about that. What is more, many of them live in buildings which should have been condemned many years ago. What about our farmers&#x003F; They have had a rotten deal from this Government and are continuing to get a rotten deal. The Government has no constructive long-term plan for our farmers. Thousands of them have had to leave their farms, a tendency which will continue. There is no doubt about that. But what kind of security have they got under the present circumstances&#x003F; As hon. members know, thousands and thousands of existing farmers are up to their eyes in debt and do not know where to turn in order to straighten things out. Let us take industry. Industry is deeply concerned about the new controls over its freedom and about the threatened withdrawal of large numbers of Bantu labour, particularly from certain areas. These industrialists who, next to the mines, constitute the mainstay of our economy, are deeply worried because of the Government&#x2019;s refusal to assist in the training of our unskilled labour, a matter which the Leader of the Opposition discussed earlier this afternoon. The Government refuses to do so largely because these unskilled labourers are non-White. The result is that production suffers and inflation is encouraged.</p>

<p>If one looks at the educational field we all have to agree that this field has been scandalously neglected. That goes for Whites, for the Bantu and for the Coloureds. That this is so, is a short-sightedness on the part of the Government which is proving a great disservice to South Africa as a whole. The more you neglect education, the more adversely you affect productivity. Therefore I say that we are correct in saying, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, that thousands of our white youngsters leave school far too early. They leave school with poor qualifications, but they are forced to do so in order to assist with the family budget. Their potential is lost to the country year after year. On my desk I have letters from parents to prove that what I am saying is absolutely true. It is going to take South Africa a generation to overcome the effects of this short-sightedness. Do not let us bluff ourselves on that score. It is only now, 20 years too late, that the necessary educational and vocational surveys are being made. What is more, if one examines the financial position of education, one finds that although the total sum of money being spent on education has increased during the past few years, as a percentage of the national income it has decreased&#x2014;an alarming state of affairs. In the <i>Economic Journal</i> of 1964 Pro. fessor Horwood wrote in an article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the total of central over provincial expenditure on education has increased from R66&#x00BD; million in 1950 to R163 million in 1963, if these amounts are expressed as a percentage of the net geographical income of the country, there has actually been a decrease of from 3.25 per cent in 1950 to 3 per cent in 1963.</block>

<p>Under the latest Budget the amount of money spent on education is 4&#x00BD; per cent of the national income. One would have thought that, after a period in office of 20 years, this Government could have done something more dynamic. I know the hon. the Minister has said that this amount must be increased, but the hard fact is that the country is getting richer, we are all being grossly overtaxed and yet the amount spent on education and training is, expressed as a percentage of South Africa&#x2019;s net geographical income, decreasing. Money voted for education is a long-term investment. What is more, it will not encourage inflation&#x2014;in fact, it will increase productivity. And increased productivity, as has so often been said, is one of our greatest needs.</p>

<p>66 per cent of our industrial workers are unskilled. This is a frightening figure. In the United States only 15 per cent are unskilled. The answer to the problem for us lies in better education, not only for the Whites, but for all. All we have had this year in so far as education is concerned, is this dreary and frightening National Education Policy Bill which underwrites nobody at all in a practical sense. <span class="col_7665-7666" refersTo="page_1094"/>Another practical aspect concerns the health of the nation, an aspect with which productivity is also linked. I refer here to the grievous shortage of funds for medical research. The country is short of scientists, engineers, medical doctors, and university staff, partly as a result of chronic neglect and shortsightedness, and partly out of meanness in the allocation of funds to assist these people. The latest report of the C.S.I.R. makes dismal reading on this subject. Let me read the following extracts therefrom&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During 1966 the council granted R533,300 to universities, university colleges, museums and other institutions, for research in the medical sciences.</block>

<p>Half a million rand. Sir! That was all that was allocated to all our universities, for postgraduate study, individual <i>ad hoc</i> grants and to units and groups for purposes of medical research. The report goes on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">While the amount of money made available to the council for supporting university and medical research has been increased steadily each year, the sum available falls substantially short of the requests received. For 1966 approximately half the funds requested could not be provided.</block>

<p>That to me is an absolute disgrace. Further on it is stated that the work on medical research set out in the report &#x201C;represents but a fraction of the medical research potential of the Republic&#x201D;. It is pointed out that because of lack of funds this potential lies dormant. That is an indictment of the Government, quite clearly set out in this report. Add to that the fact that they go on to say that less money is coming to us from outside, and we are receiving less money from the U.S.A. They go on and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The C.S.I.R. Committee for Research in Medical Sciences is at present considering the wisdom of establishing disease prevalence profiles with a view to discovering noteworthy disease trends. The idea is to steer research funds into areas where such trends indicate special dangers to public well-being.</block>

<p>Then they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In general. State grants for medical research are allocated and spent with care &#x2026; But since applications for grants are increasing annually, the problem of drawing up acceptable criteria for establishing priorities in allocating grants is now a pressing one.</block>

<p>Finally they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Important research projects designed to supply information immediately applicable to the improvement of public health, do at present compete for funds with equally important projects which, though mainly of academic interest, are essential to scientific development and training at our universities. To formulate an effective nutritional and food policy for the country, knowledge concerning the nutrition status of the different levels of the population is required. Research is therefore being carried out to ascertain the best method of determining the nutrition level of separate population groups and actual nutrition status surveys are also being carried out on a limited scale.</block>

<p>In other words, everything is earned out on a limited scale because just over R&#x00BD; million, and no more, is allocated to the C.S.I.R. for medical and nutritional research purposes.</p>

<p>Now, poverty in South Africa is rife. Malnutrition and disease, whatever hon. members may say, are also rife. Most of these things arise out of the poverty which I have just mentioned, and they lead in their turn, as hon. members know, to a whole mass of sociological problems which are becoming so deep-seated that South Africa one day will reap the whirl-wind in grim human terms, unless we set about dealing with them now.</p>

<p>It may interest hon. members to know that the average expectation of life at birth of the different population groups in South Africa differs very much as a result of the prevalence of poverty amongst our non-white population groups. For instance, the expectancy of life for our white males is 64.6 years and that for our white females is 70.1 years. For Coloured men the figure is only 44.8 years and for women it is 47.8 years. The respective figures for Asiatics are 55.8 years and 54.8 years. This shows a 20-year span of difference in the average life expectancy between white and Coloured people, and there is no doubt whatsoever that this is largely due to poverty. There is also a ten-year difference between the Asiatics and the Whites.</p>

<p>Rigid ideology, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition quite rightly said, breaks up family life in South Africa with incredible cruelty and indifference, and I think this is a grave reflection on the European people as a whole and with it the children, of course, are the ones who suffer.</p>

<p>Last year I raised the question of the amount of skimmed milk that was thrown away in South Africa annually simply because there were no means of collecting it. I do not have time to go into the subject in any detail, but thousands and thousands of pounds of fresh milk are thrown away annually. It is not collected. No plan seems to have been made to organize the collection of this milk, to have it properly processed, to stockpile it and let it be distributed. Only 120 municipalities are receiving it at the present time. The tuberculosis rate is such that the Secretary for Health said only a few weeks ago that South Africa was facing an epidemic of tuberculosis which might last for another 50 years. If there is no co-ordinated plan whatsoever <span class="col_7667-7668" refersTo="page_1095"/>on the part of the Government, except on a very small scale, namely R25,000 for the Bantu areas and R64,000 for municipalities, the outlook looks grim. The latest figure voted for tuberculosis on the Estimates is R14 million. But by that time they already have the disease. It seems to me that nothing practical is being done to stockpile skim milk which can be processed either for poverty purposes or for purposes of civil defence in terms of the country&#x2019;s needs if we find ourselves in the middle of a war.</p>

<p>The incidence of tuberculosis among our urban and our rural Bantu is becoming a frightening business. These are the things we on this side feel the Government does not devote nearly enough time nor money to under the circumstances. They spend so much time talking big business and power politics that the practicalities are so often forgotten. That is why I deliberately mentioned education and this question of health. It is on these grounds that we consider the Government should turn its attention to matters of really human concern and that is why the Leader of the Opposition moved his amendment, i.e. to ensure the security and happiness of the South African population.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has been my doubtful privilege since 1954 to be a member of an assembly together with the hon. member for Wynberg. who has just resumed her seat. I have heard many speeches by the hon. member, but I want to say with all due respect that I have seldom heard her make a speech as poor as this afternoon&#x2019;s. But one cannot actually hold it against the hon. member, for if one has no case it is rather difficult to make out a good case. I am not going to try to reply to all the arguments advanced by the hon. member, but I cannot resist the temptation to reply to some of them.</p>

<p>In the course of her speech the hon. member dealt with the farmers, amongst other matters. I do not know how much she knows about farming and how many farmers she knows. Perhaps she still knows as little about our farmers as she knew in 1954, when she referred to the people in the rural areas as the &#x201C;blikkiesdorpers&#x201D;. [Interjections.] I am afraid she has not learnt much more about the farmers since then, because this afternoon she told us that the farmers were getting a &#x201C;rotten deal&#x201D; from this Government. But in spite of the fact that the farmers are having such a terribly bad time, according to her, prices of land have increased by about 100 per cent in the past six years. Now I ask the hon. member: If the farmers are having such a hard time, if they are in such a poor position, if they are getting such a &#x201C;rotten deal&#x201D;, as the hon. member alleges, how can they be prepared to pay 100 per cent more for land than they did six years ago&#x003F; I leave the hon. member there as regards her arguments on farming, because it is apparent that she knows nothing about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said: &#x201C;Poverty and malnutrition are rife in South Africa.&#x201D; I wonder&#x2014;no, I am convinced that there is not one other country on the continent of Africa where so little poverty is encountered as in South Africa. The hon. member referred to the low life-expectancy of our non-Whites, particularly our Coloureds. Does the hon. member not know that only 20 years ago&#x2014; when this Government was not in power&#x2014;as many as 50 out of 100 Coloured children died in infancy&#x003F; As I say, it was not the National Party which was in power then. Under this Government that figure has now decreased to less than 10 per cent. Is that proof of callousness, of the inhumanity of this Government to non-white races in our country&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member also complained terribly because the Government expenditure was supposedly so high. She also complained about the large increase&#x2014;according to her&#x2014;in the number of public officials. As a reason for that she advanced the fact that population registration entailed unnecessary staff and money; that control over the movement of Bantu in our country occupied unnecessary officials and money, etc. This afternoon the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also spoke about the so-called unnecessary public expenditure. But in the same breath he spoke of the thousands of children who were crying out for education. According to that side the Government expenditure is unnecessarily high, on the one hand, but on the other hand they complain that the Government is not spending enough, for instance on the education of our children. How long will the Opposition persist in sitting on two stools&#x003F; I am afraid they are no longer sitting on two stools&#x2014;they have long fallen between them and are lying on the floor between the two stools!</p>

<p>For that reason I do not want to spend any more time this afternoon replying to arguments of that kind, because that does not get us anywhere. I would rather point out that here we have a Government, a dynamic Government, consisting of extremely capable men under a very dynamic young head of government. Because that is the case, I have no hesitation whatsoever in raising a matter this afternoon which I think warrants the attention of the Government. In fact, I believe that in the near future this matter will receive the necessary attention. In recent times we have heard a great deal about re-appraisal, particularly with regard to the U.N. and its activities. This afternoon I want to speak of our re-appraisal in respect of our provincial system. Sitting in our dining-room the other day, I looked at the wonderful work of art by Professor Roworth which so beautifully portrays the meeting of the fathers at the National Convention 58 years ago, and it was as though I saw those people before me in the flesh. The thought occurred to me whether now, after 58 years, the time has not come that we should form a re-appraisal of our entire system. It goes without saying that over a period of 58 years conditions may change <span class="col_7669-7670" refersTo="page_1096"/>very much, and in the past 58 years conditions have in fact changed very much in South Africa. Circumstances have arisen which are beginning to cause me concern, and this afternoon I want to raise some points. I am not doing this in a spirit of criticism&#x2014;I want to make that quite clear at the outset, in order that there may not be the least misunderstanding. If I draw attention to certain unfortunate phenomena, it should not be construed as criticism of any administrator or executive committee. It should not be construed as criticism of provincial councils. I am pointing out certain things because in my opinion they are inherent weaknesses in this system, this system which, as I said, is 58 years old.</p>

<p>If we look at the Estimates of revenue and expenditure before us, we shall see that no less than R189 million is paid over from our revenue account to the provincial administrations. In addition there is R52 million for national roads. Of this Budget approximately 16.6 per cent goes to the provincial administrations. Over this 16.6 per cent this Parliament has very little to say. In fact, the Select Committee on Public Accounts, which reviews the expenditure of all the Government Departments, has no power to discuss and review this percentage of our Budget which is paid over to the provinces. Now, Mr. Speaker, I say this is an unfortunate phenomenon, which does not imply any criticism of the provincial administrations concerned. It is inherent in our system. We have no right to supervise the spending of that R189 million, although it is voted by this Government. Let us take the Cape Province as an example. According to the latest Estimates of the Cape Province, which I have before me, that is. the 1967-&#x2019;68 Estimates, revenue total R166,457,440. Of this amount the provincial administration gets R83,442,000 from the Central Government. In other words, exactly 50 per cent of the total revenue is received from the Central Government. Now we all know that it is an unfortunate fact of human psychology that one is more meticulous and more sparing with money that one earned oneself than with money one inherits or receives as a present. For that reason I say that to me it is an unfortunate fact that we, who have to vote this money for the province, have no right or power to review and supervise that expenditure through the Select Committee on Public Accounts. I say once again that it is an unfortunate fact of human nature that one is not as cautious with one&#x2019;s expenditure if one receives the money as a present as one is if one has to earn it oneself. A further unfortunate fact which has arisen in the past 58 years, since the fathers portrayed on the painting in the dining-room drew up their plans, is the unequal pressure of taxation on the different sections of the population of South Africa. Apart from income-tax imposed by this Parliament on the population of South Africa, there is also income tax which is levied by the various provinces. In the Transvaal and in the Free State it is 32 per cent of the Central Government&#x2019;s income-tax. In the Cape it is 33 per cent and in Natal 37i per cent. Now the question occurs to one: Why this unequal pressure of taxation on inhabitants and taxpayers in the same Republic of South Africa&#x003F;I give you another example. In the Cape we still have the divisional council system and its concomitant divisional council rates. I do not know whether hon. members are always aware of the fact that on a small farm of 100 morgen a farmer in the Cape pays up to R150 in divisional council rates.</p>

<p>It is a disgrace!</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says it is a disgrace. I repeat, I am not criticizing the Cape. I am not criticizing the Cape Administrator. Nor am I criticizing the Cape Provincial Administration. These things are inherent in the system we received from the hon. fathers on that panting in the dining room, 58 years ago. But I also say that it has certainly become time to form a re-appraisal. This entire system must be reconsidered. I have given you these examples to show that this system, which has now applied for 57 years, suffers from certain anomalies. In this regard I may refer to the question of motor-car licences. The provinces are not entitled to levy a tax on petrol, but the provinces have to build roads. And what better and more equitable form of taxation with a view to the maintenance of roads is there than a tax on petrol&#x003F; But unfortunately the provinces are not entitled to levy a tax on petrol. This is another legacy from the National Convention. Because the provinces are not empowered to impose the most equitable form of road taxes, namely a tax on petrol, they must necessarily turn to the other source of taxes that they do in fact have, namely motor-car licences. And now one finds the anomaly that the citizens of one province pay much more for the same vehicle than the citizens of another province. But this is by no means the worst. One furthermore finds the anomaly that a person who travels 3,000 miles a year pays exactly the same as a person who travels 30,000 miles a year. In this regard I have made calculations on the basis of one example. On a six-ton truck the vehicle licence in the Cape is at present R110. For the farmer who travels 3,000 miles a year, licence fees alone therefore come to 3.66 cents a mile. The person who travels 30,000 miles, on the other hand, pays .36 cents. You will therefore note that we find this kind of anomaly because the province&#x2019;s sources of taxation, fiscal sources, are so restricted. They have to fall back on this one source, and that is why one finds this inconsistency or anomaly.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am not asking that it should be abolished. I shall tell you in a moment what I am in fact asking. I shall come <span class="col_7671-7672" refersTo="page_1097"/>to that. There is a further phenomenon which gives rise to concern at present. That is that the responsibility of the provincial council is being reduced more and more. When traffic legislation was before the various provincial councils recently, the members of the provincial councils were told quite clearly that they could not tamper with the ordinances because the Administrators and Executive Committees had decided on them jointly, and that the provincial councils should merely accept them as they were. Now I ask, what is the function of a provincial council if the provincial councils as such are tied down to such an extent, with a view to uniformity&#x003F; And one of these days we are going to find exactly the same thing as far as education is concerned. For these reasons, and because these circumstances have arisen since 1910, I believe that the time has come to review this entire system. I have the utmost confidence that if we raise this question with the Government, they will consider it most thoroughly. The hon. the Minister of Finance recently said in a Press statement that he was already reviewing these financial relations which contain aspects of in equitability. He is studying them. I am not asking that the provincial system should be abolished. I merely want to make the statement that since 1910 circumstances have arisen which have made it imperative that this entire system should be reconsidered. As regards its financial aspect, the most important aspect of my speech this afternoon, I have the utmost confidence in our hon. Minister of Finance. And permit me, Mr. Speaker, to congratulate him now on his first Session as Minister of Finance, which is now coming to an end. And allow me to say at the same time that he is assisted by a capable, young and dynamic Deputy Minister of Finance. And if I add to that that we have a very capable young Minister of Economic Affairs, I am convinced that the finance and the economy of the Republic of South Africa are in very safe hands. And that is why I feel confident in raising this matter this afternoon, in the knowledge that they will make a thorough study of it. I believe the Borckenhagen Commission report has been completed and that it will be dealt with during the recess. For that reason I have no hesitation in raising these few points, because I believe that the time has come to review this entire system and to make a very thorough study of it, in order that it may be adapted to our changed circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to what has been said by the hon. member for Paarl. All I gathered from his address to you here this afternoon is that the provincial system should have a slow death and not a sudden one. That was inherent in his speech. But this is a typical approach that has been going on but this is the first time that I am aware of that an hon. member of this House has voiced these sentiments. This surreptitious eroding of the powers of the provinces has been going on for a long time. And what has happened in the past is that the Government has so tightened the string round the purse that we have the position of an Administrator saying that he has become quite ashamed of having to approach the Minister like a beggar, cap in hand, to get a reasonable subsidy. And the hon. member for Paarl will know that when it was in accordance with Government policy that Coloured education should come into the hands of the Central Government, the Government simply cut down the subsidy on education and made it impossible for the Cape Province to continue to run and to finance Coloured education to the extent that the province said: Please take it over, we cannot run it anymore. The hon. member referred to the question of taxation. It is a matter that has been raised frequently by the administrators, namely that the limits on their powers taxation are unfair and unjust. The hon. member mentioned the case of the tax on petrol. He knows that the Central Government at the present moment extracts from the motorist R113 million per year by way of customs and excise on motor vehicles, fuel, parts, spares, types, etc. And after that it merely hands back to the province sufficient to cover national roads. If the provinces were enabled to have the benefit of the total of that taxation there would be no difficulties in financing. There will be no difficulties in financing the roads which is the cause of the hon. member grumbling about the taxation on farms. I do not know whether he realizes that his proposals mean the end of the divisional council system, and the end of the local authorities system if we do away with provincial administrations. The position I believe does need airing. We on this side of the House have repeatedly asked the Ministers responsible to publish and make known the reports of the Borckenhagen and Schumann Commissions. I think the hon. member will be quite enlightened when he reads those reports. He will find, I am sure, if my anticipation is correct &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish I knew. I have to make some intelligent guesses and that is that a little more authority should be given to the provinces and not taken away from them. And I would like to see those reports published because publication is becoming urgent. I do not know how much longer the Schumann Commission report is going to be on the banned list. It has been in the hands of the Government I believe for several years. It is impossible to get a copy of it from the Minister. I think there is something a little more sinister about this proposal, and I say it with reluctance to the hon. member for Paarl. Nationalists call it uniformity, but I believe that the Government&#x2019;s problem is that it does not like independent thought in the lower formations of government. The attitude is that if it is difficult to get the provinces or <span class="col_7673-7674" refersTo="page_1098"/>the municipalities or the divisional councils, to toe the line, let us scrap them and let us govern the whole country&#x2014;that seems to be the line of thinking. Let us get away from the basis of argument and persuasion.</p>

<p>I want to raise one matter with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration on which a certain amount of clarity would be welcome to the country, particularly arising out of the remarks of the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon. The Prime Minister posed certain questions on the federation aspect of the policy of this side of the House, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration or some member opposite if they can perhaps give us a little enlightenment on a very basic aspect of what they term &#x201C;separate development&#x201D;. I ask this because, quite frankly, I do not have a published pamphlet before me; they do not publish pamphlets on the other side of the House to deal with a mobile policy like separate development. I have been trying to find out exactly what separate development entails, and the one aspect I want to deal with is the concept of the hon. the Minister that we have separate nations in South Africa, Black, Coloured, Indian and White, and then again the Bantu are divided into a number of nations. I also understood that attached to those separate nations and their separate development is a separate geographical place for them in the Republic. That is why the homelands are being created, and I understand that it is part of the separate development policy that the ultimate end of the road is self-government for those nations of their own homelands. That seems to be clear. I want to ask the hon. members, if that is the position, and whether they will deal with two aspects. The one is that that concept is foreign to the laws which are at present on our Statute Book. Is it the intention now that such laws as these of citizenship, etc. will be so altered that the laws will provide for these different nations; and is the whole concept of population groups now a thing of the past&#x003F; Because a population group is not and cannot be a nation. What puzzles me, and why I raise this matter, is because the Minister of Bantu Administration read us a long lesson on this subject during the 1966 Session and on other occasions. But I have before me a speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister in April. 1967, when he attended the sitting of the Council for Coloured Affairs. This was issued by the Department of Information. The Prime Minister was speaking partly in English and partly in Afrikaans and these were his words, and not a translation. The Prime Minister spoke of the policy of separate development and said it had become the policy of South Africa and it has not only been accepted by the leaders of the different population groups, which he describes as being Black, Brown, White or otherwise. He goes on to say that it is a fact that we have four population groups, the Whites, the Coloureds, the Bantu and the Indians, and then he goes on to make a further statement which seems to me to run contrary to the exposition we heard from the hon. the Prime Minister when he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to stress the fact that as far as separate development is concerned, it is not only a theory or a philosophy, but separate development is the only practical policy to ensure that different peoples can live together in one geographical area in peace and harmony as we have been living in South Africa and will continue to live here.</block>

<p>In other words, South Africa is to be regarded as one geographical area.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>No. The Hon. Chief Whip can get up and explain how we are going to have separate nations developing to separate individual freedoms and self-government, and yet maintain one geographical area, the Republic of South Africa. If hon. members will take the trouble to read the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech, they will see it is certainly not a fragmentation of South Africa he is discussing. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now want to deal with certain demands that have arisen in this country resulting from the natural population increase and increased immigration. In the time at my disposal I will have to restrict my remarks to one aspect only, and that is the situation in regard to the health services of South Africa. I want to restrict myself entirely to the administrative aspect. I am not a medical practitioner and I am not in a position to deal with this question from a medical aspect, which will be dealt with by other speakers. We find that in South Africa, in the white areas, there is a ratio of one white doctor to 1,440 of the population. In the Bantu areas the ratio is one doctor to 13,000 Bantu, and in the overall picture there is one doctor to just under 2,000 Whites and non-Whites. Our neighbours are in a very much worse position. Let me say so immediately, but I do not want to set out what the position is in our neighbouring countries, except to say that in Angola there is one doctor to 14,500, in Mozambique there is one doctor to 20,500, in Botswana there is one to 21,000, and in Lesotho one doctor to 21,300. The worst of the ratios in Western Europe is in Finland, where there is one doctor for 1,500 people, which approximates to our ratio in South Africa in regard to the Whites. As regards this figure I want to draw attention to the fact that the total number of Bantu doctors registered in 1960&#x2014;I have not got the latest figures&#x2014; was 127. Of these, only 103 were practising in South Africa. They are in various areas, and of the 103 only 20 were within the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>I have raised from time to time in this House the problem of training Bantu and other non-White doctors as a matter requiring urgent attention. It seems that under this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development <span class="col_7675-7676" refersTo="page_1099"/>there is a complete dissipation of effort between the various Departments and Ministers who are responsible. I find that when one wishes to inquire into the position the Minister of Health says he is not responsible; he says the Minister of Education is responsible for setting up the medical schools. The Minister of Bantu Administration is responsible for the training of Bantu doctors, the Minister of Indian Affairs is responsible for the training of Indian doctors, and the Minister of Coloured Affairs is responsible for the training of Coloured doctors. This is an urgent problem. Year after year the question is asked as to what is being done and all the Ministers, up until this year, when we had the exception of the Minister of Coloured Affairs, have said that the matter was under consideration. The Minister of Coloured Affairs said it was intended to establish a medical school, but where will he establish it&#x003F; Apparently he will establish it at the Western Cape College, at Bellville South, but that college can only be established when there are facilities for teaching, and the only facilities for teaching will be at the Tiervlei Hospital which might come into use by 1971. That is when a start can be made in training Coloured doctors. But as far as the Bantu are concerned, one is told that the matter is still under consideration, and we have this answer year after year.</p>

<p>One realizes that problems exist, but where is the Cabinet&#x2019;s responsibility for meeting this problem&#x003F; Is it the Minister of Health on whom the ultimate responsibility rests if there is a breakdown in medical services&#x003F; That breakdown will surely come unless there is some urgent planning, and in the absence of some co-ordination it is unlikely that this problem will be tackled as urgently as it should be. The only legal means of co-ordination is the National Health Council, but the Minister of Health tells me that Council has not been convened since 1952. In so far as the other statutory body is concerned, viz. the Coordinating Council, that is meeting less and less frequently. The Minister of Bantu Administration is well aware of the necessary plans that have been prepared by his Department. I had the privilege in earlier years of attending such a conference dealing with the areas in the Cape Province. He knows the urgency and in reply to a recent question he told me that he is getting on and that the hospitals are being built; he is going to provide something like an additional 4,370 beds, not in the Bantu homelands but in the border areas to serve them. But nothing is being done to train personnel to run those hospitals. The Minister knows that a few Native nurses are being trained, but where is he training enough doctors to attend to the 4,000-odd beds&#x003F; The hon. the Minister should know how many doctors are necessary to run these hospitals, and unless they are going to be provided by the Bantu, then it is a mythical business to talk about separate development. If the Whites are still going to run these hospitals for them, then for how long; for how many generations&#x003F; Perhaps the Deputy Minister of Bantu Education will tell me what he is doing in this connection. The difficulty that the hon. the Minister is faced with is that there are only about 500 Bantu matriculants coming out each year who can possibly be trained for professional occupations, and those 500 matriculants are expected to provide the professional men for millions and millions of black people. Sir that is the problem and I want to know what the hon. the Minister is going to do, because the amount that is spent on Bantu education has been pegged; it does not allow for increased numbers to be educated. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he is going to do in this connection because I see no signs that anything is being done and the people who are responsible for health see no signs of it.</p>

<p>Let me turn to the question of nursing services, and in this connection I want to say to the Minister that the hospitals which are under provincial control at the moment, are doing their utmost ito train Bantu nurses, with the material that is available, as fast as they can. That is being done not by this Government but by the provincial administrations which the hon. member for Paarl wants to do away with; they are the people who are training Bantu nurses and they are training them as fast as they can.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to speak to the hon. the Minister of Health about the question of nursing services generally. According to a recent survey made by the South African Nursing Association, the wastage each year or during the course of training of nurses is over 50 per cent in the case of general nurses and something like 78 per cent in the case of nurses for mental patients and mentally defective persons. Sir, what is being done to meet this problem&#x003F; One finds that in 1933 185 nurses wrote the final examination for mental nursing. Thirty years later, in 1963, the total was 190. That is the progress in thirty years so far as nursing services in mental institutions are concerned.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, perhaps the hon. the Deputy Minister might study the constitution of the country. If he does, he will find that mental hospitals fall under the Minister of Health and have nothing to do with the provinces. I am sorry he is so ignorant. That is why he thinks that the nurses are being trained by the Government when in fact they are being trained by the provincial administrations. Sir, the position is urgent in so far as nurses are concerned. I know that the hon. the Minister is waiting for the report from the Nursing Commission. I hope that there is going to be no question of that report being <span class="col_7677-7678" refersTo="page_1100"/>delayed so that steps can be taken to remedy the position. He indicated to me last year that he hoped to receive the report towards the end of this year.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of planning which comes directly under the Minister of Finance which causes me grave concern. In the capital Estimates this year provision is made for a total expenditure of R109,000 for the expansion and the provision of mental hospitals in this country. It amounts to .3 per cent of the Public Works Vote of R30&#x00BC; million for this year. Sir, this is the planning which is being done by this Government at a time when we are told, as we were told by an hon. Minister on Friday of last week, a few days ago, that at one stage they had to keep 847 mental patients in police cells because there was no mental institution to receive them. In spite of that fact, we find that provision is being made for only R109,000 in the capital Estimates this year. The Minister will be aware of what is being done by the provinces. Here provision is being made in the Estimates for capital expenditure of R109,000 when the four provinces are carrying a total of R131 million for hospital building work to be done, R131 million of which they are providing an amount of nearly R30 million this year. The hon. the Minister will concede, and those with experience in this matter will agree with him, that when you have a Budget, such as we had this year, in which there is no indication of new planning, it means that we are going to sit for four, five or six years without any adequate expansion of these necessary hospital facilities. I come back again to the hon. the Minister and I ask him, as I asked the Minister of Finance earlier, whether he will not let us have a look at the report of the Schumann Cornmission. I am sure that better provision will be made for services for mental patients if all hospitals were under one control, or at least they might be in three of the provinces because I cannot speak for the fourth. If all health services were under provincial control I am sure better results will be achieved.</p>

<p>The final matter which I wish to mention just briefly is the question of civil defence which has arisen and which is part of the question of health services and the taking of adequate precautions in the event of any disturbances within the country. Sir, there has been a very long delay in getting this civil defence organization off the ground. The Minister of Health particularly is concerned with one aspect which flows from the Defence Bill which is passing through the House at the present moment. He will know that civil defence will be very much dependent upon the extent to which voluntary nursing organizations assist the Government and provide the machinery to operate emergency medical services in times of trouble and need. He will find that his colleague, the Minister of Defence, is now making it an offence to mention anything in the newspapers about the voluntary aid detachments of nursing services. That provision is contained in the Defence Bill, and it seems to me a very unwise provision when we are attempting to build up the Noodhulpliga, the Red Cross, St. John&#x2019;s and other organizations of that kind. They need the maximum publicity if they are to get people to join these organizations and to play their part. I hope the Minister will look into this matter and see that there is some co-ordination between him and the Minister of Defence in that regard.</p>

<p>Sir, looking at the results of the Session and looking at the capital Estimates for health services one finds that instead of feeling secure, instead of feeling that our continued prosperity is ensured, instead of the country being happy with this Government, one finds that, in so far as these matters to which I have referred are concerned, it has the greatest reason for the utmost alarm at the neglect on the part of this Government.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>It is disheartening that an hon. member of the Opposition should get up here and ask elementary questions on the colour policy of this Government. The hon. member has been in this House quite some time. It is true that he is not an old member of this House, but he has been here long enough to find out what the basic difference is between the policy of this Government and the United Party policy. But apart from that the hon. member has been on the Provincial Council. He is involved in politics, and he should at least have some knowledge of these elementary things, but what did he do&#x003F; He got up and started by referring to the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister in connection with the different race groups in the country. It is quite clear that the hon. member has no grasp of the policy of this party, for what the hon. the Prime Minister said when he made his first statement as Prime Minister on the steps outside this building was that we in South Africa&#x2014;the Whites, the Blacks, the Indians and the Coloureds&#x2014;would solve the problems of South Africa right here, and that we needed no interference from outside. The hon. member is confusing that with the details of the policy of this Government. But apart from that the Opposition has tried in this debate, and in fact throughout the Session, to create the impression that there is not very much difference between their policy and our policy, and certain sections of the Press have also tried to create the impression that the National Party and the Opposition are not really so far apart, which of course is wrong. The fact of the matter is that we differ fundamentally as regards the most important question facing South Africa, and the fundamental difference relates to the meaning of &#x201C;nation&#x201D;. The hon. member asked, as though it was the first time the matter was discussed here: &#x201C;What does &#x2018;nation&#x2019; mean&#x003F;&#x201D; It is clearly apparent from the various concepts mentioned by him that the hon. member does not understand the elementary points in South African politics, namely who constitute the people of South Africa. That is what it is all about. <span class="col_7679-7680" refersTo="page_1101"/>The important question before the nation is this:</p>

<p>How can more than one nation co-exist peacefully within one geographical unit in future&#x003F; The fundamental difference between this and that side of the House centres on the question: Who constitute the nation&#x003F; We believe that there are several nations in South Africa, and that has been said umpteen times, both here and outside. What is more, everybody except the Opposition understands that. The black people of this country understand what it is all about, and that is why they support the policy of this Government. The outside world is also showing greater understanding than the Opposition, who hear our policy every day. What is more, the public outside understand it, and that is why they support the Government to an ever-increasing extent. But the Opposition inside this House fail to understand it, despite the fact that nothing has been explained to them so frequently as this very concept.</p>

<p>There are signs that the outside world is beginning to understand this concept to an ever-increasing extent, for what is happening in Africa&#x003F; What is now happening in Africa is what happened hundreds of years ago in the rest of the world. Hundreds of years ago Europe was divided into nations. The Western world has run away from the Continent of Africa; it has left it precipitately and it has left it with certain geographical areas in which various nations live together, and it hoped that they would be contented to live within the same geographical boundaries, which was unrealistic and unacceptable, and which is now causing great strife in Africa. What is the position at present&#x003F; In the past decade or two the metropolitan powers have run away from Africa, and now a struggle has arisen here. While we are conducting this debate, the nations of Nigeria are dividing in accordance with the natural boundaries in Nigeria itself; at the moment the fragmentation of that country is progress, and it is not going to stop at East Nigeria and West Nigeria. In the years ahead Nigeria is quite probably going to be fragmented along natural lines. But that does not only apply to Nigeria. All the other countries north of South Africa are splitting along natural lines. Sir, it is a very great truth, a truth that is also basic to the policy of this Government, and it is the law of nature herself, which contains a great diversity in herself, a diversity which reveals itself on all levels, that one cannot force people or things together unless they belong together. That is the foundation of the policy of this Government. It is not a policy which was cleverly devised; it is this Government&#x2019;s attitude to life, an attitude to life which developed as a result of the fact that the white man in this country has co-existed with people of other races through the centuries, which is at present more clearly defined and more clearly set out. It is nothing but a pattern of life which has developed through centuries, since the white man arrived in South Africa. What is the basis&#x003F; Its basis is the simple, natural concept that one should afford an opportunity to people of the same culture, the same language and the same ambitions, who have grouped them together through the years, to preserve their own identity and to seek their own salvation in future, separately and among their own people. That is the basis of the Government&#x2019;s policy. On the answer to the question as to how more than one nation can co-exist permanently and in peace in future, hon. members on the opposite side and we on this side differ fundamentally. We say there is more than one nation. That there is more than one nation is proved by the fact that these nations manifest themselves through their own languages, their own sense of coherence and the urge to live together. Now it is most interesting to see how this concept is accepted by the Bantu in South Africa. I am going to give you examples of how they accept this concept.</p>

<p>When the Government grouped the Bantu in the urban complexes according to their ethnic ties, the tension which had previously existed was resolved immediately. It was accepted immediately and there was peace in those areas. That is one demonstration of it. Another important demonstration is the following: When the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development recently took a further step along the road and projected the development of the Bantu homelands and the greater responsibility placed on local units, this announcement was immediately accepted by the Bantu themselves in great confidence and contentment. An offer was made to them, an offer to co-operate on this basis, and every single national group in South Africa not only accepted it but was also enthusiastic about it. They were enthusiastic about the prospect of making their own way in future, with the assistance of the white man. They were enthusiastic about doing so for their own sake and with a view to their future. That is the basis on which the hon. the Minister is now further developing a policy. The fact of the matter is that in every field where the Government has tried to apply this concept administratively, it has been accepted by the black man of South Africa. An interesting phenomenon in the field of politics in recent times is the following: The breakthrough to the black man himself has come. This is one of the great breakthroughs the Government has made in recent years. Its acceptance is indeed a demonstration of how we are solving our problem in the Republic of South Africa on the Government&#x2019;s basis, while all the Western countries in the rest of Africa failed in their efforts. The very fact that here in the Republic we have peace, acceptance and co-operation on this basis while the rest of Africa is beginning to go up in flames because they function on the opposite basis&#x2014;a basis which is also subscribed to by hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014;demonstrates to the rest of the world that South Africa is succeeding where the rest of the world has failed. That is what is happening at the moment. It is not only a <span class="col_7681-7682" refersTo="page_1102"/>political fact but also a political demonstration of a truth regarding the politics of Africa in these times, something which makes us world leaders.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make in this connection is the following:</p>

<p>This matter has certain implications. In his speech the hon. member demonstrated that he had no grasp whatsoever of what it was all about. In the past millions of people were allowed to live together in this territory of ours. That was in the days when that side was in government. The people were allowed to live together and work together to a large extent. We on this side envisage that it should be different in future. Well, in order to reverse this integration demands a few things. It demands patience on the part of both sections. It demands courage to put it to one&#x2019;s own people and to ask them to accept its financial and other implications. They have to be asked to shoulder the great administrative responsibility It demands a large administration which has to be built up. Furthermore, it demands a great deal of money. It is impossible to separate millions of people, after they have lived together as they lived in South Africa, unless the people are also financially prepared to pay the price. The hon. member complained about administrative problems. He does not understand that what is inherent in the concept of self-development for the Bantu is that we have to make the Bantu start from a certain point&#x2014;no matter how small the beginning may be&#x2014;and that we have to lead him to a certain point. In himself he must be able to move to a certain point. From there, we have said, the following steps&#x2014;the A, B and C&#x2014; of this policy must be taken. What are these steps&#x003F; He must be given an opportunity to develop in his own schools and universities in the educational field. He must also start from a certain point as far as his medical services are concerned. He must receive his training in his own hospitals. We are so far ahead now&#x2014;we are so far ahead in numbers and achievements. And yet the Government is reproached across the floor of the House for supposedly progressing too slowly. How unfair that is! Not only is the Government not moving slowly&#x2014;the Government is moving much more rapidly than the progress made in the rest of Africa. Even more, it is moving more rapidly than any country in the East, apart from Japan, and it is moving more rapidly even than some white countries in Europe and many states in South America. In other words, South Africa&#x2019;s achievements as regards the black man alone are so great that there is no comparison between them and the achievements of other countries as regards the black man. The achievements of the Republic may indeed be compared to the highest norm of achievement in white countries. I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not trying to claim that we compare with developed countries such as America and Switzerland. The fact of the matter is, however, that quite a few of the countries I have in mind now are under white control. I am thinking of virtually all the countries in Central and South America when I say that the achievements of our country&#x2019;s black man are actually comparable with the achievements of those countries&#x2019; white men. That is what it means in effect.</p>

<p>There is therefore the following implication. If we want to pursue this policy, we must provide for a transition period. We must be prepared to lay a certain foundation, slowly but surely. Then it does not befit hon. members on the opposite side to look at us reproachfully and to ask us: Why are there not enough doctors, nurses, etc&#x003F; The fact of the matter is that the black man is contented and has confidence in and is co-operating with the Government to implement its policy. That in itself is such a great breakthrough that the hon. members on the opposite side in this House dare not set out clearly an alternative policy in respect of the black man. Another leg of the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude in the past was that whatever they sought to do, they wanted to measure by one principle: White leadership. Do you know what has happened&#x003F; Neither the black man in South Africa, nor one population group, nor a single responsible ship of the Opposition in the political field, organization is prepared to accept the leader-Not one.</p>

<p>As regards the Transkei, the fact of the matter is that the Government of the Transkei, and not only the Government but also the people of the Transkei, are accepting the policy of this Government to an ever-increasing extent. Even Vendaland, Tsongaland, Zululand and the Tswana areas of the Western Transvaal are ready and willing to accept the policy of the Government. Why&#x003F; Not because the chiefs alone favour it and accept it, but because the people themselves sense and see the results of the Government&#x2019;s achievements and the prosperity and advantage these offer them.</p>

<p>Dreams&#x003F; The hon. members on the opposite side say they are all dreams. Do you know who has been dreaming in South Africa&#x003F; The Opposition were dreaming when they thought they would catch the Black man of Africa by speaking of &#x201C;one big society&#x201D; and &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;. There is nothing as harsh and true in South African politics than the Black man&#x2019;s rejection of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. It is a dream. They were dreaming, but Africa does not dream. The Continent of Africa does not dream. Do you know what is happening in Nigeria&#x003F; There the Black man is demonstrating, without interference from the outside, through himself and for himself, that the policy of the National Party of South Africa is correct. [Interjections.] There in Nigeria, where the Black people are governed by Black people, the inhabitants are rejecting the &#x201C;one society&#x201D; and the &#x201C;great society&#x201D; of which <span class="col_7683-7684" refersTo="page_1103"/>the Opposition speaks. But not only do hon. members on the Opposite side want all blacks together, they want to mix White, Browns, yellows and Blacks. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I just want to say the following. Apart from the breakthrough that has been made to the Black man as regards the policy of this Government, another important breakthrough has been made. There is also goodwill from Bantu states outside South Africa. During the past years this goodwill has unfolded and developed. What is the hard fact of that&#x003F; The hard fact is that outside South Africa, too, the honesty of this Government&#x2019;s policy is accepted. Outside South Africa, too, the truth which lies at the root of separate development is accepted. Do you know when it is going to be a great day for South Africa&#x003F; The great day will be when the voices of which there are now a few will become more and more and more. Because then it will mean that the White man in South Africa has rejected the attitude of that side, that the Black man of South Africa has rejected the attitude, and that the Black man in states outside South Africa has rejected their attitude. Mr. Speaker, the world outside is getting to ask more and more whether South Africa is not perhaps correct, whether South Africa is not winning. I want to predict here that if we follow up our successes in this field, as we have done, not only the black people on this Continent but people all over the globe will accept the Government&#x2019;s attitude. Because it is based and tailored on one great natural law, namely: Bring together and keep together what belong together&#x2014;those who speak the same language, those who have the same ambitions, and those who have to create their own future. Not only are we as White people creating our own future, but with us the Black man is prepared to create a future for himself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened to-day to words, words, and more words. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat says, that people of the same kind, people who speak the same language and who have the same traditions, ideas and ideals belong each with the other. The hon. member, and other hon. members before him, have referred in nearly every case to the &#x201C;swart man&#x201D; as distinct from the white man. I want to say that the group of people for whom the Government has no answer, are the Coloured people, and it is the Coloured people about whom I wish to speak to-day. We hear about &#x201C;multi-national&#x201D;; we hear about &#x201C;multi-racial&#x201D;, and we only have &#x201C;multicoloured&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Here is a group of people nearly two million strong who are with us, and have lived with us for hundreds of years, and the Government is deliberately thrusting them away from us. We get the glib talk, of which we have heard so much to-day, that these people are a nation. Well, let us examine what the Coloured nation really looks like, how it is composed, and what it comprises. First of all, in making classifications, those who are not white or Bantu, are classed as Coloureds. The Coloured nation consists of seven groups, and the seven groups are first the Coloured people, as we know them; the Indians, who include two religious groups, namely Muslims and Hindus; the Malays; the Chinese; the Griquas; other Asiatics; and other Coloureds. In these last-mentioned two groups there are many other groups of people, whose skins are darker than ours and who are classified as Coloured.</p>

<p>I now ask the Government in all sincerity, how such a heterogeneous group of people can be regarded as a nation&#x003F; That is what I should like to know. If there is a nation, surely a nation must have a home-land&#x003F; It is all very well to talk glibly about the Bantustans. I am not going to discuss that this afternoon, except to say this. If the Bantustans could be developed, and if they could be brought to a state of independence, which would make them entirely self-supporting, I think we would all be very happy. But, the Government is singularly silent in regard to the vast number of Bantu, who live around the towns, townships and cities in South Africa. For the Government, these Bantu just do not exist. They say now that the Coloured people are a nation. I should like to ask the Government: What national anthem is the Coloured community expected to sing&#x003F; What flag must it respect What country is theirs&#x003F; Which is their homeland&#x003F; Here is the biggest group of Afrikaans speaking people in the wide world, other than White Afrikaans-speaking people in this country; yet we talk about treating them as separate people, as a separate nation&#x2014;&#x201C; &#x2019;n aparte volk.&#x201D; I say that it is utter nonsense. What does the Coloured man get&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Ovambos have self-determination. They know self-determination means that one determines for oneself what one is going to do. But, the Coloured man is going to get separate development, and we, are going to tell him, how he will develop, separately. We control his social life, his political life, his sporting life and his economic life. He has no say. It is all designed for him. The hon. members whom we have been listening to this afternoon, who throw the ball backwards and forwards, are dealing with people, who have ambitions, fears, hates, loves, anxieties and worries of all sorts and kinds, the same as we have. These are the people for whom I am pleading to-day. May I ask the Government to please tell us where these people are to develop and when will they start. What does separate development mean for the Coloured man&#x003F;</p>

<p>I will go through a few aspects of his life in regard to separate development. His children are not educated, except if they choose to go to school. Firstly, there are insufficient schools, and secondly there are no hostels; there are no boarding bursaries; there are no travelling allowances. These are paid only to Whites. The Coloured man, if he is a teacher, gets a very much lower salary than his White colleague. <span class="col_7685-7686" refersTo="page_1104"/>He does not have any prospect of getting into any of the professions other than being a lawyer or a doctor. If he wants to be an engineer, I ask the Government, where does he develop separately in that profession&#x003F; Where does he participate in the higher brackets, the top echelons of aviation in this country&#x003F; Where does he share in the higher and better paid jobs in the Railways&#x003F; In other Government departments it is always said, that Coloured people can be postmasters in their own townships, and they can be station masters on their little sidings in the Coloured townships. But, if any unbiased man were to walk into any post office, in any city, he will find that the majority of the customers in the post offices, in the White areas, are Coloured and Bantu people. They are not served by their own kind. Coloured people are beginning to ask, whether or not the time has arrived that the policy of separate development be carried out properly. We have seen, and we have discussed it often, that, when a diamond concession is granted, Whites get it and never the Coloureds. With regard to fishing, Coloured people have no harbour, although they were promised one on the west coast, at Elandsbaai. There was a departmental committee appointed to find out where the harbour should be. If an individual wants to enter into the transportation business, the Act militates against him. Where are these people going to develop separately, other than in a few limited and prescribed avenues, set aside and designated by the Government&#x003F;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister in a speech delivered at the opening of the most recent meeting of the Council for Coloured Affairs, spoke in the most glowing terms, almost eulogistically, of what the Coloured Representative Council could expect. The offer was, that they could handle finances, which would be voted by the Central Government. They would have some say in local government, at town council level. They would deal with education, social and community welfare, pensions and settlements in Coloured areas. The present Council of Coloured Affairs has been so dissatisfied, for so many years, that even to-day, although it has had its life extended from the original five years by another three and another one, making eight or nine years altogether, they have discussed every subject, that has been raised in this House, by many speakers who have spoken on behalf of the Coloured people. The Council has complained about the fewness of English schools. They have asked that the English language should be used to a greater extent. They have asked for compulsory education. They have asked for adjustments in teachers&#x2019; salaries to make them more realistic. They have even asked for two universities, or at least one, in the English medium, and they have asked for it to be sited, either in Johannesburg or in Natal. When the Coloured representatives have from time to time raised these matters, Government speakers have said that that was not so. I say to-day categorically that this is the case. These are the matters that have been discussed by the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. This Council is a very unhappy and dissatisfied body, because all its deliberations are in secret. They have complained about the Group Areas Act and the inadequacy of compensation. They have been asking for 2&#x00BD; years for the Transportation Act to be amended and for discussions with the Minister of Transport, and nothing has happened. Let me say here, in passing, that last year in Port Elizabeth a Coloured man got the contract to transport the post from Jansenville to Klipplaat. A case was taken against him before the Road Transportation Board on appeal by the White operator, who was unsuccessful, not on any other grounds than that the man was a Coloured. I ask the Government whether they think that is fair and reasonable.</p>

<p>We come now to the Liquor Act. I heard it said a week or two ago, that Coloured persons, applying for licences in the Coloured arereas, find themselves having to compete with White persons, who have set up their businesses on the perimeters of the Coloured townships. The hon. the Minister of Justice is applying his mind to this problem. I state it simply as a fact, to get it on record. It is grossly unfair. If White people vote to have Coloured people moved out of town, they cannot chase after them to get their business. The Union Council for Coloured Affairs has also been asking for some time, for discussions to take place on the penetration of Indians in Coloured townships in Coloured areas. They, the Council, make no headway. They have also been dealing with another matter, namely the question of trading, where Indians &#x2014;and one cannot blame them&#x2014;who have been pushed out of the White areas by the Department of Community Development, set themselves up in business and in shops provided by Community Development on the borders of Coloured townships. These people are now going to compete for the little business, that is offering amongst the Coloured people. In other words, the Coloured people are the Aunt Sally. There are many cases on record. The departments are well aware of it. The Ministers know about it, and yet it goes on. All this glib talk takes place.</p>

<p>When it is suggested here that Coloured people should participate in our defence, the Government hold their hands up in horror. These are loyal people. They are people who have come to the front, when they have been called upon in the past. They will not only make good soldiers, but loyal soldiers and they are brave men. But, we do not make use of them. Is it intended that they should form a separate army inside South Africa in this mythical homeland which they do not posses&#x003F; So, the sorry story goes on. There is no walk of life readily open to Coloured people because of the prejudice of Whites. Legislation has been passed against them dealing with job reservation, which they resent and reject. Because of the fact, that these people are good <span class="col_7687-7688" refersTo="page_1105"/>tradesmen and the country is developing, there have been more exemptions than declarations under this particular Act. The reason is, that Coloured men are just as apt at acquiring training. They are just as skilled. They are even craftsmen. If the Government would like to do justice to the Coloured man instead of an injustice they would scrap that Act and repeal it forthwith. It is not working, and it never will work. The Coloured man finds himself in the position where his White countrymen do their level best to humilitate him on every possible occasion. In the Free State, as hon. members of this House will know, a departmental commission or committee was appointed by the provincial administration to investigate the possibility of having Coloured people served at different counters in White shops. In all seriousness, this is a type of resolution passed by a Nationalist controlled council and seriously pursued to see whether or not it is a workable proposition. A town council, I think it was the Roodepoort Town Council, came to light promptly, and proposed to serve Coloured and White on alternate days. I say this in all seriousness. When do we get to the stage where we shall have separate tills and separate cash registers, and when do we have separate money&#x003F; Because this is the climax of what I want to say this afternoon. The Government has got to make up its mind, one way or the other. If the Coloured man is to be herded into townships by himself, he has to get his fair share of every possible occupation, trade, and calling which is offered in this country, according to his ability. He has also got to have the opportunity to have the necessary training for that, and his children have got to have the opportunity to be educated to fill those posts. What do we find&#x003F; I said in the beginning of my remarks that it is not unreasonable to say that the 12 million Bantu can be accommodated to an extent in their Bantustans and homelands, but, there is no such place for Coloured people. There is no such place. They are here with us, they are the closest to us, and they have everything that we have ever had and ever will have. Their skins are a little browner than ours in many cases, but there is no other difference. I think, there will come a day of accounting. If ever a charge was laid at the door of this Government, it would be the criminal attitude, which they adopt towards these Coloured people. It has been said by one or two of my colleagues, that Coloured people accept separate development. Let me say here and now, that that is not correct. The Coloured man has got to the stage, when he feels that he cannot hit his head against the wall any longer, and that he cannot live with bitterness in his heart.</p>

<p>There are no other &#x201C;kinkels&#x201D; here at all. These are people we are talking about. The Coloured people are here with us, have always been with us, and I feel that one of the biggest, shall I say, blots on the escutcheon of the Government is their treatment of the Coloured people, because what the Government is doing to the Coloured community is indefensible. It is indefensible in any part of the world, under any circumstances, and at any time, which anybody should wish to choose. When they go to public places, they are isolated, segregated and even chased out. I want to say to the Government people, that the time has come when they must seriously consider that if we are going to pursue the myth of a White South Africa for Whites only, then Whites must work for Whites, Whites must buy from Whites, and Whites must be the only people who deal with Whites. That is what we have heard here. We have heard here about &#x201C;algehele skeiding&#x201D;, and I would just say this, namely that the Government people can laugh about it, that this is what the Government policy means. The sooner people outside wake up to and face the fact that this is what it entails, the sooner will we get some reason into the heads of these gentlemen, who go on to the platteland and propagate this myth, that there is a White South Africa. There is no such thing, never was, and I am absolutely certain never will be. Therefore, I conclude by saying that Coloured people are beginning to think and they will be expressing themselves along the line &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, White leadership is going on first class as far as we are concerned. That is why I am standing here to-day. The Coloured community knows the White men that they can trust, and they know the White men that they can follow. The Government must not run away with the idea, that they can go on to the platteland and make fancy speeches at these obscure places, we read about in the papers, and hoodwink people outside, into thinking that there is a possibility that this can be brought about. The whole history of the policy of this Government is such, that to-day we have more Coloured and more black people in the White towns than ever before. I would say that the Ministers responsible for carrying out the Government policy do their best. However, I am absolutely convinced that every one of them, without exception, should examine his conscience very, very closely every time he goes to bed at night.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>I trust the hon. member for Karoo will forgive me if I do not immediately follow his line of thought. It is obvious that the attitude and the policy on the Government side as far as our internal affairs are concerned, is as different as the north and south poles from that of the United Party. In order to understand that, it seems to me <span class="col_7689-7690" refersTo="page_1106"/>that we must try and understand the immense events and changes that occurred in the world during the Second World War. It is so that before the Second World War the White man was in the position of dominance in the world, and the black man and the brown man accepted that fact. Just as the British and the French and the Belgians were ruling in other parts of Africa, so the black people and the brown people accepted our dominance in South Africa. But during the Second World War a vast change came over the thought of the world, and when I heard the slogan that we fought for world freedom from the Allied side, I often wondered if we in South Africa fully understood what the implications of that idea was going to be. In 1947 I was in the Eastern Province and I saw the Lovedale Institute and various institutions the State was subsidizing for the education of black people, and I asked Government supporters, and all I knew were Government supporters in those days, what they were going to do with the Bantu who were educated and who had degrees, and who had developed political ambitions. Were they going to be sent back to look after the cows. I got no answer. In Cape Town every day Bantu streamed in from the Bantu areas. Bantu who could speak neither Afrikaans nor English, came to town to look for work. They used to beg for money and I, being in a business here in town, used to give them something because they were starving. In Bellville and in the Peninsula, squatters villages began to develop and I used to ask Government supporters what the plan was for the economic development of South Africa. I could get no answer. It is terrible to think of what would have happened to Cape Town and the Cape Peninsula if the United Party had stayed in power and had just let things develop. Not only the White people, but the Coloured people too would have been choked by Black slums long ago. The United Party in 1948 refused to accept these vast changes in the world. It seemed to be their only object to stay in power. In order to do that, they, although they now always talk about national unity as they talked about national unity then, made out to English-speaking South Africans such as myself that the Afrikaans-speaking supporters of the National Party would destroy the rights of the English-speaking South Africans. And curiously enough, because of a certain strange logic, we believed them because those leaders were Afrikaans-speaking, and we had no knowledge of and we had no contact with Afrikaans-speaking National Party supporters. Not only did they whip up and stir up English-speaking voters to fear Afrikaans-speaking National Party supporters, but they whipped up the fear of the ignorant Coloured people, portraying the National Party as horrid Boers which will oppress them. By doing that they managed to get probably 99 per cent of the Coloured votes in 1948 and nearly all the English-speaking votes. But despite that the White nation turned to the National Party who with their feet on South African earth and seeing the world through South African eyes, said that the only road for survival and for happiness and harmony in South Africa was the road and policy of apartheid or separate development. The National Party won the election with 42 per cent of the votes. This is a fact with which the United Party made much play at the time. The Leader of the United Party, General Smuts, said that they were going to reverse the reverse and that it was just a fluke. The United Party always talked about national unity. They had their opportunity. I distinctly remember the last nine years of their regime. They frightened the English-speaking voters and they did not play the game with the Afrikaans-speaking voters. Not only did they frighten the English-speaking voters to make them vote against the Afrikaners, but they did not carry out the agreement of Union in regard to the equality of the two languages with the result that there was constant tension between the two language groups. When the National Party came into power one of the first things the new Prime Minister did was to give the assurance that in the rule of the National Party both languages would be treated equally. And they have been treated on an equal footing since that time. Immediately the tension between the two language groups ceased. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has said that he is glad that South Africa&#x2019;s image in the world is better. But who blackened South Africa&#x2019;s image in the outside world&#x003F; Certainly no Government will ever blacken the image of its own country. In their fury in being defeated and losing power they blackened the name of South Africa. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, at that time &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Ah that time we were in the British Commonwealth. All information which other countries received about South Africa came through London and the United Party had the ear of London and they and their Press did not scruple to blacken South Africa and the new Government. The Government was placed in the worst possible light. I remember the then Leader of the Opposition, General Smuts, in his impotent fury at being rejected by the electorate describing his opponents, the Nationalists, as things that creep in the night. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has expressed great concern about our economic strength. I am very glad that he treats it so seriously. But I distinctly remember a time when the then Leader of the United Party, General Smuts, used his great international position to say and to influence people with the idea that factories would close, banks would shut down and that the tread of unemployed would be heard in our streets. Not only did General Smuts say <span class="col_7691-7692" refersTo="page_1107"/>that but I distinctly remember how hon. members opposite and their followers took great pleasure at the idea of South Africa&#x2019;s discomfiture and weakness. During those first years of National Party rule when it became obvious that it was not true that the National Party, mostly supported by Afrikaans-speaking South Africans, was going to destroy or remove the rights of English-speaking South Africans, they came with the story that once the Republic was established it would be brought about. But actually when the Republic did come as a result of a majority vote by all South Africans living at that time, the National Party Government entrenched both language rights. It is the only entrenchment in the Republican Constitution. What is the position to-day&#x003F; While we believe in a policy of apartheid or separate development and have never deviated at all from that policy or principle and carried it out to its logical consequences, the United Party still fails and refuses to accept that we are a White nation on a black continent. They want to make the most of both worlds. And so the United Party leader says that he wants everything under one umbrella. We still have the old traditional separation but we will have everything in one form of state, be it unitary or federal. The reasoning is: What harm will a Coloured man as an M.P. do&#x003F; That cannot do any harm. It cannot break down the traditional separation. But if a Coloured man was a member of this House with the status of an M.P. how could he possibly entertain friends&#x003F; How can he go into hotels&#x003F; You must thereby break down separation between Whites and Coloureds. We are told that in this federal system the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to give the black people who number 12 million, eight White representatives in the South African House of Representatives. We are supposed to believe and accept the fact that 12 million people are going to accept eight representatives in the South African Parliament, where in the middle of South Africa Lesotho who was created there by another nation and over which we had no say, have complete sovereign independence. That is what we are supposed to believe. Malawi and all their brothers to the North have achieved sovereign independence while our Black people will accept White leadership with eight representatives. I want to know what is going to happen if these people do not want to accept the leadership of the United Party. If they do not accept it we are straight back at White dominance. It is the National Party who is the liberator of nations. We accept the fact that while we will not give up power over ourselves, we realize that power over them is not the point, as long as we have the power to control the destiny of ourselves and of our children.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is a pity the hon. member for Maitland likes to indulge in so much superficial argument. Take one instance. He says we are frightening the English-speaking people into not supporting the Nationalist Party. It is very easy for somebody on this side to turn round and say that they are frightening the Afrikaans-speaking people into not supporting this side of the House. It is a very superficial argument and I think it is an insult to the English-speaking community. As I know them you can lead them, but they are not easily frightened and I do not think they are so unintelligent as to swallow anything that is put before them. As far as national unity is concerned, there is a simple test. Let the Government present us with a Cabinet, a balanced Government of Afrikaans and English-speaking South Africans, and I will concede that national unity has become a fact under the present Government.</p>

<p>Judging by their speeches, the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs have set themselves a twofold target. The one is to improve race relations in the country. The second is to improve our country&#x2019;s relations with other countries, notably the countries of the Old World in the West and the countries of the New World in Africa. This is an aim which the Opposition has consistently propagated. In fact, this is the essence of all politics in South Africa. Of course, the one is very much dependent on the other. Better relations abroad is very much dependent on harmony in race relations at home. A nation is like an individual. Your personal position in society is largely dependent on your general behaviour as an individual, and on this depends your ultimate welfare. In the same way, a nation&#x2019;s position in the society of nations is dependent upon its behaviour as a nation; in other words, on its political actions and beliefs. Therefore, a nation&#x2019;s ultimate welfare and its security are also to a very high degree dependent upon its position in the society of nations. Because, just imagine what development projects South Africa would have been able to tackle, what social benefits we would have been able to give our people, if South Africa were at peace with the world, or rather if the world were at peace with South Africa, and if we were not required to dissipate so much money and manpower on defence against threatened hostilities. There is, therefore, no heavier duty on the Government than to work for greater harmony with the nations that matter in the world.</p>

<p>There was a time when the Government took up a very narrow attitude in this matter. Their attitude was that it was no use trying, that there was no point in trying, to meet argument with argument; that the whole world wanted one thing and one thing only, and that is one man, one vote; and that because we could not concede one man, one vote, there <span class="col_7693-7694" refersTo="page_1108"/>was nothing we could do but to draw the laager and prepare for the worst. This was the most unproductive approach in the political history of South Africa, and I hope we have seen the last of it. The fact is that &#x201C;the world&#x201D;, as we call it, is not a united, single-minded whole. It is an assortment of power blocs and a conglomeration of conflicting interests. No country is without its enemies and adversaries, and we are not the only country with enemies. The Prime Minister was quite right when he said that at the time of General Smuts we also had enemies. No country is without enemies; but the difference is that at the time of General Smuts we had powerful friends, and that is the secret of the security of a country. You can afford to have enemies if you have on your side at least a few powerful friends. And that should be within the resources of any government. I say without hesitation that a government which finds itself unable to be accepted in any alliance of nations anywhere in the world and so strengthen the security of its country is not worthy of support.</p>

<p>That applies to South Africa more than to any other country, because with our immense mineral wealth, with our geographic position, as a country of tremendous strategic importance, and with our long background of intimate association with the West, it is indeed a poor government which cannot find an alliance to belong to. It is of vital importance to South Africa that we belong somewhere. It is no use shouting at the West that we are their best friends and that they are too stupid to realize it. &#x201C;The West&#x201D; is more than a geographic concept; it represents an idea, the broad idea of democracy, and democracy is a very powerful idea, because it respects the desire of every man to share in his own rule. Therefore, because the West is a wider concept than mere geography, a country can be Western orientated and westernized without really being part of what we call the West and the democratic idea it represents. That is where we, in the eyes of others, appear to fail. Let us face that fact. We will have to come to honest grips with this problem if we are sincere in our desire to become an active partner of the West, in the interests of the security of South Africa.</p>

<p>We on this side believe, in the first place, that for the sake of our future welfare, our security and self-respect we must belong. We must be seen to have friends. We must belong to an alliance. I notice that some Government commentators seem to take comfort from the fact that Israel stood alone and yet she prevailed. Sir, this is a poor analogy, because Israel had so many powerful friends, silent as they were in order to avoid a world conflagration &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes. the major nations had to avoid a world war; but I say that Israel had so many powerful friends, silent as they were to avoid a world conflagration, that at the crucial moment in the fighting between Israel and the Arabs, nobody, not even the rest of the great Islamic world, came to the practical assistance of Israel&#x2019;s enemies in the field. So I say again that we must belong, and we believe that we must make up our minds that we want to belong to the West and become once again an active partner in the Western alliance. I firmly believe that in the long run this could be more important to us than our membership of the U.N. We heard much of the U.N. to-day. It is quite true that the U.N. is far from a perfect organization, and we in South Africa certainly have no reason to love the U.N., and I am in full agreement that South Africa should refuse to give any financial support for actions which are aimed against us. And we should encourage every suggestion for improving that organization. But we should be realistic enough to realize that it is futile to expect an organization like the U.N. to be more perfect than the world itself. That will never be. Just as the strongest and best-equipped police force in a country will never stop individuals from starting a fight, so no international organization can prevent conflict from breaking out between nations intent upon fighting.</p>

<p>The point of importance is whether an organization like the U.N. can prevent local conflict from becoming a world conflict. That is the important thing, and let us be fair. Since the Second World War, the world has been seriously threatened on many occasions. There was Berlin, and there was Hungary, and there was Cuba, there was the Congo, and there are still Vietnam and the Middle East. There was also Korea. And despite the brinkmanship we so often faced, in every case, the conflict was contained and a world conflict was avoided, as the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out. There is endless room for debate as to what would have happened if there were no machinery such as the U.N. in existence, and how much the U.N. positively contributed to preventing world conflict. We should always be grateful for suggestions put forward, whether they are put forward by the Prime Minister or by the Leader of the Opposition, to improve the U.N. But in the end all that counts is that there exists an organization where the major powers can meet and indulge in a war of words, if necessary, as they do at the U.N., rather than to withdraw into hostile camps where they are not faced with the task of meeting criticism as they have to do in the open forum of the U.N. It is very significant that the last war was started by those very countries that had left the World Organization and had withdrawn into their own camps and were no longer prepared to meet with the others in open discussion.</p>

<p>As far as small nations are concerned, like us, I believe that we should seek our security by becoming an active member of the Western alliance, preferably within the framework of an organization like the U.N., and I believe we can do it. The question is how we should proceed in terms of practical politics. What <span class="col_7695-7696" refersTo="page_1109"/>should we do&#x003F; I was most grateful to learn from the hon. the Prime Minister, not to-day but when he spoke in the Other Place, that he was keen to have this kind of problem thrashed out in open debate. If he was correctly reported, he said that he was willing to engage in debate for days, so important was it for South Africa to find the right answers. I want to thank the Prime Minister for that, and to say to him that he will find the Opposition more than willing to participate, if he means by debate discussing the problem. But we have learned, and I am sorry to say it, that this kind of debating has become a rare occurrence, because no sooner do we start discussing a problem than hon. members opposite start attacking the man and the party. I sincerely hope that I understood the Prime Minister correctly to imply that he wanted us to tackle the problem rather than to tackle the man. If this is so, let him say so and let him consider whether our Parliament should not follow the footsteps of other Parliaments where it is against the rules to digress from the matter under discussion and attack the person of the member and indulge in personalities.</p>

<p>Coming to the question as to how we should proceed in terms of practical politics to improve our international relations, I think the main answer lies with race relations at home. But before I come to that, let me deal with a few improvements that could profitably be considered in the field of foreign relations. In the first place, Parliament should have a Standing Committee on Foreign Relations to consider the question of international conferences, matters relating to the diplomatic service, relations with the U.N. and other international and African organizations, and, generally, the relations of South Africa with foreign countries. The establishment of such a Standing Committee would immediately tend to give to the question of our foreign relations a wider basis, less of a partisan basis and more of a national basis than is presently the case. Most important of all, this would give Parliament the opportunity to deal with the South-West Africa situation on a national basis rather than on a party-political basis. In fact, this is so important that I believe that I should make this a separate heading and call it Point No. 2, because if there is one matter which should be dealt with on a national basis and not a partisan basis it is South-West Africa. I believe this could be done through a Standing Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>Secondly, I believe that we should go out of our way to re-establish contact between our Parliament and other Parliaments in the rest of the world. Members who participated in the old Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and who attended parliamentary conferences of the C.P.A.&#x2014;I was fortunate enough to attend one such conference, the first one to be held on African soil, in Nairobi in 1954&#x2014;will testify that it was of immense value to South Africa, and that we benefited tremendously by contact between members of our Parliament and members of other Parliaments.</p>

<p>It is a pity the hon. the Prime Minister did not tell us about this this afternoon, but I am extremely grateful to hear it, because we have been asking for that for a long time. I believe it is vitally important that this should be made a success, and I will leave this point until further details are available. I hope that as many exchange visits as possible will be organized between our legislators and the legislators of other countries.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, we should do everything in our power to attract international conferences to South Africa&#x2014;all kinds of international conferences. I think we have been far too afraid of colour; and far too afraid of the world. South Africa will prove to be a most popular venue for international and regional meetings, and I can think of no greater advertisement for South Africa than to promote this kind of activity. Personally I would say that a city like Johannesburg is best suited to accommodate such conferences. There are several large hotels of international standard being erected, some now nearing completion. Some of these will have conference facilities, but if the Government finds that suitable conference facilities are not available then I would suggest that such accommodation be provided in co-operation with one of the universities on the Witwatersrand, either the University of the Witwatersrand or, even better, the new Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit, for which new buildings have to be erected. I can think of no better idea than that the Government should provide the necessary facilities to make it possible for us to invite international conferences to our country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly not, but we have been very hesitant and the Minister knows that that is so. On several occasions when there was talk of international conferences here there was no encouragement given at all because of the question of colour. Furthermore, I do not think that we should hesitate any longer to invite an exchange of diplomats with those countries in Africa who are willing to be on friendly terms with us. Sir, I believe that such a step would have important benefits for us in those countries and, not least of all, it would help to create in our country not only contacts for business people <span class="col_7697-7698" refersTo="page_1110"/>but the right psychological climate for the outward-looking approach which some leading circles in the Government are trying to promote.</p>

<p>In the sixth place. Sir, I believe that it is essential that we make our diplomatic service more attractive to people of talent outside the party political ranks. I firmly believe that our diplomatic service should be the most attractive career in the whole of the Public Service. The highest positions should be open to those who make it their career, and I believe that this should be the rule rather than the exception. At the same time I want to say that I believe that the diplomatic service should be far more representative than it is at the present time. I think we should start now with the training of South African non-Whites to help to man positions abroad. Sir, it cannot be argued away that in the present climate of world thinking, a non-White speaking up for South Africa and helping to represent his country is often far more effective than miles of argument. That has already been proved in the case of private agencies who have included trained, talented non-Whites in missions they have sent abroad in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I do believe that we should at all times hold our own on the international platform and that we should not withdraw. There must be no question of withdrawing. I go so far as to say that we should miss no opportunity, no invitation, to argue the case for South Africa. I believe that the time has never been so ripe for a forward thrust, for dynamic action, as it is to-day. Sir, the outcome of the South-West Africa case at The Hague has given an important breathing space to South Africa. The events in the Middle East have proved once again our strategic importance, and events in the Middle East and Vietnam have taken much of the heat off South Africa, and therefore the time is ripe for a forward thrust on the foreign front as well as on the home front, because in the last instance the future relations of South Africa with the rest of the world will depend on our handling of human relations in our own country. It is true that the Government is at last making the right kind of statement in the right places abroad. The Government stated not so long ago&#x2014;last year&#x2014;in no uncertain terms that it was moving in the direction of removing discrimination in South Africa. Sir, I would like to have heard the Prime Minister say a little more about that this afternoon. He is very effective when it comes to popular politics, but we want to hear from him how he intends to set about removing discrimination, as solemnly declared to the United Nations. In front of us lies an immense task, the task of bringing peace and balance in the relations between the diversity of peoples in South Africa. I believe that we must distinguish between unity and uniformity. The unity which is South Africa must be based on a recognition of its inner diversity, and I believe that if we concentrate on fundamentals and eliminate petty stuff which only tend to spoil our image, we would have a big chance of improving our position abroad. Our problem is not as unique as we try to suggest. The world is full of examples of countries with diverse peoples and nationalities, all within the same country, seeking a way to live together without sacrificing cultural and historical identity. There are examples in every part of the world, and a very glaring example that comes to mind is that of Yugoslavia. The attempt to form a &#x201C;Yugoslav Nation&#x201D; from Serbians, Croatians, Slovenians, Bosnians, Montenegrins and Macedonians has failed because of the deep contrasts amongst the peoples making up that country. Not even the brutal force of two dictatorships, a Royal Serbian one and an international communist one. were sufficient to overcome the cultural, religious and historical contrasts and the crass economic differences between these related nations. The federal idea came to their rescue, with very marked success. I am not suggesting that we in South Africa should copy any other country. The conditions are nowhere quite the same, but what I am saying is that it is always helpful to look and see how other countries with similar problems overcome some of their difficulties. Let us be frank. In our country it cannot be expected of any self-respecting Bantu nation to accept exclusive white rule or white domination for all time; but similarly we white people will never be willing to accept Black domination. It must be clear to everybody that we must find a way whereby we can co-operate without the one dominating the other, because we shall simply have to co-operate. Sir, for one thing, we form an economic workshop; we will never get away from that. Think of the many links of communication; think of the security we would lack if we were not the unity that we are. If in South Africa the military, the police, the security services, were not free to operate over the whole field, what would the position have been&#x003F; I wonder, for instance, where we would have been if the thousands of loyal Bantu serving in the S.A. Police were not available to help stamp out subversion and crime. We are very heavily indebted to Bantu police co-operating with white police. Johannesburg would be an impossible place to live in if it were not for Bantu police assisting the white police. Sir, time will show that there are fields where you can have separateness but there are fields in which Black and White will have to co-operate, whether we like it or not; and therefore our aim should be to establish co-operation without domination. Of course, there will be obstacles and difficulties, but, Sir, who has ever achieved anything by only seeing obstacles and losing sight of the possibilities&#x003F; [Interjections.] Leadership is not the same as domination, or do hon. members opposite look upon their Leader as dominating their Party&#x003F; I do believe that we should move, as has been stated over and over again, in the direction of the development of &#x201C;kerngebiede&#x201D;, as I prefer to call them, for the different Bantu peoples, and &#x201C;kerngebiede&#x201D; for <span class="col_7699-7700" refersTo="page_1111"/>Whites cum Coloureds cum Indians &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout started his speech to-night by saying that foreign relations depended upon domestic relations. I also believe that this is true to a large extent, but I just want to put this question. Since when has our image abroad started improving&#x003F; I want to make the statement that it started improving when the Opposition stopped thinking that its salvation to come to power in South Africa once again would come from abroad. Over the years the United Party has made a point of availing themselves of every opportunity to say and do things intended for overseas consumption and not to promote the welfare of South Africa. If in the past we had a wrong image abroad, then I am laying it squarely at the door of the United Party over the years. But since the verdict in the South-West Africa case, the United Party has undergone a remarkable change. It acquired &#x201C;a new image&#x201D; and it wanted to pose as the great patriot. I just want to remind the Opposition of the fact that before that verdict was given, their own Leader made a speech in Windhoek, where he said that he had a policy which was acceptable to the outside world, not a policy which was acceptable to South Africa. He played with the cards of the outside world to obtain foreign aid so as to come to power in South Africa. That is the game the United Party has been playing over the years.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to dwell on that point too long, because in regard to foreign relations the hon. member for Bezuidenhout expressed certain thoughts here in respect of which I can agree with him wholeheartedly. I can name a few of them, but I do not think that it is necessary to waste my time on doing that.</p>

<p>I want to come to a second thought, and that is in connection with domestic relations. The hon. member said that as regards domestic relations we should not pursue a policy of &#x2018;&#x2018;uniformity&#x201D;, but of &#x201C;diversity&#x201D;. I want to read what he said on a previous occasion to accentuate this idea of &#x201C;diversity&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is and will always be a multi-racial state. It cannot be anything else. A Zulu will not become a Xhosa and a Xhosa will not become a white man. It will remain a country of many nations and nobody on earth will change that.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said this year in a debate in this House on 12th April, and to-night he emphasized that once again. But how does this agree with what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition advocated here this afternoon&#x003F; Because the Leader of the Opposition laid a great deal of emphasis on one idea this afternoon; he said that we were one people and one state in South Africa, and he quoted the example of Israel. He said that if we could really be one people and one state, then we could follow the example of Israel and then we, like Israel, would also be able to accomplish a great deal, but he said that as long as we wanted to regard the other population elements, such as the Xhosas, as separate nations, we would never have that unity. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wanted to know this afternoon when we would achieve unity and how such a state would be able to function. I want to express just a few ideas to-night about these two thoughts that were expressed here by the Opposition: the thought that was expressed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, namely that we are a multi-racial state, and the thought that was expressed by his own Leader, namely that we are one state and one people. Mr. Speaker, we, the National Party, do in fact believe in that diversity of nations. The hon. member for Zoutpansberg portrayed this in very explicit terms this afternoon. We believe that every nation in South Africa has an identity of its own. We believe that every nation in South Africa has its own nature and its own character. We believe that every nation in South Africa has its own purpose and its own destiny. We believe that we have here one white nation, one mature nation with its own state, i.e. the white mature state, and we believe that we have under our trusteeship nine Bantu nations and two minority groups that have not yet developed into nationhood. They are still groups in that they have not yet developed the solidarity of nationhood. I am referring here to the Coloureds and the Indians, but I am not excluding the possibility that they may and will become nations in the future. The United Party talks about one nation and one single state, a concept which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition emphasized here a great deal this afternoon. The logical conclusion at which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ought to arrive with that starting point of one nation and one state, as the hon. the Prime Minister pointed out this afternoon, is that in that case he should believe in integration. If he believed in one state and one nation, then he must believe in dividing lines being wiped out. That is the logical conclusion, but he is confronted with a dilemma. He knows that on that standpoint he and his party have time and again been rejected by the electorate. The nations of South Africa do not want that. Not one single nation in South Africa, as the hon. member for Zoutpansberg pointed out so strikingly this afternoon, wishes to hear anything about dividing lines being wiped out. The Bantu nations accept this diversity; the white nation accepts this diversity and both <span class="col_7701-7702" refersTo="page_1112"/>the Coloureds and the Indians accept this diversity of nations in South Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore the United Party finds itself in a dilemma, and it wants to escape from that dilemma by designing a kind of policy whereby only this diversity of colours will be taken into account, a policy whereby these differences in race and colour may continue to exit. The first problem that faces them is the question of numbers, because according to their point of view there are 3&#x00BD; million Whites to 14 million non-Whites, according to the 1960 census. In other words, the non-Whites outnumber the Whites by an enormous majority. You must remember, Mr. Speaker, that they do not regard our population groups as one nation as distinct from another nation, but as non-Whites on the one hand, all of them grouped together, as distinct from the Whites. Let me contrast with that the National Party&#x2019;s point of view. If one goes by numbers, one finds the following ratio: One has a White nation of 3&#x00BD; million, a Zulu nation of 2.8 million, a Southern Sotho nation of 1.2 million, a Xhosa nation of 3 million, a Tswana nation of 1 million and then one has the other population groups that are under 1 million in number and the Coloured group with1.6 million and the Indians with .4 million. If you look at these figures, you will see at once that the white nation is numerically the biggest nation in South Africa. Under our policy there is no question whatsoever of our finding ourselves in a numerical dilemma. I maintain that if we approach this matter from an ethnic point of view, then it is already obvious that we do not have that dilemma at all. At any rate, there is no need for us to reply with figures because to the National Party policy of separate development this is not a problem at all. A nation is a nation, whether it is big or small. To us it does not make any difference because we know that all the Whites belong to the same nation and that all the Xhosas belong to their nation, and the same applies to the Zulus. Numbers are of no importance in this respect, but they are in fact of importance in the United Party&#x2019;s point of view in which it wants to take differences in race and colour into account because it does not want to accept the logical outcome of integration. Why do numbers count in their policy&#x003F; It is because numbers bring them to the dilemma of numerical domination. They know that the moment one draws distinctions within the same nation and creates minority groups &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the dilemma of racial domination. That is the dilemma they are trying to accommodate by means of their race federation plan. I took the trouble to analyze this race federation plan so as to see precisely what we have in this race federation. The race federation plan originated in 1963, by way of an article written in the <i>Sunday Times</i> by the Leader of the Opposition. Before that time they tried to get out of this dilemma by writing into their constitution those so-called &#x201C;checks&#x201D; and &#x201C;balances&#x201D; or by means of a &#x201C;Bill of Rights&#x201D;, but they abandoned those things and then they arrived at the race federation plan.</p>

<p>What is this race federation plan on close examination&#x003F; This plan has two levels. Firstly, on the level of central government there is the parliament, and then there is the level of the communal governing bodies of the various races. They never refer to nations, but to races. The race element of the plan should be sought in their race representation, and the federation element should be sought in the way the powers are distributed between their communal governing bodies and the central governing body. I should like to deal with the federal idea first. A federation consists in having two governing bodies between which the powers are distributed. Each receives its share of the powers, but the one cannot dominate the other as far as those powers are concerned. Each governing body has its powers which have been allotted to it and in respect of which it is sovereign. Is that the case here&#x003F; On the lower level we find that they have in their race federation plan communal councils for every Bantu area and then they have communal councils for the Bantu outside the Bantu areas. They have a communal council for the Asiatics and four communal councils for the Whites and the Coloureds to take the place of the present provincial councils. They have all these various communal councils, but then they say that these communal councils will always be &#x201C;under the supervision&#x201D; of the central governing body. &#x201C;The general supervision will be necessary and very important during the formative years of the federation.&#x201D; That is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wrote in <i>The Star</i> of 5th November. Therefore the U.P. does not envisage federation at all. What it does envisage is that it will have a number of communal governing bodies controlled by the central governing body.</p>

<p>Now we come to the central governing body. This is the highest level. What does it consist of&#x003F; It consists of the Whites and the Coloureds in the Cape and Natal, and they will be placed on the same Voters&#x2019; Roll. Along with the Whites of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State they will elect 160 representatives. They will have 40 representatives in the Senate. That is according to their race federation plan. The Bantu, consisting of approximately 11 million people at present, will have eight White representatives in the House of Assembly and six White representatives in the Senate. I can understand why the hon. member for North Rand is laughing about that, because it is ridiculous. He never understood it himself. The Coloureds of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal will get separate White representatives in this House, but they have never said how many. The last time we put this question <span class="col_7703-7704" refersTo="page_1113"/>to the Leader of the Opposition in this House, he did not reply directly. He said one or perhaps two. On 13th April this year, in column 4155 of Hansard, he said that the Asiatics would also be given one or two White representatives in this House. You will notice that according to this whole plan the white race has no governing body of its own, because it has to share this central council with the Coloureds. The Coloureds must also sit here as representatives. Therefore the whole position is that it is only the white race that does not have any separate representatives for itself in terms of their federation plan. The white race must share it with the Coloureds throughout, but the other races will have representatives, although they will supposedly be Whites. Why the Whites can be represented in this House by Coloureds, while the Bantu are to be represented by Whites, is a matter only the United Party can understand.</p>

<p>But from this one thing becomes very clear, namely that 4&#x00BD; million Whites and Cape Coloureds will then have to dominate 11 million Bantu completely, in the ratio of 160 to approximately eight representatives of the Bantu in this House. Will it be possible for that domination to endure&#x003F; They themselves admit that it cannot endure, as the hon. the Prime Minister indicated in his speech here this afternoon. It is simply going to depend on the pressure that will be exerted on them. Their policy reminds me a great deal of a pressure-cooker. When the pressure-cooker has to let off steam, they will change their policy. Their policy is nothing but a pressure-cooker policy. There is no guarantee whatsoever in this plan of theirs. I want to put it this way. There is no race plan, there is no federation plan and there is no race federation plan at all. After this speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout &#x2014;the speech he made on 12th April, 1967&#x2014;the United Party itself said that it was no longer a race federation, but also a federation with a geographic concept. That was as a result of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s speech on 12th April, 1967. The geographic element has now been added to that plan.</p>

<p>If we look at the ridiculousness of this plan, which can never be carried into effect, then we see that it brings them back to the logic of their starting-point, namely that one state in South Africa means that they must also accept integration. One state and one nation without integration of the various race groups is a ridiculous idea. They will have to accept that. Now they want to attribute that to us as well. They are confronted by that dilemma, but now they say that we are also confronted by that dilemma. They say that our policy is only theoretical, because there are 3,471,000 Bantu in the white areas. Time and again they cast into our teeth the fact that 55 per cent of the Bantu are supposedly living in white areas. To the United Party this is a real danger to their policy. That is true, because as their numbers increase in the white areas, there will have to be more integration under their policy. But under our policy this is quite a different question. Numbers cause no fears whatsoever in the case of the policy of separate development. Large numbers of Bantu in the white homeland do not make any difference, because they do not cease to be Xhosas or Zulus, in the words of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Each of them still knows to what nation he belongs. The charge is leveled against us that they are detribalized Bantu. They are supposed to be detribalized Bantu. If they are detribalized to that extent, I want to add that even if it was true that they have no tribal background, they have nevertheless not ceased to have an ethnic background. They still have the background of being Xhosas or Zulus or whatever nation they may belong to. Through this policy of ours we retain that ethnic background, in spite of the fact that they are here in the white homeland. Irrespective of how large their numbers here may be, they still fit in with the political set-UD of their own nation. The way we view the State of South Africa is that we do not only have one state here, but a state with emerging states for each of these nations, under the supervision of the Whites. They are going to find their refuge in that. In that framework they are going to find their political salvation, and there they will be able to realize their political aspirations. There they will become full-fledged citizens of their own nation. [Interjections.] We shall come to them presently. Just give me an opportunity. Even if they are working here in our homeland, they are still able to link up with their nation.</p>

<p>But now the United Party says that they are integrated with the Whites here, and that there is economic integration already. We have argued this matter so often that I do not want to repeat all the arguments. Nevertheless, there is one point I want to mention again. That is that the concepts of the economy should be approached scientifically. The economic concepts are those of money and goods, capital and commodities. These are the concepts with which the economy works. If one talks about economic integration, one has to work with those concepts. If a Bantu invests his money in a bank, that Bantu does not become integrated with that bank. All that is integrated with that bank is his money, because it becomes part of the money invested in that bank. [Interjections.] Yes, it may seem ridiculous to you, but that is the concept. You are referring to economic integration, not I. If a Japanese sells a camera to South Africa, he does not become a South African and he does not become integrated. They are merely trading here. That camera becomes part of our economy in South Africa. If a Briton provides certain services in America, he does not become integrated in America and he does not become an American. His services do become integrated with the economy of America. Arguing purely on the economic concepts of money and goods, capital and commodities, the provision of services that are a commodity can never be regarded as the integration of <span class="col_7705-7706" refersTo="page_1114"/>the person by whom those services are provided. Under our system integration can never take place as a result of the fact that those persons are providing their services here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point spoke here this afternoon about the idea of citizenship. He said that we should explain the so-called idea of citizenship a little. Recently the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development made a very interesting speech in the Senate. He pointed out the multiracialism in our policy. He said that we should also place the relations between the various nations and ourselves on an &#x201C;inter-national&#x201D; basis rather than a person to person basis. As far as the idea of citizenship is concerned, we should look once again at the prototype the National Party created in the Transkei. There we have two kinds of citizenship. At present we have two kinds of citizenship for the Transkeian citizen. He has citizenship in that state which has self-rule, but in terms of the South African Nationality Act he has another nationality. He is still a South African. You had a similar idea under the old British Commonwealth of Nations. At that stage you had a &#x201C;common status&#x201D; as a British subject, but you also had citizenship of the dominion of which you were a citizen. That is the basic idea with which we are working in respect of these nations. Now the hon. member says that they are all citizens of the same country. At the moment they are citizens of South Africa, but the moment their states have been developed, they will be granted their citizenship in those states, even if they still have South African nationality. The moment they become independent their citizenship of the White state will cease. Then they will only have citizenship of their own state. That is the position.</p>

<p>The position will be as it is in the Transkei. If the hon. member does not know that, he should read the Transkei Act. Therefore this is in actual fact not problem. Hon. members are saying that in 1949 we piloted through the Citizenship Act and that we made all of them South African nationals. That is true. We made them citizens. But that does not mean that they will become emancipated within the framework of our politics and that they will not be granted their own citizenship in due course.</p>

<p>Now we come to the Coloureds. I said that we regard the Coloureds as a minority group. That is because they consist of various homogenous groups which, however, have not yet developed the feeling of solidarity of a single nation. However, I am not saying that they will not become a nation. We are training them to become a nation in due course. Once they have reached that stage where we can grant them recognition as a nation, we can treat them the same as we do the other population groups with which we are dealing. But I want to emphasize that these processes will take many years. They do not merely take decades, but may even take centuries. Just as the process of emancipation our Bantu population has to go through is a lengthy one, it will also be a lengthy process even for the Coloureds to make such progress that they may develop into one homogeneous nation. Once they have reached that stage, they and the Bantu can be treated alike. The object we are pursuing is very obvious. That is why we have already established institutions for them, to make it possible for them to develop that feeling of solidarity. That is why we have established a university for them. That is why we have settled them in certain townships, separate from the Bantu. Under the United Party regime the poor Coloureds were the step-children of this country, because in every location they forced the Coloureds to live among the Bantu. Here in Cape Town, too, the Coloureds were not given separate townships. They were merely pushed into the backyards of the Whites or forced to live among the Bantu. They never gave them separate townships. This National Party is giving them separate townships in which they can develop as communities. That is why we have a Department of Community Development to develop these communities, the Coloured community amongst others, so that the Coloureds may develop themselves into a full-fledged nation. If we have the pattern for the Bantu nations, we shall also have the pattern for the Coloureds in due course.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to follow very far the line which the hon. member who has just sat down has taken. However, I want to deal at once with the statement which he made and repeated. He repeated it obviously because he wanted to get it on the record. I do not think it should go on the record without its flat contradiction. His statement was that the Leader of the Opposition had used the phrase during his speech this afternoon that we in the United Party stood for &#x201C;een volk in een staat&#x201D;. In that regard the hon. member proceeded to build half an hour of his speech. He drew deductions from this statement. He made assumptions. He went on to say what the consequences would be, and so forth. This was all based on a completely false premise. My Leader made it clear that the term &#x201C;een volk&#x201D; could be translated as having many meanings. It is quite clear that the hon. member who has just sat down was determined to give it the very narrowest meaning, read in conjunction with the words &#x201C;in een staat&#x201D;. My hon. Leader did not leave it there. He was questioned by the hon. the Prime Minister. He made it clear that if &#x201C;een volk&#x201D; meant a common citizenship, then there was common citizenship in South Africa. Indeed this Government was responsible for giving South African citizenship to the Bantu, and not only to the Bantu, but to the Coloureds and Asiatics in South Africa as well. <span class="col_7707-7708" refersTo="page_1115"/>In fact the citizenship which is now general throughout South Africa, was a citizenship created in terms of legislation passed by this Government. I go further. My Leader went on to say that nevertheless and in spite of that, this Government was responsible for legislation which was giving the various ethnic groups of the Bantu a special and particular loyalty, first to their own people and only secondly to South Africa.</p>

<p>Hon. members say &#x201C;correct&#x201D;. That is the end of the argument of the hon. member who just sat down. His own colleagues say &#x201C;correct&#x201D;. He was wrong. His basic assumption was false, his premise was wrong, and the whole of his case which he took half an hour to build, was simply a house of cards which falls down with the first puff of wind. I have other things to say tonight, but I do want to say to the hon. member who, in the last five or seven minutes of his speech went on to deal with the Coloured people and the Asiatics here in South Africa, that I know him and that he is in a privileged position where the Bantu are concerned. I think, however, that he should make a wider study of race relations in South Africa and have a look at the Coloured people, and not only the Coloured people down here in the Cape, but the Coloured people in Natal, who come from a completely different racial stock, who do not come from a common stock, even amongst themselves. They come from three different racial stocks. When the hon. member has applied the policy of his Government of separate ethnic groups, having sovereign independence in their own independent homelands, and he applies that logically to the Coloureds in South Africa, and to the Asiatics in South Africa, then there will be time for him to come along and tell us whether he is going to apply it in the case of the Bantu. As long as that hiatus remains in the argument of the Government, they can never climb over it. We either give homelands to all the people and we treat them all alike, and give them all similar rights, or we do not give it to the non-Whites at all. We must draw a line somewhere. Where are they drawing a line to-day in regard to the Coloured people&#x003F; In my own province they are drawing it, and the hon. member is a party to it. They are drawing a line in regard to the Coloured people in Natal who. not being on the common roll when the Separate Representation of Voters Act was passed, have no franchise at all. They have given a franchise to the Bantu, but not to the Coloureds of Natal. They do not treat the Coloureds of Natal as they treated the Coloureds of the Cape in regard to the franchise. Why not&#x003F; Why discriminate against them&#x003F; They leave the Coloureds on the common roll in Natal. They took them off the common roll in the Cape and made a big song and dance about it, but they were quite illogical, because they have left them on the common roll in Natal, but only those who already were on it. Since then, whatever the qualifications of the Coloured man in Natal have been, he does not get any sort of franchise. They give it to the Bantu, but not to the Coloured. What kind of a logical attitude is that for Government speakers to adopt&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member should not interrupt like that. He says:</p>

<p>What about the Indians&#x003F; I shall tell him what about the Indians. The Indian in Natal has no franchise as regards the municipalities, nor the Provincial Council nor Parliament. But when the Indian comes from Natal, under the Government&#x2019;s legislation he goes on the separate roll here and becomes a Coloured man. He then has a franchise and has a parliamentary vote and a municipal vote. That is the position under the hon. member&#x2019;s Government. Therefore he need not say to me: What about the Indians. He does not know about the Indians. If he would listen to me for a bit, he would learn quite a lot to-night.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with a matter which has been dealt with here by my Leader and by the hon. the Prime Minister and also by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. That is the question of the United Nations. I think we can easily let our feelings run away with us in regard to the United Nations. Heaven knows there is plenty of provocation from time to time for us to feel that we have lost faith in them completely. I would be the last to suggest that there is not room for improvement. Along the lines of the suggestion which has been made by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;not quite as it was put across by the S.A.B.C. this evening, but along the lines that he suggested&#x2014;it may well be that there is big room for improvement. I want to say that I think we in South Africa should be wise in our generation. We should not be afraid to face the signs. We should read the signs as clearly as we can, even if it means being very uncomfortable in the process. We are a very small nation, and we have seen a very small nation that has been successful in a lightning war. I wonder whether we realize that Israel was fighting our battle when it fought the battle up there. If Israel had been swamped or wiped out. the influence of Russia would have come right down, south of the Asiatic Peninsula. It would have spread right into Africa, into our continent. The only thing which stopped that influence was Israel in this fight. Our own people must be a little more wide awake than the President of Egypt was. I think that he must be one of the most na&#x00EF;ve men alive at the present time. He believed that he could swamp Israel and still maintain his independence and the independence of the small nations who had lined up with him to gang up against Israel in the recent war, and maintain the oil supplies in the Middle East. <span class="col_7709-7710" refersTo="page_1116"/>How na&#x00EF;ve can a man be&#x003F; Did he not realize that Russia&#x2019;s sole concern was in connection with the oil in the Middle East&#x003F; Once that battle was won by Egypt and its allies and Israel had simply been swamped and annihilated&#x2014;which they said was their intention&#x2014; where would the influence of Russia have ended to the south&#x003F; Our memory is so short. I wonder how many hon. members here have read the history of the three Baltic states, Lithuania and the other two, and what happened to them&#x003F; This was one of the most tragic chapters of human suffering. Did the United Nations sit down and decide how they were going to give independence back to the three Baltic states&#x003F; Most people do not even know about them. They do not even know their names.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people have read the history of Russia&#x2019;s take-over of the oil wells in Rumania. Why was Russia so interested in those areas, when the name Baku was on everybody&#x2019;s lips once upon a time&#x003F; To-day they do not know where it is. Sir, these things come and go. What we have to realize is that when Russia and America, the two great giants, are opposed to each other, honest men may come by their own. If those two gang up together, it does not matter about the United Nations. When those two have ganged up together, there is nothing to stop them. That is what we should realize here in South Africa. We should be willing to make friends ourselves, not only to try to strengthen the United Nations. However uncomfortable it may make us from time to time, and however stupid we may think that they are, we should be willing to make friends ourselves. We should go out to make friends whenever it is possible. It is opportunities like these which have now presented themselves as a result of the war in the Middle East which are giving us the opportunity to make friends. But we should cash in on it when the opportunity comes. We should not be bashful and be afraid to come forward. I think we should read the lessons aright of what has happened in this period of our history, in case, having failed to read those lessons, we in our own history hereafter have to pay for it.</p>

<p>I want to come to a matter I really wish to deal with in more detail to-night. That is the question of the Bantu and the training of the Bantu for specific tasks. This is a point I raised in Committee on another occasion. The then Chairman of Committees ruled me out of order and, may I say, quite rightly so. As I sat here to-day listening to the speeches, I wondered who to-day speaks for the raw Native in this Parliament.</p>

<p>We, the white man in South Africa, although on a slower tempo, are going the same way as the metropolitan powers who used to have control over such big areas in Africa. They left what they called independent states behind them, which every one of them is crumbling. We are going at it more slowly, although on the same basis, namely that of the vote. The only place where the vote was ever tried out, was down here in the Transkei where the Bantu have had the vote for so many years in the past. They voted for certain representatives in this House. As to the rest of the Republic, the Bantu never had the vote. They do not understand it and they do not want it. I stand on that absolutely. Not a single hon. member in this House who knows the Bantu can tell me that there is a single tribe, let alone what the hon. the Minister calls a nation, who understands what the vote is and says: That is the way of solving political problems.</p>

<p>Farmer after farmer&#x2014;and I am one of them&#x2014;has to train his lorry drivers, only to find them leaving you. They go away somewhere else. They do not go to another employer as a lorry driver. When they have been back home again, one may next find them in town, humping great cases about or doing a labourer&#x2019;s work. They may be doing stevedoring work, or something of that kind. If these men could be relied upon, thoroughly trained and made to realize that they would get paid more if they would stick to that job &#x2026; Here is the point I want to make. With training for a particular job, they should be free to sell their labour where they can get that job. So the man who is trained as a lorry driver, should be free to offer his services as a lorry driver. A man who is capable of doing first-hand repairs to farm implements, is a man who is almost worth his weight in gold at the present time. You will realize, Mr. Speaker, that it is quite impossible for us to take a white artisan and keep him on a farm, doing that kind of work. In fact, one cannot get him. One can get neither a Coloured nor an Asiatic to do it, as far as Natal is concerned. But one can train one of the Bantu to do it, and he will do it admirably. Then, the next thing that happens is that he is gone. When farm labourers are being trained, particularly in regard to the use of farm implements and the ability to carry out repairs, they should be made to realize that, when they have been trained, they will be able to rely upon that employment. We have done it in the past, until for economic reasons a change had to be made. I had kraals that have been on my farm since the days of my father and my grandfather. The people that live there, were good and honest, in fact, some of the finest people in the world. But the temptation was always there, when one has trained one of them, to leave.</p>

<p>One man, one goat. Training facilities, in my opinion, should be provided throughout the rural areas, wherever these Bantu are employed and where the masters are willing, if necessary, to pay the fees themselves. I am certain that they will be overwhelmingly willing to pay those fees, so as to get that relationship of the man who is willing to see to the education of his employee, that he should be properly trained. Most farmers do not have the time to devote to the training of their Bantu employees in this fashion. But it has become a dire necessity. We must give the Bantu that first requirement, namely definite employment of a kind which they wish in the place where they wish to have it. That is basic, wherever they are going to be employed. If we are going to simply send them back <i>en masse,</i> untrained, to their own homelands and tell them to go and pull themselves up by their own bootstrings, it is not going to get them anywhere. It is not going to help in solving the real troubles which will then arise, troubles that will arise from having a great mass of humanity, an amorphous mass there, who are not allowed to go out and seek labour in a market which they are free to enjoy to the best advantage because they have been trained for a specific purpose. I appeal to the Minister concerned. If he puts his mind to it, I would be perfectly satisfied that he can do it. He should start these training places for Natives who are in employment and ask the masters to pay the training fees. A Native who can read and write and has been there for three hours, is very valuable, more valuable than a completely illiterate Bantu. A Bantu who has had a practical <span class="col_7713-7714" refersTo="page_1118"/>training in the use of implements on our farms, is infinitely more valuable than one who has not had it. Why give one the little academic training up to Std. II or III and then refuse to go on with the practical training&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is no compulsion at all. If the hon. the Deputy Minister had listened to me, he would have realized that. It is a case here of the employee freely choosing his employer, going to the best market, the same as a white man would wish to do, and if he can get a better salary then as a trained man somewhere else, good luck to him. But the training goes on, and at the present time there is no provision of any kind whatever that I know of, being made for the training of the Bantu in that particular respect. And it is the least that they can ask of us while we are deciding their destiny for them as we do day after day in this House.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was very disappointed in the hon. member for South Coast&#x2019;s approach this evening. All I can think is that he is suffering from a political, psycho-somatic complaint of viewing everything with trepidation, of seeing only the black side of the future and never the brighter side, that part that is so important to this Republic. When an hon. member of the Opposition makes the statement that no Bantu is prepared to accept the policy of this Government, I think it is a statement that should be repudiated in this House not only by him, but also by other members on his side. I served for many years as chairman of a Bantu Advisory Board and I can give the fullest guarantee that the Bantu accept the policy of the Government as the only policy. They are not interested in integration; they are not interested in social integration, because they know what evils will result from that and the exploitation that will be born out of any economic integration. I am shocked to hear the hon. gentleman make a statement that is so unfounded after what is being done to give every man a place in the sun. This is the normal course that is followed by the official Opposition. They come out of an era long past, and out of the doldrums we find gentlemen representing the United Party in this House, debating on a very shockingly low ebb. They come on an ebb like the hon. member for Wynberg who repeatedly tries to cause a split between the two language groups. She knows and we know that the Afrikaner has always been very tolerant and the Nationalist Party was, as the Opposition said to-night, the mouthpiece of the Afrikaner. But it is the mouthpiece not only of the Afrikaans-speaking South African to-day; it is the mouthpiece of the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking South African to-day. It is the most tolerant party that there ever could have been for the simple reason that if they were not tolerant, what would the civil service have looked like to-day&#x003F; I challenge them to show one case of victimization. I wonder what the position would have been if they had been in power. I would like this evening to show the facts as they are. I want to use only one aspect as a debating point this evening. In this past Session we saw the United Party fighting a Bill on planning and the development of our natural resources as ardently as they possibly could fight a Bill. It was more than purely a law they were fighting. They were fighting the future of this country, and I will prove it this evening to the best of my ability. When this Bill was laid before this House, who did they drag in to support them&#x003F; They dragged in the people who see South Africa as a short-term investment, people who still believe in the statement of MacMillan that the white man is expendable. But the people that believe in a long-term investment and take South Africa as security know that this country is a gilt-edge investment with a great future, a certain dividend and no fear of amortization. In the metropolitan areas where the European workers have been used for many years by certain industrialists as half-skilled labourers because they had got into that habit of using Bantu labour they will find that as soon as they can mechanize and automate their industries those half-skilled European workers will become first-class skilled workers. In the whole world to-day we find this shortage of skilled artisans, but we begrudge our own Europeans the right to become skilled artisans by working on this method of overusing unskilled labour in our metropolitan areas. I am convinced that by forcing, if you want to call it forcing, although it is not forcing, and by giving guidance to the industries you will find that they will mechanize. and you will find that the industries which make use of intensive labour will go to the rural areas. In speaking of the rural areas, the hon. gentlemen on that side have lost touch completely. They have created the impression among the industrialists that they are going to be pushed out into the bundu. They have lost touch with the rural areas. The rural areas have played an important role in the development of our country. The rural areas to-day have created the correct industrial atmosphere for potential industrialists. The electricity and water tariffs are competitive with those in the cities, and I think, if you take the amount of transport subsidies paid for Bantu labour in the cities, then I think we are surely entitled to subsidize to a certain extent, or to make certain concessions to those industrialists who are prepared to develop their industries in the border areas. And this is not just what I say. What did Dr. Van Eck say at the opening of the Rand Show&#x003F; And he is no politician. He is a very well-known financier, economist and industrialist. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_7715-7716" refersTo="page_1119"/>One of the results of this planning was the evolution of the border area development programme, officially announced in mid-1960. This visualizes the establishment of industries on the periphery of the Bantu reserves and held out the prospect of the creation of employment opportunities for the non-White in close proximity of his home. The scheme has profound social significance and in addition to building up viable industrial activities serving the entire South African market and already extending into the export field, is making a real contribution towards restoring to the Bantu stability and the self-respect of a home and a family.</block>

<p>That is the position, Sir. Dr. Van Eck, an industrialist, can see that basically migrant labour is wrong. However, the members of the Opposition cannot realize that they are entitled to a place in the sun. South Africa is a dynamic country and if one considers our industrial development over the past six years since we became a Republic&#x2014;the Republic which that Opposition fought in a way they have never fought before&#x2014;then you will see that our gross domestic product which in 1960 was R5,000 million, to-day totals R8,000 million. This phenomenon is unprecedented in the world. It is something to feel very proud of. Every South African should feel proud of this great industrial development which took place. But I believe that it is not yet the end of the development. I believe we are on the eve of far larger development than what has taken place up to now. If South Africa was a static country, if South Africa was a country with low potential, then the Opposition would have had an argument. But I believe that we are on the eve of great industrial development. I believe that the socio-economic aspect of this development will and must play an essential role. If one considers our cities, our metropolitan areas, for example Johannesburg, what is the position to-day</p>

<p>You find over-population, which is one of the causes of inflation. It pushes up land prices and rentals, and who suffers&#x003F; A few businessmen gain through this over-population, and the man in the street suffers. This Opposition has proved over and over again that the man in the street is only there when they want to climb onto the bandwagon and start their political face-saving. But the public of South Africa have had enough of their stories. The public of South Africa consider them to be redundant to-day. It is a pathetic state of affairs when an official Opposition has not that political backbone to stand up and admit that the way of life that South Africans want is separate development or apartheid, as they so belittlingly call it. The way of life of South Africa is not political integration. The way of life of South Africa has been accepted by the broad public and has been proved over and over again at every election to be the road along which the future of South Africa will be attained. We have to be very careful. All the development that lies ahead for us will be based on sound socio-economic planning. For many years we have been living on our minerals, which actually means that we have been living on our capital. The day must break when South Africa&#x2019;s exports must be so large that the minerals we produce in this country can be kept in reserve. This Government has done more than any previous government to develop a sound industrial future for South Africa. But when you look at our minerals, not in a single debate have I ever heard the official Opposition giving as a reason for inflation the fact that gold has a fixed price, and not once have they ever said that this is grossly unfair to South Africa. Instead of that, they look for all sorts of excuses.</p>

<p>Most of the development has taken place in the large cities, but it will be just as effective in the rural areas, when the Government has created this industrial atmosphere and you will not stop it.

He realizes that the border industrial development will solve the problem that we have to-day in the metropolitan areas. Another thing is the social aspect in the metropolitan areas. We in this House are always inclined to look at the social aspects as they affect the non-Whites, and I think the reason is that the Opposition can never debate any issue without becoming colour-blind and having a colour complex.

<p>I am convinced that as the result of it, the Suikerbosrand area will be developed and I am convinced that in future recreation areas and nature reserves will be planned, and that is important. South Africa is becoming densely populated and we as a Government must do everything in our power to develop this scenically beautiful country, not just for the financiers or just to make money out of it, but in a long-term process of development in the interest of every citizen and to give a place in the sun to the European as well as to the Bantu but in their own areas, and not integration as would eventually take place if the Opposition were in <span class="col_7717-7718" refersTo="page_1120"/>power, because basically that is where we differ. They love climbing on to this political bandwagon and they love their political face-saving, and they are past masters at face-saving. This afternoon we saw that happen again. We saw them claiming that they were great supporters of some of the ideologies that we have had all these years, but we know that eventually, if they ever get into power, which is impossible, we would have had a conglomeration of colours and the biggest chaos South Africa has ever seen. But we are grateful to have a Government that believes in ideologies, even though we are continually being ridiculed by the Opposition.

[Interjection.] But I want to tell him that the broad public of South Africa has seen that in all the years we had to live in isolation the West did not play their role and the communists certainly did not play their role, and the African states saw that they were being exploited. In this isolation they have realized that South Africa&#x2019;s intentions are decent and that South Africa will play the role it should play in the future development of this continent, and that South Africa will always be the guiding country. The day will come when we will have a decent Opposition as far as policy is concerned, and that will be a good day for South Africa.

<p>I felt a good deal of sympathy for the hon. member for Lichtenburg because the speech he made here to-night was apparently a speech which he had not been able to make on a previous occasion, but I think it is a little unfair of the hon. member to expect, because he had not been able to make a speech at a certain stage, that we should now, at a different stage, have to listen to that speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lichtenburg boasted of the industrial development which has been taking place in South Africa over the past few years. Of course I think that all the hon. members in this House, and not only members on that side, can be proud of South Africa&#x2019;s achievements in the economic sphere. But at the same time, after the hon. member had boasted of the industrial development in South Africa, he said:</p>

But all the wonderful industrial development which we have been experiencing up to now was possible precisely because we made use of the entire labour force which we had at our disposal in this country. We made use of the Bantu, and not only of the Bantu but also the Coloureds; we made use of all the human resources which we had at our disposal.</p>

<p>Yes, they have economic integration in the sense that they make use of other manpower over and above their own in order to develop their industries, and here in South Africa we are also making use of the labour of all races, which has been placed at our disposal.</p>

<p>But the hon. member also went further. He said in the beginning of his speech that the hon. member for Wynberg was trying to drive a wedge between the Afrikaans and English-speaking people in the country. I find it strange that the hon. member could ascribe something like that to the hon. member for Wynberg when the hon. member for Wynberg is in fact one of the members of this House&#x2014; actually, the same applies to all the members on this side of the House&#x2014;who is prepared to bring Afrikaans and English-speaking children together under the same roof at school and on the same playing fields&#x2014;and then the hon. member for Rustenburg states that the hon. member for Wynberg wants to drive a wedge between the two white language groups! Sir, if one wants to drive a wedge between <span class="col_7719-7720" refersTo="page_1121"/>two groups then one will not want those two groups to come together. Since the hon. member for Wynberg wants English and Afrikaans-speaking pupils to congregate under the same roof at school, perhaps in different classrooms, and that they should be brought together on the playing fields, the hon. member is in fact pleading for unity between Afrikaans and English-speaking people.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister told us that the National Party stood for the retention of dividing lines on the basis of colour. He said that if one wanted a multi-racial society, then one stood for the elimination of colour lines. I find it strange that the hon. the Prime Minister should have adopted that attitude in this debate, since he is one of the people who is being criticized in his own Press these days because his attitude is regarded by some of his followers as being too liberalistic.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that the hon. the Deputy Minister will not ask me to quote further. To-day supporters of the National Party are expressing criticism against their own leaders to the effect that the dividing lines on the basis of colour are being destroyed because certain adjustments are being made, adjustments to which the Government was opposed in the past, and the National Party found that the best way of evading this criticism is to say that the United Party stands for the destruction of colour lines. That is the criticism which is now being used by the National Party, and the man who uses that criticism to the best effect is the hon. the Prime Minister himself, and that is why he adopted this attitude to-day, i.e. because they are being criticized at all levels by their own supporters. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that it was stated a few years ago at Loskop that no Maoris would be allowed to come to South Africa, and this year that policy has been changed and Maoris will be allowed to come here, and now that they are being criticized by their own supporters, the hon. Chief Whip and the National Party have suddenly come forward with the accusation that we advocate the elimination of dividing lines on the basis of colour.</p>

<p>After the speech made at Loskop dam, <i>Die Burger,</i> for example, stated very clearly that no Maori would be allowed to come to South Africa as a member of a New Zealand team. If that was the policy of the Government, why did Mr. Dirk Richard ask what could be wrong with a Maori or two being included in the team&#x003F; Would <i>Die Burger</i> and Mr. Dirk Richard have adopted this attitude if it had not been clear to them that the standpoint of the National Party had been that no Maori should be allowed into South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>But I really want to deal with another matter to-night, namely the depopulaion of the rural areas, as seen in the light of the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy. My point of departure is an article written by the hon. member for Primrose in <i>Dagbreek en Sondagnuus</i> of 1st January, 1967. His article was concerned with all the loose ends which have still got to be tied up in South Africa. This is what he wrote in regard to our relations with other states in Africa, and, <i>inter alia,</i> he also had a lot to say about our agriculture and our water. In regard to this matter he stated the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the recent rains it must have become clear once more to all who wanted to take note how much water and soil in South Africa was being lost. At places where the flood waters were so strong that jackal fencing with iron poles and all was washed hundreds of yards downstream, centuries-old stone walls were ripped from their foundations, practically all that could be seen 12 hours after the floodwaters had subsided was the damage&#x2014;water in which springbuck, blesbuck, cattle, horses and small stock had drowned, had disappeared. Water and soil erosion and soil conservation are synonymous concepts. Dr. Piet Koen&#x2019;s idea of more smaller water conservation schemes of &#x201C;store the water where it falls&#x201D;, is a loose end which must be tied up. And for the farmer, upon whose welfare we are so dependent, is it not possible to tie up the loose ends of cheaper agricultural implements and cheaper fertilizer&#x003F;</block>

<p>In other words, the hon. member is very well aware of the problems facing our country, particularly in respect of soil erosion, water conservation and increasing production costs. But articles are being written, public speeches are being made, but the results, as far as the farmer is concerned, are still not being produced. The farmer is receiving precious little in the way of active support from the Government. The result is that after 19 years of Nationalist regime the population in our rural areas is still diminishing. In 1958 only 18 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s Whites were resident in the rural areas and nine years later it was only 16 per cent. That means that 85 per cent of our Whites are to-day living in the cities. And yet the process of the depopulation of the rural areas is still continuing. I was particularly interested in what the hon. member for Rustenburg said, i.e. that we will have industrial development of the rural areas now that we have passed legislation in regard to the physical planning of our resources. But it will still be a long time before industrial development can make up the backlog which has arisen over the past few decades. I say that the obvious step which the Government must take is to create such circumstances for our country people that they will remain there and will not move away to the cities.</p>

As the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has stated on so many occasions, we have not only had a depopulation of the rural areas, we have at the same time also had a repopulation, with its concomitant social and sociological problems. But I want to confine myself to the question of what the farmer can do under these circumstances, and what the Government&#x2019;s task is under these circumstances. I say that the process of the depopulation of the rural areas has been accelerated by this Government, because they themselves, and particularly the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, have announced that 2,400 farmers are abandoning their farms each year because they can no longer make a living on them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to allege that over the past 19 to 20 years the Government has stood helplessly by, so to speak, and watched how the process of depopulation has been accelerated. One of the most important reasons for that is that our agricultural industry is no longer as attractive as it was previously. The agricultural policy is more or less in the form of a protective policy in times of emergency. What is more, the amount of protection given was ineffective. In times of so-called prosperity the farmer in South Africa had to try and stand on his own two feet. I want to state here to-night that the Government has created certain problems which are affecting all the farmers. It is not only one particular group of farmers which is being affected. They are affecting all farmers. They are problems which have to be considered by the Government. In the first instance, we on this side of the House allege that the dividends which the average farmer derives from his agricultural undertaking makes it impossible for him to continue his operations on a sound basis. We maintain that the dividend of from 2&#x00BD; to 3 per cent, which is what the average farmer is earning, compares much too unfavourably with what the average industrialist and the average businessmen are earning in their fields. Unless the Government is prepared to ensure the profitability of our agricultural industry, it will not succeed in keeping people there, nor will it succeed in drawing other people to the rural areas. We regard that as requirement number one. Requirement number one is that a survey will have to be made. I am certain that the commission of inquiry will in fact prove this. I am referring now to the commission of inquiry which was appointed a few years ago. That commission will prove that for the average farmer of this country a dividend of 2&#x00BD; to 3 per cent is the lowest, when compared with any other form of undertaking. That is the aspect to which this Government will have to give attention. <span class="col_7725-7726" refersTo="page_1124"/>The second item to which the Government will have to give attention is that which was mentioned by the hon. member for Primrose in his article. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> And for the farmer, upon whose welfare we are so dependent, is it not possible to tie up the loose ends of cheaper agricultural implements and cheaper fertilizer&#x003F;</block>

<p>I think these are ideas which have crossed the minds of the hon. the Ministers from time to time, namely that they would also like to see this type of thing being done. But, why are they moving so slowly&#x003F; Why are they not prepared, as the hon. member for Primrose said, to tie up the loose ends&#x003F; Unless these loose ends are tied up, I want to make so bold as to say that even more farmers will leave the rural areas of South Africa. It is an item which affects not only the cattle farmer, the wool farmer or the grain farmer, it is an item which affects all farmers. There is not a single item being used by farmers to-day in the production of his product of which the price is not increasing tremendously. There have been increases in the price of his labour, fertilizer, iron standards, tractors and other requirements. There is not one item which can be mentioned the price of which has not increased tremendously over the past few years. In most cases the price of the farmer&#x2019;s product has either diminished or remained constant. As a result, the profit margin is automatically being reduced and the farmer is losing confidence in his undertaking. That is why people are leaving the rural areas. I do not have to look far for my proof. I can really quote the commissions on the depopulation of the rural areas. The difficulties with which farmers are faced are clearly stated in the reports. That was proved as far back as 1959 when this Commission brought out its report. It stated very clearly that one of the reasons why people lacked confidence in the agricultural industry was the fact that production costs had increased so tremendously. That position has continued for nine years. Each year we have to bring it to the attention of the Government. Even at agricultural congresses the request is being made that production costs should be pegged. The Government ought to peg the prices of means of production. That is the type of thing that is being requested at agricultural congresses. But there has been absolutely no reaction on the part of the Government. The Government is merely allowing production costs to take their own course, and more and more people are leaving the rural areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Newton Park has now returned to agriculture. Perhaps it is a fortunate thing for this debate that he has done so, but it is a very unfortunate thing for the United Party. The hon. member quoted from a newspaper report of what the hon. member for Primrose is alleged to have written in regard to soil erosion, water erosion, water conservation and soil conservation. He wanted to use it as a means of informing this House how badly things are going with agriculture. He used the following examples. He said that in 1958 the number of agriculturalists in South Africa comprised 18 per cent of the population.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>In the rural areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the rural areas, yes. I am talking about the rural areas. According to the hon. member this figure has now, over the past nine years, diminished to 16 per cent. In the first instance, the hon. member&#x2019;s figures are incorrect. In the second instance, he knows that it has repeatedly been pointed out during this Session that in other countries which are becoming industrialized, in countries where phenomenal industrial development is in progress, the percentage shift of rural as compared with urban population has been a natural phenomenon throughout the entire world. Also during this Session it was pointed out in this House that in France, a highly industrialized country, this shift is still progressively 2.8 per cent per year.</p>

<p>The French Government, as is the case in the rest of the world, including America, does not regard this phenomenon as being incorrect in point of state policy. On the contrary, if that agronomical and agricultural land had not been earning any interest, then the hon. member could have made out a case. But with the depopulation, as the hon. member puts it, larger units have simply been established as a result of a new farming pattern, organization and rationalization of labour, etc. It is those hon. members who took it amiss of us during the last session because the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure was not lending sufficient assistance in consolidating land so that it formed units. Surely it is obvious that if land is consolidated into economic units, if it is consolidated into units which are more productive, there will be a removal and a depopulation. Surely one cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p>The hon. member also alleged that because things were going so badly with agriculture, we found that there was a depopulation of the rural areas. As proof of how badly things were going he mentioned two persons, the so-called pocket-patriot Nationalists of Standerton whose photograph appeared in <i>Die Beeld</i> and who had stated that they had resigned from the National Party because they were not satisfied with the agricultural policy <span class="col_7727-7728" refersTo="page_1125"/>of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. Throughout this Session, that has been the one fundamental way in which the United Party&#x2019;s criticism of South Africa has failed. It has been unable to come forward with a case, and has therefore seized upon two so-called Nationalists&#x2014;and they are nothing else but United Party supporters&#x2014;to indicate how badly things are going. As long as that Party does not see the economy of South Africa as a whole, as long as they divide the economy up into separate compartments, and deal with it as separate facets while they play the one off against the other, they will remain bankrupt. They cannot understand that if we are dealing with agricultural prices, it is going to affect the whole cost of living, the entire political economy as a whole.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the case of mealies, and I want to use it as an example now. The hon. member must know very well that if the mealie price is raised, it is not merely being raised for the urban consumer, but also for the rural consumer. The rural consumer who has to feed poultry, milch cows, and beef cattle.</p>

[Interjections.] Last year the price for the mealie farmer was increased by 28.5 cents over and above the calculated price, as a special incentive&#x2014;I want to call it an actual subsidy, just as the one given to the drought-stricken farmers there in the north-west and in the Northern Transvaal when their fodder was subsidized. Because a harvest of 47 million bags had been expected the previous year, and as a result of the drought which had prevailed during the previous three years, this Government allowed the mealie farmer 28.5 cents over and above the calculated price to which the farmer was entitled, after the production costs and the entrepreneur&#x2019;s salary had been taken into account and the increased adjustment had been made.</p>

<p>Precisely. A harvest of 48 million bags was expected and the actual harvest was 57 million bags. That gave the mealie farmers an overall revenue of R191 million. That was R2 million less than the figure in the record year 1953. To that increased harvest the farmer still has to contribute his 18 cents to the stabilization fund. Now the 1966-&#x2019;67 harvest has been reaped. Those two people whom <i>Die Beeld</i> wrote about, have been used by this hon. member as an example. On an expected harvest of 87 million bags, the farmers&#x2019; overall income from mealies would have been R291 million. That is based on this price of 230 cents. The harvest is already 92 million bags. The farmers&#x2019; income is R100 million more than in the previous year. But that is not all. Let us glance at the income per morgen of the 1966 harvest, particularly since things have gone so badly with agriculture, as the hon. member wants to allege. The income per morgen of the 1966 harvest yielded 35.50 cents per morgen for the farmer. If we take the latest harvest at 87 million bags, and not at 92 million bags, the income of the mealie farmers is 37.50 cents per morgen. That is R12 more per morgen than they received from the previous year&#x2019;s harvest. However, the production costs per morgen did not increase by R12.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask the hon. member this: Where is the weakness in the price determination of agriculture&#x003F; Once again I am taking mealies as an example because the hon. member used as an example those two persons who resigned over the mealie price. The error which hon. members on the opposite side are making is this. They are trying to isolate one of our domestic economic facets, they want to view it separately, they are trying to place it in a separate compartment. They then want to use it to make political propaganda in the rural areas. But when they come to the cities, they simply reverse the argument and tell the people in the city, &#x201C;Your cost of living is too high, your salaries are too low&#x201D;. So they are playing the one off against the other.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and said that subsidies were only being provided in times of drought and in times of emergency. Has the hon. member not analyzed this Budget yet&#x003F; Has he not seen that in this Budget an amount of R77,728,000 has been made available for subsidies&#x003F; Let me make it very clear that the farmers are not receiving this entire amount in the form of subsidies. But these subsidies make it possible for the consumer to buy the farmer&#x2019;s product at a price at which the farmer can produce it and still remain in the rural areas. The result is that the producer is not saddled with a lot of surplus produce, and in addition it enables the consumer to purchase the product without, in turn, increasing his salary, something which would again draw the cost of living and the production costs into this eternal vicious circle. We do not have a separate, isolated economy, but an integrated economy which affects everything simultaneously.</p>

<p>In addition I want to discuss the question of subsidies, and I will once again use mealies as an example. For mealies alone provision is being made this year for a subsidy to the amount of R31 million. The farmers, i.e. the dairy farmer, the poultry farmer, are also receiving a share of that.</p>

<p>Very well then. The hon. member wants to try and make out a case here that things are going badly with our agriculture. He referred, to use another example, to fertilizer as well. Let us consider the matter of fertilizer. Last year the subsidy for fertilizer was R8.8 million and this year it is over R19 million. Of that amount R14 million is to the account of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the other R5 million is to the account of the Department of Trade and Industries. That ensures that the fertilizer companies do not go bankrupt, but it also ensures that the farmers&#x2019; production costs do not fall.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made another point here and said that the farmer was only receiving 2.5 per cent on his capital investment. That is the statement he made here. But he adduced no proof whatsoever. Now I want to ask the hon. member this:</p>

<p>Does he want South Africa and the taxpayer of South Africa to help the farmer who is purchasing land for a price greater than its agricultural production potential for the sake of the appreciation value of such an investment&#x003F; The best investment in South Africa is in property and land. Does he want the taxpayer and the consumer public in South Africa to shoulder the burden of that appreciation benefit&#x003F; Must they guarantee a farmer interest on his investment&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, do not put words in my mouth.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am asking the hon. member a very straightforward question. He made the statement here that the agriculturalist and the farmer in South Africa were receiving 2.5 per cent interest on their capital investment. But he did not tell this hon. House on what capital investment they were receiving it. He did not say whether it was capital investment in implements or stock. Surely it was on his total capital investment.</p>

<p>Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Now that hon. member is saying &#x201C;Yes, that is correct.&#x201D; Now I want to ask him the following question. If a person were to purchase a piece of land here on the Foreshore for the sake of a good capital investment and with a view to the appreciation value of that land, who must guarantee that person&#x2019;s interest for him&#x003F; The hon. member cannot reply to that question. The greatest problem in connection with agricultural capital investment is that land is constantly being purchased for prices which are over and above the agricultural production value of that land. It is not being purchased for the sake of the agricultural value nor for the agricultural production which it will yield; it is being purchased with a view to the capital appreciation value which the investor intends getting out of it. No farmer, nor any other person for that matter, can claim that a certain interest on that land must be guaranteed.</p>
