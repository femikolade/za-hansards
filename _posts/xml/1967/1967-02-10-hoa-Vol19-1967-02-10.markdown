<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a small correction to a reply given by me in this House on the 3rd February. In reply to a question as to the renewal of a lease for the Silwood post office, I stated that the increase in the rental had been 227% and as such exhorbitant and uneconomical.</p>

<p>The lessor has drawn my attention to a clerical error. It appears that the new rental would have amounted to an increase of 82% and not 227% on the present rental. The lessor states that this present rental is considerably less than comparable rentals paid by other lessees in the same building complex.</p>

<heading>SUPPRESSION OF COMMUNISM AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The House will be aware that when this clause was debated in 1962, the insertion of this clause in the Suppression of Communism Act, there were certain amendments moved at that stage in an endeavour to improve this clause. They were rejected and this side of the House voted against the insertion of this clause in the Act. We object again to-day, and I rise to move the amendment standing in my name, and to endeavour to prevail upon the hon. the Minister of Justice to accept an amendment which we believe will improve th&#x00E9; clause as it now exists. The Minister will note that in terms of the wording of the clause, he may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> prohibit all persons who are listed from belonging to certain organizations. That, in fact, has already been done by Proclamation 2130 of December, 1962. I wonder whether it is not better, because of the consequences which now flow from this power, for the Minister to have a wider discretion. At the moment his discretion appears to be either <span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0530"/>to have a person listed or not to have him listed. When once he is listed it would appear that the prohibition must apply to all the listed persons and there can be no exceptions. The amendment I move is to suggest that the Minister should have a further discretion, and that is that when he issues a prohibition in terms of this section, he then again apply his mind to the individual members concerned, who were members or office-bearers, and can exclude from the prohibition those who have had a change of heart. By changing the words as I have suggested in my amendment from &#x201C;all&#x201D; to &#x201C;any of the persons listed&#x201D;, I think the Minister&#x2019;s discretion will be extended. It will also have the effect that the gazetting of a prohibition order in terms of this section will also have to contain&#x2014;and I think it desirable -&#x2014;the names of the persons who are then prohibited from belonging to certain organizations. The public will then become aware of the identity of those persons and one will not have in this proclamation merely a bald statement that all persons whose names appear on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in section 8 of the said Act will be affected. If the amendment is accepted, it will enable the Minister to exclude from the prohibition the names of those whom he thinks should be excluded, whilst retaining them on the list for other purposes. It would then give him that further discretion which I believe will be an improvement to the Bill.</p>

<p>May I address you on that point, Sir? While this is of course an amendment to the existing law, the existing law, in that part which the hon. member proposes to amend, is applied to the new insertion. In other words, the new insertion has no meaning whatever without that part of the original Act which the hon. member proposes to amend. I submit to you, Sir, that the amendment which is proposed by the Minister has no meaning unless it is related to the Minister&#x2019;s power to prohibit by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> If that is so, in my submission the hon. member should be entitled to restrict that power to prohibit by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> It cannot in my submission be regarded <i>in vacuo.</i></p>

<p>I agree that the amendment is quite out of order. All that is before the House is lines 15 to 18. But apart from that, if we were to accept these words proposed by the hon. member, &#x201C;any person whose name appears&#x201D;, in the singular, the rest of the clause would be absolute nonsense, because it is all in the plural, while he limits it to a single person.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I feared that this amendment would be out of order because I contemplated moving such an amendment, but obviously it affects the principal Act and therefore one cannot amend it in this respect. But that does not mean that I do not agree entirely with the spirit of the amendment which the hon. member was trying to move. I am now asking the hon. the Minister whether he will at least give us some assurance that this very far-reaching clause will not simply be applied holus bolus by a statement in the <i>Gazette</i> which most people do not see anyway. Indeed, I think it is no exaggeration to say that until the Commissioner of Police brought the attention of half a dozen people to the <i>Gazette</i> notice which had been published way back in 1962, most people were not even aware that they were infringing the law in any respect. Now this whole matter has come before the public eye again. Presumably a new notice is going to be gazetted. I wonder whether the Minister can tell me whether he is now going to publish some new notice including these still wider provisions of the law as it existed in 1962? It does not help us at all.</p>

<p>A notice may be gazetted, or the Proclamation embodying notice 2130 may be made retrospective, and all we know then is that any person who was at any time a member of an organization which was subsequently banned is now prohibited from not only being or becoming office-bearers, officers, etc., of any particular organization which the hon. the Minister happens to mention, not only from making or receiving any contribution of any kind, but also from participating in any way in any activity, not only concerning the specified organization which the hon. the Minister listed in No. 2130, or may list in a future notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, but of any organization which condemns or supports or discusses, even, any politics or any activity of the Government or of the State. Yesterday, in replying to me in <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0531"/>the Second Reading debate, the hon. the Minister said I was wrong in one respect when I criticized the retrospective nature of this amendment to the principal Act, because he said this applied only to people who were, he said&#x2014;I have his exact words here&#x2014;either office-bearers of an unlawful organization or listed communists; and then he said they could only be prohibited from receiving or making any contribution in respect of a certain organization. But this clause goes much further than the Minister said, and I was not incorrect when I stated in the Second Reading debate that this goes very far indeed.</p>

<p>The second part, subsection (c) says &#x201C;participating in any way in any activity&#x201D;. That is much more far-reaching than the original clause and more far-reaching than the amendment the Minister mentioned yesterday. And it does not only apply to listed communists or to office-bearers in unlawful organizations; it applies to members as well, to anyone who at any time was ever a member of an organization which subsequently has been banned. How the hon. the Minister can say that I extended my criticism of this clause beyond the actual terms of the clause, I cannot understand, and maybe he will explain this to me. I want to point out to the Minister that listing means any list in the possession of the liquidator and that this, in turn, can mean anybody, not only a person who was an office-bearer or a member, but who was a supporter of any organization which was subsequently banned. Again, I must say over and over again that I think it is utterly and miserably unfair to penalize people now for actions which, when they performed them, were legal actions. How is anybody to know what is going to enter, if not this Minister&#x2019;s mind, then the mind of future Ministers, since we extend these clauses in ever-extending circles? How does one know what organization will to-morrow or the day after or next year be considered in the mind of the Minister an organization which ought to be banned, and thereafter everybody retrospectively becomes or has the potentiality of becoming a criminal in terms of this law? I want to point out that this clause carries a very heavy penalty, of up to three years&#x2019; imprisonment without the option of a fine. Therefore I think it is essential that the Minister, if he cannot incorporate this in the law in any way&#x2014;and I still want to see whether he cannot add some sort of proviso whereby he can limit this to individuals&#x2014;will at least give this House his assurance which can be made public that he is not going to use this far-reaching clause without any discrimination whatsoever and without any differentiation whatsoever between organizations which may be considered dangerous and organizations which are in fact not dangerous to the security of the State.</p>

<p>I think that at least the Minister owes it to this House to give us some assurance in this respect. This idea of giving mass notices is, quite, I believe, outside of the normal practice in any normal democratic country. To have mass notices informing people that in retrospect they may become criminals in terms of a law which this House is passing to-day is outside of all normal democratic practice. The least the Minister should do is to assure us, and not leave it to the Commissioner of Police through a Press statement, that there is no intention of having a widespread witch-hunt under this clause, and that he will indeed use some differentiation when he applies this clause.</p>

<p>I am going to vote against this clause, irrespective of course of any assurance. I have told the Minister that and he knows it; he is under no illusion. But my actions in this House are not the important issues at the moment. What is important is that some assurances should be given to people who were performing perfectly legal actions at the time they performed them and who are now finding themselves in jeopardy as a result of this wide clause which was buried, as it were, in 1962 but which is now being exhumed with all the usual sort of unpleasantness that goes with exhumation after five years. I should like to have some assurance from the Minister on this clause.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Houghton is reading much more into the clause than is written there. The clause provides that the Minister may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> take certain steps as regards all persons whose names appear on any list in custody in terms of such-and-such a section. Let us take this category first. He can prohibit the persons whose names appear on a list in custody from being or becoming office-bearers, officers and members. Now certain other prohibitions are added, namely in terms of subsections (b) and (c). In the past a notice appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> in which the Minister prohibited this list of persons from being or becoming office-bearers, officers or members. But that notice did not prohibit them from making a contribution of any kind. If the Minister wants to apply such a provision to that category of persons, namely the persons whose names already appear on the list, he will have to publish a new notice in the <i>Gazette</i> to prohibit them from making or receiving any contribution of any kind for the direct or indirect benefit. That is quite clear from the entire clause. The Minister cannot say, simply because the Act has been amended, that because he served notice on certain persons six years ago such notice is also of application to the new provisions inserted now. He cannot say that those persons are now also prohibited from doing things of that nature. It simply cannot be that way. That is how we read this Act. It has never been interpreted in any other way. As the hon. member knows, the Interpretation Act provides that if an Act is passed now, it is presumed that it is not of retrospective effect. Those are the rules of interpretation in our courts. The hon. <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0532"/>member knows that, too, or she should know it, being one of the legislators in this House.</p>

<p>I therefore feel, Sir, that the hon. member is reading much more into this clause than is actually intended. Now she also argues about the two other categories, and the same principle applies to them as well. If the Minister also wants to make it of application to those whose names appeared on the list previously, or to persons who were previously prohibited from being office-bearers, he would have to serve new notices on them to cover clauses (b) and (c).</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at this stage I should like to make it clear to this House what the attitude of the official Opposition is to this clause. The House will recall that when the hon. member for Transkei led off the debate on behalf of the official Opposition at the Second Reading, he made it clear that whilst we intended to confine the Second Reading Debate to clause 2, we had objections to other parts of this Bill, and indeed this applied in respect of clause 1. We object to the amendment which is being introduced and we on this side intend to vote against it. The House will recall that when this amendment was introduced in 1962 we on this side of the House opposed it and voted against it. Since the amendment which is now being introduced, far from restricting the provisions of that clause, in fact extend those provisions, we will naturally be against the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>It is, I think, important to appreciate the far-reaching effect of the proposed amendment, and in particular to appreciate that the power which is being given now to the hon. the Minister amongst other things is to prohibit a listed person from participating in any way in any activity of a particular organization referred to or any organization of a nature, class or kind specified in such notice. The second part can be very wide indeed. The activities of any organization of a nature, class or kind specified in such notice &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is where the hon. member takes a mistaken view of such things. He says that these words which I have referred to are already in the Act. Of course they are already in the Act, but they now refer to a different category, because they now refer to the proposed amendments as well. The proposed amendments, as I have pointed out, give the power to prohibit from &#x201C;participating in any way in any activity&#x201D;. These words are new: &#x201C;participating in any way in any activity&#x201D;, and since those words are new, what they now relate to is also new, and what they now relate to is, as I have pointed out, participating in any organization of a nature, class or kind specified in the notice.</p>

<p>Perhaps at this stage it would be convenient for me to refer to the amendment which stands in my name in relation to clause 1 on the Order Paper. May I ask, Mr. Chairman, whether the ruling which you gave to the hon. member for Green Point in regard to his amendment is to apply also to mine?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of order. The amendment seeks to restrict the operation of the new powers which are inserted to a restriction in respect of a particular organization, and not in respect of a particular organization and any other organization of a nature, class or kind. In my submission, Sir, this should be a competent amendment for an hon. member to move, namely to restrict the operation of the new powers dealt with in the amendment to only particular staged organizations, as opposed to any organization at all. I do submit that this is normal and usual, and such amendments have been allowed in the past. Therefore I feel, Sir, that this is a competent amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I pointed out that by reason of the proposed amendment the effect of this clause now becomes even more far-reaching than it was before. In relation to the portion which gives the Minister power to prohibit from participating in any way in any activity of any organization of a nature, class or kind specified in the notice, I would point out that the onus will now be on the person concerned to decide whether or not that activity is of a nature, class or kind similar to those of the particular organization stated. This I suggest is almost an impossible task to expect of any person. I would point out also that this must be read in relation to a proclamation which has already been passed in terms of section 5<i>ter</i> and which was promulgated on the 28th December, 1962, in <i>Government Gazette No.</i> 154 of that date. In that proclamation certain organizations were listed and the then Minister of Justice prohibited all persons who appeared on any list in the custody of the officer referred to in section eight, or who were office-bearers of any such organization, from participating in the activities of these listed organizations. But it went further, Mr. Chairman. In part 2 of that <i>Government Gazette</i> these persons were restricted from participating in any organization which is in any way affiliated to or a subsidiary of an organization mentioned in part 1, or which promotes, furthers or performs any act, etc. But then clause 2 of part 2 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any organization which in any manner propagates, defends, attacks, criticizes or discusses any form of state or any principle or policy of the government of a state or which in any manner undermines the authority of the government of a state &#x2026;</block>

<p>So, Sir, if one reads the proposed amendment of this section with clause 2 of part 2 of this Government Notice it is perfectly clear that these persons will now become debarred from in any way attacking, criticizing or even discussing Government policy. I submit with great respect that this makes a farce of this provision, because it restricts a person quite unjustifiably. We should like to hear the reaction of hon. members on the other side of the House, particularly of the Minister, to our interpretation of th&#x00E9; far-reaching effect this amendment will have. If our interpretation is correct, as it appears to me to be. we should like to know how the hon. the Minister justifies the amendment which he wishes to introduce.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very simple problem that we want to meet here. In terms of the notice published, the Minister had the right in the past, and has already exercised that, to prohibit any listed person, or office-bearers, officers and members of any organization declared unlawful, or any person subject to restrictions, from becoming office-bearers, officers or members of a particular organization or of an organization of a particular nature or kind. That was the intention of the original section, and action was taken accordingly. But it was then found that despite the fact that the Minister prohibited a person from becoming an office-bearer, an officer or a member of that kind of organization, he simply resigned as office-bearer, officer or member of such an organization while at heart he remained faithful to the same convictions and blithely continued, for example, collecting funds and participating in the activities of that organization, as though <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0534"/>he was in actual fact still one of its officebearers, officers or members. That is the loophole that we want to close up here.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me just explain first. As I said, it happens that despite the fact that they are prohibited from being office-bearers, officers or members of a particular organization, they resign but simply continue participating in the activities of that organization as though they are still members, officers or office-bearers of that organization. We are herewith prohibiting them from doing so. We are now closing this loophole by providing that they may no longer make or receive contributions in respect of such organizations, nor may they in any way participate in the activities of such an organization. That makes the Act fool-proof, and that is how it should have been originally. The hon. member is therefore correct as far as his interpretation is concerned&#x2014;that is the intention; we now want to close up these loopholes as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton wanted to know whether I was going to issue a government notice holus bolus which would make it applicable to everybody. I want to give her the undertaking that what I will in fact do will be to inquire into each particular case, into the case of each organization, and if I find that persons who were prohibited from being office-bearers, officers or members of a particular organization did not continue using this loophole in the Act, this provision will not be made applicable to them. On the other hand if I find that they did in fact use this loophole, this provision will in fact be made applicable to them. I cannot say more than that. I am being quite frank about the matter. I told her what the problem was and what the reason was for this particular amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister dealt with the question of the wide description of organizations. He contends that we cannot narrow down those organizations which people have been prohibited from joining but if he refers to the previous notice, to which reference has already been made, he will see that such people are prohibited from participating in any way in any activity or from contributing to the funds of any organization which in any manner propagates, defends, attacks, criticizes or discusses any form of State, or any principle, or policy of the Government of a state, or which in any manner undermines the authority of the Government or State. In terms of this they are apparently also prohibited from participating or from contributing money to an organization which defends the Government&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>Take the Dutch Reformed Church. On the other hand there are contributions they may make to other churches who may criticize the Government&#x2019;s policy. Surely, Sir, that is quite ridiculous. Is it not? I wish the hon. the Minister would get up and explain what is meant by this section. These people are, in fact, being prohibited from taking part in anything. They cannot belong to or contribute to the funds of an organization whether that organization supports the Government or is against the Government. The question is how will they know? They may, for instance, join a certain church and become members of that church only to find later on that the synod of that church or some other spokesman for that church either defends the Government&#x2019;s policy or attacks it. Then these people will have committed an offence because they belong to an organization which is critical of Government policy. I wish the Minister would deal with this, particularly with the very wide description of these organizations.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that the provision as it was before this amendment could also apply to these organizations. They could not become members of an organization designated by the Minister in the <i>Gazette.</i> For instance, he could if he wanted to, use his discretion prohibiting them from becoming members of the United Party or of the National Party.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. But he could have prevented them from becoming office bearers or members of the National Party or of the United Party, for instance. I remember that argument was made in this House at the time. That is why the Chairman correctly ruled that that matter has already been dealt with. In addition the Minister can now, if he wants to exercise his discretion in that manner, prohibit them from contributing, but that was understood. The hon. the Minister explained why these additional provisions were being inserted. The reason for them is obvious. The law as it was up to now became ineffective because, as the Minister said, persons prohibited from becoming members of an organization merely resigned as members but carried on their activities.</p>

<p>Well, the Minister has jurisdiction to identify a church as being such an organization but he would not be so foolish to do so. But that is not the point.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to return to the objection that a blanket proclamation can now be issued, i.e. without naming the individuals concerned. When the Minister dealt with this objection he said that he would apply his mind to it and would not necessarily apply the proclamation to all. But the other interesting point is that the Minister claimed that he has these powers to prohibit &#x201C;enige persoon&#x201D;. That is not the wording of the Act and this is where our objection comes in. The Act says &#x201C;alle persone&#x201D;. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to speak to the amendment which you have ruled out of order but I should like to point to the consequence of the wording of the Act as it now stands and to ask the Minister whether he will not give consideration to it. I think he misunderstood the position. I gave notice of my amendment in English and therein I referred to &#x201C;any person&#x201D;. In the translation, however, I see it was translated as &#x201C; &#x2019;n persoon&#x201D;. It should be &#x201C;enige persoon&#x201D; and these are the words the Minister used. In other words, when prohibiting under these further powers he should name the individuals and not issue a blanket prohibition covering all persons on the list.</p>

<p>Now it is retrospective in so far as there are persons who were members of organizations, which were not banned organizations when this original clause was passed, which subsequently became banned organizations and which now fall within the ambit of this clause. Therefore it is retrospective.

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron does not know that it is retrospective. He says that I am wrong. I ask the hon. the Minister: Am I wrong? He told me yesterday that I was right. He said that in so far as I relate it to the retrospectivity of people who were members of an organization subsequently banned, I was correct in saying that this clause was retrospective.</p>

<p>I come back to this question of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s declaration in the House that he will give each organization his individual attention before he puts it in a gazetted list. Sir, I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister will do that, but what worries me is not so much the list that he is going to gazette, although that is bad enough in all conscience, because the last list included organizations which I at any rate did not think of as communist organizations and I was surprised <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0536"/>to hear that they were communist organizations. Subsequently an organization like Defence and Aid was banned, That is a matter which we cannot discuss in detail because of its <i>sub judice</i> nature, but that organization also is not communist <i>per se.</i> Sir, part 2 of this gazetted notice went much beyond the listed organizations&#x2014;37 or 36 of them&#x2014;which the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor included in that Government Notice, Part II refers II refers to &#x201C;any organizations&#x201D;, so persons who were ever on a list, persons who were ever members or office-bearers of an organization which has been banned, may not now take part in any activity of any organization of any nature that criticizes, condones or in any way discusses Government or State policy. It has nothing to do with the organizations that the hon. the Minister is going to scrutinize; it may mean, as the hon. member for Transkei has pointed out, a church. Personally I do not think that it is going to mean a church, but in terms of the law it could mean a church.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have that assurance. Sir, there are many respectable citizens who were members of a committee of Defence and Aid years ago, before it was banned, who now find themselves in jeopardy. They have become political eunuchs to all intents and purposes, because they may not participate in any way in any activity of any political organization. I am sure that this is further than the hon. the Minister intends this gazetted notice to go, and that is why it is so important that it is not only the organizations that ought to receive his attention, but the individual who may be affected. I really feel that the hon. the Minister himself must admit that this goes further than the sort of people he is aiming at. He has not given us examples of people who were members or office-bearers of organizations and who have now resigned from those organizations&#x2014;those organizations in fact no longer exist because they were banned &#x2014;but have now continued their activities by collecting for those organizations. This goes much further than that, retrospectively, and it affects the future of many extremely wellknown, respectable people of South Africa who will now find themselves in jeopardy if they continue to play any part in politics in this country. I do not believe that that was what the Minister intended by this clause and I think that some way ought to be worked out in which he can at least limit the far-reaching nature of clause 1 of the Bill.

The objection is not that someone can go to the Minister and that the Minister can do something for him. The whole difference between us on this whole Act is that we do not believe that this is the way things should be done. Sir, in answer to the hon. <span class="col_1039-1040" refersTo="page_0537"/>member for Waterkloof, it is not for the hon. the Minister to say what you shall or shall not do, in his unfettered discretion. So far as the proposed amendments which are on the Order Paper are concerned, the hon. the Minister has not answered on the merits of those amendments and we do not know whether the hon. the Minister might in fact accept them. So far he has only indicated that he agrees with your ruling that they are out of order and therefore cannot speak to them. We have therefore not been able to discuss the merits of the amendments. I want to give the hon. the Minister the opportunity of doing so and I want to give this Committee the opportunity of discussing the merits of those amendments. [Interjections.] Sir, I hope hon. members opposite will stop sniggering and giggling; they are making no contribution to the debate.

<p>That will have the effect of reviving some discussion on the merits of the amendments moved by the hon. members for Musgrave and Green Point. I think it is a fair amendment. I think that the merits of this amendment are that the hon. the Minister will have to apply his mind not only to the organization but also in respect of the persons concerned, and I do not think that this is too much to ask.

The hon. member for Transkei has mentioned this and he is entitled to mention it because it could apply to a church.

What we would like to know is whether the Minister intends to maintain the prohibition in respect of this extraordinarily wide definition of &#x201C;organization&#x201D;, and if he is going to maintain it, then what in fact does it mean? What organization does he anticipate will fall within the ambit of this definition? The other thing we would like to know is why the hon. the Minister cannot in fact name the organizations. Sir, to help the hon. the Minister out of all his difficulties I move the amendment I have read out.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of order, may I address you on the admissibility of the amendment? This amendment affects the principle of the entire clause, although the hon. member only relates it to paragraphs (b) and (c) as a proviso. We must read the clause in its entirety, as passed at the Second Reading. In other words, that type of exception is excluded. That is the principle we adopted at the Second Reading, namely that we cannot make it applicable to special persons and organizations, because the <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0538"/>principle adopted at the Second Reading was that it would be applicable to all organizations. For that reason I want to contend that this amendment is out of order.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to address you, Sir, on the admissibility of this amendment, and in particular I would like to deal with the arguments addressed to you by the hon. member for Heilbron. If the approach of the hon. member for Heilbron is accepted, it will be quite impossible to introduce any amendment to any clause because what the hon. member is saying, in effect, is that you have to accept the clause as it emerged from the Second Reading, and that is nonsense because it defeats the whole object of the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>On the merits of the amendment, I submit that it does not affect the principle which was accepted at Second Reading, which is the principle of extending the power given to the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazet e</i> to prohibit certain persons from doing certain things. He had the power before to prohibit them from being or becoming office bearers, officers or members; he is now given the power to prohibit them in addition from making contributions of any kind and participating in any activity. Those two principles are not in any way affected by the proposed amendment, which merely relates to clarifying the organization in respect of which those amendments shall apply, and clarifying the persons in respect of whom those two amendments shall apply. I emphasize, in conclusion, that they do not in any way affect the amendments which emerged from the Second Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I just elaborate on that? The prohibition contained in clause 1 is directed against all listed persons and against all office-bearers of certain prohibited organizations, and it is also directed against any restricted persons. Subclause (a) states what the nature of that prohibition on all those persons may be. Now we are extending the nature of the prohibition by the addition of (b) and (c). However, the nature of the prohibition always penetrates to all listed persons and all office-bearers and all restricted persons. The nature of the prohibition is destroyed by this amendment in that it mentions only certain listed persons and certain office-bearers and certain restricted persons. It affects the entire principle contained in clause 1 and destroys the entire principle which has already been laid down and which has already been accepted by the Opposition.</p>

<p>May I add that it is strange behaviour on the part of the Opposition that during the Second Reading ii expressed itself as being opposed to only one principle contained in clause 2 and that it accepted all the rest. But the difference is that during the Second Reading they wanted to appear to be opponents of Communism &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to reply to the arguments addressed to you on this point of order by the hon. member for Heilbron. His argument now is that the nature of the prohibitions which are now included in the clause relate to the prohibitions as a whole. This is not so, because in terms of your previous ruling, Sir, it was made perfectly clear that what this Committee was considering at this stage was simply the amendments which emerged from Second Reading. That is all. The Committee is considering those amendments. This ruling of yours, Sir, must now be accepted by the hon. member for Heilbron and by the Committee as a whole. The amendment now moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) does not do any harm to this ruling. It is an acceptance of it, but it pinpoints the organizations in respect of which those two amendments shall apply and the persons in respect of whom those amendments shall apply. With great respect, Sir, it is perfectly possible in the Committee Stage for a clause to be amended in this way, enabling certain further restrictions to be included, but providing that those further restrictions shall be applied to particular organizations and to particular persons only, whereas the previous restrictions which applied in the clause may have been somewhat wider. So, with great respect, I submit that you, Sir, ought to allow this proposed amendment because it does not go against the principle accepted.</p>

<p>I am inclined to agree with the hon. members for Musgrave and Durban (North). The position is that we are here extending the classes and the activities. What this amendment seems to do is to say that it has been accepted in principle that we can extend them, but what we should now like to do is to impose certain restrictions on them. It has always been the rule in the Committee Stage that one may do that. I am therefore inclined, for what that is worth to you, to state the opinion that the amendment is in order.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Having indicated that I believe the amendment to be in order, I deeply regret that I cannot accept it. What the amendment apparently seeks amounts to this, that all the organizations are to be mentioned by name. Very well, one may mention all the organizations by name, but what happens then? The moment one mentions the organization by name, the name is simply changed and then I have to publish a new notice. That is the difficulty one runs into. Consequently one should also have the power, as it was conferred in the original measure, to say &#x201C;of a certain kind or of a certain nature&#x201D;, to include a certain group. When the previous <span class="col_1043-1044" refersTo="page_0539"/>Minister published his notice, he had apparently faced the same difficulty, and therefore it was formulated in such a way that the organization was mentioned by name and the groups and classes included.</p>

<p>Now I want to say this to the hon. member for Houghton and the other two hon. members, that (b) and (c) would not necessarily apply to everybody. It may happen, but not necessarily, and I shall apply my mind to that. But it is wrong to presume, as all the hon. members on the opposite side have apparently done, that because this notice was issued at that time these provisions will be applied to all the classes as set out there. That is an erroneous deduction. When the opportunity presents itself and when I have to issue a notice, I shall, as I promised earlier in the Committee Stage, bring a magnifying glass to each one and see to what extent I should put a stop to those activities, the question of making donations, etc. But hon. members should not assume that future notices will necessarily be similar to that one.</p>

<p>I am very glad that we at least have a limited assurance from the hon. the Minister that we must not take it as read that when he issues a notice it will necessarily be made applicable to every single person who was at any time involved in such an organization. I am very glad to have that assurance, but I am still worried about the fact that obviously the notice he has to re-issue will presumably take the same sort of form as the previous notice; in other words, it will mention the specific organizations. But the second part of that original notice is the part that worries all of us.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but in giving his reasons for rejecting the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (North), he said that his difficulty was that people who were members of an organization he had specified then became members of another organization; that they changed the name of the organization. The second part of that notice, the first part of Part 2, would cover that. It talks about any subsidiary organization or organization of the same nature as the organization mentioned in Part 1 of the notice. Why cannot he go that far and no further? It is the second part which is the damaging part, which says that a person may not take part in any organization which criticizes, discusses commends or upholds any Government or State or has anything to do with any political organization. If he could at least in terms of the new notice omit the second part of Part 2, we would to some extent have a limitation of clause 1. Will the Minister please put his mind to that, because then he will still satisfy himself that people who belong to an organization cannot simply change the name of the organization and continue either to collect money for that organization or in fact to further the activities or the aims of any such organizations or subsidiary organization. I think that is going too far, anyway. But at least he will be meeting the very valid objections to the far-reaching nature of this clause if he omits to publish a notice in the same terms as the first notice and omits the second part of Part 2. I hope that the hon. the Minister will bear that in mind when he comes to publish such a notice.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say something about the amendments moved by the hon. member for Durban (North). The Minister has given his reply and has said that he cannot accept the amendments because organizations can change their names. The hon. member for Houghton has dealt with that point, and I do not wish to repeat what she has said. But when we were discussing this matter earlier, we mentioned the churches. The Minister smiled and said that this measure could not apply to a church. But I ask him, why can it not apply to a church? As the notice is worded, it does include a church. How can the Minister just say that it does not include a church? When I first raised the point the hon. member for Heilbron interjected before I could get as far as mentioning churches, and he mentioned the Anglican Church, and I said, no, it may also be the Dutch Reformed Church. It does show how the hon. member&#x2019;s mind is working. As far as the hon. member for Heilbron is concerned, it does include churches. I say that the Minister must devise some way of bringing more clarity as to exactly what organizations are concerned. Because as I pointed out earlier, the way the notice is worded it includes anybody&#x2014;not only a person who attacks any form of government, but who defends any form of government. How do these people know where they stand? How do they know that the Mnister does not mean it to include a church for instance? How do they know what organizations the Minister has in mind unless he tells them in the notice what type of organization he has in mind? I appeal to the Minister again to reconsider the matter. Perhaps he can amend the section in the Other Place. As it stands now it is most unreasonable.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the practical implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of peaceful coexistence;</li>

<li>(b) the necessity for economic and political progress by the Bantu peoples in their own areas; and</li>

<li>(c) the grave shortage of adequately trained professional staff and technicians who will be required to replace Whites in the Bantu areas, <span class="col_1047-1048" refersTo="page_0541"/>expresses its satisfaction with the sound progress and the high standard already achieved by the Department of Bantu Education. This House further considers that development should continue on this sound foundation with special attention being paid to special courses aimed at preparing and equipping Bantu to perform particular tasks which arise from the social and economic development brought about in various spheres by the implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy.</li>

</ol>

<p>All education has a broad task and purpose as well as a specific and particular task. I may define the general, or broad, task of education as being the process of imparting knowledge to the developing human being, of putting human values in the right perspective, of guiding and developing the personality traits and specific talents of each individual to the fullest potential possible, while the complete human beine, i.e. body, mind and soul, is being educated to be of service to himself, to his people and to the community at large. But I said education in each country also has a specific and particular task. Let me mention Israel here as an example. In the <i>Education Survey</i> of U.N.E.S.C.O. the particular task of education in Israel is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To create not only the normal type of good citizen but a pionee youth ready to build its homeland and, if necessary, to sacrifice life itself in its defence. The new curriculum is to be adapted to the basic needs of the child and his environment. It is to emphasize education for citizenship and will continue to foster the spirit of pioneering and self-sacrifice.</block>

<p>This is the specific task of education in Israel, and ore can well understand it in the light of the special position in which Israel finds itself. Now, I want to contend that we here in South Africa are entitled to the same extent, and that it is equally as essential, to impose on education, in addition to its general task and object, also a specific task in the light of the special circumstances prevailing in South Africa. The question which involuntarily comes to my mind in this connection is whether we, in all our education, i.e. in White, Coloured, Bantu and Indian education, have not always been blind to everything except the general task of education, namely to impart knowledge to children as regards languages, sciences, cultural, practical and aesthetical subjects. We have educated them and we have made them civilized&#x2014;in short, we have given them what is normal and what is also given in all countries in the world. But I want to ask whether we in South Africa with its specific problems, with its special population structure and with the specific problems which that involves, have not been ignoring a major task here throughout the years. To what extent, for instance, are our curricula still old-fashioned and drawn up for promoting the general task of education, a task which does not differ internationally? I maintain that we here in South Africa also have a particular task for our education. This particular task is above all education for everyone in his own sphere. The particular task, as I see it, is&#x2014;and this links up automatically with the Government&#x2019;s policy of peaceful coexistence and separate development&#x2014;that each group has to be trained and educated so as to adapt to and fit in with his own community in the best way possible and to be of service to his own community. These are my feelings in the matter and this is how I think it can also be applied in practice. By such means we shall be able to ensure that we produce contended people, people who will be able to realize themselves fully, and to avoid producing people who are frustrated because they can see the green meadows of another group which they are not allowed to enter. It is against this background and in the light of this particular task which I put to education in our country that I should like to look back on the development of Bantu education over the past 13 years for the purpose of trying to ascertain to what extent the specific as well as the broad task has been carried into effect.</p>

<p>On 7th June, 1954, Dr. Verwoerd said the following in regard to the Department of Bantu Education in a statement of policy in the Senate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of my Department that education should have its roots entirely in the Native areas and in the Native environment and Native community. There Bantu education must be able to give itself complete expression and there it will have to perform its real service. The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community, however, all doors are open. For that reason it is of no avail for him to receive a training which has as its aim absorption in the European community while he cannot and will not be absorbed there.</block>

<p>The two foundation stones of Bantu education in South Africa are, to my mind, the Bantu Education Act of 1953 and the Extension of University Education Act of 1959. These two Acts were placed on the Statute Book by this Government in order to place Bantu education, ranging from pre-school education up to and including university education, on a common and sound basis. The attitude of the Opposition towards both these Acts was the most negative attitude imaginable. At the Second Readings of both these Acts the Opposition moved that they be read for a Second Time &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;, in other words the strongest form of censure possible in terms of parliamentary procedure. The Opposition therefore rejected the entire principle. Now, however, 12 or 13 years later, it is <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0542"/>evident that the Government was right, as usual, to pass these Acts, that everything is working perfectly as planned, that these Acts have brought happiness and peace throughout the country and that the Opposition, as usual, was wrong. When these Acts were introduced, the prospect was held out that the following tasks would be undertaken. Hon. members will find them in the speech made by Dr. Verwoerd when he moved the Second Reading of the Bantu Education Bill. These tasks are: (1) To do justice to the mother-tongue in Bantu education; (2) to bring literacy to the broad masses; (3) to improve achievements at school and to raise the number of passes and standard and to cause more pupils to proceed to secondary education; (4) to introduce vocational and technical courses in order to train artisans for service to their own community in their own area; (5) to allow the parents to participate to a greater extent so as to train them in that way to accept co-responsibility, something which would at the same time serve as a process of educating them; (6) to develop the Bantu&#x2019;s own university colleges and to remove the Bantu from white universities; (7) to cause the Bantu to make a bigger contribution to financing his own education. Let us deal with each of these points in order to see how far we have already progressed towards the set object.</p>

<p>As far as mother-tongue education is concerned. I know that the hon. member for Houghton in particular resisted it fiercely in those days. She said they did not have the scientific terminology, etc.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>At that time the hon. member spoke very disparagingly of the potential of Bantu languages to be of practical use to the Bantu. In this connection I want to refer once again to the <i>Education Survey</i> of U.N.E.S.C.O. and to what it contains as regards the history of education in Israel. It states, <i>inter alia</i>, the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was an uphill struggle to base an entirely new school system upon a language which only a generation ago was a literary medium. The daily Hebrew language, usage and vocabulary grew as subjects were one by one introduced into the school curriculum and gradually the Hebrew language became entrenched as both the vernacular and the language of instruction in kindergartens, in elementary, secondary and vocational schools, as well as in institutions of higher education.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You cannot be serious when you compare an ancient language like that with the Bantu languages.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pointing out that the Hebrew language suffered from a similar lack of modern, scientific and technological terms as is the case with Xhosa, for instance. But in Israel they demanded mother-tongue education and consequently the Hebrew language was adapted to the modern, technological age and the necessary terms were created in order that the language could indeed serve as a medium of instruction. But as soon as we want to do the same thing for our Bantu groups, this hon. member finds fault with it. I accept and state in no uncertain terms that here it was a case of &#x201C;know yourself, accept yourself and be yourself&#x201D; as the three main characteristics of a nation. I have numerous letters here in which glowing tribute is paid to the Department for having introduced the mother-tongue as a medium of instruction, because that has made people proud of what is their own and at the same time an opportunity has been created for Bantu authors to inspire their own people anew and to bring them new ideas through the medium of their own language. Therefore mother-tongue education has progressed a long way and has had many good results.</p>

<p>The second question is what results have been achieved after a period of 13 years in extending education to the masses. To what extent have we succeeded in reaching the masses during this specific period? I have a number of interesting figures here. I do not want to bore hon. members with too many statistics but unfortunately I shall have to quote quite a number of statistics. In 1953 when this education was taken over, there were 5,665 Bantu schools. The figure increased to 8,463 in 1963 and after education in the Transkei had been transferred to the Department of Bantu Education in the Transkei whereby approximately 15,000 schools were transferred to that authority, there were still 7,222 Bantu schools in 1965. The number of teachers increased from 21,148 in 1953 to 30,119 in 1963, and after approximately 6,000 Bantu teachers had been transferred to the Transkei there were still 28,692 teachers under the Department of Bantu Education in 1965. The number of pupils increased from 858,079 in 1953 to 1,770,371 in 1963 and after the secession of the Transkei the present figure is 1,655,435. Where as at the time of the takeover in 1953 only 45 per cent of the Bantu of school-going age between the ages of seven and 14 attended school, 85.3 per cent of them attended school in 1965. If one thinks in terms of uneducable persons, whom one always finds, this percentage is even higher. In other words, in this case we have succeeded in achieving our object within the short period of 13 years.</p>

<p>Then I come to a further object, namely the range of education&#x2014;to give more secondary education and to achieve a higher number of passes. This, of course, is a very difficult sphere. I am aware that the hon. member for Houghton tells us regularly that Bantu pupils go to Std. II only; this is usually her argument. I just want to tell her that we certainly have not reached the position I should <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0543"/>like us to have reached. But what is the position? In 1948 the total enrolment of pupils for Std. VI was 20,745; in 1965 it had increased to 66,493; in other words it had more than tripled. The percentage of passes in Std. VI was 52 per cent in 1948 and 84 per cent in 1965, without the course having been watered down or the examinations having been made easier. I can also quote the figures for Std. VIII. The total enrolment increased from 3,123 to 11,644 and the percentage of passes from 63 per cent to 78 per cent. In Std. X the total enrolment was 324 in 1948 and 1,339 in 1965 and the percentage of passes increased from 53 per cent to 62 per cent over the same period.</p>

<p>The standard of matric education was not watered down. I now want to speak about a specific school, which does not fall under the normal schools because it is a special school, but I honestly want to say how pleasantly I was surprised with the result achieved and the course offered at the school for the sons of chiefs in the Transkei. The matriculants of this particular school for the sons of chiefs in the Transkei emerge from that school&#x2014;and I say this in all honesty&#x2014;with a course which equips them better for life than that with which our white matriculants emerge from our white schools in South Africa. I state this with all the power at my disposal. They have 11 compulsory subjects for Std. X, which include four compulsory languages, namely Afrikaans, English, Sotho and Xhosa. They have a whole series of other subjects which, <i>inter alia</i>, include diplomacy and world events. The examination papers are dealt with by the University of South Africa. The school&#x2019;s pupils receive a thorough preparation for life.</p>

<p>We now come to vocational and technical courses&#x2014;the fourth object we set ourselves. In 1947 there were only 12 technical courses available to Bantu. I have just received information that there were 37 vocational and technical courses in 1965 in which the Bantu could qualify himself, courses such as carpentry and joinery and here I want to refer in brief to a furniture factory manufacturing school furniture near Umtata which at present manufactures the school furniture for all the Bantu educational institutions throughout the Republic of South Africa right up to the Caprivi. This then is an industry which has been established within the Bantu area. There are also courses in leather work, spinning and weaving, bricklaying, motor mechanics, and electro-technics. Radiotricians, health inspectors, surveyors&#x2019; assistants, etc., are also being trained. The object&#x2014;and I want to state it very clearly&#x2014;is not to train these people ever to compete with Whites or to oust Whites from their employment by coming to work for lower wages in the white area. These people are being trained to provide and render these essential services in their own areas so that Whites who render them at present may return from there to the white area where they can be taken up in the white community again. The ideal situation is that each should be self-supporting in his own area.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of greater participation by parents, which has been put as the fifth ideal. In 1953 there were only a few school committees in the Transvaal; in the rest of the country there was no such system at all. At present there are 509 school boards and 4,089 school committees which give plus minus 50,000 parents an active role in the education of the Bantu. Here I want to quote from what was said by Professor Kwgare, of the Faculty of Education at the University College of the North&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ten years of local control and maintenance of schools by parent committees have brought a revolutionary change in parent attitudes towards the school. No subject is discussed with greater zest and animation than the local school, its management, its buildings, its teachers and its activities. School committees have been a most effective agency in the education of the adult Bantu community &#x2026; committee members are receiving invaluable training in self-government and are learning to bear responsibility and to handle trust moneys.</block>

<p>A double object is being achieved. In the first instance they take an active part in education; they have an active interest and at the same time this process trains them in eventual self-government. As regards this matter, I also have a number of letters here in which glowing tribute is paid to the parents for their participation in education.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of higher Bantu education, namely the development of the Bantu university colleges with the simultaneous removal of Bantu from white universities. When the Act was introduced in 1959, there was, as I said before, tremendous opposition. The charge was levelled from all sides that the autonomy of the universities was being affected and that we were doing the most impossible thing in the world. Mr. Speaker, these Bantu university colleges were established and are undergoing a gradual process of development. Naturally there are difficulties; the numbers are not yet what we should like them to be but a good deal of progress has been made. In 1961 417 Bantu were enrolled at Bantu university colleges. In that same year 237 Bantu were enrolled at white universities. In 1963 there were 608 at Bantu university colleges and only 170 at white universities. In 1966 the number of Bantu at Bantu university colleges increased to 1,160, while the number of Bantu at white universities decreased further to 148. Of this number of 148, 110 are Bantu medical students in Natal who are accommodated there specifically because there is no medical faculty at the Bantu university colleges as yet. In other words, if one does not take these 110 medical students into account, there are only 38 Bantu at white universities at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there is an entirely non-white medical faculty there.</p>

<p>In the meantime the University of South Africa has developed further. The University of South Africa is an institution which provides training facilities by means of correspondence. In 1961, 1,171 Bantu were enrolled at the University of South Africa and in 1966 the number had increased to 1,616. In other words, at university level the number had increased from 1,825 to 2,924 from 1961 to 1966, a period of five years. This really is an achievement. We already offer seven faculties at the Bantu university colleges. There are faculties of arts, education natural sciences, law, theology, agriculture and commerce and administration. Hon. members will be interested to learn that the University College of Zululand the entire Department of Psychology, for example, is in the hands of Bantu at present, from the head of the Department to the lecturers and the students. Here again we have therefore achieved the ultimate of the ideal we set ourselves. This is the direction in which we are still going.</p>

<p>Then I come to the seventh point, namely the question of financing. At the time of the take-over this matter was, of course, discussed at length and it was decided in this House that the amount spent from the Revenue Account in 1953, prior to the take-over, would remain fixed at that figure, namely R13 million. Up to the present time White taxpayers contribute R13 million to Bantu education annually. But to what extent has Bantu education been extended in the meantime and how has the cost thereof been defrayed? There has been an increase in the general tax. Whereas only three-fifths of the general tax was transferred to Bantu Education, 100 per cent was eventually transferred to Bantu Education. In other words, the R3.50 which a Bantu pays as general tax is at present transferred to Bantu Education intact. It is evident from information which we have at our disposal that only 53 per cent of those who have to pay tax do in fact pay this tax. If the collection of taxes can be streamlined and if machinery can be put into operation to obtain a 100 per cent collection of the general tax, this contribution to Bantu Education can be increased tremendously. The contribution of the Bantu in respect of his own education increased from R3 million in 1955-&#x2019;56 to R7,774,000 in 1965-&#x2019;66, whereas an additional amount of quite a few hundred thousand was spent on university education. From a total Bantu Education Budget of nearly R22&#x00BD; million the Bantu themselves already contribute R8&#x00BD; million from their own taxes. Therefore as far as each of these seven objects are concerned, we have achieved, or are in the process of achieving, what we set out to do. I come back to the idea I expressed at the beginning, namely the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint at that time that the Act could not be implemented and that it was bad. At that time they moved by way of amendment that the Bill be read &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;. In other words, they expressed their disapproval in the strongest Parliamentary language, and what has happened in practice? In the meantime Bantu education has been placed on this sound basis.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to mention a few figures in order to illustrate how South Africa compares with African States in the field of Bantu education. Hon, members must remember that most of the African countries do not finance their education from their own sources only; they receive technical, financial and other assistance from various sources. The necessary aid is poured in from all sides. We know that a communistic paper wrote scornfully, &#x201C;Yes, it is true; the Americans provide the hospitals in the African states; we provide the nurses who indoctrinate the patients with the communistic idea. In the second place the Americans provide all the libraries, the buildings; we from the communistic countries provide all the books for indoctrinating the readers&#x201D;. That is what is happening in Africa at present. But in spite of all this aid which is poured in and the fact that they are free states which may deal with their finances arbitrarily, the position is as follows: Of the children of school-going age between seven and fourteen, the following percentages do attend schools in the African states: In Ghana 92.8 per cent; second on the list is the Republic of South Africa with 85.3 per cent. Then follows Kenya with 60 per cent; 60 per cent of its population of school-going age is at school and the rest receives no education at all. In the case of Libya it is 59.7 per cent, Algeria 55.8 per cent, Sierra Leone 27.1 per cent, Mali 18.5 per cent and in Somalia 4.5 per cent of its population goes to school. This gives a clear picture of our position in South Africa. Our position must after all be compared to the position in the rest of the African states, because that is where a comparison is possible.</p>

<p>How does the Bantu see this situation? I have here a number of letters and I just want to read one or two in order to illustrate how these people feel about this matter. I cannot pronounce the names very well, but the first letter was written by the principal of a Bantu school at Winburg and he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is my duty to find the truth and to give it to White and Black without any fear. There are many wolves which roam through the country with false propaganda against our Government. This is done for the purpose of sowing discontent and disorder, particularly amongst my own people, the Bantu people. The delegates of the Argentine Trade Mission on their visit to the Republic of South Africa mentioned the fact that there were few countries in the world which could be compared to the Republic of South Africa in the field of the development of the so-called uncared for nations. According to them, the Republic treats the Bantu <span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0545"/>better than any other country visited by them. No government has done as much for the education of the Bantu as the present Government, and that, what is more, within such a short period. Therefore we must support our country in this case.</block>

<p>I have here another letter from a person from Johannesburg. The first letter was from a Free State Bantu. [Interjections.] Mr. E. D. Morane wrote from Maroka and the letter was published in <i>The Star</i> of 2nd June, 1966&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ninety per cent credit should be accorded to the present Government for the phenomenal rate of progress made by the Bantu in South Africa to-day. The evidence thereof is clear for all unbiased persons to see in all spheres of our national existence. One has only to look at the opportunities created for the Bantu in education, hospitals, the police force, industry and commerce to realize that the present Government&#x2019;s policy of self-determination for the Bantu by the Bantu themselves is gradually and surely taking shape. Opportunities such as mentioned above were non-existent before the present Government came into power with a clearcut policy, and it is in the educational sphere that ample proof of the feasibility of the present Government&#x2019;s policies can be seen.</block>

<p>Now, a few ideas on why we have this education and this training. The first reason why we give this education is that we, this Government and the Whites of South Africa, have always adopted the attitude that we are the guardians of the non-Whites. That has been the attitude from the beginning. However, a guardian does not remain a guardian of his ward for ever. At some time he must lead the ward towards his own fredom, otherwise he is not a good guardian. One must not keep him down for ever, because that is everlasting discrimination. For that reason one assists in providing these facilities for him, gradually and step by step in his own territory on certain conditions so that he may eventually be able to stand on his own feet. This is the duty of the guardian towards the ward; this is our duty as human beings and that is why we are doing it in the first place. In the second place, it is very closely bound up with the practical implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and peaceful co-existence. I now state specifically&#x2014;and then they must accuse me of indoctrination&#x2014;because I am using this word which has such a bad connotation in the world on purpose, but I maintain that in view of the specific problems created and the particular tasks imposed by the population structure in South Africa, we should be unwise if we did not use education, apart from its general object of making human beings more mature and civilized educationally and for imparting general knowledge, to bring the problems of South Africa with its population structure pertinently and specifically to the attention of the children of all races so that they may know how to co-exist in this country in the future. We should be unwise if, as far as education is concerned, we held the view that we were living in a paradise in which there are no problems of any nature. Like in Israel, education must be geared for producing a nation of pioneers who have to offer resistance on the borders to attacks from Jordania and elsewhere. In this way we in South Africa have to use education to bring about the realization that Black people and Brown people and others are living here together and that we have to respect one another and that each has to remain in his own territory, and for that reason education is ideologically linked up with the policy of this Party, and that is how it should be. Education must also serve the State. It cannot exist merely for its own sake. One cannot simply train a person; one has to train him for service to his community. That is the task. Education must also bring about the economic progress of the Bantu in their own areas. It is also essential to give those countries their own freedom eventually, and you do after all know that the ultimate aim of our policy to which we are progressing is complete freedom and independence for those people in their own circle. We have to make economic freedom available to them in the direction in which they are moving.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. Minister two or three hints within the space of three minutes and the Whip is already looking at me askance. I do not really want to give hints, but I do want to put forward some ideas. In the first place I want to ask whether, as far as Bantu education is concerned, we should not think more specifically that our task at this stage lies in practical and technical education and that more emphasis should be placed on that than on academic education. Time does not permit of a long discourse. I do not want to neglect academic education, but from the nature of the case the primary task now is to make provision for the broad masses to find a livelihood and to find work and to be able to earn an income for himself and his people and to be able to maintain a decent standard. In order to be able to achieve that, one feels that the emphasis now has to be placed on technical and practical education where a person can be trained as a cook or as a waiter and in various spheres in which he can really find himself. I want to go further and ask that preparatory courses be fitted in at the university colleges and I want to mention the specific example of the so-called B courses at the various colleges. I think there was such a course at the University College of Zululand. Here we have the eternal question, &#x201C;Which came first, the egg or the chicken?&#x201D; The students cannot gain university admission because they do not have scientific subjects such as chemistry and mathematics but they do not have the subjects because there are no teachers who can teach these subjects. Now we have the eternal circle. I understand that the University College of Zululand offered the so-called B course which afforded students in <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0546"/>their first year after matric an opportunity to qualify for full admission if they did not have scientific subjects by taking those specific subjects, subsequent to which they could do either of two things. They could either proceed to a teaching course and take a teacher&#x2019;s diploma which enabled them to teach those subjects at school, or, in the second place, they could take the A course, the full academic course, and could proceed with their studies after that year of preparation. Furthermore, I want to ask for more diploma courses and I think the Minister may profitably give consideration to this matter. These are diploma courses and not necessarily full academic courses. The latter must be there and we should like them to be there, but do not allow the person who cannot complete the full course, who fails in his second year, to go back to the ordinary commercial world or whatever the case may be; award him a diploma after further study in his field of study so that he may bring relief in that field. He does have the knowledge, after all, although he has not achieved the full standard. Make use of him, by means of a diploma, to render assistance and to bring relief in respect of the situation as a whole. I have a further two or three points which I shall discuss with the Minister in private. In conclusion I just want to say this. Our Bantu education has showed, over the past 12 or 13 years, that we are on the right road, that we are moving in the right direction and that we should continue in this way because the Republic of South Africa demands it of us. We must continue on this road and must make the necessary adjustments to enable us to cope with the problem.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I find one very great advantage in the speech of the hon. member for Randfontein; the ground he has covered is similar to the ground I intend to cover myself. I intend to reply to the points he raised, practically all of them, but there are two points on which I do not wish to leave him in any suspense. I should like to deal with them immediately. The first is in regard to the Separate Universities Select Committee, which became a Commission and reported in 1959. The hon. member says that our attitude to that Commission was negative. Sir, it was not; it was positive. I understand there are only two members in this House to-day who sat on that Commission. The other member was the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare. We are the only survivors left in the House. On the 1959 Commission, not only did we differ but we gave a minority report expressing our views. One thing we did not do was to object to the establishment of tribal colleges. The hon. member, like others, is confusing two things.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What are tribal colleges?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The university colleges for Africans. What we said was that this was not a question of whether we should oppose the establishment of those colleges. Establish them if you wish we said and have as many facilities as you like, but do not interfere with the free universities we have. That was our attitude. The Government members said that the African must get out of the white colleges. We said: If you do wish to get them out, let us have a ten-year plan. It is almost ten years now. Secondly, I want to say that the whole basis of our minority report&#x2014;if anyone wants to read it I will let him have a copy; it is a fine document&#x2014;was based on the expert opinion of leading educationists in South Africa. They were all Afrikaans-speaking, from the Universities of Stellenbosch, Pretoria and Potchefstroom. We based our report on what those learned men had to tell us. So much for that.</p>

<p>I come to the second point, which arose through an interjection by the hon. member for Houghton on the question of home language instruction, the correct thing for the Africans. I do not know whether hon. members have heard of the Cingo Commission. I am sorry I cannot pronounce it in the correct manner, but I just call it the Cingo Commission. That was a commission established by the Department itself. There were three members of the Commission, two of whom were distinguished members of the Department and the third a retired inspector who later became Minister of Education in the Transkei, with two assessors, white educationists from the Department. They drafted a report on the state of education in the Transkei. I do not want to read the whole report, but it is a damning indictment. I just want to take from the report the point which refers to home language instruction. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu child, therefore, must change his medium of instruction. A foreign language must therefore at some stage of his scholastic career become a substitute for his mother tongue.</block>

<p>I need not go further. They know themselves what they want. I leave that for the moment, because I am coming back to the report of the Commission. Anyone who has attended debates on Bantu education in this House from 1952, which was the first year during which I took part in those debates, up to last year, 1966, will know that I cannot subscribe to the terms of the motion of the hon. member for Randfontein, much as I like him personally and much as I respect his views on education. Let me take two points. He speaks about the &#x201C;sound progress&#x201D; that has been made. I do not think we have made sound progress, and I want to deal with it in detail. Here is a very attractive expression, that the policy of this Government is now &#x201C;a policy of peaceful co-existence&#x201D;. Well, what is in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. If the hon. members find that the name &#x201C;peaceful co-existence&#x201D; has the same scent as apartheid or separate development, I have no objection. But we were always told that the policy was <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0547"/>apartheid, separate development. Now it is peaceful co-existence. I thought peaceful co-existence was the Russian policy towards America, or the policy of Western Germany to Eastern Germany. I did not know it was the policy of South Africa. Surely we have all been existing peacefully here; we have been living very happily together.</p>

<p>I want to say that there is one very heartening sign in the speech that we heard to-day. Gone are the days when Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr was accused of being a &#x201C;kafferboetie&#x201D; because he was spending £4&#x00BD; million, that is R9 million, on the education of Bantu, who form 70 per cent of the population. Those days have gone. Every hon. member in the House to-day is anxious to support the cause of Bantu education. We are all &#x201C;kafferboeties&#x201D; now. We are all liberals. When the Bantu Education Bill was introduced in 1953 <i>Die Transvaler</i> said, &#x201C;Vandag, soos in die verlede, is die Nasionale Party die ware progressief en liberaal.&#x201D; If anyone would like to see the cutting, or see the article it comes from, I can produce it. We are all agreed now. What we must do now in this House is to see how we can get together. I have made suggestions as to how we can get together. I have done it over the years, year after year. I think there should be established in this House a committee for Bantu education. This committee for Bantu education would be representative of both sides of the House. We could advise the Minister and the department. That is what I think could be done. The same thing is done in regard to Rallways. We also do it with public accounts. Why can we not do that? At present the Select Committee on Public Accounts takes Bantu education in its stride. There is no doubt to-day about our attitude. We all want it. Even the hon. the Minister of Finance made a speech last year in which he said that he expected a break-through in the economic situation because of the advance made in the field of Bantu education. But there is this difference, Sir. The hon. member for Randfontein and the Minister of Finance say the Bantu are being educated for service in their own areas. Now, a man cannot be educated for service in any area. A man is educated not for some place; it is the man who is educated, and whatever area he will find himself in in the future, he will be in the position of being an educated man.</p>

<p>We had a debate recently on Natives going back to the reserves. Does anyone believe that the Bantu children in Soweto are going to go back to the reserves? The whole idea is absurd. There are over 500,000 African people in Johannesburg. They cannot all go back to the reserves. We know they are not going to go back. They are being educated for life there, and yet this department, when it was offered assistance in respect of the very thing the hon. member for Randfontein tells us about, namely technical training in a school to train them for their work in Johannesburg, the Department refused to let them be trained in Soweto. They were told to go to the homelands or the reserves. They are all being told they must go to the homelands. They are told they are being educated to-day to go to the homelands. It is a new version of the old plantation song, &#x201C;Carry me back to old Virginny&#x201D;. Now they teach them to sing, &#x201C;Carry me back to old Eshowe&#x201D; or old Umtata or something of that kind. The whole thing is absurd, Sir.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about what I find in this motion. The first thing we heard from the mover related to the matter of finance. Well, if ever there was a tangled web it is the financing of Bantu education. The Government introduced a Bill in 1953 and Bantu education commenced in 1954. In 1955 they established this Bantu Education Account in terms of Act 23 of 1956. We all know that famous section 20. In 1957 they came forward with another measure. In 1957 they said that the Loan Account for Bantu education which until then had been financed out of the Native Affairs Vote, would be debited to the Bantu education account as well. No other department has to do that. In 1958, for good measure &#x2014;or bad&#x2014;they then said that this would apply to what had been expended on the Loan Account from 1954: it was made retrospective. The Bantu Education account is for current expenditure and loans. How is the money raised? It is raised, as was pointed out here, by the Native poll tax, which is an amount of approximately R10 million. That is the amount budgeted for in the last Budget. There is also the pegged amount of R13 million from the first day the Bill was introduced. Then with the development of the university colleges an extra R1 million was given, which makes now R14 million. Then there are sales of property and various subscriptions and fees that come to about R850,000&#x2014;let us say a round million rands. So we have about R35 million all told. But, of course, that is not sufficient.</p>

<p>What do we spend on a child in a Bantu school? We spend R13 per child per annum. What do we spend on the white child in my province, of which I am very proud? On a white child in a primary school we spend R90 per annum, which is seven times as much. What do we spend on a child in the high school in the Transvaal? We spend R141 per annum per child, which is 11 times as much as that spent on the Bantu child. The only students Bantu education is providing for well are the students in the colleges. We have had the figures given to us here, namely in some cases over R2,000 per student per annum. I have the figures here, if anyone doubts my figures. That is how the amount is raised. But it is not sufficient. That is not sufficient money.</p>

<p>We have now said to the parents that they must pay. I will give credit to the department for this&#x2014;they have praised the parents for paying themselves for their schools and for their teachers. They called on the parents, the <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0548"/>poorest section of the community, to pay for their teachers and schools. I have always felt ashamed of that, Sir.</p>

<p>The next thing we require to know when we speak about our finance is: How are we providing to-day for secondary education? What progress have we made? I have given the figures before. That fact is, Sir, that a system of education has to produce its teachers. The position to-day is that only one child in 30 can go to a secondary school, only one in 1,500 reaches standard ten, whilst only one in 9,000 passes matric. Those are not my figures, they are the figures of the department. That is the picture relating to finance.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, we have not the buildings, and we have not the teachers. We saw pictures in the newspapers this week of poor children in Soweto who are not going to school.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned I was dealing with the report of the Department of Bantu Education and I referred to the fact that money was apparently not available for schools and for teachers&#x2019; salaries. I pointed out that the poorest section of the community were in some instances being called upon to provide their own schools. 5,500 Teachers are being paid by private people, 2,000 of them presumably by churches and other private organizations and 3,500 by the parents themselves. They have to pay for their own teachers. That is one of the weaknesses of the whole system. I have been protesting against the inefficient Bantu education system. When I say that, I want it to be clearly understood I am not referring to the officers who are called upon to administer this system. On the contrary, they do not deserve our criticism, they rather deserve our prayers in having to administer this Act in its present form. There is another point I should like to mention in regard to finance. We are told that finance is not available and a new financial proposition has been enunciated by the Department of Bantu Education. They say they can tell us what the contribution of the Bantu is to our national product every year. They said that for that reason they could peg it at R13 million or R14 million, as the case may be. That is quite absurd. If one takes the product of any enterprise, whether it is an ordinary manufacturing company or a gold mine, who can say how much is contributed by natural wealth, how much by capital, how much by the enterprise of the skilled staff, how much by Whites and how much by Bantu. The thing is impossible. We are economically integrated, whether we like it or not. We have been told that funds are not available and therefore the department has praised parents for providing their own funds.</p>

<p>I am very pleased the hon. member for Queenstown is here in his capacity as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. He will be able to assist me. According to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report for the year 1964-&#x2019;65 R625,000 of the Bantu Education Account was surrendered because it was not spent. In the financial year 1965-&#x2019;66 over R1 million was surrendered. This was done by people who confronted these poor Bantu people with this proposition: &#x201C;You are now asked to decide whether you will have school feeding as you have had, or more education.&#x201D; These poor people said: &#x201C;We will choose education.&#x201D; The Department could have given both. They have sufficient funds. I have spoken and given my opinion and I now go to the people whose opinion is much more valuable than mine and, if the hon. member for Randfontein will excuse me, whose opinion on Bantu education is more important than his as well. I am speaking of the leaders of the Bantu people in South Africa. What do they think of this system under which they have to work. They did not provide this system. They are the toad beneath the harrow. The toad beneath the harrow knows exactly where each toothpoint goes; the butterfly upon the road preaches contentment to that toad. We are the butterflies on the road and we are telling them that they have a wonderful system of education. Now I want to refer to them. The first name I shall mention is that of Professor Kgware. He is an important man in the field of Bantu education in South Africa. He is a professor at Turfloop University College for Bantu and in addition chairman of the Bantu Education Department Advisory Committee. He is a man of some standing and I should like to quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Professor W. M. Kgware, of the University College of the North, has blamed low salaries for the shortage of competent and fully qualified teachers. Professor Kgware, speaking at a special conference of the Transvaal United African Teachers&#x2019; Association at the Atteridgeville Community Centre, said the salary scales for African teachers introduced in 1963 were &#x201C;woefully inadequate&#x201D;.<br/>African teachers were not satisfied with the salaries they received. The Government has done so little to invest in the education of Africans.<br/>The total enrolment of student teachers at university colleges had decreased dismally since 1960.</block>

<p>There is one authority. I want to return to the authority I mentioned this morning in passing. I am talking about the Cingo Commission, namely three Africans appointed by the department to draft a report on complaints that had been received concerning the system. I quoted this morning its findings about the question of medium. Now I want to quote one or two more:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0549"/>The commission&#x2019;s own observations in those schools visited seem to indicate an almost frighteningly low standard of education in all subjects.</block>

<p>These were men appointed by the department. I read another&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission feels that the double session as found in the Transkei is educationally unsound.</block>

<p>Sixty per cent of Bantu schools have double sessions. Only 40 per cent have single sessions. I read another:</p>

<block name="quote">The commission recommends that a thorough investigation into the powers and functions of the school boards and school committees be made.</block>

<p>In other words, there is dissatisfaction with the school boards and the school committees and with the whole system. What did the predecessor of the hon. Minister think of this report? What did he think of the Cingo Commission Report? He praised it and said that it was a very fine report. It condemned his system but he said that it was a good report. In other words, he is beginning to see the light and there is ground for optimism. The Cingo Commission Report condemned the whole basis of this Act which we were given in 1953, the basis which was praised by the hon. member for Randfontein, the school board system in Bantu education. Under that system the teachers become the chattels of the school boards. Here we have professional men and they come under these laymen: Some of them may not be educated; and these laymen have the power to appoint teachers, to promote them, to transfer them and to dismiss them. They control the disciplinary regulations as well. There it not a white school board in the whole of South Africa that has that power. They have that power. When this system was introduced in 1953, we tried to warn the Government and said that this was a very dangerous experiment. It is dangerous. The Cingo Commission said that this is a serious situation. Shortly after the commission had reported on education in the Transkei, the Transkei received self-government and they dealt with this question of the school boards. What did they say? They said that the whole system was rotten with bribery and corruption. The hon. the Minister of Education said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite usual for a teacher to pay as much as R100 per year in order that his post might be secure.</block>

<p>I can quote much more. It was condemned by Chief Kaizer Mantanzima and Mr. Moledle who was then the Minister of Education. That was their opinion, the opinion of the toad beneath the harrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I accordingly wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, mindful of&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the grave shortage of professional men and technicians, and</li>

<li>(b) the need to educate the Bantu to enable them to make a greater contribution to our National productivity,</li>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to support the motion of the hon. member for Randfontein. With reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Kensington I just want to say that we find the arguments and the statements made here by the hon. member rather hackneyed. The same applies to the accusations. We have listened to them time and time again from that hon. member and from the other members of the Opposition. We have also debated the question of home-language education on several occasions. From that same quotation from which the hon. member read one or two passages I shall prove to him that the reverse is also true. What the hon. member proposed in his amendment amounts to nothing else than the advocating of a purely integrated community in all fields.</p>

<p>I should like to say that the cardinal and most important dates in regard to the development and the progress made with Bantu education under the government of the National Party are specifically the following: In 1953 we had the passing of the Bantu Education Act (Act No. 47 of 1953), when all Bantu education, with the exception of higher education, was taken over by the then Department of Native Affairs. Another very important date is October, 1958, when the new Department of Bantu Education came into being and took over all administrative control of Bantu education. A further important date was 1959, when, despite much opposition, the Extension of University Education Act was passed here. The Bantu Education Act, as we noticed this morning, has evoked tremendous opposition, opposition which began here in Parliament where the Opposition were supported by the then Native representatives, opposition which was propagated by the English-language Press and which also had its effect on the Bantu themselves and which caused the Bantu at that stage to oppose this legislation. The purely educational principles and the noble motives of the Government contained in that legislation were overlooked. All that was done was to arouse suspicion against the legislation. I can recall that I attended a congress of the Native Advisory Council in January, 1955, in Uitenhage. On that occasion only matters affecting Native advisory councils in cities were to have been discussed. But somehow or other the question of the Education Act was raised. I cannot repeat here the language, the remarks <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0550"/>and the insulting words expressed by the Bantu there on that occasion. Present on that occasion were one or two educationists; one was principal of a Bantu high school in the Free State. He stood up and asked the delegates to give the Education Act a chance. He said that there were elements in the Act which had to be tested.</p>

<p>Fortunately the dissatisfaction, resistance and opposition on the part of the Bantu disappeared in time, one reason for that being the judicious application of the Act by the officials of the Bantu Education Department. In time the Bantu came to recognize the intentions and the exalted motives of the Government. Positive results followed and there was co-operation. In this regard I want to read one letter. There are many letters which I could read, but in this regard I just want to read one letter which I find typical. It appeared in the Bantu educational journal of March, 1966. The heading of the letter is &#x201C;The good fruits of Bantu education&#x201D;. The person writes as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, at the time when it was introduced, there was bitter opposition to Bantu education, but now the children of the very same people that protested so vehemently are enjoying the best fruits of education.</block>

<p>The writer then goes further to say something about the matter which the hon. member for Kensington mentioned here just now, namely mother-tongue education:</p>

<block name="quote">Since the Bantu languages became the media of instruction, most of our children have flocked from the primary schools to secondary schools and thence to the universities. The number of universities has increased to meet the demand.</block>

<p>Then there is a concluding remark:</p>

<block name="quote">The Department not only trains, but often provides opportunities for the employment of its products. Most of these serve as clerks, teachers, supervisors and sub-inspectors. The Department of Bantu Administration and Development as a brother organization of the Department of Education also employs many who have left school. It is obvious that many changes will still take place, so let us open our minds to accept them without protest.</block>

<p>The take-over of Bantu education has truly ushered in a new era for Bantu education. To my way of thinking the objectives were briefly as follows. The first was to train and prepare the Bantu thoroughly for service in their own community. The second was to create opportunities for the Bantu to render service to his community in various fields, such as agriculture, education, industry, self-government and administration. The third was to create greater opportunities for the Bantu parents, something to which the hon. member for Kensington has objected so much. This objective was to create opportunities for the Bantu parents to participate in educational services. In this way the school boards and school committees have been established by means of which more interest on the part of the Bantu parents in the education of their children was roused. In addition education must, in the fourth place, be adapted&#x2014;for me this is a very important point&#x2014;to the cultural heritage of the Bantu, to his nature, to his interests, to his requirements and to his own identity. As someone stated it very effectively to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Educational theory and practice were to be adapted to the material with which they have to work in Bantu education. This material is a Bantu child taken from a Bantu community, shaped by Bantu culture, speaking a Bantu language learnt from a Bantu mother.</block>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The aim was autogenous education for the Bantu and in this connection the Department and this Government have done much pioneering work. For more than half a century here in South Africa and throughout the entire continent neither the social order nor the valuable traditional institutions and customs of the Bantu were ever taken into consideration. What was done was simply as part of an effort to Westernize the Bantu; to make of him a black Westerner. What was the result? The result was that the developed and educated Bantu became estranged from his own people; he lost his own identity and became an artificial being. This principle of autogenous development&#x2014; the hon. member for Kensington will no longer laugh when he hears what I am going to say now&#x2014;is being accepted by educational experts on the continent of Africa. I am referring here to resolutions adopted in September 1962 by a conference at Tananarive of 31 Africa states. South Africa was not present to indoctrinate those delegates with its system; and what did they say at that conference? There the following was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The westernized educational system does not meet the needs of Africa because it estranges the children of Africa and weans them away from the aspirations and the traditions of the black man.</block>

<p>Bantu education here in South Africa has indirectly sought to achieve the development of peaceful co-existence&#x2014;that word which apparently smells as sweet as lavender to the hon. member for Kensington. In spite of castigating criticism and agitation against the Bantu education policy, the Bantu parents have, through the school boards and committees, been given a greater say in the matter and have gradually come to reveal a different attitude to this matter, and the splendid motives which inspired the Government when this Act was <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0551"/>being passed have begun to yield good fruits. The schools and the teachers have become the hard core of co-operation and goodwill, and from there it has radiated out and has also brough in its wake good race relations, peace and prosperity. The fruits have already begun to be plucked. Proof of the fact that good fruits are being plucked was the fine Republic Festival celebrations held last year. Sir, it was a revelation of the goodwill and co-operation of the Bantu. The Bantu schools were not given direct instructions to organize the festivals but it was put to the principals that if they were approached by Territorial Authorities for assistance they could in fact co-operate. In this way principals and teachers rendered active assistance in many ways with the arrangements and the functions in regard to the Republic Festival celebrations. Where these festival celebrations were given added lustre by presenting choral singing, exhibitions, concert programmes and competitions, there they lent a hand, and so we find that a major part of the teaching staff and pupils were actively incorporated in the celebrations in the various national communities. In addition to that I also want to mention the competitions, <i>inter alia</i> the essay competitions for standard 5 pupils in both languages, which were held by the Department as well as the competitions for Bantu composers and Bantu writers&#x2014;a competition in which 142 people participated. But in the short time which I still have at my disposal I should like to refer to a number of the festival celebrations and the goodwill revealed there. These celebrations were attended by crowds of Bantu and Bantu children. I am referring in the first place to the Ciskei. At Zwelitsha the function, held on 14th April 1966, was attended by between 10,000 and 12,000 people and that in spite of unfavourable weather conditions. A choir of approximately 1,000 schoolchildren was responsible for the choral singing. In that case the Territorial Authorities were responsible for the organization. At Lady Frere, where the function was organized by the Regional Authorities between 6,000 and 7,000 Bantu were present on 15th April, 1966. The items were well arranged and it was the teachers who had had the lion&#x2019;s share in those preparations. Then I come to the South Sotho. At a function held at Witzieshoek on 15th April, 1966, there were almost 6,000 Bantu present.</p>

<p>At Ficksburg approximately 85 per cent of the inhabitants of the Bantu residential area there were present at the function and the choirs were composed of Bantu schoolchildren. I then come to the Venda: At Sibasa there were approximately 7,000 Bantu persons at the function which took place on 29th March, 1966. Chief Mphephu, the chairman of one of the Territorial Authorities stated, <i>inter alia</i>, at that function&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a great improvement on the side of Bantu Education. School committees and school boards have been elected to control Bantu Education. It is a great thing when people are granted the power to control their own things. To-day we see there are Bantu Inspectors of education. Is that not freedom? All these are what the Government promised &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, what the Government promised, it gave&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; now it is true the Government is fulfilling the promises. Agitators will not be quiet for theirs is to sow bad seed amongst the people because they do not want friendship and peace.</block>

<p>In the Shangaan territory a celebration was held on 29th April at Thabina near Tzaneen, which was attended by approximately 5,000 Bantu. One of the members of the Machangana Territorial Authority was the main speaker there and I am quoting to you in brief what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Together with the entire country we want to wish the Republic of South Africa a prosperous, great and rosy future.</block>

<p>And now the speaker continues with fine imagery&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May the Republic of South Africa grow like the elephant. May the buffalo and the rhinoceros tremble in its presence.</block>

<p>He continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place the Machangana Territorial Authority and all the 511,093 Shangaans of this region, wish to reaffirm their loyalty to the State President and the honourable Prime Minister on this historic occasion. We should also like to express our honest desire for continued loyalty, peaceful co-existence &#x2026;</block>

<p>That word which the hon. member for Kensington cannot swallow&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; peaceful co-existence and co-operation with the Government of our country.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I could have enlarged further on the celebrations held by the North Sotho at Turfloop which were attended by approximately 7,000 Bantu, as well as the celebrations held by the Swazis at Tonga in the Barberton district, which were attended by approximately 4,000 Bantu. At Temba, a Bantu town in Hammanskraal, approximately 1,000 schoolchildren formed a guard of honour for the hon. Deputy Minister, Mr. Vosloo, who was the main speaker there. Approximately 10,000 people were present. I could also have referred to the celebrations at Ga-rankuwa and at Caprivi and even to the well-attended tribal celebrations in South-West Africa but I do not have the time to go any further. I just want to mention a last example from Natal. Apart from the festival celebrations at Nongoma, <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0552"/>which were attended by approximately 5,000 Bantu, almost 600 Bantu schools in Natal and Zululand celebrated the Republic festival there on 18th March, 1966. The greatest gathering of Bantu was apparently at the Umlazi Bantu township. According to estimates 25,000 people were present, almost half of whom were schoolchildren.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. member was present there; I do not know how many head of cattle he normally slaughters for a function. In every instance the Bantu Education Department, on its part, perpetuated the memory of the Republic Festival celebrations by presenting each one of the schools with a copper school bell with the Republican coat of arms on it. In this way 8,900 schools in the Republic received a fine memento and a functional article of daily use.</p>

<p>One can state without any reservation that the objective observer would have to admit that there has been a phenomenal growth and development in Bantu education over the past few years. The hon. member for Randfontein quoted certain statistics here to illustrate that fact. I just want to mention a few factors which in my opinion have contributed the most to that phenomenon. I am referring here to the sacrifice and the loyalty of the thousands of Bantu teachers and inspectors who have given priority to the task of education and have paid no heed to all the prattle of our opponents. I should also like to refer to something I mentioned a moment ago, i.e. the hard work, the loyalty and unselfish service of the officials of the Bantu Education Department, from the Secretary down to the most junior official. I am also referring in this regard to the enthusiastic interest and active participation in educational matters of approximately 55,000 Bantu parents serving on local control boards, school committees and school boards. Then I also want to mention the eagerness to learn of the Bantu and the will and desire of the Bantu nation to build up for themselves a future in their own environment through knowledge and education. In conclusion, before my time is up altogether, I just want to make a remark in regard to the future. We are not saying that we have already achieved everything we would have liked to have achieved in regard to Bantu education. Neither are we saying that enough provision has been made for professional and technical training. I definitely feel that the territorial authorities can be activated to an even greater extent in this regard. I want to ask lhe hon. the Minister whether it is not necessary at this stage to activate the territorial authorities to assume greater responsibility in general and also in regard to their education.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Koedoespoort seems to have derived considerable enjoyment from this Cook&#x2019;s Tour around the Republic, indicating the paeans of praise which the Bantu expressed at the time of the Republican festivities. Sir, festivites usually provoke happiness, but after every festivity again comes the day of reckoning, when we have to come back to the realities of life. I believe that the &#x201C;kern van die saak&#x201D; in this motion moved by the hon. member for Randfontein is expressed very clearly in para, (c), which refers to the grave shortage of adequately trained professional staff and technicians who will be required to replace Whites in the Bantu areas. To me this is a tacit admission of a degree of failure after 10 or 12 years of the implementation of Government policy in regard to Bantu education. Hon. members realize that, and at least they are prepared to admit that these shortages exist. I want to refer to our amendment, in which we indicate that in the mind of the Opposition all is not well in regard to Bantu education.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Opposition is not that of airy fairy hypothetical do-gooders. We look at things from the practical point of view. We appreciate that we can no longer live in a fool&#x2019;s paradise and believe that 3 million people can go on providing the skilled services for 17 million people. We believe that the time has come to ditch the theory that the Bantu child should remain a Bantu child.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Randfontein referred to the late Prime Minister&#x2019;s remarks when he was Minister of Native Affairs. I wish to refer to some remarks made by Dr. Verwoerd, and I believe that from these remarks one can assess the difficulties that confront Bantu education to-day, particularly the difficulties in respect of the financial situation. Dr. Verwoerd said in 1954, when he was dealing with this question of the subsidy and the pegging of the amount contributed by the State to R13 million a year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to state very clearly that I take full responsibility for the pegging of the subsidy on that basis and I support it because I think it is in the best interests of Bantu education and its control.</block>

<p>Sir, there does not seem to have been a change of heart in that respect. Four years later, in 1958, the then Minister of Finance more or less endorsed these words. He said that while the White guardian should supply essential funds, thereafter the community concerned must itself see to the extension of those services, in accordance with its capacity. But this only applies to the Bantu. If it applied to each of the racial groups in South Africa, perhaps there would be some justification for it, but to lay down a policy of that nature in regard to the poorest and least well-off and the most numerous race in South Africa seems to me to be a little illogical. Then seven years ago we had the remark to which I have referred, the <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0553"/>remark of the Minister of Bantu Education, who said that it was the aim of Bantu education to keep the Bantu child a Bantu child.</p>

<p>How can we ever hope to overcome the great shortage of adequately trained professional staff if we treat the Bantu child as a Bantu child? I say that hon. members opposite are wallowing in the morass of their own ideological intransigence. They are no longer objective and they are no longer able to criticize themselves. I want to give some figures to show the results of this attitude. The hon. member for Randfontein has quoted figures which I do not question, but his figures were not comparative; they reflected the position of one racial group only. If one compares them with the figures for other racial groups in regard to their education facilities, it becomes different.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member made that remark. I will do so straight away, although I was going to do it a little later. I want to refer the hon. member for Koedoespoort to Rhodesia, a little closer to South Africa than some of the other states to which the hon. member for Randfontein referred. I believe that Rhodesia is an object lesson to South Africa because their expenditure on African education represents 11 per cent of the total budget. Their national budget is £60 million, and African education takes up more than £6 million of that. In relation to the number of students in Rhodesia, the Rhodesians are spending as much as the South African Government is spending on Bantu education, but our numbers of pupils are much higher than theirs. I think the hon. member for Koedoespoort should bear that in mind. Whereas the Rhodesian expenditure on education is 11 per cent, my calculation makes the amount of money spent in South Africa on Bantu education 1.1 per cent of the total expenditure.</p>

<p>In the limited time at my disposal I want to deal with certain factors because I believe they play a very important part in this picture of Bantu education. I wish to deal with the question of Bantu teachers and their salaries and I deal with it in the full knowledge of what the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education said last year when he indicated that conditions would be improved. I want to deal with expenditure under the Loan Vote, and I want to deal with school fees and school books and school feeding, and if I have time, the question of Bantu night schools.</p>

<p>The shortage of teachers is, I think, one of the greatest difficulties and it has caused the lack of satisfactory progress in Bantu education. There are not enough properly qualified Bantu teachers, and why are there not enough? I think the answer is easy enough to arrive at if one studies the facts. In 1966 there were, roughly, 20,800 qualified Bantu teachers, of whom less than 50 per cent were earning more than R2 per working day. There were, roughly, 1,400 unqualified Bantu teachers, of whom less than 4 per cent were earning R2 or more per day. On a five-day week, this totals the magnificent amount of R43.3 a month in salary. I want to tell the House that if members refer to the figures released by the Bureau of Statistics for 1964, they will find that there were 2,100 Bantu in the tobacco industry earning nearly R48 a month. There were 12,000 Bantu in the paper and paper products industry earning almost R44 a month, and there were 5,400 Bantu in the printing industry earning on an average R56 a month. There were 17,000 Bantu in the clothing industry also earning on an average over <b>R41</b> per month.</p>

<p>If the salary offered to people who, I believe, would be classified in the main as semiskilled labourers is in excess of the salary offered to Bantu teachers then I believe that it is a sad indictment of the years which have been wasted in the development of Bantu education.</p>

<p>But it does not extend in this direction only. Take for example the expenditure on <b>Bantu</b> education on the Loan Vote in the last Estimates. I am referring here to schools only. I am ignoring altogether the ethnic colleges. The expenditure from the Loan Vote for Bantu was R450,000 for approximately 1,600,000 pupils. For Coloureds the figure was R1.8 million, which is four times the amount for a quarter of the number of pupils. These are the comparisons which the House must take into consideration. The sum for Indians on the Loan Vote was R5.6 million, which is 12 times the amount for one-twelfth of the number of pupils.</p>

<p>Then we come to this vexed question of school books. There again, of all the races the poorest race is the greatest sufferer, because the amount is pegged and the Deparment of Bantu Education with the best will in the world cannot provide some of the services which I believe its officials would like to. I will now furnish official figures in connection with school books. I can give the relevant references, they are all here. As far as Bantu are concerned, no books are supplied free to pupils in classes above standard six. In primary classes, class readers in English, Afrikaans and a Bantu language and certain graded class books are provided free. What is the position? The position is that a Bantu child who wishes to go on from standard six to be trained to fill the positions which the hon. member suggested are urgently required to be filled, in terms of his motion, has to buy, or his parents have to buy, his own books. It means that, according to figures released in Natal, the text books and the exercise books for those four years of education would amount to more or less R97. <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0554"/>The figures which were given to me some time ago by the Department of Bantu Education for the Cape indicated that their estimate was approximately R70, and this was from the primary class to Form V. I submit that no other race in South Africa has that burden in regard to their education.</p>

<p>Let us take the Coloureds for example. The position varies from province to province. In the Transvaal free loan books are provided to all pupils up to and including standard ten. In Natal free loan books are supplied up to standard six, and from standard eight to standard ten indigent pupils have to apply for loan books. But they can obtain them. In the Cape state schools pupils have to supply their own books but indigent pupils can apply for loan books. Let us now take the position of Indian education. In this regard certain information was given in reply to a question&#x2014;and this information is reported in Hansard. Free books are available to primary and high school pupils. Now, Mr. Speaker, is it fair to say that we in South Africa are doing everything possible in regard to the education of our largest population group?</p>

<p>Then there is the question of school feeding. I should like to refer briefly to a report of a commission appointed by this Government which was mentioned in the Senate in 1951 when the then Minister of Education referred to a report of a commission on school feeding. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the main the findings amount to this, that the school-feeding schemes for all races in the Union should continue, that the parents by way of a consideration should themselves make a contribution to the feeding and that the department which is to be responsible for Native education on the basis of the recommendations of the Native Education Commission should also be responsible for the school-feeding scheme for the Natives. &#x2026; It is generally accepted that the under-nourished child does worse at school than the well-fed child, and that an increase in the nutritional standard brings with it an improvement in achievements at school.</block>

<p>If we take that to its logical conclusion, what do we find as far as the Bantu people are concerned? We find that the incidence of kwashiorkor, though it is gratifying to notice it is declining, amongst the three racial groups, namely the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians, is highest amongst the Bantu. The incidence of the disease amongst the Bantu is 2&#x00BD; times that found amongst the Coloured people, and it is 24 times that of the Indian community.</p>

<p>But, Sir, despite this recommendation from the Government&#x2019;s own commission, nothing is allocated for school feeding. This does not apply to Coloured schoolchildren. It does not apply to Indian pupils. There is a scheme in existence whereby Coloured schoolchildren receive multi-vitamin tablets. In 1963, 44,000 were receiving these tablets, and it is estimated that ultimately 73,000 Coloured schoolchildren, the indigent ones, will be receiving vitamin tablets.</p>

<p>As far as the Indian community is concerned, school feeding at the moment mainly operates in Natal. An amount of R300,000 is allocated for that in Natal, and it is subsidized by the Department of Indian Education which was recently taken over by the State.</p>

<p>When a question was put to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education in regard to the possibility of supplying vitamin supplementary tablets to indigent and under-nourished pupils, the reply was that &#x201C;such a service does not fall within the purview and responsibility of an education department&#x201D;. Note that, Sir. That is contrary to the recommendation of their own commission.</p>

<p>Next I want to deal with the question of bursaries and loans. Because, Sir, obviously a poorer section of the community, if it is to receive education, must be assisted to a large extent by making available to them bursaries and loans. What is the position in this regard? We find that as far as the Bantu are concerned, bursaries and loans allocated amount to R111,000 in the last year for 1.6 million pupils. As far as our Coloureds are concerned grants-in-aid and bursaries total R448,000 whilst bursaries to the value of R420,000 are available. This was for only 400,000 pupils. When we come to deal with the Indian community we find there again that proportionately the amount allocated to Indians is far in excess of that allocated to Bantu pupils. We find that R72,000 was allocated for 135,000 pupils.</p>

<p>I realize that I have quoted a large number of figures. However, I have done it deliberately because I believe that so often these figures are examined separately, and not together, whilst I believe that the only way in which we can obtain a comparison and have a true picture of what is being done&#x2014;or what is not being done&#x2014;is to take the figures and examine them together. I believe that these comparisons are odious, Sir.</p>

<p>Then we have the question of libraries. Surely a library is one of the most important factors in the education of people who a short while ago were illiterate. And what do we find? We find that an amount of only R4,000 is shown on the Estimates for libraries for the Bantu children. For the Indians&#x2014;who are much smaller in numbers&#x2014;there is a sum of R40,000 allocated.</p>

<p>There is another inconsistency which I find very hard to understand. This is something which has only become apparent to me as a result of a question during the last session, and that is in regard to the financing of Bantu schools. It now seems that there will be a discrimination exercised in the financing of Bantu schools. Those primary and secondary school buildings in the homelands will be financed in <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0555"/>full by the Government but those in the Bantu townships in the white areas of South Africa will only be financed on a rand for rand basis. Surely the pupils in those areas are just as much entitled to Government assistance as those in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Then there is another aspect which I feel should be dealt with sympathetically by the hon. the Minister and his Department, and that is in connection with the Bantu night schools. Many of these Bantu night schools were serving a very useful purpose. They were run by dedicated people who were giving education to Bantu who normally by virtue of their domestic duties in cities stood no chance of improving their education. But what happened? Most of them have been closed and those which still manage to exist, do so under most difficult circumstances. There was one in the Durban complex and because the site was required for road development, the Department of Bantu Education could not see its way clear to give a permit for removal to a new area which had the approval of the local authority. It seems to me so wrong that these young people who desire education and who can get it if it is available to them, are entirely deprived of such education. They spend their evenings in the cities with nothing to do but gather together on street corners and be tempted to go into ways of crime. It is no use saying that these people can go to night schools provided they are in the non-white townships. It does not work. I have gone to the trouble to find out. It is absolutely impossible for these pupils to leave their domestic service at a reasonable time, to catch two buses in some instances, to attend night school and then to get back safely much later in the evening under almost dangerous circumstances. I believe that this is a shocking state of affairs and one which the Government, bearing in mind that there are other gaps in its ideological implementation of its policy, could consider with a sympathetic ear to see whether the many Bantu employees in the cities can be given some facilities for improving themselves. It will be in their own interest if the Government is ever able to implement its policy and get these people back into their homelands.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development_and_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the very limited time that we have to discuss a very important subject I do not want to allow myself to be led astray down a few murky by-ways dealing with matters which belong under the Bantu Education Vote and which it will be possible to discuss here shortly, something which a very senior member on the opposite side, the hon. member for Kensington, was unfortunately also guilty of. He raised points here which should have been raised under the Vote, and he also rode quite a number of his old hobby horses. The hon. member for Durban (Berea) who has just finished speaking did not confine himself sufficiently to the motion to which we are giving our attention and enlarged at too great a length on Vote discussions. I do not want to do that. In my speech I am going to touch upon a few aspects which they raised. I just want to try and give the hon. member for Berea an adequate reply on one point and do so in the words of a Bantu man in Africa himself. The hon. member referred quite derogatively a few times to the expression, &#x201C;a Bantu child to be treated as a Bantu child&#x201D;. In fact, he referred very derogatively to that expression. The hon. member is implying that what should actually be done to the Bantu youth is to apply denationalization in order to tear them away from what the Creator intended them to be, i.e. members of a specific Bantu nation. That would be committing genocide as far as they are concerned. Nothing else. In that way too tremendous hatred on the part of those Bantu nations is being aroused against the Whites advocating and practising those things. Proof of that state of mind was furnished when the hon. member for Koedoespoort read extracts from certain letters and referred to that very effective statement made at a Republic Festival. But I want to read the hon. member something which was said by a very important Bantu person of Africa who had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A country which lacks its own culture is no more than a collection of people without the spirit which makes them a nation. Of all the crimes of colonialism there is none worse than the attempts to make us believe that we have no indigenous culture of our own, or that what we did have, was worthless, something of which we should be ashamed instead of a source of pride.<br/>Some of us, particularly those of us who acquired a European type of education, set ourselves out to prove to our colonial rulers that we have become civilized and by that we meant that we had abandoned everything connected with our own past and learnt to imitate only European ways. Our young men&#x2019;s ambition was not to become well educated Africans, but to become black Europeans. Indeed at one time it was a compliment rather than an insult to call a man who imitated the Europeans a black European. So I have set up this new Ministry (of national culture and youth) to help us regain our pride in our own culture.</block>

<p>These words were spoken by President Julius Nyerere at the opening of his Parliament at Tanzania quite recently. I think it is the most damning reply to that integrationistic member for Berea. The spirit of our Bantu education system and the object of this Government with the presentation of Bantu education is not, as that speaker put it, to try and make imitation black Europeans of them but &#x201C;to help them regain pride in their own culture&#x201D;. I think that we have now permanently dealt with the hon. member for Berea on this point. With more time at my disposal I could have done the same thing more intensively and have <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0556"/>brought the hon. member for Pinetown more discomfort and less amusement, but I cannot do so this afternoon. The same applies to the hon. member for Houghton who said here by way of interjection that the Bantu in South Africa were living in a Western country. The hon. member for Kensington spoke here about the university colleges and made frequent reference, with few deductions, to the minority report of 1959 which preceded that legislation. I would advise the hon. member, after having had six or seven years&#x2019; experience of the system of university colleges, to refer back with less pride to that minority report, because the university colleges have, as they have done so many things, given the lie unambiguously and irrefutably on every point to that spirit which lay hidden in the minority report. The university colleges have done excellent work which has already attracted the attention of countries outside South Africa&#x2019;s Bantu areas. So much for that hon. member. In regard to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment I want to quote a single word which typifies a tremendous ideological difference between the Opposition and the Government which occurred when he spoke in his amendment about the better education which the Bantu ought to have received so that there might have been a greater contribution to &#x201C;our&#x201D; national productivity. We are not dealing here with one developing nation in South Africa. We are dealing here with differing criteria and differing complexes of productivity which arise from the abilities from the different Bantu nations which have to be co-ordinated with wisdom and statemanship into a joint effort here in Southern Africa. So we must see the production potential of the Bantu peoples alongside that of the white people in South Africa. I do not want to discuss that hon. member any further either.</p>

<p>I should like to thank and congratulate the hon. member who moved this motion for having done so. I think it is a very good thing that we have been able to focus properly, not only the attention of the members of this House, but also the attention of the Bantu and the attention of the Whites in South Africa on this matter, even if it was just for a few hours. It is an important matter for all of us who are concerned in it. The only pity is that there were not sufficient positive contributions in this regard from the opposite side of the House. I want to remind hon. members very briefly and merely in passing of the fact that when discussing these matters we must always take certain basic principles into consideration. I have already touched upon several of them here by way of repartee. The first, the most fundamental of all the principles, the root of the entire complex of principles, is that Bantu education is an educational system for the Bantu. I am saying this more specifically for benefit of the hon. member for Berea. Bantu education is an educational system for the Bantu. That is fundamental. That applies to every manifestation and facet of all educational activities. That applies to financing, to syllabuses, to methods, to management and control&#x2014;to everything. The principles on which Bantu education are founded, are just as universal and just as unassailable as those in the other educational systems we know in South Africa i.e. they must be adapted to the requirements, the knowledge, the background, the experience and the abilities of the various Bantu nations or groups for whose benefit the education is being applied. Therefore we will also see that as far as organization is concerned education must differ from one Bantu nation to another, just as it differs from one white nation to another and differs between one white nation and another non-white nation in South Africa and in the world. Another very important principle is that the Bantu child must be trained for service in and to his own community and in his own ethnic sphere. As a result of this we have all the secondary schools, the trade schools, the technical schools, the training schools, the university colleges as well as those facilities for medical training which we already know about. The establishment of these opportunities and facilities for study always supplies the needs of the Bantu nations concerned and of the Bantu homelands which are involved, and serve as the primary point of departure when considering what we must do and how we must do it.</p>

<p>A further principle I want to remind hon. members of is that in a certain sense the Bantu themselves set the pace at which Bantu education develops. The rate at which the number of secondary students increases, and associated with this, the rate at which the scope of secondary study facilities increases, is in a certain sense determined by the Bantu themselves. The number of qualified artisans, technicians, and professional people, etc., produced each year, also depends on this principle. As the Bantu themselves develop on the physical, political, economical and social levels, so their education must develop and expand. It would be fatal if the education of the Bantu were to develop out of all proportion and away from the Bantu, or <i>vice versa</i>, fall behind in the development process. It is the bitter task of all of us who are entrusted with the administration of education to see to it that that balance is maintained. I have every reason to believe, on the basis of the facts and the statistics which the hon. member for Randfontein very skilfully mentioned in his introductory speech, that the pace which we have thus far set in the development of Bantu education has developed correctly and will gradually be accelerated as it becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The last principle I want to remind members of is that the Bantu must also accept great responsibilities, and must in particular accept the responsibility in respect of financing their own education. Education is a basic service without which no nation can make any progress. It is therefore only fair to expect that the Bantu should pay for it themselves. There is nothing which will do more to bring <span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0557"/>home to a nation, which is being subjected so severely to denationalization onslaughts, their needs and their duty to save themselves, than being obliged to provide their own education. The particular financing methods for Bantu education contain no new or shocking principle in this connection either. The basic purpose of this financing method is to intensify responsible citizenship amongst the Bantu and to make them aware of their obligations towards their own people and also to make them aware of the fact that a nation with self-respect must, as far as possible, see to their own needs. The collection of Bantu taxes, which has given cause for concern in this regard, is already being administratively improved as much as possible and I am glad to be able to say that there have been appreciable improvements merely in the administrative collection of Bantu taxes. If necessary, and I think it will be necessary, we will have to see to it that better statutory methods are introduced for the collection of Bantu taxes. In this regard the hon. member for Kensington, whom I should not like to waken now from his afternoon slumber, had a great deal to say about the inefficiency of Bantu education and also about the financing of Bantu education. Bantu education must not only be educational but must also be financially related to the Bantu nations. In that way they must also adapt to the living standards of the Bantu. That is why it is not correct, as the hon. members for Berea and Kensington did, to refer to Bantu education as a cheaper and rudimentary form of education. The educational system, just as in the case of the other systems which nations must have in order to come into their own as nations, must be related to the essential nature of that nation itself. That is why it would be useless for me as an individual to wish that I could have for my children, whom I have now for a period of 19 years been seeing through university, the same inexpensive pattern of university education as the Bantu in South Africa are experiencing in respect of their university education. If we compare the Whites to the Bantu we find that we are dealing here with two different criteria, with two different national systems, with two different patterns of life and living standards. These are facts which hon. members on the opposite side should make some attempt to visualize and understand. That is why I reject the statement that the education of the Bantu is inferior and that the education of the Bantu is of too low a standard and ineffective because it is perhaps cheaper <i>per capita</i>, as the hon. member calculated in his speech.</p>

<p>On these principles and on others rests the great expansion which we are experiencing in all the types of schools which we find in the Bantu education system. It is not necessary for me to go into that any further. Other hon. members, particularly the two on the Government side, quoted statistics in this regard which everyone will find useful. I just want to remind hon. members of one small example in this connection. It is the position in regard to matriculants. Future matriculants are a very important group of Bantu persons who have to go through our schools. Fortunately the figures of Bantu matriculants increase every year even though they are not of a sufficient number and in a ratio which one would like to see and which is perhaps necessary. However, they are increasing. That is the right type of phenomenon. Matriculants with mathematics and science, which comprise a very important part of the knowledge of mankind, are also increasing yearly, perhaps because our Department has for many years already been applying a stimulus in this regard in the form of bursaries which we grant as encouragement. That is why great progress has been made in this sphere, particularly the technical sphere, the specialized field of education and more specifically also in the field of trade training and technical education because the service which must be rendered to the community here is so great. Compared with figures in previous years the numbers of technically-trained Bantu have perhaps decreased, but that is because training in those days was a purposeless training when compared with the purposeful training which they are receiving now. The great progress in this field is also rooted in the great choice they have in regard to the direction they can take in trade and technical education, a number of which possibilities I shall mention to the House in a moment. We have in our institutions many students who are being trained as carpenters, joiners, furniture makers, bricklayers. concrete workers, plasterers, plumbers, leather and upholstery workers, radio electricians, electricians, bakers, tailors, spinners, weavers, medical orderlies, sister-lecturers, milliners. female hairdressers, butchers and numerous others.</p>

<p>I then come to the next level, which is that of the university colleges. I am sorry, Sir, that I have to deal with these things in haste, like a butterfly touching lightly on flowers in its rapid flight. The three Bantu university colleges have in the past few years been developed with great success, as I told the hon. member for Kensington at the outset. The initial prejudice which there was, just as in the case of Bantu education and in regard to which the hon. member for Koedoespoort read out a striking example a moment ago, also disappeared like mist before the rays of the sun. The three university colleges, which have already been expanded, together have more than seven fullfledged faculties, namely the faculties of law, education, agriculture, arts and philosophy, natural sciences, theology, commerce and administration. The number of colleges has not only increased, it is still increasing, and in addition to that building alterations will have to be carried out at the colleges. In this regard hon. members must bear in mind the medical training scheme in Durban which further completes this picture of Bantu education at the university level. There are great opportunities therefore for the Bantu youth, opportunities which are steadily increasing <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0558"/>to enable them to equip themselves for service within their own spheres.</p>

<p>After this very rapid little survey I want for a moment to try and look to the future, as the hon. mover of this motion also did. Since the acceptance of our policy of separate development these two Departments which deal with Bantu administration have, particularly in the past few years, spent much of their time on the drafting of policy with a view to future development on the basis of separate development and the time has now come when these two Departments will, to an increasing extent, be concerned with the practical implementation of these policies. In recent times a comprehensive reconstruction and rebuilding of society, of nations and of communal aims amongst the Bantu peoples in South Africa has been in progress. This reconstruction is overarched by the political developments, the emergence of the Bantu nations on their road to freedom; and if it is borne in mind that freedom in fact means the right to govern oneself, then one must realize how great and how important is the task of all of us who are concerned with qualifying the Bantu individuals to accept their duties in this task of responsible and independent self-government as people and as individuals. All forms of development of the Bantu peoples and of their separate home territories must therefore to a very large extent emanate from and be generated by the Bantu peoples, the Bantu communities and the Bantu organizations themselves. It is desirable that the Bantu should to an increasing extent undertake and implement matters dealing with all branches of their national development, assisted of course by the Whites. That is essential for a greater degree of self-government and the fact that they must do these things themselves is the most important training ground for good citizenship and independent development that they can have. What it amounts to is that the Bantu authorities should in general, for the particular responsibilities allocated to them as authorities, be more actively involved in the execution of their duties. This activating process embraces their entire national way of life. I do not want to say much about that at the present. I had something to say about this matter during the last session and I will probably have more to say about it later on in this session. But what is of very great importance to the contents of this motion is the fact that the authorities must literally therefore be assisted in involving and finding more and more Bantu individuals so as to be able to build up a civil service and a social order of their own with their own people.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, with their own ministers. There is nothing strange about that. Some of them already have their own ministers. Of course we, as white officials, have to help them and support them in that task, and that is also what we are doing. Of course I can say nothing further at this moment about the particulars of this process and the re-organization which it will entail; I can only say that my two Departments are already very busy preparing this re-organization of the activating of the Bantu on that basis in conjunction with the Bantu themselves, with a view to its future application. At this stage I just want to emphasize again that the Bantu must train their own people for that service, and the entire Bantu public service in its wide variety will ultimately therefore have to be made up of Bantu themselves. The control of every nation&#x2019;s domestic affairs is, as you know, managed by two parallel-moving elements or cells, namely the administrative cell and the government cell. It is in these matters which they have to be of assistance; it is for this that training is now necessary. Along these natural and evolutionary lines the various Bantu populations can, each in its own way and according to its own tradition, according to its own requirements and activities, found and formulate its own national identity and not try and imitate that of a western nation. With a view to the initial requirements of such a Bantu public service, the Department of Bantu Education will, in the closest co-operation with the other Departments, i.e. the Department of Bantu administration and Development, concentrate on a well-planned training programme, and for that purpose will not only the existing university colleges, the vocational training schools and the technical schools have to be used to the full in order to meet the need for Bantu professional men, Bantu artisans and Bantu clerks, but the necessary Bantu manpower, particularly on the technical level, will also have to be provided. As I informed hon. members earlier on, the Department of Bantu Education has already made a start with this task. For example, they have already made a start with the training of Bantu surveyor assistants, Bantu health inspectors, medical orderlies and assistants, nurses, and numerous others. The courses at its trade and technical schools are continually being expanded and supplemented as the need arises. The university colleges are already providing for the training of economists, social workers, agronomists, lawyers, etc. Even a course in pharmacy has been introduced, at the university college of Turfloop in Northern Transvaal. I am very glad that the hon. member for Randfontein made such effective reference in this connection to the Schools for the Sons of Chiefs, of which we have four in the country, where people are also being trained&#x2014;in fact those people who are already the traditionally designated future leaders of their people&#x2014;in the spirit, in the traditions and requirements of leadership of their people, a type of school which we as Whites do not even have for children of the same age. However, they do have them in Britain. But much more than that is necessary. I have said that the need for Bantu technicians, particularly at this time, <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0559"/>has become urgent. On more than one occasion reference has been made to the fact that more should be made of the training of Bantu engineers, but here I would also much rather believe in the evolutionary process than in the reverse process of training, because it is my view that it would be an incorrect principle to begin with the training of Bantu engineers and other technologists for the most advanced services while there are insufficient numbers of technicians and tradesmen on the lower levels of the pyramid, for surely the pyramid is broader at the base where the ordinary tradesmen and technicians of the nation are to be found. As the requirements on the technical level are met, the time will in fact arrive when it will also be necessary to train technologists on the higher level, including engineers, to do that work. Both my Departments are at the moment planning for institutions, courses and syllabuses for the training of artisans and technicians in the entire comprehensive sphere of engineering, according to the existing requirements in the ranks of the Bantu in all the different fields. These things are also of course very essential in the field of commerce, administration and law, and work is also being done in the necessary direction there. In this connection there are numerous courses at our colleges which lead to diploma certificates and not to degree certificates, which is what the hon. member for Randfontein advocated. I may just mention that there are already 16 courses at our various colleges in education, social work, law, theology, agriculture, nursing, pharmaceutics, commerce and administration, and for all these specific directions I have already accepted it as policy, and laid down as a principle, that efforts should more specifically be made in the direction of expansion and the furnishing of trained persons by means of diploma courses. That is a very sound principle, particularly in view of the requirements of the Bantu, but no matter how important it is to have these people with diplomas and certificates we must be realistic and keep our eyes fixed on practical things and see to our immediate requirements. In this respect we have a tremendous need for the ordinary schooled Bantu in all these branches. In order to meet these immediate requirements for the Bantu authorities it is the plan to recruit Bantu with the necessary potential whenever they may be found, in the teaching profession or in the white areas and the municipal service, or wherever it may be, so that they can become qualified as quickly as possible for that specific service at the university colleges and their technical institutions by means of shorter or longer courses. It is my fixed intention to qualify such trainees by means of diplomas as well, which can subsequently count for their promotion in the service. We have made a start with the planning for these crash training courses and it will shortly be possible to make practical progress. Here I am thinking of all the practical things such as all the various offices which I mentioned and which are necessary in all the branches of the Bantu peoples&#x2019; own public service.

<p>I am told to wait and see. The hon. member for Randfontein came forward with this motion to-day to create an opportunity for the Minister to tell us about his ideals, and what we had from the Minister came down to this. He quoted a Prime Minister of Black Africa, Julius Nyerere, an avowed socialist, a man who has gone out of his way to turn his back on every single value that the West recognizes, a man who has abused the position to which he was elevated in order to destroy Western values.</p>

<p>He was never a bright boy of mine. I want to ask the Minister whether the values of Western Christian civilization are universal. Do they mean anything in the world to-day, or are they limited only to the white people in South Africa or the white people of the world? Because that is the conclusion I draw from what the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Randfontein have said. Are the values and principles on which our Western Christian civilization is based universal, or are they not? Are they still of value to anybody except ourselves, or not? We are told by the Nationalist Party that these people must not become black Europeans, but what is it to be a European? Is it the belief in certain standards and certain values on which our religion is founded? That is what we understand when we say that we are Europeans and have a European civilization. Are we now turning our back on that and saying it is of no application to anyone else in this country, by insisting that they evolve something of their own not dictated by us? Now Nyerere is quoted as an authority which justifies this, but I think the Minister could have done much better than that.</p>

<p>The motion deals with the practical implication of the Government&#x2019;s policy of peaceful co-existence. I want to ask: Co-existence with whom? Is it co-existence with the Bantu people in our country? Are we not to-day peacefully co-existing with our Bantu people? Because <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0560"/>we now have a motion which is mindful of the practical implementation of this policy and then calls for all these things to be done. If we are to-day peacefully co-existing with the Bantu people, how are we going to persuade them that they must become citizens of another country which has no existence at the moment except in the minds of the Minister and his Department? How are we going to put it across to them when they are playing an economically fruitful part in our society, that they have to evolve away from us into something else? What is the goal of every single undeveloped people if it is not imitation of the Western way of life and the standards of living of the white man which are based, I repeat, on our Christian civilization, because of the respect we have for each other and our recognition of the rights of the individual and the right of every man to get ahead?</p>

<p>I agree, but why must we now deny to the Bantu that very thing and force them into something else? [Interjections.] I want to know whether the Department of Bantu Education in fact has embarked upon this policy of forming the minds of the Bantu pupils and telling them that they have to develop into something else which will separate them effectively from the white man. I want to hear whether that is the policy of the Minister&#x2019;s Department.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to put it to you this way. I have very little time left. We talk in this country, and the hon. member for Soutpansberg is continually using the word, of the infra-structure of our economy. And we have this physical infra-structure which comprises the Railways, the roads and housing, in other words physical things which make it possible for investment and production to take place. But there is such a thing as the mental infra-structure of our country, which consists of the education of our people. This mental infra-structure is the ability of these people to absorb the technical knowledge and to apply it. That is what is important in this country. It is vitally important that we should put this across to the absolute maximum number possible. From the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s point of view, surely this must apply, even if we accept for a moment that there will be homelands in which these people will develop. How can we accept that it is just and right to limit the amount of money for the education of the Bantu people even if they are to develop in their own homelands? Because, the infra-structure which I term the mental infrastructure, the ability to absorb and to use technical ability and technical means of production, must not be limited. They must be used to the absolute maximum.</p>

But what of the next generation? Our plans should not be limited to what they have here to-day. We should be looking at the next generation and the one beyond that. And I believe it is criminal, Mr. Speaker, to limit as we are limiting to-day, our financial contribution to the education of the Bantu youth who in the future will have to carry in their own country as well as in ours, the burden, an increasing and growing burden, of having to put into effect the technological civilization of which we are so justly proud.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>It is a limited amount we are offering them. We are not going ahead as fast as we might. I think it is common cause on both sides of the House that we could do more. And if there is a reason I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why it should be limited. And we are unable to accept for one moment that this is something for which there is any justification. I now wish to discuss for a very brief moment the needs of a country such as the Transkei. Not only the Transkei, but there are eight other countries which we were told are going to emerge. Every single aspect of their lives, every movement day in and day out, is going to be affected by the policy that we are applying to-day. And, Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that we are doing enough. What I think is happening in this country is that we are going through a process which is happening in other industrialized countries, whereby every succeeding generation moves into a place in society that its forefathers never knew. The children of the White population of to-day, the children of this generation, will be doing work that their fathers never did. We have it amongst every single group, In so far as the Coloureds and Indians are concerned there is a continual upward movement as a result of education, employment, and as a result of income coming in from our society. And that is happening to the Bantu too. In every single Bantu township in this country where the Bantu have come in to take certain standards of employment, their children, by reason of the great opportunities created, even by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own policy, will have opportunities which will be greater and higher and of a far more demanding nature. And this is something which is happening in <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0561"/>our country and I feel that this is a sociological trend that goes on throughout the world. But I do not think there is any country in the world where the successful application of it and the ability of allowing it to go ahead, is more important than in this country. Because I believe that is the key to this peaceful co-existence of which the hon. member spoke when he introduced his motion. What we have here is a country that is developing. What we are being told is that this Government will ask the Bantu people to leave this country of ours, to accept that they are not citizens of this country of ours. In other words, to leave a country, Mr. Speaker, which is one of the industrial wonders of the world. They must now accept citizenship in a developing country where they will perhaps be a little bit better off than in some of the other countries of Africa. But not all that much. They will be dependent on us in all the progress that is made. And I am wondering whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is putting this across to the minds of the people that they are teaching. Because that is what we are doing. We are asking them, the present generation of Bantu working in our industries and on whom our whole future depends, to accept that their children shall leave this society of ours, that they shall accept citizenship somewhere else, in some other place, where those opportunities and advantages will be denied them. And I believe that the hon. the Minister, and the hon. member who introduced this motion when he was talking about the practical implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy of peaceful co-existence, are making a very serious mistake when they believe that that is the way to achieve peaceful co-existence between the different races in this country of ours.</p>

<heading>INVESTIGATION OF FUNERAL SERVICES</heading>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to examine the extent, if any, to which the lower and middle income groups are exploited by funeral services.</block>

<p>Initially, I must confess that it is with a certain amount of diffidence that I venture to raise a matter of this nature in this hon. House. I felt it could impinge on intimate matters, matters which affect people at a time of great sadness, something which could reawaken memories and cause distress. But I have had a growing conviction that the time has come when some form of investigation should take place into the manner in which funeral services and other ceremonies which take place when we leave this mortal sphere, are conducted. None of us can avoid or escape death. There are no barriers for rich or poor or White or Black. Death can strike at any time, it can come suddenly and it can catch those left behind unawares. I believe that to be a time when consideration and sympathy on the part of those left behind is a very important aspect. And I believe too, that there should be no exploitation at that time in matters affecting the last rites of departed people. I do not believe that the little adage which the undertakers adopt sometimes when they exort their staff to &#x201C;collect while the tears flow&#x201D;, should apply. I do not believe that anybody should capitalize out of another&#x2019;s grief or to profit from another&#x2019;s sorrow. These may all be laudable sentiments and I know that when this sad happening takes place there is a tendency for some people in their grief to be more extravagant than they need be. And I believe that there are sometimes people who take advantage of a mourner&#x2019;s distress. The mourners themselves are diffident about raising objections or protecting themselves from exploitation because they regard it as a sign of disrespect for their loved ones whom they have just lost. They, therefore, do not argue about what happens and they do not investigate too closely charges which are made. It is difficult to say whether this exploitation has assumed any alarming proportions in South Africa. But I would be very loath to see in our beloved Republic a situation which has developed in America in regard to exploitation. Anyone who reads &#x201C;The American Way of Death&#x201D; by Jessica Mitford or &#x201C;The High Cost of Dying&#x201D; will realize that it would be a sad day for South Africa if some of the practices which have become accepted commercial practice in the United States should ever be allowed to develop here.</p>

<p>We find that funeral arrangements vary in accordance with the person&#x2019;s religious conviction. Different races have different ways of honouring their dead. Some people find that the keeping up of the tradition in that respect involves a great financial strain, and it is not uncommon among the Bantu people to find that they have to borrow to bury their dead. As far as the White upper income group is concerned, I believe that no particularly monetary sacrifice or hardship is involved. They are usually able to provide the facilities which they regard to be in keeping with the status of the loved one they have lost.</p>

<p>When it comes to the question of the poorer section, often they are faced with sudden and crippling expense and in many cases their pride makes them feel that expense should not <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0562"/>be spared on such an occasion as this. They find themselves committed to debts for a long time afterwards. This is not unusual, because undertakers themselves indicate that there is a high proportion of bad debts.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I realize that the State cannot protect people against themselves in this respect. The State cannot interfere, but I believe, too, that the State should make sure at this time, a time which comes to all of us, there should be the minimum of exploitation and malpractice. If possible malpractices should be eliminated altogether. I want to refer to certain known instances where I believe the actions of undertakers and funeral directors have left quite a lot to be desired. I am referring particularly at this stage to the question of funeral benefit and burial societies. I have already referred to the question of pride, and I know that many people feel that when they depart from this mortal sphere, they would not like their loved ones left behind to be involved in expense, or be crippled by a great deal of expense involved in funeral services. Because of this feeling, they are inclined to take out some form of policy, which undertakes to do certain things and which they feel leaves them with a sense of security, so that when death comes upon them, they know full provision for their last rites has been made. As a result of this, they take out various insurance policies, and usually by means of a regular monthly payment, which in some instances can be as small as 35 cents a month, spread over a period of years, undertakers and funeral directors contract to provide certain arrangements at the time of death. I understand, Sir, that these contracts are calculated actuarially and on that basis it should be, from the point of view of the funeral director, a reasonably safe business investment. I do not believe that there is any excuse for some of the means that have been adopted in so far as these policies are concerned. They may be adopted to compensate for a short-fall as a result of increasing cost of services, and the general increase in the cost of supplies, but I do not believe that it is necessary to resort to means which appear to be taking place. I want to refer in a little more detail to a particular policy. This is a policy which has been offered by a firm which has been established in the Republic for over 100 years. They contract to do certain things. They say in their policy &#x201C;in consideration of the above payments and the due observance of the terms hereof, the Society undertakes to provide in the event of the death of a person covered by this contract, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) For the funeral of an adult of 16 years of age or over&#x2014;a fully trimmed polished coffin, the usual attendants fully to carry out the funeral, one mourning coach for mourners (if within the borough) (and then they mention the place) and payment of the usual cemetery fees.<br/>In the event of cremation being desired, the Society will carry out the arrangements required by the Crematorium Company and pay the cremation fees&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That is what the policy says. This is what happens in practice, and this is a specific case. It concerns a middle-aged couple who decided that they wished to take out this form of insurance. They paid their nominal premium regularly every week for a period of 10 years. At the expiration of the 10-year period, the policy virtually remains dormant, and no more payments were required to be made until the death of either of the spouses. The husband died first and it was stipulated that cremation should be carried out. In due course, the funeral arrangements were made and completed, and in terms of the policy, the weekly payments continued on the same basis as before for a period of 10 years or less, should the remaining spouse pass away before the period of 10 years. The 10-year period payment expired, and shortly after that the widow passed away. This widow too had made a previous request for cremation. It had also been indicated at both of these funerals that a better quality coffin should be provided, because it was considered by the mourners that the type of coffin which was provided under the policy, was not really in keeping with the occasion.</p>

<p>For a cremation?</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am coming to that point, because I believe it is something that does require investigation. The hon. the Minister has raised that matter about the coffin for cremation. In the first instance, although the funeral had taken place under the policy, an account was rendered for the cremation fee. In the second place, there has been an agreement beforehand that an additional amount of R40 would be paid in respect of a better coffin which would be provided. The account submitted amounted to R92. Now, if one deducts the R40, on which agreement had been reached, a further amount of R52 remains. Now the details were supplied, and there were certain charges to which I believe no one could really take exception. There was included in this additional amount of R52 a donation to a minister, Press notices and services in connection with the disposal of the ashes after the cremation. These three items amounted to R19. That left a balance of R33, which was made up as follows:</p>

</tr>

</table>

<p><span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0563"/>A total of R33 odd. But what did the policy promise? The policy promised, and I quote from the wording to which I have referred: &#x201C;The usual attendants fully to carry out the funeral&#x201D; and &#x201C;in the event of cremation being desired, the Society will carry out the arrangements required by the crematorium company and pay the cremation fees&#x201D;. It was established subsequently that the crematorium company charges the undertaker an amount of R15.50 for the actual cremation. But the undertaker&#x2019;s account showed R21, and there was also the question of the R2 doctor&#x2019;s fee for the cremation certificate, regardless of the fact that the contract had laid down that the cremation fee would be paid.</p>

<p>At this stage, as is normally the case, I would assume the deceased&#x2019;s relatives were unaware of the terms of the contract, so they were not, at that stage, able to investigate details. I submit again that normally, at the time of loss and extreme grief, people do not go into these details. It becomes, I think, almost routine procedure that the account which was submitted by the undertaker, is tendered to the estate of the deceased person. However, in this instance, inquiries were made, because it was recollected on the death of the husband that an account had been rendered in respect of the cremation. It was felt at the time that this was wrong, and that the policy covered that. A letter was addressed to this particular firm, seeking details. A month elapsed, Sir. There was no reply. As a result, a registered letter was submitted, which evoked immediately a telephone call from the firm in question, apologising for the fact that the first letter had not been replied to, and offering the somewhat lame excuse, I feel, that it had been wrongly filed. Arising from the second letter an official reply was received in which the firm apologised most profusely, assured its most careful attention at all times. An amended account was submitted this time for R71, deducting the amount which had been charged for the cremation expenses.</p>

<p>The letter indicated that as regards a portion of the rules of the contract, which was termed a continuation contract, certain facts applied, to which I have already referred, but full details were not given, although they were specifically asked in the first and in the second letter for a copy of the contract and for full details. A further letter was sent, requesting the full details of the original contract and the wording of the continuation contract, and seeking further information. In due course a reply was received, enclosing the actual contract. The letter also revealed that the policy made no provision for Press announcements. So it would seem that no provision would be made in a policy of that nature to notify those left behind of the demise of a person whom they may have known for many years. It said &#x201C;the family is usually advised accordingly&#x201D;, but in this case, no such advice was given. In so far as the charges rendered for the three Press insertions, the remark was made that normally a service charge was made when more than three Press insertions were required. So a service charge of R1, in addition to the normal Press insertion charges, was made. Then, despite this funeral taking place in mid-winter, there was a charge for the preservation of the body. In the letter requesting further details, mention was made of this fact. This is the reply, and I quote: &#x201C;Preservation of bodies is at all times necessary and these services are not covered by the policy, for on occasion bodies are sometimes kept for several days&#x201D;. In this instance, death took place on the Sunday. The funeral took place on the Tuesday. I am told by someone who should know, that there is no such thing as preservation. Apart from embalming, it is merely refrigeration. One is tempted to ask: How can the terms of the contract offer &#x201C;a full funeral&#x201D; if these charges are levied? Then the question of an after-hours removal fee was raised. The reply was: &#x201C;You will no doubt appreciate that any removal carried out outside of normal hours of business necessitates the payment of overtime for the staff engaged on such removal. Therefore a charge of R6.30 is made and is paid to the staff concerned&#x201D;. Reference was made to the cremation fees. The comment in the reply was: &#x201C;These fees are paid to the crematorium&#x201D;. You will remember that the crematorium charges the undertaker R 15.50, but the charge levied in this case, which allegedly was paid to the crematorium, amounted to R21. The letter concluded by stating that an amount of R42 had been paid to the burial society, indicating that that was all that was paid, and implying therefore you had received your R42 worth. All of these details can be substantiated&#x2014;I have the correspondence here. I have photostats of the actual statements&#x2014;I believe it is fair to ask whether these practices are general, and if they are general, whether the time has come when this House should pay some attention to the matter and make some recommendation to the Government asking for these circumstances to be investigated. You see, Sir, I have made my inquiries in a limited way, and I am told, and again I believe my source to be a reliable one, that in cases of cremation under this type of burial policy, the cremation charges are always made, irrespective of whether the policy admits that the cremation should be provided if so desired.</p>

<p>Then there is another aspect. I am told that although at one stage with these policies the coffin which was supplied, was in keeping with the dignity of the occasion, to-day the standard of the coffin has deteriorated to such an extent that very few people, I understand, would be prepared to make use of the coffin that is provided. There is a further aspect. I am told that normally the charge for the use of the mourners&#x2019; coach is approximately R5, and in <span class="col_1093-1094" refersTo="page_0564"/>this instance surely, if the mourners&#x2019; coach had not been used, it could have been offset against other expenses, but no attempt was made to do that. I have examined the terms of other policies, and one of my hon. friends, who will take part in the debate at a later stage, will deal with it in a more technical and skilled manner than I can. I believe that the terms of these contracts are not specific enough and that the people who wish to make this provision, are not really certain of the terms which they are accepting when they sign the contract. I believe that there is room for misunderstanding, and I believe that there is always a reluctance on the part of the surviving relatives to be involved in what they regard as disrespectful and undignified arguing afterwards. I think that I have the general support of the members in the House when I say that any form of exploitation in respect of a subject of this nature should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>In so far as the question of the crematoria are concerned, my investigation has led me to believe that they possibly operate in a manner above suspicion. They are controlled by provincial ordinance and they have regulations promulgated by the province. I know that one company in particular, and this is a matter which the hon. the Minister of Transport raised, is most specific that it will not accept a funeral if there is to be re-use of the coffin. That is absolutely specific. But I know doubts exist in the minds of many people as to whether coffins are in fact being re-used, being paid for in full and then used again and again in the case of cremations. To me that is a doubt that should be dissipated once and for all.</p>

<p>I am sure that there are people who are engaged in this business, who conduct their business in an ethical manner, but I feel that it should be established, firstly, that undertakers are not making excessive profits on the basic cremation charge, as I have indicated appears to happen in some instances. I feel, too, that it should be established beyond doubt, and prevented as far as possible, that touting by means of commissions and gifts does not take place amongst hospital staffs and nursing home staffs. I believe there are instances known where that disgusting practice has taken place. I believe, too, in so far as flowers are concerned, that it should be ascertained beyond all doubt that people who direct that flowers should be sent to some institution, are in fact sure that their instructions are carried out. I believe, too, that it may be desirable to investigate whether a monopoly is developing in funeral business and whether, if it is, it is in the interest of the public. I believe that the tendency of many funeral directors nowadays to provide elaborate chapels where people can use their normal church or the facilities made available at the crematorium, is something which may be adding to the basic costs of these services, because if one follows the American pattern, these chapels will become most elaborate; some of them in fact have. They are air-conditioned; they boast in their advertisements, which are extensive advertisements, family rooms, slumber rooms, ministers&#x2019; private rooms, etc. I believe that all these things should come under some form of investigation. I would like to suggest that in any investigation that is made, those who are concerned and involved should be entitled to make as much information available to the investigating body as they can. I believe that the public should be called upon to come forward, despite their natural reluctance to do so. I believe that the funeral directors and their staffs&#x2014;because I believe that the staffs are very lowly paid for the unpleasant type of work that they are called upon to do&#x2014;the clergy, the medical profession and any other ancilliary services should also be called upon to place whatever information they have before the investigating body.</p>

<p>Sir, I hope that this motion will receive the support of both sides of the House and I trust the Government in its wisdom will agree to appoint some kind of investigating body.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>I have been asked to present our case on behalf of this side of the House. I just want to say that I did not come to deliver a funeral oration on the motion of the hon. member for Berea. I think we are discussing this motion on a non-political basis, and if I may say so with your leave, Mr. Speaker, in a very calm atmosphere for this type of motion. This is a topical matter which affects the entire country; it is a topical matter which affects everybody, because in the final instance everybody has to go that way, or shall I rather say, be carried that way. We are therefore grateful that the hon. member for Berea has raised this matter.</p>

<p>As I listened to him presenting his case, I thought of the joke I heard while I was preparing this speech. It is about a lady who went to her doctor to be treated for some ailment or other. All he did was to give her some pills. She asked him what she was to pay, and he replied: &#x201C;R12&#x201D;. She said: &#x201C;But doctor, that is rather steep!&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;Madam, have you been to the undertakers?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to approach this matter as seriously as the hon. member for Berea. Let me therefore say the following by way of introduction, to place this question of funerals in South Africa in the correct prospective. As you know, we South Africans are a religious nation, and the funeral plays a most important part in the community in the Republic, particularly among the Whites. It plays an important part because most White South Africans are attuned to arranging the last tribute to their deceased beloved ones in the best possible manner. I think it was the British <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0565"/>statesman William Gladstone who said on one occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Show me the manner in which a community or a nation cares for its dead and I will measure with mathematical exactness the tender sympathies of its people, their respect for the laws of their land and their loyalty to high ideals.</block>

<p>Therefore I want to emphasize again that South Africa must certainly be in the front rank of the Western nations in respect of dignified funerals for its deceased beloved ones. But I also want to add that as far as the Afrikaner in particular is concerned, funerals have developed through the years into a ceremony, a ritual, to which he attaches a great deal of value and which has played a quite exceptional part in the history of his social life. Here I am referring in particular to earlier days. That is why terms like &#x201C;begrafnisrys&#x201D;, &#x201C;begrafnishoek&#x201D; and &#x201C;te laat kom vir jou begrafnis&#x201D; were included in our Afrikaans vocabulary.</p>

<p>The talks I had with funeral undertakers and in particular my own observations through the years have brought me to the interesting conclusion that there is most certainly a difference in approach, as far as funerals are concerned, between our Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking South Africans. I do not want to go into the matter to intensively. I may just mention that according to my findings and to what I was told by funeral undertakers, English speaking persons prefer a more simple funeral. The coffin in particular is mostly more simple than that selected by Afrikaans-speaking persons. I mention these matters in the serious spirit in which the debate is being conducted. Sir, to point out that one should be too categorical when discussing the question of alleged exploitation, if any, by funeral undertakers, of the lower and middle income groups. Because most South Africans like to have funerals accompanied by pomp and ceremony, one may expect the cost of funerals in the country to increase.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to reply to the various allegations of the hon. member for Berea, I want to use this opportunity to say a good word for the funeral undertaker. I feel at liberty to do so because I am in no way associated with any funeral undertaking. It is most important that one should see the service and the service motive of the average funeral undertaker in South Africa in its broad perspective, and as I see it&#x2014;and here I am referring specifically to the reliable funeral undertaker&#x2014;the funeral undertaker is in the main actually a combination of three persons in one. In the first place he is the family doctor, then he is also the minister and in the final instance he is the family attorney. I want to start with the last, the family attorney. Like any family attorney the reliable funeral undertaker must have some knowledge of many of the legal aspects of a funeral, amongst them the laws regarding funerals and excavations. Like the good family attorney, the funeral undertaker must also be able to give sound advice in general in a friendly and calm fashion to the bereaved. In the second place I see him in the same position as a minister. He must be able to give advice, for example on the attitude of the church concerned in respect of cremation or in respect of various funeral services, and then he must also be able, like a minister, to act in a dignified way on the day of the funeral itself. Then I also see him as a doctor, because after all he must know something about the anatomy of the human being. He must also be able to ascertain that death has in fact occurred, and like a doctor he must be able to soothe those who are left behind and who may be tense and nervous.</p>

<p>Having outlined these characteristics of the funeral undertaker I think, Mr. Speaker, that you will agree with me that it is clear that the average funeral undertaker&#x2014;I am not referring to the few black sheep to whom the hon. member for Berea referred&#x2014;renders a most important social service, and as such he is entitled to fair remuneration for his services. I do not want to anticipate the views of the hon. the Deputy Minister, who is handling this motion this afternoon, because he will present his views himself, but we on this side of the House feel, with the knowledge at our disposal, that there is at present no necessity for a special commission of inquiry into funeral undertakings. The cases of actual exploitation&#x2014;and I would by no means deny that exploitation does in fact take place&#x2014;are too few. I want to say at once that I would be the last to deny that exploitation has in fact occurred from time to time. Every profession has its black sheep, but I want to say that the hon. member for Berea has probably lost sight of the fact, although he referred to that in passing, that there is a national association of funeral undertakers in South Africa. I have gone to the trouble of contacting them. I must add that this association represents 70 per cent of the reliable funeral undertakers in South Africa. I do not know whether the hon. member has acquainted himself with the fact that this association maintains a very strict code of conduct. I just want to refer to two aspects of that code. The first relates to this very question of funeral costs. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Association will endeavour at all times to be equitable in the costs of our services and never to abuse bereaved families.</block>

<p>It then continues, in the fifth point of the code&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and to maintain a high ethical standard in our relationship towards all other funeral undertakers.</block>

<p><span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0566"/>You will therefore see, Mr. Speaker, that if there are actually cases of exploitation by funeral undertakers in the Republic, we on this side of the House feel that it is the duty of the public to bring such cases to the attention of the Government authority concerned, and I am convinced that they will then be investigated and dealt with departmentally.</p>

<p>Finally I also want to say that in view of this Government&#x2019;s attitude regarding private initiative&#x2014;we have always advocated private intitiative&#x2014;we do not wish to interfere with the way in which private concerns arrange funeral services, provided of course that the costs do not become exorbitant. I think the hon. member will agree with me that apart from the three or four cases mentioned by him, he did not present a very strong case to prove that there is large-scale and general exploitation by such undertakers.</p>

<p>I also want to say that if funeral costs have risen in recent years, and they have risen, just like the costs of any other service, it is due mainly to the fashionable demands undertakers are set by the public of South Africa in respect of funerals. If South Africans would be satisfied with less fashionable funerals. I believe the costs would also be considerably lower. I recall the days when I was still a little boy, when life was still somewhat simpler. Then funerals were also dignified, and the accounts were congruous with the occasion. But nowadays, as elsewhere in the world, splendid funerals have become a kind of status symbol to many people. It is estimated, for example, that in South Africa the annual funeral account for an average of 28,000 deaths amounts to about R11.5 million spent on flowers, funeral processions, monuments, tombstones, coffins, etc.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Berea referred in passing to the costs in the U.S.A. Conditions there are not quite comparable to those in South Africa, but I think I may state that we in this country are still in a most fortunate position, because in America funeral costs have certainly become exorbitant. There one does not hear of &#x201C;undertakers&#x201D; but of &#x201C;morticians&#x201D;. Nor do they speak of funeral undertakings, but of &#x201C;funeral homes&#x201D;, and instead of cemeteries they refer to &#x201C;funeral parks&#x201D;. During a visit to America I had the opportunity to visit such a &#x201C;funeral home&#x201D;, and what an experience it was! It is a palatial building in the latest architectonic style, where a man may lie in state for several days and where those who survived him may obtain luxury accommodation in the building, where even meals are served. In other words, funeral undertakings in America have also become a kind of hotel industry.</p>

<p>The latest statistics I could obtain show that the Americans have to pay about R550 for an average funeral for an adult. The comparable figure in South Africa for a decent funeral in the middle income group amounts to R120 at present. I am convinced the cost of living is much higher in America, but the figures are nevertheless interesting. In America the most luxurious funeral costs about R 1,000, whereas in South Africa, as far as I could ascertain, it costs about R300. The cheapest funeral&#x2014;and this is important, because the hon. member&#x2019;s motion refers to the lower income groups&#x2014;costs about R140 in America, whereas the lowest tariff in South Africa is about R60.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the specific allegation made by the hon. member, that funeral undertakers in general make exorbitant profits. After a thorough investigation I could find no sign of that, and I also want to say that the whole matter was dealt with in a preliminary report by the Bureau for Census and Statistics as long ago as 1946, and that the exaggerated allegations which were then also made, were exposed. On page 19 of that report, the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">233 funeral establishments in the Union amassed a total net profit amounting to £72,815, showing an average net profit of 8.1 per cent or approximately £313 per firm.</block>

<p>Now one should remember that among the 233 undertakings mentioned, there were only about eight large undertakings. The rest consisted of smaller undertakings. If we leave out all other places and consider only the larger centres, we shall see that we are left with just £9,000, or R18,000, per centre, which is not very unreasonable. A similar inquiry has just been undertaken by the Bureau for Census and Statistics in terms of the general questionnaire which the Opposition opposed so vehemently at the end of last year&#x2019;s session, the questionnaire which was sent to selected house owners. I do not know whether the Minister has the particulars available, but I think it will be revealed once again that funeral undertakings are still not showing exorbitant profits. Furthermore, one should bear in mind the tremendous expenditure that funeral undertakers have to incur in order to render efficient services to the public, and how the costs of the various items have increased through the years. Let me just take a few categories with comparative figures for 1936 and 1963, the latest figures I could obtain. The first item comprises cemetery fees. In 1936 a single grave cost R4.50 in Cape Town. In 1963 it cost R10. As regards Johannesburg, a single grave cost R6 in 1936 and R14 in 1963. In Durban a single grave cost R5 in 1936 and R20 in 1963. I could continue along these lines.</p>

<p>Another item which involves large capital expenditure for funeral undertakers is motor vehicles. A new hearse, which cannot be manufactured here but must be imported from the U.S.A., cost R 1,400 upon delivery in 1936, whereas it now costs R8,000. In 1936 a mourners&#x2019; <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0567"/>vehicle cost R600, whereas it now costs R2,400.</p>

<p>I now come to wages and salaries. Funeral undertakers are burdened by a serious shortage of staff, for the very reason that their staff do not earn the wages they may earn in many other professions. This is not criticism of the Government. This is the reason why undertakers frequently find that a man changes his job as soon as they have trained him. In 1936 a qualified artisan earned R14 a week, whereas he earned R40 in 1963. In 1936 a labourer earned R3 a week, whereas he now earns R8.50. In 1936 a funeral manager earned R80 per month, and now his income is R240 a month. Thus I could continue, Sir. but I do not want to burden you with further statistics.</p>

<p>I think it is important that we should discuss the question of materials, namely the manufacturing costs of coffins. Expenditure forms the crux of funeral costs. I shall just refer to that briefly, because my time has almost expired. The costs of wood and other materials have also increased tremendously through the years, compared with the figures in respect of 1936.</p>

<p>In view of the preceding facts, this side of the House feels that we cannot accept the advisability of a commission of inquiry. We feel that if sporadic cases of exploitation occur, they should be dealt with departmentally.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Turffontein has obviously made a considerable study of this subject. I thought when the hon. member for Berea introduced this motion that somebody would quite possibly come forward to substantiate the increases in the cost of present-day funerals. I believe that the hon. member for Berea has certainly done a great service to this House and to the country in raising the matter in this House.</p>

<p>I believe that there are many members of the public who are most concerned at the accounts that they receive following a funeral service. As the hon. member for Berea quite rightly pointed out, at times of deep grief relatives are invariably most anxious to ensure that the loved one who died receives the very finest funeral. I believe that on these occasions a certain degree of exploitation from the part of certain undertakers does take place. If the hon. member for Turffontein referred to the motion which was moved by the hon. member for Berea he will see that the hon. member for Berea explicitly refers to the advisability of appointing a commission to examine the extent of such exploitation, if any, etc. Consequently the hon. member for Berea wished to put forward a case to show that he believed that there was to a certain extent exploitation taking place and that the stage had perhaps been reached where the Government should take some action to clear up this matter. The two important words are &#x201C;if any&#x201D;. I am sure it is not intended of the hon. member for Berea to besmirch the undertakers of this country, who obviously perform a valuable service to the community. Obviously the undertakers themselves, who have their national society, can take steps to ensure that exploitation does not take place.</p>

<p>However, it does appear that in certain instances there are undertakers who are exploiting the position, and perhaps the Undertakers&#x2019; Society should take a stronger line and exercise a stricter degree of control in connection with the undertakers and directors of firms who are affiliated to their society.</p>

<p>I do not intend to deal at great length with various points in connection with exploitation which has taken or is taking place in regard to this matter. However, I do feel that as far as the older people are concerned, many of them make provision for their funerals, either by taking out a policy or by means of their own savings. Invariably, when one discusses financial problems of social pensioners and others, one finds that those persons have made some provision to pay for their funeral. Obviously they do not relish the idea of having a pauper funeral and therefore some provision must be made for these people. Here I do believe that a certain degree of exploitation does take place. Invariably one finds that where in the case of an elderly couple the husband or wife passes on and the funeral is to take place in terms of an insurance policy, the survivor. because of advanced age, is not able to ensure that all the conditions of the policy are fulfilled. I feel that many of these older people have been subjected to this exploitation. One finds that the cost of dying is certainly increasing more than the cost of living. The small resources of the deceased spouse are consequently heavily strained because of the funeral expenses. Moreover, certain undertakers find ways and means of charging for extra items which are included in the funeral account. Many of these older people are not competent to analyse and challenge the various items appearing on the account.</p>

<p>I know that it is the intention of the Government. perhaps during this session, to introduce a Bill for the protection of aged persons. Perhaps this is one aspect which could be provided for in the Bill. Of course, we have not seen the Bill because it has not yet been introduced in the House. Be that as it may, many of these older people are then faced with this enormous burden, a burden which in many instances. especially among the lower-income group, reduces the estate of the deceased to a negligible amount. I do feel that these older people are open to exploitation. I have had cases brought to my notice where children of a surviving spouse have taken the matter up with the undertaker concerned. Of course, they always do receive an explanation.</p>

<p><span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0568"/>The question of the explanation is important. The hon. member for Turffontein tried to put forward an explanation of the rising costs of funerals. Perhaps what he said is true to a certain extent. But at the same time there is this fear that some older people are subject to a certain degree of exploitation. We realize that the costs of funerals must over the years have increased. Both previous speakers referred to the position obtaining in the U.S.A. I was interested to read in the latest report of the Advisory Council on Social Security in the U.S.A.&#x2014;published for the year 1965&#x2014;certain data concerning a lump sum death payment in terms of their social security programme. Page 64 of the report contains the following information&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1952 the consumer price index has risen by more than 16 per cent. More significantly, over the same period, the average cost of an adult funeral has gone up by at least 32 per cent.</block>

<p>So you see Sir, the increase in the cost of living is a factor as far as the cost of a funeral is concerned. But at the same time the question is whether a degree of exploitation is taking place and to what extent that exploitation is taking place. The hon. member for Berea mentioned cremation and in this regard there is no doubt that there are many people who have become most concerned when they hear stories, some may be true and some not, of the continual use of a coffin by an undertaker. On one occasion I spoke to a leading undertaker in Durban who gave me the assurance that a coffin was not used on more than one occasion. If a person wished to ensure that it was not used again, he could request that the coffin also be incinerated. However, there are many people who are continually afraid that they are being exploited in that regard. I know of a person who was prepared to sell to the undertakers a type of coffin which would have sold at about R30 and which was made of fibre glass and another material. However, not a single undertaker was interested in using such a coffin although it could result in a considerable saving to the public. The reasons that were given were that in many instances they manufactured their own coffins and consequently were not prepared to purchase coffins. These are matters which can be dealt with by the undertakers themselves and by the Society. The hon. member for Turffontein has a point in this regard. The worrying point is, however, whether exploitation is taking place.</p>

<p>I think that there are other aspects of cremation which have caused concern from time to time. I know of a particular case in Durban where a doctor who had recently come to live in the city was asked to call at an undertaker to sign the necessary certificate. When he called at the undertaker to sign the certificate, he was informed that the body had already been moved to the crematorium and that the funeral had already taken place. He then went to the crematorium to examine the body but on arrival there found that the body had already been placed in the incinerator and been cremated. When he reported back to the undertaker he was informed that he could sign the certificate, that everything was in order and that he would receive his normal fee. This is of course a case where the control of crematoria under the provincial ordinance is the responsibility of the provincial administration. I believe that investigations have taken place from time to time in regard to the administration of the ordinance governing the control and administration of crematoria. There does appear to be a lack of confidence on the part of a large portion of the public in dealing with the charges resulting from funeral services. The other aspect is that many of these people become financially embarrassed due to the fact that they involve themselves in a funeral beyond their means. I believe that this is also an aspect which should be investigated, namely where a funeral is allowed to take place and the relations can then pay the amount off over a certain period. I know too of another practice whereby certain undertakers can make available to older people an advance payment arrangement for their funeral. Thereby they achieve a certain percentage of discount. Here again they are old people who are sometimes encouraged by being told that they can have a funeral which would normally cost R150 if they pay R120 now. Some of these people then die some years afterwards and it is found that a R150 funeral is not by any means an elaborate funeral and in fact due to rising costs it appears that the undertaker is then not required to give the funeral he had contracted to do at the time of selling the funeral for R120.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly, that is the point which concerns many of these people, and particularly the older people, and I am thinking of the lower-income group who feel that their loved ones or they themselves should be well cared for when the time comes for their funeral to be held. There are many of those surviving who are not conversant with the conditions which are laid down and upon which a payment has already been made. I feel that the hon. member for Berea is to be congratulated on bringing up this matter. I do hope that the Government and the Minister who will reply to this motion, will take into account the degree of anxiety that exists in the public mind when it comes to funeral services.</p>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although I do not intend speaking at length I do feel that we are discussing a most important matter this afternoon, and that it is a good thing that the House should be giving attention to it. <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0569"/>When I look at the green benches I feel inclined to say that hon. members have already made very good and adequate arragements for their last journey to the hereafter. If that is not the case, they are feeling very healthy on this Friday afternoon. This is a very important matter because the motion refers explicitly to the lower- and middle-income groups. Those are usually the people who cannot provide for themselves and who do not have the abundant means that we who are sitting on these benches to-day may perhaps have, so that we need not worry that there will be no money the day we die. Those are the people who have no reserves, and it is therefore a good thing that we should give attention to this matter, because those are the people to whom this motion relates. Furthermore, those are also the people who in many cases cannot provide for themselves. I am thinking of the large group of Coloureds, not the developed Coloureds, but the Coloured population of all classes, that go in for funeral insurance nowadays. They are people who in some cases cannot provide for themselves and they are quite incapable of safeguarding themselves against exploitation. I said that it is an important matter we are discussing this afternoon, important to the person who forms the centre of the occasion. I do not actually want to bring it up in that sense, but it is very important to the dear ones of that person who have to bury him. A man may be ever so humble, but if the day arrives when he has to bury those who were dearest to his heart, he wants to pay them the due and proper respects. For that reason I consider this motion most important.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this is not a matter of such limited scope. This is a most important matter in the lives of the people of South Africa. I was surprised when I made enquiries and that virtually half of the White population of this country belong to funeral insurance schemes. Hundreds of thousands of non-Whites also belong to such schemes. Those schemes have assumed such proportions that policies to the amount of almost R4&#x00BD; million are paid annually and that the funeral funds controlled by those companies total more than R18 million. It is not such a small factor in our economic life, but above all it is a very great factor in the lives of people who want to live with the assurance that when they die or when a dear one dies, they need not worry. There can be no funeral undertakings without funeral insurance. These two things are linked virtually inseparably. Speaking of funeral insurance. I do want to tell the mover and seconder of the motion that there is actually no possibility of exploitation in that regard. The most we can do is to make certain suggestions for its improvement.</p>

<p>I should just like to express a few thoughts which occurred to me when I looked at this motion this morning. The first is that in terms of the 1943 Act the maximum amount for which one may take out funeral insurance at present is R200. I want to ask the Deputy Minister to consider&#x2014;he need not necessarily reply to that to-day&#x2014;that since 1943, when this figure was stipulated in the Act, matters have changed a great deal. I want to ask him to consider, furthermore, that insurance even against funeral costs is a form of saving. In our present-day economy we want to encourage saving as much as possible. These people also have to put 10 per cent of their investments into Government bonds, etc. I would, therefore, say, in view of the fact that we have heard here that funeral costs have increased a great deal, which is understandable, that it may perhaps be a very good thing to increase that amount considerably, with a view to people who may want to take out the higher insurance.</p>

<p>There is another matter which we should also reconsider. If one goes in for funeral insurance one pays. I am not going to quote all the tables, but if one has paid from five to seven years and then stops paying, the policy remains valid for a further six months. It then lapses. One then loses all one&#x2019;s money and gets nothing back. If one has paid from 14 to 17 years and then stops paying, the policy remains valid for a further 24 months. If one has paid 25 years or more, a policy, of course, remains valid for a longer period. Normally a funeral insurance policy is fully paid-up after 15 years. If the policy lapses before that time, however, it is valid for only a certain period, and after that the person is no longer covered. That alone would have been worthy of our consideration, but I also noticed in this book this afternoon that in the year ended 30th June, 1965, 138.000 funeral insurance policies were taken out. But 101.874 policies, almost 102.000 policies, lapsed. To me this appears to be a matter deserving of our attention. A tremendous number of policies taken out for funeral insurance lapse and those people lose everything they have paid in. subject, as I said, to the fact that in terms of the 1943 Act such policies remain valid for some months. One wonders whether it is not possible to introduce the concept of a surrender value in respect of funeral insurance as well. I have also noticed that a person who renders funeral services takes out a licence from the Receiver of Revenue. He pays R2 a year for that. I do not know whether that is still the case, but I do think that this should be such an important and high-ranking profession in our lives that it is a ridiculous amount to pay for a licence to render funeral services, which also include insurance services. That is stated explicitly here. It is not only in respect of the undertakers themselves. I shall be grateful if this aspect could receive attention with a view to attaching much greater status and importance to it, so that not anybody who wishes to do so can qualify for this. I appreciate, of course, that as far as the insurance aspect is concerned, the <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0570"/>person is subject to the approval of the Registrar of Insurance.</p>

<p>As far as funeral undertaking is concerned, this is actually a business. As I see it, it is a business in respect of which the undertaker builds up a reputation of which he wants to be proud. If he performs his duties well, he will get business. If he performs them badly, his clients will leave him. The increase in prices had a particularly severe effect on the old policy holders. I could imagine that if a person who paid up his funeral policy 20 years ago is still alive to-day and were to die now, it would be hopelessly inadequate. Perhaps this discussion may also serve&#x2014;and surely the State can do nothing about that&#x2014; to make such people aware, in some way or other, through some report or other of this discussion in the House of Assembly, of the fact that they are not adequately covered for a proper funeral. Perhaps it is up to our members of Parliament to go and tell our voters that those people who have old policies and who paid up their policies quite a few years ago, should go into the matter again because it may just be that when they need the money they will find that it is hopelessly inadequate. If a person dies, the funeral undertaker finds the next of kin at their most vulnerable. People are dumbfounded. A person may be killed in an accident. The people are deeply distressed. The funeral undertaker then asks them: Shall I arrange it in this way? Do you want a better type of wreath, or a poorer type, or this or that? The next of kin, the widow or the small children, then say: Do as you think best. Then the account arrives, and in many cases it is a shock. I do not think the State can do much about that.</p>

<p>We are here dealing with a question which is of such importance in the lives of people that I can only say that we should try to correct the few aspects which we can in fact correct. For the rest, we should inform our voters about this matter. We should discuss it with them, because it is by no means an insignificant matter that we are discussing in the House this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what I have to say is brief, but very much to the point, because I have a few examples I should like to mention. Before proceeding with my remarks, I should like to say that I hope the Minister is going to accent this motion, in view of the fact that the House is unanimous. Everybody has spoken in favour of the motion. Everybody is satisfied that there is a need to look into this matter and that there are aspects of funeral services and the burial of the dead which require investigation and some corrective action. I therefore hope that the hon. the Minister will accept the motion and will have something done about this matter. The big thing is of course that every person, in the lower income groups particularly, in the Coloured and Bantu communities, is terrified of being buried in a pauper&#x2019;s grave. For that reason they struggle with friendly and burial societies payments to ensure that when the end comes for them, they will be laid to rest and that the funeral will be paid for. As has been said, these funeral services have been brought into being. There are burial societies. I want to say that I do not condemn them all, because there are many of them, including some very big ones who run their business properly and fairly. The whole basis of the burial societies is that they prosper on the cancellation of and lapses in policies. That is the whole essence of it. I have here in front of me a booklet together with a letter from a Coloured man. This Coloured man, through his wife, joined a burial society. He paid his contributions for four years and the society then packed up. The family got no money, the State took no action.</p>

<speech by="#member">

<p>The society died.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>It was not cremated but the books were. An offer was then made by an attorney to the members of the society that if they paid RIO each he would institute a civil action. Many of them paid the RIO and the attorney himself has also not taken any action. In many cases a policy lapses after as short a period as four weeks. I do not have to tell you. Sir, that the method of collection is that the agent calls weekly and collects the small contribution of 2 cents or 3 cents or 20 cents, as the case may be, but if he does not turn up to collect, and the policyholder does not make it his business to find out what happened to him and four weeks go by, then the policy may not be re-instated and in many cases it is not re-instated. That is the one aspect. The more serious one is what you might call the cumulative or rolling-effect policy. On the payment of a small sum of money a family can buy one funeral for the stated price. Having paid for that, the agent comes along and then a second one has to be bought and a third one and a fourth one and so it goes on in perpetuity. If the payments lapse on the 4th and 5th, the whole lot fall away. In these two instances alone. I think there is a case for investigation, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will agree that these cases warrant investigation. It is perfectly true, as the hon. member for Queens-town has said, that half the White population in South Africa contribute to these burial societies, and the Coloured people contribute in their thousands. The case made by the hon. member for Berea is a sound and solid one.</p>

<p>Then, of course, there is another aspect which really borders on racketeering, and that is, that when an individual dies and the family approaches an undertaker, who does the job, the burial society then says, &#x201C;Oh, that is not our undertaker,&#x201D; because they have an arrangement whereby they get a discount from their one on the side. If you do not go to the right undertaker they do not pay out so promptly. These people are then told to wait; that the <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0571"/>estate has to be advertised by the Master and that they must wait until the executor or the lawyer has wound up the estate, and then at some distant time in the future the amount is paid over. It is never enough to pay for the funeral; it hardly pays for the coffin. Sir, this is really a subject which is difficult to discuss because one does not want to be light-hearted about it. This is a racketeering business. As the hon. member for Berea has said, there are books which have been written on what is going on in the United States. I think we are well on the way to doing the same sort of thing. I think people are exploited by these burial societies. Old people, especially old ladies, die quite happy if they can say to their children and their family, &#x201C;You need not worry about me; my policy is in order,&#x201D; but when they come to die you find that the policy is not in order; you find that the sum of money paid out is hopelessly inadequate; that it bears no relationship to the cost of the funeral. I believe that the time has arrived when we should face this thing squarely and deal with it in the proper way. Whether the Price Control people are the people to look into it or not I do not know, but I think we must get away from the idea that because the deceased whom we loved, revered and cherished is gone, we are not going to argue. I can tell you quite frankly, Sir, that the bill in certain cases is quite alarming. Because the funeral undertakers think that the family can afford it they stick it on; they charge you for the bit of grass that they put down on the side of the grave to make it look a little bit nicer; they charge you for a bit of fancy stuff on the turf so that the coffin sinks away quietly. One often wonders whether there is any relationship at all between the bill and the capital cost of the material used. I think we should get down to the fundamentals and look at this matter from every angle. I am concerned in the main with the low-income groups, the Coloureds and the Bantu. Other people are interested in other groups. But I do not think there is any shadow of doubt that this matter requires some investigation and action and I hope that the hon. the Minister will take that action to-day.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I also propose to be brief. I wish to draw attention to a few points however. Firstly I wish to emphasize that this motion relates to the lower and the middle income groups. Whilst Parliament cannot always protect people against their own stupidities, the lower and middle income groups are the groups that do need to be particularly protected, sometimes even against themselves, because they are the ones who usually do not have the mental ability to protect themselves as those in the higher income groups are able to do. I believe that previous speakers in this debate have made out a case which does warrant the appointment of a commission to look into this matter. The hon. member for Queenstown has referred to the very large number of people in this country who contribute to burial societies and I do not want to go into that again. He has also referred&#x2014;and I suggest that this alone warrants the appointment of a commission&#x2014;to the large number of lapsed policies. One may wonder why there are not complaints in this regard, and it may be said that because there has not been a large number of complaints made to Government Departments, people are probably not dissatisfied and that therefore there is no need for the appointment of a commission. But I would point out that when you are dealing with persons in the lower and middle income groups, they tend to be gullible; they tend to accept explanations given to them, particularly if they are referred to a clause in their contract with the burial society. Many of them can be misled into believing that these particular clauses cover the funeral undertakers concerned and that therefore there is nothing they can do about it. I would draw attention, in relation to this subject of lapsed policies, to a clause in a contract with a funeral society, dealing with this very subject, and I would suggest that this clause, whilst it may not have been deliberately designed to mislead, certainly must have that effect. The clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The society will endeavour to arrange for a collector to call upon all contract holders but should no such call be made, that fact will in no way excuse contract holders from non-payment, and the holder of the contract shall in such case remit amounts direct to the head office, drawing attention to the fact that no collector has called for same.</block>

<p>One can well imagine what happens in practice. The individuals concerned are told that a collector will call; they may even be told that if a collector does not call, they must still remit, but in the course of time they may get used to the fact that a collector will call; and then if after a few months he fails to do so the policy-holder may well be lulled into believing that the collector will call in a few months&#x2019; time and that in the meantime he need not worry about it. Then after several months he is told that his policy has lapsed: his attention is drawn to the clause and there is nothing he can do about it. Legally the funeral undertakers may be within their rights, but I would stress that when you are dealing with persons in this category they can very easily be exploited in these ways. The hon. member for Berea has draw attention to another form of exploitation which appears to be increasing, and that is that whilst the policy states that the funeral society undertakes to provide a funeral&#x2014;these are the words used&#x2014;when the funeral has taken place the relatives or the deceased estate is presented with accounts for all sorts of extras. I would submit that this is an aspect also which calls for investigation by a commission, because whilst it may be that in terms of the strict wording of the contracts entered into, the funeral societies may be perfectly <span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0572"/>within their legal rights, the fact that the policy suggests to the policy-holder that all the costs of the funeral are to be covered if he goes on paying, there are presumably escape clauses, if I may put it that way, in terms of which these extras are legally justified. That may well be. but the point I make is that the policy-holders are lulled into a false sense of security by being made to believe that their policies will cover all the funeral expenses, and this is not the case. I think one will find that if an investigation is made, it is the rule rather than the exception that even in regard to funerals covered by these benefit policies, accounts come afterwards for extras of one sort or another. This, I believe, should not be allowed. There is something wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein was showing that the costs of funerals have increased over the years. This is admitted. Obviously, with the increase in all other costs, these costs have also increased. But the motion is not directed to the general high cost of funerals, although this is an aspect to which the Government might well give attention. The motion is directed particularly to the possible exploitation and the possible abuses there may be in regard to funerals, and so the hon. member for Turffontein, I believe, has missed the point.</p>

<p>To sum up, I would suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that the evidence which has been presented to the House this afternoon has been of a particularly strong nature and does, in my submission, warrant the appointment of a commission to look into this whole question, particularly in view of the fact that this affects so many people in this country because of the high proportion who contribute to funeral benefit societies.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF POLICE, OF FINANCE AND OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>One would expect everybody to be interested in the topic we are discussing here this afternoon, particularly because it concerns all of us. Indeed, it is not pleasant to come to the end of one&#x2019;s life, but we must all reach that stage sooner or later. A Dutch poet. Antony Staring, wrote the following epitaph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wandelaar die my hier begraven ziet.<br/>As het sterven een kunst was,<br/>Dan lig ik hier niet.</block>

<p>That is, indeed, the position in which all of us find ourselves. But this is an interesting topic in another sense, namely that it also applies to all other countries of the world and all other peoples. This is not a case where one can say that South Africa is unique in this respect or that circumstances are different here. In discussing this topic, we are discussing circumstances which are to be found all over the world. After I had listened to the hon. member for Berea, and especially after I had listened to the hon. member for Karoo, I felt that the first sentence written in the book <i>The American Way of Death</i> might perhaps be very applicable. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh Death, where is thy sting?<br/>Oh Grave, where is thy victory?<br/>Where, indeed?<br/>Many a badly stung survivor, faced with the aftermath of some relative&#x2019;s funeral, has ruefully concluded that the victory has been won hands down by the funeral establishment in a disastrously unequal battle.</block>

<p>It is most certainly not as bad as that here in South Africa. This may, indeed, be the case in other countries of the world&#x2014;such as America&#x2014;which were mentioned here. But of one thing I am very well aware, and that is the circumstances which are attendant upon this business transaction, circumstances which are different from those of any other business transaction. I think we must take this into very serious consideration. The hon. member for Queenstown referred to it. It is an ordinary business transaction, but the circumstances of one of the parties are exceptional circumstances which are not present in the normal course of business. In the first place, as the hon. member for Queenstown observed, the person who has to enter into the transaction is experiencing a measure of shock. I am not referring to insurance, but to cases where arrangements have to be made after the death. He asks himself: &#x201C;What would be the right thing to do? What would the deceased have expected me to do? What does the family expect? Will they perhaps express criticism?&#x201D; Then he arrives at the conclusion that he should arrange a proper funeral. Now. this is the important question: What is a proper funeral? In that respect this matter is largely the concern of the person who is entering into a contract and not that of the Government which has to try to regulate the lives of the people. I realize that the circumstances are difficult. Secondly, the person who is making the arrangements is to a large extent handicapped by ignorance; he does not know about all the things which must be done. It is estimated that an individual only handles a funeral once in every 15 years of his lifetime. It stands to reason that the person who has to make the arrangements is unfamiliar with the circumstances, and he is only too glad if he is able to find somebody who can do it for him. He is not knowledgeable about these matters and he is engaged in a major transaction. You know, they say that in the U.S.A, this is the third biggest single expense in a household. After the purchase of a house and of a car. a funeral is the third biggest household expense over there. I am told&#x2014;and the hon. member for Turffontein has already said so&#x2014;that the cheapest funeral in America costs 708 dollars. That is merely the undertaker&#x2019;s bill. If all the other accessories are added, the bill eventually amounts to approximately 1,450 dollars.</p>

<p><span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0573"/>There is another factor. The person who has to make funeral arrangements must act without delay when a death occurs. Even if we do expect the death of one of our relatives, even if we do know that he or she is suffering from an incurable disease, we are, nevertheless, not inclined to discuss beforehand what will be done and by whom in case a death occurs. That is simply not done. The result is that, when the person dies, the necessary funeral arrangements have to be made in all haste.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Because we all hope the patient will get better.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely. That may perhaps be the reason. In contrast to that, let us take the example of a man who wants to buy a car. He asks for advice everywhere, he waits for a week or a fortnight, once again asks for advice at another place, and so forth. The Ford Company will advise him, for instance, to sound an owner of a Ford motorcar as to the good qualities of that car, and also to drive such a car. But in the case of a death this cannot be done. That is why I am saying that we must realize that exceptional circumstances are present in this case. Because there are exceptional circumstances, people do not complain easily. One feels that after all is said and done one wants to do one&#x2019;s best for the deceased relative. That is why one asks oneself the question whether it would be fair to make a complaint because one has to pay R70 while one only expected to pay R60. One fee&#x2019;s that the impression may be created that one did not want to spend an extra R10 on the funeral of a relative. Those circumstances are present, and I am most certainly taking note of them.</p>

<p>When death comes and arrangements have to be made, the factor which is most important of all in considering such a step is that it is the last tribute which can be paid to the deceased. It has to be a fine funeral. The coffin must not be cheap. I think that that is really the source of the trouble which has given rise to the motion which is before this House to-day. Insurance policies make provision for a coffin of a certain quality. When death comes we find that we should prefer to bury the deceased in a coffin of a better quality. The deceased must be buried in a fine coffin. Perhaps no enquiries are made as to the price. It would, of course, be sensible to ask what the price is. But frequently we do not enquire after the price. The coffin stands there, it must be fine and good, and we merely accept the position without complaining. Unfortunately the shock only comes later when we receive the bill.</p>

<p>Since funeral arrangements have to be made in this manner, the circumstances lend themselves to a large measure of exploitation. I do not want to hold a brief to-day for undertakers, neither do I want to attack them in any respect, because I am not sufficiently conversant with these matters. But I do want to say that in many cases undertakers abuse these exceptional circumstances and derive benefit from them.</p>

<p>Now I want to quote from the <i>National Funeral Service Journal</i> of America, dated August, 1961, to illustrate what I mean. The following brief report appeared in that journal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A funeral is not an occasion for a display of cheapness. It is, in fact, an opportunity for the display of a status symbol which, by bolstering family pride, does much to assuage grief. A funeral is also an occasion when feelings of guilt and remorse are satisfied to a large extent by he purchase of a fine funeral. It seems highly probable that the most satisfactory funeral service for the average family is one in which the cost has necessitated some degree of sacrifice. This permits the survivors to atone for any real or fancied neglect of the deceased prior to his death.</block>

<p>I am reading this report to point out that this atmosphere is created and that undertakers are exploiting this atmosphere in order to make this occasion a greater and more expensive one for those who have to foot the bill. Strangely enough, many people make use of these things. They are susceptible to everything which is offered here. Many books and articles have been written on this topic.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the fact that people are afraid to talk or to complain, even if they were of the opinion that justice had not been done to them. In respect of the complaint about the treatment, I should like to read what Lord Essex said:&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How long, I would ask, are we to be subjected to the tyranny of custom and undertakers? Truly, is it all vanity and vexation of spirit&#x2014;a mere mockery of woe, costly to all. far, far beyond its value, and ruinous to many; hateful and an abomination to all; yet submitted to by all, because none has the moral courage to speak against it and act in defiance of it.</block>

<p>That is true. We may perhaps think that something is wrong; we may perhaps think that the cost is high, but the state of mind of those who remain behind is such that they would rather offer the one who has passed away something expensive, something fine. When everything is over and the bill arrives, it comes as a great shock, and that gives rise to the discussion we have in this House to-day.</p>

<p>But there are also other aspects of the matter, Sir. There is the grave itself. The grave is a separate expense. This item has become an expensive one over the past few years. <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0574"/>As hon members themselves know, land is very scarce in certain European countries, and one can no longer buy a grave there; it has to be rented. In those graves the deceased are hurried in an upright position in order to save space. Such graves are rented for a period of eight or ten years, and after that the bones have to be disinterred and destroyed, because that land is then made available to somebody else. That is why we find that even in our country not only the services of the undertaker, but also graves have steadily become more expensive items.</p>

<p>I should now like to look at our own position here in South Africa. I thought that there might be two possible objections. One of them is in respect of policies and premiums, and the other is in respect of the prices of goods and services. Actually, the hon. member for Berea mentioned only one case, and that is my problem. The hon. member&#x2019;s major objection was that the policy made provision for certain services to be rendered and that the insurance company subsequently failed to render those services. In passing I just want to say that from the nature of the case it is very difficult for a Government to help people to enter into contracts or to help them to see to it that their rights in terms of the provisions of the contract are honoured. Surely, this is not the task of the Government. People should help themselves as far as that matter is concerned. The Government cannot do it for them. The hon. member for Berea himself admitted that. In this case he referred to undertakings, but in discussing the matter he also referred to the question of insurance. As I said earlier on, there are several kinds of policies&#x2014;in this regard I made some enquiries beforehand&#x2014;and their premiums differ from one another. In the policies provision is made for specific coffins to be provided, coffins to the value of a certain amount. But apart from the coffin which is being provided, the following services are also included: fetching and attending to the corpse, registering the death, reserving and paying for the grave, the church, the hearse, the funeral car, and so forth, as the hon. member for Berea more or less read out to us. Often the policy also make provision for the payment of a bonus amount which may in certain cases be as high as R110.</p>

<p>I want to say beforehand that, where there are complaints about a matter such as this, specific cases may be brought to the notice of the price controller. In the second place, both the price controller and the Department of Commerce and Industries are in a position to make proper enquiries into cases where it is felt that an offence has been committed, where it is felt that there may perhaps have been exploitation in regard to the rendering of services or the prices charged for goods. Action can be taken by the price controller. I am saying this beforehand and I want to elaborate on this a little further, particularly in view of the fact that we are dealing here with only one case which was submitted to us by the hon. member for Berea. The hon. member for Umbilo specifically called attention to these words in the motion, namely &#x201C;if any&#x201D;. In other words, we do not know; it is a mere possibility and on the strength of that those hon. members are asking us to incur the expense of instituting a commission of enquiry.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am talking about specific cases. A specific case was mentioned by the hon. member for Berea and the hon. member for Karoo also mentioned one. [Interjections.] I grant that the hon. member is right; the hon. member for Umbilo also mentioned one. In the light of those circumstances, those hon. members would have been been first to criticize the Government about the cost of a commission appointed to enquire into a matter which is so limited in extent. I am saying beforehand that we cannot agree to the appointment of a commission to enquire into this matter. I should like to submit a few other thoughts to the hon. member for Berea in a little while. I gathered some information beforehand and at various undertakings comparisons were made in regard to funeral charges. I am not referring to people who want to practice exploitation, because those who want to do so will always find an opportunity. But under normal circumstances we fail to find any evidence to the effect that exploitation is in fact being practised by respectable undertakers. If there are specific cases, I should very much like them to be brought to my notice, and we shall refer them to the price controller for thorough investigation. In the case of non-policy-holders the services provided are, except for the sale of the coffin, the same as those which are provided in the case of policy-holders. It was brought to my notice that in the case of major undertakers in Pretoria, the coffins were displayed and the prices varied between R10 and R472. They have an extensive range of prices and the prices are displayed. In other words, not only can anybody who is interested see the coffins there, but he can also see what the prices are, and then <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0575"/>he knows beforehand what he has to pay. These are the circumstances prevailing at present. Apart from the coffin which is sold, these services are still available in the case of non-policy-holders. In the case of some undertakers, the services which are provided are charged separately, such as the hearse, and so forth. In other cases these services are included in the price of the coffin. In most cases these major undertakers have subsidiaries which manufacture coffins for them. It has been brought to our notice that the prices of coffins have shown a considerable increase during the past few years. As you would expect, they became more expensive as a result of the increase in the price of timber and of chrome, which is being used to a large extent for adding the finishing touches to coffins, and also as a result of salaries being increased. This also applies to the services which are provided. Even as far as the hearse and the service at the grave are concerned, there has been an increase in price, largely as a result of the increase in wages, but also as a result of the increase in the prices of motor-cars, licences, insurance, fuel, and so forth. I pointed out a moment ago that as far as funeral charges were concerned, there had also been an increase in the price of the graves itself during the past few years. I am told that in Pretoria a grave costs between R17 and R30 and that it is as much as R35 in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that the cause for complaint is to a large extent the fact that a policy is taken out in which provision is made for a specific coffin and certain services, and that subsequently the undertaker does not provide the services or the coffin which, in the opinion of the policy-holder, should have been provided. These are circumstances over which we do in fact have very little control and which should actually be taken care of by the individual himself. In most cases these undertakers are associated with large insurance companies. I want to draw the attention of the hon. members to the fact that undertakers are not the only people who make policies available, but that policies are often made available by insurance companies which, in turn, enter into contracts for the services to be provided at the grave. Another factor which I think is worthy of mention, is that there is a reasonable amount of rivalry in South Africa as far as undertaking businesses are concerned. There is quite a number of them, and in view of the ample scope for rivalry one would not expect there to be any unnecessary exploitation. That is why I want to suggest&#x2014;and I think that is why this discussion has rendered a very good service to-day&#x2014;that when these people take out policies, they should rather determine beforehand what they are going to receive. We can mention a practical example. As we are sitting here to-day, it is very likely that all of us have fire-insurance policies or other comprehensive policies in respect of fire, theft, and so forth. I wonder how many of us have ever read through the conditions of those policies. When we have had a fire or theft in our homes, we examine the policy and then we see that it is not quite correct. This is the cause of a great deal of the evil which gives rise to these complaints.</p>

<p>The machinery does exist. There is a Price Control Act and there is a price controller. If specific cases are brought to our notice, the price controller will make the necessary enquiries and action will be taken when necessary. Hon. members will probably agree with me that the extent of this entire matter is not such that it justifies the cost of a commission of enquiry. As a result of that it is simply not possible.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the points raised by the hon. member for Queenstown and the hon. member for Karoo. The hon. member for Queenstown called attention to two points in particular, points I consider to be of great value. In the first instance, the policy may not be for more than a certain amount, namely R200, which he regards as obsolete at this stage. In the second instance, he referred to the fact that these policies lapsed when payments had not been made for a certain period. As far as those two matters are concerned, I do not think that they will be solved by a commission. These are statutory provisions and the Act will have to be amended. However, these do not really concern exploitation, but statutory provisions. As regards those matters, I want to give the assurance that instructions will be sent to the Registrar of Insurance Companies and that he will be asked to investigate these matters and, if found practicable, to overhaul the Act in respect of these various matters which were mentioned here. I hope that the hon. member for Berea will be satisfied with this discussion and the undertaking I have given. If he or anybody else brings specific cases to my notice or to the notice of the price controller, I can assure him that the necessary enquiries will be made and the necessary steps will be taken.</p>

<p>In terms of your ruling, Sir, I am not able to discuss the merits of the amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper on pages 105 and 106, but I hope that the hon. the Minister and this Committee will bear in mind what is on the Order Paper in dealing with the alternative to that, which is the clause as it stands. Now, also on the Order Paper is an amendment of which the hon. the Minister has given notice that he proposes to insert. That amendment, which I presume is also in order, is to provide that so far as persons who have been convicted of one of the offences listed are concerned, the court may re-admit that person to practise if a certificate is produced, signed by the Minister, to the effect that the Minister has no objection to the admission of such person. This, obviously, namely the amendment proposed by the hon. the Minister and the amendment we have on the Order Paper, and the clause as it stands, reflect better than anything else the difference in approach and attitude between that side of the House and this side of the House. Our attitude is that in these matters the courts should decide. In these matters, where it is a matter of fact as to whether or not a person is a fit and proper person to practise, the proper body to decide is the court, through the judge, and in such a case it would be the full Bench of such a court, with probably two judges sitting to decide whether a person is or is not a proper person to practise.</p>

<p>We should like to know from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he has not yet told us&#x2014;why he thinks he is a better person to judge than a judge and why he is so opposed to the attitude we have adopted and to our amendment. What is there about it that he does not like? Because our proposals are that he and his Secretary or the Attorney-General&#x2014;any one of them&#x2014;should have the power to go to court to ask that someone be struck off the roll because he is not a fit and proper person to practise, because of all the information he has at his disposal. Then, having regard to the merits of that information, the judge can decide. We go even further and say that before anyone shall be admitted, he shall serve notice on the Minister&#x2019;s agencies and they can then examine the matter and appear before court as a party to the application for admission, and put all the information before the court, upon which the judge can then decide. The hon. the Minister has not indicated that he is prepared to accept that, but we would like to know why he is not prepared to do so. One wonders why he wants to use the court at all, because the court becomes merely a conduit pipe for whatever the hon. the Minister wants to do. It is no good the hon. the Minister smiling; it is a most serious matter to use our courts for this purpose, our courts which over the centuries have been charged with determining what the facts are. They know best how to determine the facts; they have been trained over the centuries how to set about determining facts in accordance with rules which have developed over centuries.</p>

<p>How does the hon. the Minister determine the facts? The hon. the Minister is sitting <span class="col_1119-1120" refersTo="page_0577"/>where he is with the power he has simply because he is a member of the Nationalist Party; simply because he is a politician and in determining all the things that he has to do he is motivated by the fact that he is a member of the Nationalist Party, that he is a politician. Surely in the determination of facts as important as these we should use the agencies which over the centuries have been found to be the proper agencies, agencies which have no interest in the matter and which can look at the facts and the merits dispassionately, impartially and judicially. What does the hon. the Minister think he has that the judges do not have? Why is it that he wants to exclude them from this? Quite apart from that, there have been Ministers of Justice before this hon. Minister who did not even know the difference between Swaziland and Bechuanaland, and I am sure that most of our judges do. Why does the hon. the Minister refuse to allow the courts to determine who their own officers shall be? We are dealing here with officers of the court. Surely the hon. the Minister is going to be guided by his security file; he is going to be guided by the information he has. He is not going to call all these persons before him and cross-examine them. How can he have any information to cross-examine them? The only information he has is the information in his files; there is nobody on the other side with different information who can cross-examine those persons whose evidence and information he has to deal with. Surely the hon. the Minister appreciates this. Sir, what interests me is that the hon. the Minister has given notice of an amendment which accepts that at a certain time a person convicted of certain offences, a person who has been listed, may in the fullness of time so have changed his approach to life that he may be considered a fit and proper person to practise. If the hon. the Minister concedes that, as he does in his amendment, then surely the best person to judge who is a fit and proper person to be an officer of the court is the court itself. I want to say to the hon. the Minister in all sincerity that this goes much further than merely the question as to who is going to practise. You are dealing here with a basic constitutional institution, an institution which is basic to our whole constitution; it is basic to our whole attitude to the things that we have been talking about, namely Communism and democracy. Without the courts which we have in this country we have no democracy; without the courts we have in this country we are no different from any totalitarian country. The hon. the Minister is fiddling with that institution; he is fiddling with our courts, and I say that because he is fiddling with the future membership of our courts. Our courts are going to be comprised of senior members of the legal profession. That is the system we have and that is why we have the Bench we have, and, Sir, when the chairman of the General Council of the Bar, speaking in his capacity as the chairman of the Natal Society of Advocates and on behalf of the Natal, the Johannesburg and the Cape Bar Councils, Says that they believe &#x201C;that the effect of the Bill if passed into law may be to inhibit the proper performance by members of the legal profession of their duty fearlessly to present the interests of their clients, no matter how unpopular their clients&#x2019; cause, no matter how powerful or influential the opposition may be&#x201D;, then we are dealing with something far more basic than just whether or not certain individuals should be allowed to practise or not. Why does the hon. the Minister think we have this profession? Why do the advocates and attorneys pursue their clients&#x2019; interests fearlessly in the best interest of this profession? Because they know that their behaviour in the presentation of their clients&#x2019; cases in the courts will be judged by the courts who are not motivated by political considerations. Sir, during the second reading debate the hon. the member for Potchefstroom had the impertinence to say that he would not take instructions in relation to anyone charged with subversive activities. Sir, does that not illustrate exactly what is at stake here? The hon. member will not do it. Why not? Because he is motivated by political considerations; he will not do it because it may reflect on him politically. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply to the hon. member for Durban (North), I just want to move the amendment as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 30 after <i>&#x201C;5quat&#x201D;</i> to insert &#x201C;(1)&#x201D;, and to add the following subsection at the end of the proposed new section <i>5quat:</i><br/>&#x201C;(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection (1), the court may admit any person convicted of an offence referred to in that paragraph if he produces a certificate signed by the Minister to the effect that the Minister has no objection to the admission of such person on account of his having been so convicted.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In his speech the hon. member for Durban (North) of course attacked the principle of this particular clause once again, and that is where we differ. The hon. member wants the court and the court only to decide who may practise. Our attitude is that we should be able to prescribe to the court who may or may not be admitted as advocates or attorneys. We prescribe to the court what qualifications a legal practitioner must have before he can be admitted to the courts to practise, and we are also entitled to prescribe to the court under what circumstances it may not allow certain persons to practise; that is our fundamental premise.</p>

<p>As regards the amendment I have moved, it has been brought to my attention that it may happen that a person who was convicted of one of the offences mentioned in clause 2 changes his views completely in the course of the years, but if the clause remains as it reads at present, such a person can never again be admitted. I felt that that was unfair, and it is <span class="col_1121-1122" refersTo="page_0578"/>for that reason that I am moving this amendment. That relates to persons who have committed offences mentioned in clause 2. As far as listed persons are concerned, the Minister still has the power, if he is convinced that there has indeed been a change in the views of such a listed person, to remove his name from the list, and as soon as his name has been removed from the list, he is free to apply to the court for admission.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked why the decision was not left to the courts; why I, a politician, should make the decision. For the simple reason that I as a politician and the Party to which I belong have decided that we want to destroy Communism root and branch; that is the sole reason. Since neither the Bar Council nor the Law Societies have ever taken action against a listed communist, we feel that the time has now come to prescribe to the courts and to say: &#x201C;In future you may not allow a man to practise in court, one of the best institutions in this country, if he has committed one of the above-mentioned offences.&#x201D; In my Second Reading speech I read a list of the offences to hon. members. These are very grave offences. In the first place the person must be a listed communist. A person is not listed before he has had an opportunity to be tried. He can take his case to court and prove to the court that his name has been listed wrongfully.</p>

<p>Then there is the other group which consists of people who have been convicted of furthering the objects of Communism. From the outset hon. members on the opposite side have told me that they are as much opposed to Communism as we are. In this case the person concerned has been convicted of furthering the objects of Communism. He has been convicted of that. In other words, he has been before the court.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Nobody is complaining about that? The entire argument of the hon. member for Durban (North) related to that. The second offence is that he has advocated, furthered, advised, defended or encouraged any of the objects of Communism. Hon. members on the opposite side have told me that they are as much opposed to Communism as hon. members on this side of the House. After the man has been tried and convicted of advocating, furthering, advising, defending or encouraging Communism, then only will he be prohibited in terms of this measure from practising. Then only will the court be instructed not to accept him.</p>

<p>The third offence is that while resident in or outside the Republic he advocated, advised, defended or encouraged the use of force, with the assistance of a foreign government or organization, to bring about a change in the political, industrial, social or economic pattern in the Republic, or that he thus furthered any of the objects of Communism. Do you feel that that is the type of person who should practise in our courts? A man who called for foreign assistance to bring about a change in the political, economic or social structure of our country? Is that the kind of man we should allow to practise in our courts? I say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. We cannot allow that.</p>

<p>The fourth offence is that while resident in the Republic, he underwent training or consented to undergo such training, or encouraged or procured someone else to undergo such training, or obtained any information which may be instrumental in realizing the objects of Communism or of an illegal organization. Hon. members tell me that they are just as much opposed to Communism as we are. If that is the case and we come across this type of man, and this type of man is tried and convicted by a court, then I say that he is not a proper person to practise in our courts. That is the reply. There is no further dispute. It is not that I, as a politician, would pretend to be cleverer than a judge, but those people have had a fair chance. The Opposition agree with us that they are also opposed to Communism, just as we are. These four offences that have been committed are clearly communistically orientated offences. They should be contented that we prohibit this type of person. Now I said that all that is wrong with this provision is the point made by the hon. member for Transkei, namely that once a man has been convicted, it is for good. Then he is done with for good; after that he dare not practise again. Therefore I want to make this concession. I think the Opposition should receive it with acclamation. They should not argue against it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister, when he said the other day that he was going to bring forward this amendment, said that it was as a result of a point I had made in the previous debate, namely that once an attorney or barrister was convicted of an offence, he could never repent or reform. He would be excluded from practising. The Minister said that he realized afterwards that it was a fair criticism to make and therefore he was going to introduce this amendment. Naturally, we accept the amendment. He need not worry about that. What we do resent is the attack that the Minister has made on us <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0579"/>on the grounds of supporting Communism. The Minister says that we say that we on this side of the House are opposed to Communism just as the members on that side are. We say it because we mean it. It is true. They know very well that it is true.

<p>The Minister, in pursuing that argument, said that if that was so, he wanted to know why we were opposed to the prohibition of certain types of communists who commit offences listed in this Bill. He proceeded to read out the offences as set out in this amendment. They are serious offences. We supported the legislation making those particular offences punishable at law because we will have no truck with people who commit that type of offence. The Minister now very cleverly says that because we want the court to decide whether a man must be struck off the roll or not, we are not opposed to people of this nature, criminals, practising in our courts. When we moved our amendment at the Second Reading, we took the line and made it quite clear that commission of offences of this nature should be grounds for excluding a practitioner. We made that quite clear. If the hon. the Minister reads the amendment on the Order Paper which was to be moved by my colleague, the hon. member for Durban (North), he will see that we give an instruction to the courts that they shall regard these offences &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not wish to deal with that amendment any more. I merely referred to it in reply to the Minister. The Minister himself realizes that the mere commission of an offence of this nature is not sufficient to exclude a man from practising. That is why he has moved this amendment, which we are asked to support, which entitles him to give a certificate to a person convicted of the offence, saying that he has no objection to his practising. That is the line which we have taken, namely that although a man may have committed an offence of this nature, as set out in the Bill, he may have repented.

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister some practical difficulties which I see in the details of this particular provision. I want to do so as a practical lawyer because when one looks at the mechanics of the provisions which we are now legislating, we find that clause 2 provides that no person shall be admitted by the court unless such person has satisfied the court that his name does not appear on any list and that he has not been convicted of certain offences. Until he does so he shall not practise. No person shall admit to practice any person who is unable to satisfy the court on those prerequisites. How would this be done in practice? How would this be done under this section which is being inserted in the Act of 1950? It seems to me that it would be done by a statement by an applicant applying for admission to the Bar or Side-Bar. He would apply and say, &#x201C;I am not a listed person and I have not been convicted of any of these <span class="col_1125-1126" refersTo="page_0580"/>offences.&#x201D; He would attest to this in his petition. Now where does the responsibility to verify this statement in terms of the legislation which is now before us? As the hon. the Minister said at the commencement of this debate, neither the Bar Council nor the Law Society wish to have this provision introduced into their controlling legislation. No responsibility rests on either of them to investigate the allegation contained in the petition. There is certainly no responsibility on every Judge of the Supreme Court or every Registrar of the Supreme Court in terms of any law to maintain for all time lists of listed persons or lists of persons who have previous convictions with an obligation to check a petition against those lists. One can for instance take the example of an individual who ten years after a conviction or ten years after listing and who is a professed communist but who has laid low for ten years, then proceeds to court and makes an application for admission to the Bar or Side-Bar. He obtains a letter typed on the Department of Justice letter-head to confirm that he is not a listed person. He has this in his possession. He then presents a petition to the court asking for admission. Whose responsibility is it to investigate whether or not that man is entitled to admission? I return to what the hon. the Minister has said, and to this difficulty in interpreting the details, namely that he imposes no responsibility on either the Bar Council or the Law Society. The papers are not served on the Secretary for Justice. The application for admission is not served on the Attorney-General. There is no provision for that. They are served merely on the societies and lodged with the Registrar. What is more, on the assumption that a person in these circumstances obtains his admission to the courts, who is then to remove him? He is entitled to practise until such time as the Secretary for Justice under this particular section applies to the court to have him removed at some time in the future. What happens during that period? He incurs no penalties whatsoever. This is legislation in a vacuum. There are no penalties for a man who has obtained his admission to the Bar or the Side-Bar in that way. There is no provision here for a penalty and as soon as he finds that somebody is on his track he will do a Wolpe or a Goldreich and disappear out of the clutches of the police.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I have studied this clause as best I can to find how one would apply the provisions before us. It is all very well legislating to-day when the hon. the Minister can read out the list of 18 people, most of whom have disappeared already, and the Secretary for Justice can apply to have them removed from the roll. But what happens in ten years&#x2019; time? Some young man who might now be on the list of the Defence and Aid Fund or some such body will in ten years&#x2019; time apply for admission to the Bar. He will by then have finished his university education. He will have lain low and have not practised Communism in the meantime. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that at the most such an applicant might face a perjury charge in that he has attested to something in his petition which is false. But if he has been presented by some conspirator with a faked letter ostensibly from the Department of Justice stating that he is not on the list, confirmed by a name signed at the bottom, and he produces that at the perjury trial, will he suffer any penalty? I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that as I am not permitted to talk about amendments which are unacceptable, and I do this in all sincerity, that he looks at pages 105 and 106 of the Minutes of Proceedings and he will find some way in which this Bill might be amended in the Senate or he might withdraw this provision before it is passed by this House and thus make practical legislation and not enact provisions which have no effect whatever. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell me whose responsibility it is to verify a petition at the present time and to see whether there is a contravention of this section.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, having listened to the hon. member of the Opposition who spoke on this matter, I was struck, firstly, by the fact that the hon. member who has just sat down spoke about a lack of what he called the &#x201C;mechanics to put this Bill into operation&#x201D;, while the hon. member who spoke just before him complained that the discretion was being taken away from the courts. I should just like to say something in this regard. The clause states explicitly that the person has to satisfy the court. Do we want to prescribe to the court the &#x201C;mechanics&#x201D; of this process of satisfying itself, because there would then surely remain nothing of the court&#x2019;s discretion? I think we would do well to come back at this stage to the crux of the matter, which the hon. the Minister has also emphasized. The crux of the matter is that this House has accepted the principle and has found that it is the will of this House and the will of the people that persons who commit these offences and whose names appear on these lists may not be qualified to practise in the legal profession. There has in fact been abundant proof of that, because the people and we believe that such persons can and will abuse that position to further Communism. That is the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>We now find that three categories are proposed in the amendment of the hon. the Minister, as it is before the House. As the Minister has pointed out, three possibilities of being removed from the list are open to the listed man, i.e. either by the liquidator, or by instruction of the Minister, or by court action. We therefore have the listed persons, the convicted persons who have had a full trial and, thirdly, those people whom the hon. member for Musgrave called &#x201C;a genuine case of reformation&#x201D;. The latter are now also covered. Persons in all these categories, who may have experienced difficulties, are now fully covered. Now we must ask a question. All the Opposition&#x2019;s objections have been met here. At the <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0581"/>Second Reading they said that their essential objection was to this section, and that it had not been met. It is a pity that we cannot discuss certain pages of the Minutes now, and that we cannot debate the merits of the amendment that was moved. I should have liked to do so. But we must point out that what is expected of the court, in terms of the provision, is that it should satisfy itself.</p>

<p>The task of the court is therefore to implement the prescriptions of this House of Assembly and of Parliament as a whole, but not through the loss of its discretion. Therefore the court must simply satisfy itself by taking cognizance of certain facts which the Parliament of this country regards either as a qualification or as a disqualification. The court must therefore exercise its discretion in satisfying itself. It must therefore weigh these facts. These are facts which must be weighed, namely whether the man was guilty of these offences, whether he was listed and whether he has the certificate from the Minister. When we come to those basic principles and when the Opposition allege that they are on our side in the battle against Communism, and when we recall that during the Second Reading the hon. member for Transkei claimed for the Opposition the title &#x201C;watchdogs of the nation&#x201D;, then I want to put a question to these watchdogs. I want to ask hon. members the question whether we are not now dealing with watchdogs which are merely prepared to bark, but which are too scared to bite the communist for fear of hurting him. That is the fundamental difference between us. We on this side are prepared to get a grip on communists in the legal profession by means of this section. But hon. members on the opposite side are prepared to hide behind the defence of &#x201C;please, courts, relieve us of our political responsibility, help us to get away from our political responsibility. Please, courts, will you not do our work for us?&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, most of the debate on this clause up to now has largely been devoted to convicted persons, namely persons who have been convicted of any of the specific crimes under section 11 (a), (b), (b)<i>bis, ter</i> or (c). Not so much, however, has been said by the hon. the Minister about those persons whose names appear on any list. I want to devote myself to that detail of this clause, without arguing the principle of whether or not the court shall decide who shall be admitted or not be admitted to practise at the Bar or the Side-Bar.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister why he has included this category of people at all in this clause. Because, Sir, it seems to me that if one examines in any detail the type of offence of which a person must actually have been convicted in a court of law under the latter part of the clause, the Minister was intending to make the restrictions of this particular clause really pertain to persons who had been convicted of a fairly serious crime under the Suppression of Communism Act. The Minister has read out a list of crimes mentioned in this particular clause. But now he also includes in this clause persons whose names appear on any list under section eight. I want to ask him whether he is not linking together classes of people in quite different categories of gravity of crimes committed under the Suppression of Communism Act, and whether he would not consider omitting from this clause altogether the persons on the list and simply confining it to people who have actually been convicted in a court of law of crimes under section eleven of the Suppression of Communism Act. I do not think that I will be out of order, and I ask your ruling, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The reason why I move this amendment is because the listing part of this particular clause goes very far indeed. The part that relates to persons actually convicted under the anti-Communist Act does at least have the grace to say that the person has appeared in a court of law and been given a chance to defend himself and he also knows exactly what he is charged with. But as far as listed persons are concerned, the only protection that they have under section 4 (10) of the Suppression of Communism Act is that the name of a person shall not be included in any such list or in any category mentioned in the list unless he has been afforded a reasonable opportunity of showing that his name should not be included therein. It is true that such a person is given an opportunity of showing that his name should not be included in the list. But the list itself goes very far because it enables the Liquidator to compile a list of persons who are, or who have at any time&#x2014;again retrospective&#x2014;before or after the commencement of this Act, been not only office-bearers or officers or members of an organization which subsequently is declared an illegal organization, but even if they have been active supporters of such an organization. There must have been many lawyers&#x2014;because fortunately they do not all adopt the attitude of the hon. member for Potchefstroom&#x2014;who supported a banned organization like the Defence and Aid Fund, believing it to be a perfectly legal organization which assisted in the defence of people accused of certain crimes. Unlike the hon. member, there were lawyers who, even if they were not prepared to take on cases to defend such people&#x2014;and unfortunately there were many lawyers who refused such cases&#x2014;were nevertheless prepared to give something, a subscription, in order to enable this organization to carry on.</p>

<p>Now it means that any person who actually gave such money is or was in fact an active supporter of an organization which was subsequently declared to be illegal, and may have the opportunity of presenting himself before the hon. the Minister, but he could not prove that he did not in fact support such an organization. Therefore this is much more far-reaching in its implications than the section of the clause dealing with persons convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act. I want to go further. This is also the intimidatory part of the clause, because it means that in future every lawyer or would-be lawyer&#x2014;because it would also relate to law students&#x2014;would have to think twice before supporting any political organization at all, in the fear that some time in the future that perfectly legal political organization could be declared illegal. [Interjections.] Oh yes, this could happen. I wish I could be as confident in regard to the intentions of the Government as the hon. member behind me is, but I am not. I know that there can be organizations which subsequently can be declared to be illegal, and which in retrospect could jeopardize the future of every practising lawyer and every intending law student who supported them, and therefore it must inhibit him from taking part in such activities.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, when he was speaking this afternoon, made a most important statement on the subject of a listed person&#x2019;s right of appeal to the courts. It is a most important statement <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0583"/>and I want to deal with it now in some detail because I believe that the hon. the Minister is quite wrong in the statement he made to the Committee this afternoon, and being wrong on such an important matter amounts to a very serious misrepresentation, although I accept that the Minister did not do so deliberately.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member cannot use the word &#x201C;misrepresentation&#x201D;. He was ordered to withdraw it by the Speaker last week, and the hon. member must withdraw it now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>If you order me to do so, I withdraw the word and I would then say that he has misinterpreted the legal position to this Committee. The hon. the Minister led this Committee to believe that if a person has been placed on a list and he has applied to the Minister to have his name removed and the Minister has refused to do so. that man can then appeal to the courts. This is what he said, and the Minister now nods his head confirming that this is what he said. He can appeal to the courts. Let us get this quite correct. An appeal, as opposed to a review, amounts to a re-hearing. In other words, the listed person can then call upon the Minister to justify the fact that he is kept on that list. Now I challenge the Minister to tell the Committee in terms of what section or sections a listed person has a right of appeal to the courts to be removed from the list. I challenge him to disclose that section and I suggest that the hon. the Minister is quite wrong, because there is no such right of appeal. At the very most, a listed person has no more than a right to apply to the courts on review. The right of review is something quite different from the right of appeal, because under a review the court is not entitled to go into the merits. In other words, the court is not entitled to decide whether or not that person should be on the list. All that the court can decide in a review is whether or not the person whose decision is being challenged, namely in this instance the Minister, has acted <i>mala fide</i> or <i>bona fide.</i> This is an extremely limited right because it is virtually impossible for anyone to prove that an official, acting under such powers, has acted <i>mala fide.</i> So, to suggest that a listed person who has appealed to the Minister and who has been rejected is protected because he has the right of appeal is, in my submission, quite wrong, and I trust that the Minister will clarify this statement, not only for the benefit of this House but also for the benefit of the persons concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>In maintaining the Government&#x2019;s attitude to the clause as it stands, subject to the amendment moved by the Minister, the Minister emphasized that a listed person had this right of appeal, suggesting that he had this very important protection. This was one of the important grounds upon which the Minister maintained the Government&#x2019;s stand in regard to this clause. For that reason I respectfully submit to you. Sir, that I should be given the right to deal with this in detail. However, I have made my submissions and I do not want to take them any further.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with another point raised by the hon. the Minister. The Minister stated that during the Second Reading we on this side of the House had made our position quite clear in regard to Communism; we stated that we were as strongly opposed to Communism as the Government is, and he then went on to say that this being the case he could not understand why we maintained our objection. Sir, the reason is quite simple. We are adamant in our attitude that an avowed Communist is unfit to practise in our courts and that therefore this ought to be ground upon which a judge should exercise his discretion. But the important point of difference between the Government and us is as to who is going to decide who is a Communist or who is not. In our submission, it is quite wrong that the decision should be taken by the hon. the Minister or by an official.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I abide by your ruling, Sir. I now wish to go on to the point made by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus to the effect that all the objections of the Opposition fall away by reason of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. This, of course, is quite incorrect for two reasons. The <span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0584"/>amendment moved by the hon. the Minister has no bearing at all, firstly, on this question as to who shall decide who is or who is not a communist and, secondly, the hon. member for Odendaalsrus says that it will deal with the objection which I personally made that persons who have genuinely reformed should be able to approach the courts to be reinstated. He says that this in fact can now be done. But I would draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that a person in that category who has genuinely reformed can only apply to the court if he can get a certificate from the Minister. In other words, the power still remains in the hands of the Minister, and if the Minister refuses there is no right of appeal. So our objections are not met at all by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. I concede that the amendment is a slight improvement on the clause as it stood before, but it certainly does not meet the objections which we on this side of the House have raised to this clause. For all these reasons we are still very much opposed to this clause and we will vote against it.</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to deal with only one point raised by the hon. member who has just sat down. The hon. member says that there is no recourse to the courts of law against the decision of the liquidator.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>No right of appeal against his decision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer the hon. member to the case of Gool v. the Minister of Justice, 1965 C.P.D., in which it was clearly held that there must be a full investigation of all the facts before a court will come to a decision. Like the hon. member I too thought at first that it was merely a matter of review, as we all understand that word, but I went into the matter and found that in Gool v. the Minister of Justice a full Bench of the C.P.D. decided that there must be a full investigation into all the facts on which the liquidator came to the decision and that the court then had a duty to make a fresh finding as to whether the liquidator&#x2019;s decision was correct or not. It is quite correct that there is an onus on the listed person. The Act shifts the onus, because the listed person must show why his name should not be on the list, but he has full recourse to the courts and every right to adduce evidence to show why he should not be listed, and it will then be the duty of the liquidator to place the evidence at his disposal before the court so as to enable the court to judge whether the person&#x2019;s name should remain on the list or not. The hon. the Minister was quite correct therefore in saying that there is recourse to the courts. Admittedly there is a shifting of the onus but the listed person has a full opportunity of bringing the facts of his case to the notice of the court.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I can remember the hon. the Minister did not mention an appeal, and if he did mention an appeal, he was quite probably referring to section <i>8bis</i> (iii) of the Act. In my humble opinion section <i>8bis</i> (iii) provides that a listed person shall be entitled to bring an action against the Minister for the removal of his name from the list within 12 months. That is not an appeal against the listing of his name, of course. He may then institute an action against the liquidator.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But the Minister said that was not an appeal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>It virtually amounts to an appeal. There is a difference as far as the onus is concerned, and I want to make the very point that the reason why this section provides that a person shall have the right to bring an action against the liquidator is to place the onus on him and to force him to give evidence. In other words, a listed person has the right to go to court if he is dissatisfied with the fact that his name is listed.</p>

<p>Then I just want to refer briefly to the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member expressed the opinion that it is possible for a person who is quite innocent to be listed. If that is the case, he is fully entitled to submit reasons to the liquidator why his name should not appear on the list. I want to put it this way to the hon. member for Houghton: Let us presume a person is innocent and will be able to prove his innocence to the liquidator. The hon. member for Houghton may not share my confidence, but I am fully confident that in such circumstances, where the innocence of the person is established, the liquidator will not put his name on the list. But he can go even further. Let us presume for the moment that a person&#x2019;s name has been put on the list and that he did not avail himself of his right, within the prescribed time, to submit reasons why his name should not have been placed on the list. He may then still apply to the Minister for the removal of his name from the list. Let us presume a person really was innocent. I am fully confident that if his name was placed on the list in error or by accident and he asks the Minister to remove his name and is able to prove his innocence to the Minister, his name will be removed from the list. But let us go further. Let us presume, for example, that the listed person is a person like the hon. member for Houghton, and has no confidence in the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely that is part of the clause; that is how a person&#x2019;s name is listed. I am merely explaining to the Committee how such a person&#x2019;s name may be removed from the list.</p>

<p>As regards the organization, the hon. member for Houghton should not forget that an organization which is declared an unlawful organization is one which is furthering the objects of Communism. In other words, when a person is listed he has through his actions, not merely in his mind, but through his actions, supported a communistic organization, and that is why his name was placed on the list. That is the position in terms of the Act; the organization concerned must be an organization which furthered the objects of Communism. Mr. Chairman, if one has regard to all these matters, this clause is quite in order and the individual has ample opportunities to safeguard himself from any injustice.</p>

<p>Then I just want to refer to what was said here by the hon. member for Green Point, who spoke of &#x201C;the mechanics of the Act&#x201D;. It is quite clear that when the court has to satisfy itself as regards a person&#x2019;s application for admission as an advocate, the court must ask at once whether documents have been served on the Secretary for Justice, because the Secretary for Justice has an interest in the matter; the Secretary for Justice is the person who will be able to say whether an offence in terms of the Act has been committed and whether the person concerned has been listed. Therefore the documents will necessarily have to be served on the Secretary for Justice, and thus the court will have all the facts before it to be able to ascertain whether or not the person&#x2019;s application should be granted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister seems determined to maintain the powers that this clause will give him, powers which the court formerly exercised, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will give us some indication as to how he proposes to exercise the power which he seeks in terms of the amendment which he has proposed to the Committee (which we did not deal with during the Second Reading because it was not part of the Bill) and whether he will indicate to us just how he is going to decide whether a person who has been convicted of an offence&#x2014;one of the offences he has read out to us in great detail&#x2014;has suddenly become a fit and proper person to practise either as an advocate, an attorney, a notary or a conveyancer. We should like to know what sort of principles the hon. the Minister is going to apply. In the past the courts have held that they have the power, in dealing with such matters as whether a person is a fit and proper person, not only to deal with his professional misconduct. The hon. the Minister is not going to be concerned here with professional misconduct at all. He is going to be concerned with the question of a person who has been convicted of an offence and who has become a person who is not a fit and proper person because of the commission of this offence. He is then going to decide when and how he becomes a fit and proper person to practise in the profession.</p>

<p>In the case of Matthews against the Cape Law Society, in a Cape provincial decision, reported in South African Law Reports, 1956, Vol. I, on page 807, the Judge President of the Cape approved of the statement of Lopes, Lord Justice, in an English case, as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">It appears to me that to hold that the jurisdiction of the court to strike off the roll extends only to professional misconduct and neglect of duty as a solicitor would be placing too narrow a limit on that most salutary disciplinary power that the court exercises over its officers. To my mind the question which the court in cases like this ought always to put to itself is this: Is the court, having regard to the circumstances brought before it, any longer justified in holding out the solicitor in question as a fit and proper person to be entrusted with the important duties and grave responsibilities which belong to a solicitor?</block>

<p>This is very important. As the Minister will appreciate, this is the power the court has even to-day. The Lord Justice continued:</p>

<block name="quote">Now, that case (he was referring to some other case)&#x2014;to say nothing of the others that have been brought to the notice of the court&#x2014;places it beyond doubt that the jurisdiction of the court extends, not only to the case where the misconduct has been connected with the profession of the solicitor, but also to cases where the conduct, though not so connected, has been such as to make it clear to the court that that person is no longer fit to be held out as a fit and proper person to exercise the important functions with which the court entrusts him.</block>

<p>This is the test. What is going to motivate the hon. the Minister? It seems to me as though he is going to have two decisions to make. The first one is to entertain the thought that such a person should be relieved of the pressures which are present upon him. Probably he will be on the list in any event. The hon. the Minister said in relation to the list that if the person has a change of heart, he will take him off the list. The person has to have a change of heart, presumably, and also he has to be a fit and proper person to practise. When the hon. the Minister moved his amendment, he did not indicate to us on what sort of basis <span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0586"/>he was going to exercise this power. We should like to hear from the hon. the Minister exactly what it is that he proposes. This is rather important. I do not think we can ever forget, in dealing with this subject, what the three major Bars of the country have to say in their joint statement about the inhibition of the proper performance of the duties of members of the profession. Members of the profession to-day, in terms of what I have just read, know that the court will or will not strike them off according to whether their behaviour was such as befitted or did not befit a member of the profession. Because of that, they were able fearlessly to conduct their affairs. They were able fearlessly to conduct the affairs of their clients. The public knew that they could employ a lawyer and that he would fight to the end for the justice of their cause.</p>

Their names could be removed from the list only if they turned to me and if I as Minister deemed it proper&#x2014;as we have deemed it proper in three cases&#x2014;to accede to their request. The three cases to which I am referring are those of advocate Findlay and the two Snitchers, the attorney and the advocate. If we adopted that line of thinking such persons could no longer be removed. They would then be entitled to remain for ever. They were the arch-enemies. These 16 people were the arch-enemies and the greatest supporters of subversion. If we accepted her line of thinking it would mean that they would remain on the list for good and for ever, and that it would be possible for them to practise at any time, except in three cases. They have committed an offence. Nelson Mandela committed an offence. Nokwe committed an offence and Arenstein committed an offence. In the other cases the people did not commit offences. They were listed communists. If we accepted that line of thinking, they would remain there for good and for ever.</p>

<p>Would the hon. the Minister tell me something about the others? This is what worries me. There are two types of listed persons concerned in this particular clause. There are people listed as communists and people who might be listed because they were at one time or another supporters of what was a legal organization when they supported it, and subsequently became an illegal organization.</p>

<p>I have already included the name of one of them in the fist of 16 names. That one is Mr. Alexander Hepple.

<p>No, there is not another one. In future further organizations may be declared unlawful. The Defence and Aid Fund was declared unlawful and its position is now subject to appeal. It does not necessarily follow that a list has to be drawn up. I say it does not necessarily follow. Various other organizations have been declared unlawful. The P.A.C. and the A.N.C. were declared unlawful, and in their cases no lists were drawn up. A liquidator will be appointed and a list drawn up only in the case of those which were essentially communistic under some other name, such as the Congress of Democrats.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It also applies to that, but not necessarily. It could apply to that.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, to reply to the hon. member for Durban (North) is rather difficult, because he jumped about a good deal. If I understood him correctly, he asked what my procedure was going to be in the case of a man who has suddenly turned away from Communism. I can assure the hon. member that that will not happen suddenly. It will have to happen over a very long period. He will have to prove over years that he has changed his convictions and changed his evil ways. Then we may have <span class="col_1139-1140" refersTo="page_0587"/>the case of the man who experiences a sincere change of convictions and who perceives that his former ways were wrong. In such a case, despite the fact that he had been convicted, I would not for my part prevent him from applying to the court. Whether the court will then admit him &#x201C;as being a fit and proper person&#x201D; rests with the court. That is no concern of mine. My concern extends only as far as the restriction that I place on the court. I have eliminated that.</p>

<p>I do not think there are any further matters to which I have to reply except, as the hon. member for Sunnyside pointed out, that if we look at section 8<i>bis</i> which provides, in the Afrikaans text, &#x201C;die juistheid van &#x2019;n lys word vermoed&#x201D; and in English &#x201C;the correctness of a list is presumed&#x201D;, then, in subsection (3) of section 8<i>bis</i>, one finds the following stipulation: &#x201C;proceedings in any court for the removal of the name of any person from any list referred to in subsection (2) shall be instituted by way of action only.&#x201D; That institutes the action. The action is instituted against the liquidator. Section 8, subsection (3), reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may upon good cause being shown direct that the name of any person appearing on any such list be removed therefrom.</block>

<p>It is in view of this provision that I said that in future the person who changes his ways will be able, in the first place, to submit his case to the liquidator, and in the second place he will be able to appeal from the liquidator to the court, and in the third place he will be able to appeal to the Minister. I think that answers all the questions from the opposite side.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now been told that this, right of appeal about which the hon. the Minister spoke, is embodied in section 8<i>bis</i> (3). But this, with respect to the hon. the Minister, does not give any right of appeal. This is precisely the point which I was making. All that there is a right to take the decision on review on the grounds purely of <i>male fide.</i> The proceedings must be instituted by way of action but the point is that this is merely the method by which you bring it before the courts. There is absolutely nothing in section 8<i>bis</i> which gives such a person a right of appeal. Not one single word in section 8<i>bis</i> deals with a right of appeal.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, addressing you on a point of order, my submission is that the hon. the Minister and two subsequent speakers have laid great stress on the fact that a listed person is not prejudiced because he can go before the courts and have the question of his listing tested and if he is wrongly listed, he can be removed. With respect, Sir, this is a very important point. It is fundamental to the whole of this question of the rights of a listed person and it is of the utmost importance that this Committee should be satisfied as to precisely what are or are not a listed person&#x2019;s rights in respect of approaching the courts, because if the hon. the Minister and Government members are incorrect in their interpretation, then a listed person does not have the rights which the Government contend he has. I persist in saying to this House that section 8<i>bis</i> does not give a right of appeal. There is no mention whatsoever in section 8<i>bis</i> of an appeal. All that it says is that if a person wishes to approach a court to have his name removed from the list he must do so within 12 months. Subsection (3), to which the hon. member opposite referred, merely provides that this must be done by way of action. As I see the position section 8<i>bis</i> remains quite clear and gives no more than a right of review which means that the decision can be disturbed only if there has been <i>male fides</i> on the part of the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, accordingly agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask that my vote be recorded against this clause. I shall do so because this is just another one of those provisions which place an undue burden of proof on the accused. The onus of proof of innocence is on the accused. I object to that in principle and therefore I am going to vote against this clause.</p>

<p>Under this clause a person who is accused of communicating with a listed or restricted person will be presumed to have known that such person with whom he is communicating is indeed either listed or restricted, and that this listing or restriction has been gazetted. I want to point out the practical difficulties of this provision. The anti-Communist Act has been in operation since 1950. It has been extended as far as the scope of its operation is concerned by about 80 amending clauses. The number of listings and restrictions is now between 600 and 700 according to the latest figure which the hon. the Minister gave me last week. Although one has the over-all aggregate of the number of people who have been listed or restricted under the Suppression of Communism Act, there has not been a consolidated list gazetted for a number of years. In fact, the last time I asked that this be done, I was given the information by the then Minister of Justice that there was no intention of providing a further consolidated list in the <i>Gazette</i> in the immediate future. This means that unless one has kept a careful check on every name which has been gazetted since the original consolidated list was supplied, i.e. names have been added to the list and removed from it, it is virtually impossible for anyone at this moment to know exactly who is and who is not on the restricted list. Therefore I say it is a very grave hardship indeed to people who will have to prove their innocence in the face of these additional difficulties. Therefore I do not think this is a fair clause. I do not think it gives anybody the opportunity of establishing his innocence and so I wish to record my objections to this clause, and I will vote against it.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to (Mrs. H. Suzman dissenting).</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to ask the hon. the Minister why he has inserted subsection (2) of this clause. In terms of it the State President or the Administrator of South-West Africa, as the case may be, may exercise the power referred to in subsection (1) without prior notice to any person. Has the Minister had any difficulty in applying the subsection in the past, and whom would he have to give notice to? I shall be glad if the Minister will explain it to us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I object to this clause as well. I will admit right away that this clause is somewhat of an improvement on the version which was presented to us last year and with which we did not proceed at the time. There is an improvement in regard to one or two of the provisions, in terms of which a person who is convicted could be deported, and these have not been included in this new version. I am grateful for that, because I have learned to be thankful for small mercies in this House. Of the two subsections omitted, one related to the failure to comply with the notice and to report to a police station at specific times, and the other is in regard to anyone who without the consent of the Minister publishes any statement, etc. by a person prohibited from attending any gathering. Those are improvements to the original clause, but there is still one very strict provision which has been left in the clause, and that is the one which makes it possible for a person to be deported, if he is not a South African citizen by birth, if such a person has been convicted under the Suppression of Communism Act because he still has in his possession anything which shows that he was at any time a member or supporter <span class="col_1143-1144" refersTo="page_0589"/>of an organization which is now a banned organization. I cannot imagine why this is included in the clause at all. The other offences mentioned in the clause are fairly serious, but to me this is a very petty offence indeed, that someone may through an oversight simply display on a desk something or other which shows that he was at any time a member or a supporter of a banned organization. I think this goes very far indeed, and the penalties are extremely severe. To be deported is a very severe punishment indeed, and therefore I wish to record my objection to this clause and I shall vote against it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But they are. It is just that they are not citizens by birth or by descent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. They are not South African citizens by birth or by descent, to be quite correct. I am grateful for the correction. That is what we are dealing with. In the past this type of person, if he had committed the various offences named here, first had to be tried; he then had to receive notice before he could be deported and he had to be tried properly, and then it frequently happened that when he had to be tried we had to produce reasons why he <span class="col_1145-1146" refersTo="page_0590"/>should be deported, and if the State has to produce those reasons why the person must be deported, the State has to reveal matters which are not in the public interest. It was therefore felt that we should insert this subsection (2), which actually means that it will not be necessary to put him on trial any further. He has appeared before the court once and he has already been convicted. What there was to say, for and against him, has been said in order to obtain a conviction, and consequently he has been tried properly. Now we are depriving him of the ordinary common law access to the court in subsection (2). He can now be deported after he has been convicted, without further access to the court. That is what it amounts to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>As I understand it now, this South African citizen may be deported without getting any notice from the State President, because the Minister says that if you give him notice the person may dispute the justification to deport him, and because he has been convicted of an offence it should be sufficient for him to be deported without giving any further notice. But I submit that these citizens may have been here for a very long time; they may have come here as children. I know of one person who came out here in 1904 and is a member of one of these Houses. He would now be deprived of any right to put up a case to the Minister or to any court merely because he was not born here. But I want to point out, also, that I do not think it is only when a man is convicted of an offence that he can be deported, because as the section reads, any person who is not a South African citizen by birth or descent and who is deemed by the State President to be an undesirable inhabitant of the Republic can be deported because he is a communist or because he has been convicted of an offence. How does the State President decide that he is a communist? I submit that this is going very far. The man has not been convicted of an offence.</p>

<p>This comes as a surprise to me; there must be some catch in it. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will tell me why he is so willing to delete the word &#x201C;communist&#x201D;. What I was concerned about was the fact that the person concerned would have no notice of the action proposed to be taken against him; that is what I object to. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply certainly does not make me feel any happier. I think the hon. the Minister should tell the Committee why he is leaving the word &#x201C;communist&#x201D; there if it is not necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I consider it most important that the word &#x201C;communist&#x201D; should be retained. If the hon. member for Transkei insists that I should remove it, however, I shall gladly do so, but then it will be his responsibility. The position is quite simple. What happened in the past was the following: The man is a self-confessed communist; his conduct shows that he is a communist; he is regarded as an undesirable person, and as soon as one wants to deport him, he runs to the court and says that he has not received notification, and then he asks to be tried first. That is what happened in the past. Our attitude is this: If people have already been tried and convicted there is no reason why they should be tried a second time and why the State should be compelled to prove in what respect they are not desirable persons, because the State may then be compelled to reveal facts that relate to the security of the State. That is all the clause deals with.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has said that because the person concerned has already been tried there is no reason why he should be given a second trial. I am not asking him to give such a person a second trial, because if a person has been convicted of one of these offences that would be sufficient to justify his deportation. But there is another type who is not tried by a court. The words &#x201C;if he is a communist&#x201D; appear in the original Act and therefore we cannot discuss them here but the point is that that man has been given no opportunity to disprove that he is a communist because he has not appeared before the court. We feel that the man should be given an opportunity to prove that he is not a communist. After all, the Minister has stressed that subsection (2) is being introduced because the person concerned has appeared before the court. I am pointing out that he may not have appeared before the court. We think that he should be given an opportunity to appear before the court and I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to follow the example of the hon. the <span class="col_1147-1148" refersTo="page_0591"/>Prime Minister who said at the beginning of the Session that it was not a good thing for two people to speak on the same day on a subject about which they knew nothing. Therefore I want to express the hope, in view of the fact that the Minister also has certain intentions, that I shall not discuss a subject about which I know nothing. I shall confine myself to those aspects of the Bantu question which relate to the Western Province and of which I have practical knowledge, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will do so too. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, certain people will not look very happy when I am through with them. I am warning the hon. member for Moorreesburg and I am also warning a few other hon. members. Two years ago I said in this House that the position of Coloured labour in the Western Province was impossible. I said that Coloured labour was becoming so scarce that farmers &#x201C;hi-jacked&#x201D; workers from one another&#x2019;s farms. In this House I was denounced as a liar. I was challenged in this House to mention names &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg does not know what I have for him. The smile of the hon. member for Piketberg will also be wiped off his face. This afternoon I am going to conclude with the Paternoster-vissery, Beperk. Mr. Speaker, at that time I was challenged across the floor of this House to mention the name of the farmer concerned. What has happened since that time? The Paarl farmer who did that, and who was innocent according to them, appeared in court six months later and was fined more than R3,000. I believe that that farmer acted in all fairness. One cannot get Coloured labour here. What I said at that time about the scarcity of Coloured labourers in the Western Province still holds good for to-day and the position is even worse. There is no surplus of Coloured labour in the Western Province. Idlers were mentioned here. Let the Government devise a scheme for idlers. I understand that the Government intends devising a scheme for idlers. Let us devise a scheme for them, because I believe that there most certainly are no Coloured idlers in the rural areas. The Minister of Labour is aware of that. Every day 850 Coloureds, and this information I obtained from the Department, catch buses in Malmesbury at 6.30 in the morning to come and work in Cape Town. They live in Malmesbury; this is how serious the position is in respect of Coloured labour in the Cape. Now it can be said, and I know it has already been said, &#x201C;Why do we not dismiss those Coloureds who live in houses in Malmesbury?&#x201D; The position is so serious that that cannot even be done. Only one out of a family of two or three remains on the farm. If one dismisses him one has no labour at all. The Minister may accompany me one week-end to see what is happening in Porterville, Gouda and Moorreesburg. He should come and see how buses take Coloureds to the cities for the week every afternoon. The rural areas are being drained of Coloureds. The problem has deteriorated to such an extent that I received a call from Philipstown this afternoon to inform me that people in lorries were recruiting Coloureds at Philipstown to come and work in the Boland. The farmer cannot get labourers. What is the position now? The position is so serious that many of the farmers in the Western Province are employing prison labour at present. Farm prisons are a good thing, because we cannot do anything else. However, the Deputy Minister spoke of the high prices of farms. Is he aware of the fact that the price of a farm is determined nowadays according to its quota of convicts? [Interjection.] The hon. member for Moorreesburg may know something about fisheries, but what does he know about farming? The position is that when a farm is advertised in a newspaper mention is made of how many shares it has in a certain farm prison and to how many convicts it is entitled. This is how serious the position has become. At present one sees many Coloured children on farms in the rural areas and I shall ask the Minister to go on a small tour there. I shall not ask the hon. member for Moorreesburg because he does not come from the platteland and he does not know what the position is. I want to ask the hon. members for Paarl and Stellenbosch, who are farmers, to stand up and tell us how many of our young Coloured people have remained on farms over the past five or six years. All of them, without exception, move to the cities.</p>

<p>No, Sir, but I want the hon. member to keep quiet and learn something. I say that the young Coloureds nowadays do not replace the old Coloureds who are disappearing from the farms. I am sorry to say that, but it is the truth. Every farmer in the Western Province says it is the truth. The position is so serious that many farmers keep their labourers on their farms with liquor. [Interjections.] No, the farmers will not hang me. They will hang the hon. member for Moorreesburg in the same way as they hung up Cape herrings to dry in the early days in Paternoster before they made fish-meal from them. The matter is so serious that I shall furnish the Minister with names and addresses of Coloureds who have been appointed <span class="col_1149-1150" refersTo="page_0592"/>and are paid R10 each to act as recruiters for outside interests in the rural districts. This is happening to-day. The hon. member for Moorreesburg says that he does not know about it. It is happening in his constituency. Let the hon. member read the names if he wants to know who these people are. The hon. member for Moorreesburg, the hon. member for Piketberg and the hon. member for Parow started this agitation. Note who they are. They started this story: &#x201C;The Western Cape is the homeland of the Coloured and the Bantu has to be removed from here.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>We shall now learn to what extent the hon. member still adheres to that. They started that. When we told them that there were too few Coloureds they said, &#x201C;Pay higher wages. Give them better accommodation.&#x201D; We are paying higher wages. We do have better accommodation and what do we find now? Higher wages have not increased the number of day labourers-&#x2014;the hon. member for Stellenbosch knows something about this. They are becoming scarcer. If on a Friday afternoon one pays more to the Coloured who is so addicted to liquor he lets one know on the Saturday or the Sunday that he is no longer coming to work because he still has some of the money left over from the week before. Ask the hon. member whether this is the truth and whether this has been the experience of farmers. This is how badly things are going now, Sir. How can I, as a farmer, compete with the industries and with the Railways? The Railways takes a Coloured boy who is not even worth five shillings or six shillings per day and employs him at R44 per month. Now I want to ask the Deputy Minister the following question: Does he, as a farmer, see his way clear to pay that wage for Coloured labour? Now it is also &#x201C;Zip.&#x201D; The Deputy Minister said that we should follow the example of the Railways. The Railways dismissed 750 Bantu and employed Coloureds. He did not add &#x201C;at R44 per month&#x201D;. Fortunately they took the poorest workers in the rural areas. Now I want to ask him whether a farmer can compete with those wages. &#x201C;Zip!&#x201D; I have to pay the full price for the dwellings of my Coloureds. What is more, in the Western Province I still have to pay divisional council rates as well. This hon. Minister does not pay divisional council rates in the Transvaal where he comes from.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, precisely, but you want to place the Transvaal in an even better position. I still have to pay divisional council rates. I say that financially I cannot afford to compete with the Railways and with industries. The Minister spoke here of industries which employed Coloureds in the place of Bantu. Of course they are able to do that. I want to mention one industry which is able to do that. I am thinking of a fishing company which ought to be able to do that, namely Paternoster-vissery, Beperk. They obtained a fish-meal concession of ten tons per hour. They do not work that concession themselves. They do not have a factory. They have sold that document to another company at R7 per ton per hour. i.e. R70 per hour. [Interjections.] Ask the directors whether I know what I am speaking about. You see, Sir, the smiles have disappeared. I said a short while ago that I would remove those smiles. They obtained that extra concession. I am not objecting to that. I just want to tell you now who the directors of that company are. The chairman is Mr. N. F. Treurnicht. He is sitting over there, the hon. member for Piketberg. Who is the other director, who is sitting next to the chairman? Mr. P. S. Marais, the hon. member for Moorreesburg. Who is the other director? Mr. Kotz&#x00E9;. the hon. member for Parow. who is the other director? A wine-farmer of the Western Province, Mr. Wynand Malan, the hon. member for Paarl. Now I ask you, Sir, is it possible for me on a farm to offer any competition, in view of the fact that I have to sell my products at market value, when these people get R70 per hour on the labour market for a piece of paper? Do you know how scarce labour is? In spite of the fact that they derive this good income from that business, they still cannot get Coloureds. I now ask the hon. member for Moorreesburg how many applications for Bantu labour he made during the past year.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not tell me that he challenges me to prove that they are not enged in whatever it may be. They have been engaged in removing the Bantu for the past ten years and at present there are more Bantu labourers in the employment of that company than there had ever been. Sir, I do not hold that against them, but then they must not hold it against me if I look after my own skin.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>What is untrue? It is not untrue that the hon. member is chairman. It is not untrue that they have obtained a fish concession. It is not untrue that they have sold the fish concession to Silvermans. It is not untrue that Bantu are employed there. What then is untrue? Sir, I say that I do not hold it against them, but they must not hold it against me if my children and I would also like to make a living. I want to go somewhat further. No person would like to work with Bantu if he could get Coloureds. [Interjections.] <span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0593"/>The hon. member for Moorreesburg must keep quiet now. He is just beginning to be noisy now. [Interjections.] The hon. member must get up and deny it. I have no objection to it. What I have stated here are facts, as far as I am aware. I shall readily accept it if the hon. member got up and said that they were not facts. I say no-one would like to work with Bantu if he could get Coloureds, but the Coloureds are not here. The fool&#x2019;s paradise which has been created, this myth of hundreds of Coloureds being available, are all figments of the imagination because they simply do not exist. They are not here. Who wants to work with Bantu if Coloureds are available? Who wants to work with people whose language one does not understand? Who wants to work with people who do not know anything about the work? I most certainly do not want to. What is the reason for the fact that there is not a single dairy farmer in the Western Province at present who does not farm with the assistance of Bantu?</p>

<p>He is not a dairy farmer. Do you know what the dairy farmer is saying at present, Mr. Speaker? I am speaking of a person who makes his living from dairy farming and not of a person who keeps one milch-goat. Some of them do have a few non-Whites but most of them employ Bantu labour almost exclusively.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I mention the name of one farmer to the hon. member? Mr. Christie Burger of Môreson, Eendekuil, is a stud farmer who is a large producer of milk.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, wait a minute, I probably know him better than the hon. member does. Mr. Speaker, at present we have the position that the Bantu has to be removed from the Western Province. Who will take his place? There are no Coloureds here to do so, and the Minister knows it.</p>

<p>So many figures have been quoted here that I do not want to quote more. Does the hon. Minister know how many Bantu are present in the Western Province illegally? There is no record, there is nothing at all to give any indication of this figure. In the urban areas in particular these illegal Bantu are one of the major sources of labour. I want to come back to this point later. I want to say that this policy with which the Government has started has solved nothing. The only result of that policy has been that labour has become more expensive. Why do I have to pay 50c per month as a registration fee for each Bantu labourer? Why is it not necessary for the farmer in the midlands, in the Transvaal, in the Free State and in Natal to do so? What have we in the Western Province sinned? Why do I have to deposit R25 at the Department of Bantu Administration if I want Bantu labourers? Why do the people in the midlands, in the Free State and in the Transvaal not pay a similar amount?</p>

<p>Before deciding on this policy the Government appointed various commissions in this connection some years ago. The then Minister of Coloured Affairs, at present the Minister of Defence, appointed Committees to advise the Government on how it would be possible to remove the Bantu from here. Why were the reports of those committees never published? According to my information all those committees informed the Government that it simply could not do something like that.</p>

<p>No, my information is not incorrect. Then publish their findings; surely it is simple enough. Tell us what those committees said.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my speech I said that higher wages tended to make day labourers more scarce rather than more plentiful. That has only made labour more expensive. We have been told to become more mechanized. The Western Province happens to be the most highly mechanized part of South Africa in the field of agriculture. At present we have a few problems in the Western Province. Better irrigation methods are being employed. People conserve water as the Government recommends. As a result more land is being placed under irrigation. The Government allowed the K.W.V. to issue additional wine quotas. Do you know, Sir, that the result of these wine quotas will be that between 3,000 and 5,000 families&#x2014;not workers&#x2014;will be required over the next four or five years to provide the necessary labour in this regard?</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Please wait a moment. There is no need for the hon. member to become so excited. The hon. member should just use his common sense. I say that as a result of irrigation our farming is becoming more intensive. We could produce food more cheaply were it not for the hampering effect which this Government has on our labour. We can produce a great deal more. Our units may even become smaller and still be economic. Unfortunately I do not have the time now to go into that, but that most certainly is the, case. Now we are told that this is the sacrifice which we have to make to solve the colour problem. Well, if this is the sacrifice, then we shall make it gladly. [Interjections.] I agree <span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_0594"/>with the hon. member&#x2014;if it is necessary to solve the problem in this way we shall make the sacrifice. But what strange phenomenon is this that the colour problem must be solved in the Western Province only? Why must the Bantu be removed from here only? If removal is the solution, also remove the Bantu from the White areas in the Transvaal and the Free State. [Interjections.] The Government is not engaged in anything. I now want to ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development whether the decrease of 5 per cent is going to be made applicable to the mines as well? Is he going to put a stop to foreign Bantu being recruited outside the borders of South Africa. Let me hear from the Minister. There the Minister &#x201C;zips&#x201D; again. He will not do so because we need those people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let us be honest with one another. If this programme is in fact the solution, let us act accordingly and make the necessary sacrifices, let all of us make sacrifices, including Mr. Piet Marais of Paternoster. But why must only I make sacrifices? Why only my children and I? Let us say that the principle which is being applied is the removal of that population group which does not live in that particular area. Let us then remove the Coloureds from the other parts of the country and return them to the Western Province.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister a further question. Does the Minister want our farmers of the Western Province to go and recruit Coloureds in the midlands and in the other provinces? Does the Minister &#x201C;zip&#x201D; again? Will the hon. the Deputy Minister have more courage and reply to this?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I said before that it is neither easy nor pleasant to work with a Bantu who can only be used for one year and goes away as soon as he has become skilled in his work. However, there is another problem involved in this entire matter. I now come to the interjection made by the hon. member for Heilbron a few minutes ago. He asked me whether I was in favour of the Bantu labourer&#x2019;s wife and family being here with him. The hon. member thought I was afraid and would run away from his question. Well, I want to offer the Government a solution if they are prepared to listen. If the Government really believes that a Bantu who was born in the Republic outside his homeland cannot become a citizen of the White part of the Republic, why do they not learn a lesson from what Germany has done in this regard, namely to remove families for periods of up to five years? Does the Government know what they are doing by allowing the Bantu into the white areas without his wife? Government members should go to the platteland and they will see that they are breeding, a race of black Coloureds in the Western Province. And those who come to the cities, strangely enough, become pure White. The hon. the Minister is shaking his head, but it is true. He sits in his office and draws up wonderful schemes, but they all mean nothing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<p>Is that not the reason why the Bantu are being removed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Surely it is much easier, instead of using convicts to farm as we have to do now, to bring the entire family here as they have done in Germany. There they have laid out entire townships for Italians who came from Italy to work.</p>

<p><span class="col_1155-1156" refersTo="page_0595"/>Do you realize, Sir, that that Bantu woman can pick grapes and fruit at less than half the price which has to be paid at present and that we shall be helping those people as well as the producer and the consumer? Why can that not be done? Surely it is simple enough to pass legislation to lay down that any person born there would nevertheless remain a citizen of the Transkei. However, it seems like punishment which is being meted out to us who happened to be born in the Western Province and want to make a decent living here. [Interjections.] The fact remains that the farmers of the Western Province are in a fix and I think the Government and the sensible members opposite are honest and willing to listen to our case but the trouble is that a small handful of members of this House have adopted a certain course and have turned the Government&#x2019;s head. Surely we cannot continue in this way. The development of the Western Province has to continue and instead of those hon. members helping us and saying that we should appoint a study group to investigate the matter in order to ascertain what is happening, they do nothing. That is the right way to go about the matter instead of dreaming up a formula and forcing it down our throats. What has it solved? Nothing. It has only made a lot of trouble and the thing is now becoming ridiculous.</p>

<p>Do you know, Sir, how one has to set about getting a Bantu at present? I am going to mention the case of a certain school in a native township in the Cape which has a vacancy for a teacher because the previous teacher&#x2019;s term expired. They had to make application for his replacement. This is a Bantu school. Before it is possible to replace that teacher one first has to obtain a certificate from the Department of Labour stating that Coloured labour is not available. This, at present, is the only way in which a Bantu can come to teach in a Bantu school here. Let us consider another ridiculous case. The Government is quite humane and in many respects they try to apply these ridiculous laws very decently. A Bantu woman may obtain leave in the Transkei to come and visit her husband here. Things are not as bad as they make them out to be abroad. She can get leave to come here on a visit of three months but then she has to make application on the other side to come here. The Department of Bantu Administration gives her leave to come. They do not do that readily but they nevertheless do. However, when she comes here she is caught by the police because she has forgotten to obtain simultaneous leave from the Department at the Cape end to enter here. However, once she has arrived here, if she has been fortunate enough to arrange matters on both sides, she only sees her husband at night because he works during the day, which is quite right, but she can only remain here on condition that she does not raise a finger to do a stroke of work in spite of the shortage of labour. Can you believe that such things happen while the world is crying out for people to work? Where do we land ourselves? Let the Minister rise and say that this is wrong. He is shaking his head but he started the &#x201C;Zip&#x201D; story. I want to make the prediction that if the labour position in the Western Province does not change very rapidly one will see chaos here as never before.</p>

<p>There is a labour problem in the Western Province, as elsewhere in the country, because there is a general shortage of manpower in South Africa, but now it is such a pity that the hon. member for Sea Point has made a serious matter ridiculous by the way in which he presented it. The hon. member has once again accused some people here. He said, amongst other things, that the same Paarl farmer of whom we spoke last year has now been punished and has paid a fine. He had it all wrong again, just like last year. I want to give him the assurance that the man whose name he mentioned last year, has paid no fine. Last year he mentioned the wrong name. He wanted to mention another name. He went around the Lobby saying that the name he wanted to mention was that of another man, but to-day he repeated the accusation in this House. I want to challenge the hon. member. He will not repeat that accusation outside this House. I think he would then go and do convict labour.</p>

<p>He has made an accusation here for which the farmers of the Western Cape will never forgive him. He insinuated that the farmers were buying Coloureds with liquor. I have heard this hon. member make many comtemptible statements, but this is the most contemptible I have ever heard him make. To-day he was really being himself.</p>

<p>What is all this exaggeration about the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape? What disruption has there been as a result of the removal of the Bantu? I can assure you, Sir, that there is absolute peace and quiet in my constituency. My people get what they want, because every case is dealt with on its merits. But it is United Party propaganda that is going on here, as the hon. member proved shamelessly in this House to-day.</p>

<p>Because there is a by-election in Worcester. Outside, and also in the farming industry, there is peace and quiet. What restriction is there? There is no restriction on seasonal labour. There was merely a slight misunderstanding, but that has been eliminated. Every case is dealt with on its merits, and it is my experience in my constituency that there is always a lot of incitement and propaganda and suspicion-mongering, and then one can always trace it to the United Party. That is where it is born. Nobody on earth would deny that the position as regards the Bantu in the Western Cape was getting out of hand. It got out of hand when the United Party was in power and when they established the locations, the shanty towns, here at Bellville. Now, after years, the position is gradually getting under control.</p>

<p>The hon. member pleaded for the importation of Bantu labour, but what has been our experience in South Africa as far as imported labour is concerned? The white settlement was established here with a labour problem, and labour was imported, the slaves or Malays. Where are they to-day? Are they on the farms? The hon. member pleaded for labour for the farmers, but are the descendants of those slaves on the farms, or are they in the cities? They have become a problem in the cities. Indians were imported as labourers, and where are they? Are they on the farms, or are they one of the greatest problems we have in the cities? There they are a social problem. We could continue along these lines. Where are the Chinese? Is there one of them left in the mines? They stay here in South Africa, and we are saddled with a Chinese problem. I say I admit that there is a labour problem, but not only here in the Western Cape; South Africa has a labour shortage which dates from its earliest history. The importation of Bantu to the Western Cape is not a solution. The more we import, the greater will be our problem in future, because it is the experience of every farmer that eventually&#x2014;and it does not take very long either; only a few years&#x2014;if that raw Bantu comes here and has been on the farm for a few years, he lands up in the city within a few years and then he becomes a social problem. I admit that there is a labour problem, but there has always been one. It was not created by the Government, nor was it created by the announcement of the removal of Bantu from the Western Cape. To me the obvious thing is this. The hon. member said that the Coloureds were leaving the farms. That is so. The Whites have also left, but the Whites are going back. They long to go back. The only solution is this. The solution is not imported Bantu labour, because that merely creates a bigger problem. The number of Coloureds is increasing rapidly. The only solution to the labour problem in the Western Cape is the Coloured and not the importation of Bantu or Chinese or Indians. We must make those people useful. They have been neglected. We admit that the Coloureds have been neglected terribly, and the people who are guilty of that neglect are over there in that corner. We can no longer speak of the opposite side of the House; we now have to speak of that little corner, and I want to predict that that little comer will become smaller and smaller. This type of reckless propaganda which the hon. member for Sea Point made to-day will cut no ice with the farmers of the Western Cape, because the farmers trust this Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury, who has just sat down, said that his constituency was quite satisfied and that he regarded our statement that it would cause disruption if the Bantu were removed from the Western Province as being an exaggeration. However, the hon. member ought to know why his constituency has been satisfied up to now, because the fact of the matter is that the number of Bantu in the Western Province has not been decreased as yet. On the contrary, all data indicate that the number of Bantu in the Western Province has been increasing. What the hon. member for Sea Point did here, was to indicate what the consequences would be if the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education were to succeed in his policy of decreasing the number of Bantu in the white area by 5 per cent per annum. But the hon. the Deputy Minister himself will admit that the number of Bantu is still increasing. Practically every day he receives deputations of farmers or industrialists of the Western Province who come to see him in order to point out to him the consequences of his policy of removing the Bantu from the white areas of South Africa.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member for Malmesbury told us that imported labour created dangerous problems and he mentioned the example of the slaves and the Indians. We all admit that mistakes were made in South Africa in the past as far as importing labour was concerned, but the United Party holds the view that the Bantu in this country form part of the South African population structure and that if we had made proper use of our Bantu labour force from the earliest times it would not have been necessary to import labour. The hon. member said that Coloureds had to be made more serviceable and nobody will argue with him on that score. The productivity of each population group must be increased to the best of their ability. But why has this problem developed in South Africa? The problem has developed simply because, in the first instance, the white man climbed higher and higher and took the Coloured along with him. The Bantu, however, also forms part of this pyramid; he is the bottom part of that pyramid and if one does not make use of the services of the Bantu one&#x2019;s economy must suffer. What are the facts of the matter? For many years we have been making use of the services of the Bantu to an increasing extent and over the past two decades we have made more use of their services than ever before; all figures and all data show that. We <span class="col_1159-1160" refersTo="page_0597"/>all know that every Government up to now has taken certain legislative and administrative steps for controlling the influx of Bantu to the white areas, but this Government is the first to make the promise, after having allowed this process of integration, not only to arrest the influx of Bantu but to reverse that process, as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education once more said during this debate. We want to admit immediately that control must be exercised over the influx of Bantu to the white area. Control must be exercised for obvious reasons. The influx of Bantu creates housing problems, sociological problems and problems relating to health services, and for all these reasons it is essential that there must be control.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The process of integration, coupled with better utilization of the Bantu&#x2019;s services, has accelerated considerably in the recent past. Why has this happened? Because, in the economic sphere, South Africa simply wants to burst at the seams. Man always wants to make progress and expand, and a further reason is that this country has strong leaders in the economic field and powerful forces have been joined which give rise to rapid industrial expansion. This trend inevitably led to Bantu labour being used to a larger extent and this process will be accelerated even more in the future. The question is often asked what other countries do which do not have Bantu labour. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education also asked that question during this debate. If he did not do so during this debate then it was during a previous debate. My counter-question is this: &#x201C;Would they have done anything else than we have done if they had at their disposal these large numbers of non-Whites we have at our disposal to-day?&#x201D; They would have done exactly the same thing. In other words, they would have made use of the services of those people.</p>

<p>I want to admit that economic integration does involve problems; this side of the Hosue has never denied that. We realize that it will create problems if we are not going to provide sufficient housing for the Bantu. We find even under this Government that it is not possible to make sufficient provision for housing. As regards the provision of social services, we simply cannot provide all the necessary services, in view of the increase in the number of Bantu. However, if one has to make a choice between economic integration and its associated problems, which can always be solved through planning, and the complete withdrawal of the black man from the white area, with all the fantastic problems associated therewith, I would rather choose economic integration with all the problems associated therewith.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not the only person to make this choice; the Government itself has apparently chosen economic integration over the past 18 years, in spite of the fact that at the same time it is also the Government&#x2019;s policy to reduce the number of Bantu in the white areas by 5 per cent per annum. Why do I say that? I say that because the Government boasts that it has stimulated economic development to a large extent, and if the black man in the white area constitutes a danger, this Government itself has placed South Africa on the road to danger, then this Government itself has driven the nail in the coffin of the white man in South Africa; and if the black man in the so-called white area constitutes such a danger I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he can wait until 1978 before removing them? If they do constitute a danger, then they should really be removed immediately. Then it will be out of the question to remove the Bantu from the white areas gradually in order to prevent disruption. If one has a stick of dynamite in one&#x2019;s pocket, one would surely not walk about with it until 1978. If the Government thinks that the presence of the Bantu in the white areas constitutes a danger, then they must be removed immediately. Mr. Speaker, the presence of the Bantu here cannot be held to constitute a danger, because if it does, the rural areas are sitting on tons and tons of dynamite to-day. The numerical superiority of the Bantu in the white areas can only be eliminated by means of a sharp increase in the White population and, secondly, by means of a powerful attraction to the Bantu areas. At present steps are being taken to improve the position by means of immigration, a policy which the Government has taken over from the United Party. We now find that Mr. Theo Gerdener, the Administrator of Natal, asks that the country&#x2019;s own white population should be boosted by making various concessions to white married couples. In this case too we find that United Party policy is being advocated by a man who is known as a supporter of the Nationalist Party. To what does this policy of decreasing the number of Bantu in white areas by 5 per cent annually amount? What it amounts to is that the hon. the Deputy Minister is prepared to listen to a small number of agitators within his own ranks to restrict development in certain areas, to remove the Bantu from such areas. He apparently thinks that Whites in the white areas will then feel safe. The hon. the Deputy Minister himself said in this debate, or rather in the Second Reading Debate, that the problems created by the influx of Bantu were throttling the Whites. I want to contend that this policy of the <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_0598"/>Government is not a cowardly policy; it is merely a cowardly policy to remove the Bantu from the White areas; for that reason the Government is responding to the representation of certain people who regard the Bantu in the white areas as constituting a danger. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, that we in South Africa would feel safer when the Bantu has been removed from the white areas, and are herded together in their own areas with not many opportunities for making a living! How safe can that make the Whites feel? There is only one policy which can bring South Africa safety and that is a policy which has interdependence as a basis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you why the hon. the Deputy Minister adopted that attitude. He did so because he knew that there had been a previous committee on the removal of the Bantu from the Western Province. And that committee, to which the hon. member for Sea Point referred, came to nothing, because instead of those people asking for the removal of the Bantu, they asked for more Bantu in the Western Province at every meeting they held. Therefore it is very easy to understand why the hon. the Deputy Minister was not prepared to accept that proposal. However, I want to put another point to the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. the Deputy Minister said to the industrialists and the farmers of the Western Province that he would not be inflexible in his attitude. He stated that in the negative. In other words, he will be flexible. Now, if one is flexible, then indeed one is not taking this matter seriously. I am prepared to take the hon. the Deputy Minister seriously. But, the people outside must know exactly where they stand in respect of this policy, in other words, whether or not the hon. the Deputy Minister is taking it seriously, because, this removal of the Bantu from the Western Province is not only going to affect people here, in due course it is going to affect us in the Eastern Cape as well. Not so long ago we were told that a line would be drawn, from the Fish and Kat Rivers up to Aliwal North. But this is not the first time that a line will be drawn between the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape. It is an old pasttime of this Government to draw lines. They draw line between the narrowminded and the enlightened. They even draw a line between what organizations one may belong to and what organizations one may not belong to; whether a person will be allowed to belong to the Rapportryersbeweging or whether one will not be allowed to do so. [Interjections.] In Pretoria they even draw a line between those people who have the largest number of Ministers as guests at their parties and the others who do not have Ministers as guests at their parties. Another line which is drawn is that between persons whom they greet with a kiss and the others whom they do not greet with a kiss! In this way a line is now going to be drawn between the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape. To me that is not funny at all. The Eiselen line is now being converted into the Haak line. [Interjections.] West of the Haak line the Coloureds will have preference in the field of labour. East of the Haak line the Bantu will have preference. This drawing of a line implies that all Bantu west of the Haak line will have to go east, and that with a few exceptions all Coloureds on the eastern side will have to come to the western side. The line has now moved a little to the east. At first the line was just west of Humansdorp up to Colesberg. Now it has moved to the Fish and Kat Rivers up to Aliwal North. This immediately places the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex in the limelight. This complex has not beeen built with coloured labour only. It has been built with great effort by. and depends greatly on, Bantu labour as well.</p>

And, at the present time, there is absolutely no unemployment. A decrease in manpower will necessarily cause disruption. And what is more, the Coloureds east of the Haak line have virtually no bonds with the Coloureds west of the Haak line. They have been living there for generations and have no bonds with this part of the country. We want to know in no uncertain terms whether it is the Government&#x2019;s policy that those Coloureds must come to this side of the Haak line or not.

But when hon. members advocate such a cause, they purposely remain silent about their so-called race federation plan with all its political implications. When they tell the farmers that the Government should allow more Bantu labour to come in for the sake of the farmers, they keep silent about the fact that they with their race federation plan want these people to be granted political rights in the White Parliament in the White area.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to refer to the allegation made by the hon. member for Sea Point, namely that a certain few M.P.s&#x2014;the hon. member for Parow, the hon. member for Moorreesburg, the hon. member for Paarl and myself&#x2014;had organized themselves in some way or other as directors of a fishing company which had obtained certain concessions, concessions which were supposedly being hired out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me to say first of all that in what the hon. member for Sea Point said, he kept back the names of the other directors serving on that board. He creates the impression that all the directors are Members of Parliament who are taking advantage of their position to obtain certain things from the Government, and get away with it. This is the only company on the West Coast in which fishermen from the fishing community are members of the board of directors of a fishing company. They are people who are active and who go out to sea themselves, who catch fish themselves and who make a contribution in that way. The hon. member has never raised objections to the capitalists of Sea Point going up the West Coast, building up major fishing interests and enriching themselves. He has no objection to that, but when, at the instance of active fishermen occupying humble positions in that industry, the hon. member for Moorreesburg, the hon. member for Parow and I&#x2014;who grew up on the West <span class="col_1167-1168" refersTo="page_0601"/>Coast&#x2014;tried to organize something for them so that they may get a living share in that industry, then there are tremendous objections. This I want to tell him, and I also want to tell it to the Opposition: Those people on the West Coast, those simple fisher-folk, are the people who, as the hon. member for Malmesbury said, have driven the Opposition into a corner. Nobody ever looked after the interests of those people. Nobody ever tried to reason why it was that the fishermen on the West Coast, who are employed in the industry and whose fathers started the industry, did not obtain an interest in that industry; why it was that the capitalists of Sea Point were granted the concessions. As regards these Members of Parliament whose names were mentioned here this afternoon, I want to say the following: The hon. member for Moorreesburg and I received representations from those people in which they asked us how it was possible that Mr. Silverman, Mr. Alan Lees, Mr. Aap du Preez&#x2014;who are from Cape Town&#x2014;Mr. Shapiro and others had obtained these mighty fishing interests. How is this possible? But one can easily understand that, not so? These people have money, these people have business experience. They had the right. But how is it possible that we never got anything, that the Government did not do something for us?</p>

<p>It was for that reason that the hon. member for Moorreesburg and I started to make representations to the effect that the State had to do something to recognize the contribution the fishing community had made, even if their personal contribution, namely that of catching fish, could be likened to that of hewers of wood and drawers of water. However, since these people were unorganized, the Department had great difficulty in helping them. That is where the hon. member for Moorreesburg and I fit into the picture. We organized a body and, for the sake of these simple people who had been in the industry for years&#x2014;some of them for three to four generations (they had been fishermen long before there were fish factories for processing fish meal)&#x2014;we asked the State to grant recognition to these people and to establish a body which would look after their interests. I may tell you that it was at the suggestion of the Department that this proposal was made. It was said that, if such a body could come forward, something could possibly be done for those people. That is why we bought, at our own risk, the Paternoster Fisheries&#x2014;which was at that stage a bankrupt concern, or a concern which was on a very poor footing&#x2014;reorganized it and sold those people more than 50 per cent of the shares at par. They could not obtain a fishing share at par anywhere. They could buy 50 cent shares at R3 or R5 each, but not at 50 cents. This Paternoster concern is the only and the first concern to give the fishermen in the industry, the boat owner, and the ordinary crew member, a chance of obtaining an active share in a relatively modest concern. Paternoster&#x2019;s capital is only half a million and the bigger companies work in millions and millions. Today this is one of the veiled hints coming from the other side.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Moorreesburg, the hon. member for Parow, the hon. member for Paarl and I are concerned, the books of that company are open to all, and you may examine our shareholdings and see whether we are the people who have in some way or other benefited ourselves in an unseemly manner. We took the financial risk of that company, we signed for it, and we received no compensation for it. I am sure that this fishing community on the West Coast is grateful that the Government recognized that concern and that they could get in on the ground floor, and that is why that company was granted a ten-ton fish meal quota when the latest concessions were granted. That concession was not sold or bartered away, as the hon. member for Sea Point said here. That company continues to catch its own fish, and it is merely because in present circumstances that ten-ton concession is too small to justify the building of an independent factory, that it was arranged in consultation with an existing company that the latter company would for a five-year period process that ten-ton concession which had been granted on such fish as were caught by this company itself, owing to the cost of building a factory in these times. That is why I want to repudiate the statement made here by the hon. member for Sea Point as being totally unfounded, as being typical of the kind of slanderous talk with which the United Party always comes out when it thinks that it may attract a few votes somewhere.</p>

<p>I repeat: The United Party and the hon. member for Sea Point do not object to the big fishing magnates, but when it is Messrs. Eygelaar, Boonzaaier, Engelbrecht and Mostert, whose grandfather and father were engaged in that industry and opened up the way for other people to get in with big money, then there are objections. I want to hope that, if he should ever find himself amongst these people on the West Coast, they will give him a good talking to. I want to leave the matter there.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the question of labour in the Western Province. In this regard I want to come back to the labour position at Paternoster. Over the past few years Paternoster has been applying for 400 Bantu per year. They usually got a few less, but that was more or less their quota, and they operated in two fishing areas. One of the first lines of policy the Paternoster board of directors adopted, was to consider how we could replace Bantu labour by Coloured labour, how we could reduce Bantu labour in the first place. Within two years we reduced it, not by 5 or 10 per cent, but by 25 per cent. I want the hon. member for Sea Point to deny this. We reduced it by 25 per cent, and it is a standing resolution that we shall continue to provide housing for the Coloureds and not for <span class="col_1169-1170" refersTo="page_0602"/>the Bantu, and that we shall also continue to develop other methods in regard to the utilization of Bantu labour for the purpose of economizing on and eliminating as much labour as possible. Even as regards this aspect the hon. member made an irresponsible statement here.</p>

<p>When will this reduction come into effect?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The reduction has already come into effect. It has already come into operation. The company applied for 300 Bantu this year. I think the company employs fewer than 300 Bantu. If my memory serves me correctly, it employs roughly 260. Now I want to say a few things about the labour position in the W.P. Just as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;if I may mention the two of us in the same breath&#x2014;I also grew up in the W.P. Even in my childhood days&#x2014;that was in the years between 1920 and 1930&#x2014;farm labour was very scarce in the W.P. When I was nominated for the first time as the member of this House for Piketberg, one of those who were present specially congratulated me on my nomination. The reason for this was that when I was nine years of age my father lent me to him to be his plough-boy. In those days there was still a demand for people who could lead the plough. I worked for him because he did not have sufficient labour. He started developing a large farm, but he did not have enough labourers. That was in the vicinity of 1928 or 1929. Why this outcry at present that there is a labour shortage in the W.P.? Surely, there has been a labour shortage here for a long time.</p>

<p>Now I want to furnish the hon. member with a different set of figures. At present there are farms in the W.P. which have many Coloureds. On a certain farm there are 1,000 Coloureds&#x2014;adults and children. On another farm there are 500. Those farmers are capable of undertaking unlimited expansion on their farms, because they have the necessary labour. I am not referring to the Bantu, I am referring to Coloureds.</p>

<p>Now, the general trend among Coloureds and their entire outlook on society are such that they want to be where there are many people. Unfortunately it is one of our problems that the person who has much, easily gets more, and the person who has little, gets even less. I want to admit that many of our farmers are experiencing difficulties in this process. But there are still many farms in the W.P. where there is a surplus of Coloured labour.</p>

<p>I want to furnish the hon. member with a few figures, because he worried me with the vague statements he made here. A few weeks ago I sent somebody to fetch a few loads of stone. The foreman was driving a lorry, but that morning he did not have people to help him. Therefore he simply drove to the Coloured quarter of Piketberg to recruit a few labourers. That was as late as 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. He recruited five Coloured labourers there. What were they doing when he found them? Nothing. What did they intend doing that day? Also nothing. At any rate, they helped the foreman to load the stone. Somebody else came there with another lorry and, because labourers were scarce, the same five Coloureds loaded the second lorry. They were hired for the day or for the week. Nevertheless, when that man with the lorry arrived at the working-place where the stone had to be off-loaded, not a single Coloured was to be seen on the back of the lorry. They had quietly jumped off along the way. Apparently they had decided that they had to work too hard and had preferred to disappear along the way. They were clean gone.</p>

<p>There is also the matter of Coloured labour. There are even people still who are not working. Our problem is not so much to find the numbers, but to discipline those people and to set them to work. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Newton Park the following question: When the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs introduces Bills which are aimed at setting our Coloured population to work and disciplining them and at co-ordinating manpower, I hope that that side of the House will co-operate. Hon. members on the other side should not continue to plead for more Bantu labour in the Western Cape. Let us co-ordinate and discipline the available labour and utilize it for the benefit of all of us.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago we in Piketberg were engaged in a water scheme. We asked the chairman of the municipality whether Coloured labour was available, and he replied that such labour was not available and that the little there was of it, was of a very poor quality. But within one day the foreman had 30 people there. Where did he find them? I think even more people were found at a later stage.</p>

<p>That is why I want to say that the people who are talking so irresponsibly and lightly about the tremendous shortage of Coloured labour, should reconsider the situation. We are in a difficult position. We have a problem. But I think that we can manage much better with the available labour. I want to say that the statement the hon. member for Sea Point made here, is untrue. He claimed that the farmers of the W.P. were bribing one another&#x2019;s labourers with wine. Bad farmers are indeed to be found in the W.P. I do not want to say that the hon. member for Sea Point is one of them. I do not know about everything he does. But in general the standard of our farming community is high. Many farmers are prepared to pay their workers more than the usual wages if they will only consent to drinking no liquor. The allegation that the farmers in the W.P. are always supplying their Coloured labourers with lots to drink and coaxing away other farmers&#x2019; labourers by means of liquor, is untrue. Over there we have the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who is an honest and respected farmer. It is not his practice to do such a thing. I know that it is not a general <span class="col_1171-1172" refersTo="page_0603"/>practice in the W.P. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ought to call the hon. member for Sea Point to order for a change. By suggesting such a thing the hon. member is casting a reflection on the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who is also a farmer.</p>

<p>You do not know. But you talk about many things of which you know nothing. The broad view held by our Whites in the W.P., is a responsible view. In general our people realize that we cannot allow an unrestricted influx of Bantu into the Western Cape, because if we do so, we are digging our own graves. Our people in the Western Cape are willing to work with a labour shortage. Surely, that is no novelty. Throughout the Western world there is a labour shortage, especially when it comes to labour in agriculture, unskilled labour in particular. In comparison with other countries such as America, we have quite a large number of labourers in the rural areas. In America and other countries the labourers only go through an orchard once and the rest has to drop to the ground because they do not have sufficient labour. That is the way they harvest there. We feel that we are prepared to make sacrifices in the economic sphere, if by doing so it will be possible for us to preserve our country for the Whites. We can also employ a labour shortage as a means of forcing and teaching our White sons to work hard. Our people are turning soft.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>In many cases we can replace the pick and shovel by other implements. Perhaps the hon. member does not know that. But we can do a very great deal by means of a little more mechanization in many respects. We should like to see our White sons and daughters in the W.P. accepting responsibility in regard to agriculture and being guided back to this profession by putting their own shoulders to the wheel. We have progressed too far on the road of wanting everything to be done by the Coloureds and the Bantu. There are still people in the W.P.&#x2014;I can take the hon. member to them&#x2014;where husband and wife as well as their sons and daughters all lend a hand and pack 1,000 up to 1,200 trays of grapes per day&#x2014;not per week. They are people who are making spectacular progress.</p>

<p>I want to express the hope that we as Whites in the Western Province will realize that we shall have to put our shoulders to the wheel, not only by way of talking and arguing about Bantu and Coloured labour, but also by way of using our own energy and doing the maximum amount of work ourselves. Then there will probably be enough Coloured labour. In addition there is the fantastic growth of the Coloured population. According to calculations we shall have three million Coloureds in South Africa by the year 2,000, and most of them will be in the Western Cape. Where are they going to find work? They will pull their weight in the growing industry. In many cases they will also take the place of the Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I extremely regret that the Coloured people have been dragged across the floor of this House in a manner which does not do credit, in my opinion, to this Parliament or to the Coloured people. I should like to say that I and my colleagues will never permit reflections on the Coloured community of this country without making the strongest protest at all times. It has been most unfortunate that the Coloured people have been referred to in terms which mean that they are unworthy to occupy a place of prominence in this country. [Interjections.] I am not going to make any accusations against hon. members. I am speaking as a Coloured Representative, and I want to say that it has been our task as Coloured Representatives to endeavour at all times to assist in the upholding of the good name of the Coloured people. I am not trying to ingratiate myself with the Minister of Coloured Affairs or with the Government, but I must say that the effort which have been made toward that end have been very many, and some of them have been very successful. We must never in this House say anything which will bring the Coloured people into disrepute and hurt their feelings. I hope it will never happen again.</p>

<p>It has been said that the Coloured people are leaving the farms. There are many reasons for their doing that. There are many thorny problems which need to be tackled. I am not going to attack anybody or any group of people, but what are the reasons for the Coloured people leaving the farms? There may be many. There has been reference to the <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0604"/>drink problem. The tot system has been a curse to the country, which has deleteriously affected the Coloured people in years gone by. What about the pay they get on the farms? Is it not that they are attracted by a little more money which they can earn in the towns? I do not want to attack the farmers. I do not want to sound a discordant note about the way the Coloured people are treated, but there are other questions like the matter of schooling. I have spoken to a lot of Coloured people and I have asked them why they are leaving the farms to go to the cities, and they tell me that their children need to be educated and there are not enough, if any, facilities for them to learn on the farms, and therefore they go to the towns and the cities. Then of course there is the economic growth of this country which has created a demand for more workers in the towns, and the Coloureds have gone there. It is a problem which I admit is difficult, but I do not think that the people who employ the Coloured people are completely free from blame in regard to this trek from the farms to the cities. Then we must also remember that there are thousands of Coloured people, men and women, who have to sit for many months of the year doing nothing because they are seasonal workers, working in the seasonal occupations such as fruit-picking and fish-canning, and there are several months of the year when there is no work for them. Just by way of meeting the point made by the hon. member for Piketberg, he said that when they wanted to load stone, they found five labourers, but when they had to come and unload the stone they had disappeared. What wages were they offered for doing that work? We are not told that. The pay of the Coloured man on the farms has not been in conformity with the economic requirements of the Coloured people and the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>But the main reason why I intervened in this debate was not to talk about the Coloured worker, because I think the opportunities will come during this Session when we can discuss this question at great length. I merely intended to take part&#x2014;and I think the Minister of Finance, who must be completely bored by this debate, will forgive me if I do not talk finance, although I might say to him that if perhaps he had made more money available to the Coloured Affairs Department the economic position of the Coloured people would have been much better than it is. But I really got up to speak on the question of sport which was raised before, and I am glad to have the opportunity during this debate to say something on this subject. I want to say that I agree with the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, who, according to the press, said he was sorry that sport was dragged into politics. I agree with him, because the Coloured man does not want, and has never asked or demanded, mixed sport. Why do you accuse him of wanting mixed sport? That is the accusation the Government makes. They have never asked for it, but what they do want is the right to go and see sport played. Now, much has been said about tradition. The hon. the Minister of the Interior spoke about the tradition of South Africa and he said that the Government wants to uphold the traditional way of life in this country. I want to ask him, in his absence, why does he want to use tradition to break tradition? Because the tradition of the Cape has been broken by the Government, by those people who do not know the tradition of the Cape. The tradition of the Cape has always been that the Coloured man was free in his movements and in any other way to go and visit any sporting occasion as a human being and as a citizen of this country. But now they need a permit to do so. It is true that the Minister said that they could go to Newlands; there is a perpetual permit for that, but they do not want to go under perpetual permit; they want to go there as of right. Let me just remind hon. members that in the City of Cape Town, where Coloured people are ratepayers and there are municipal swimming-pools and municipal sporting fields, the Coloured man has never claimed his right as a ratepayer to go to these places, but has always gone to those places specially set aside for the Coloured people.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the Coloured man always has to be kicked around. In the sporting field the Coloured man has loomed very large. All that the Coloured man wants is the right as a human being to be free. Why should Coloured people not be allowed to go to the City Hall to watch boxing; why should they not be allowed to go and watch soccer; why must they have a permit? Sir, that is the tradition which this Government has broken, and I have the right to demand that that tradition be observed in this country. Sir, the hon. the Minister of the Interior spoke here of our traditional way of life in sport. Since he has just entered the Chamber, I want to repeat what I have said very briefly for his benefit. The hon. the Minister does not realize that what the Government regards as the traditional way of life in South Africa is foreign to the traditions of the Cape. The hon. the Minister is a Cape man; he must know that the tradition of the Cape was freedom of movement for the Coloured people to go and watch any form of sport without a permit. The only excuse that the Government has for insisting on permits is to make sure that separate facilities are available, and when the Government talk about separate facilities I think they mean separate toilet facilities.</p>

<p>Sir, there is not a single sports venue, either municipal or otherwise, where separate facilities do not exist or where they will not be provided by the bodies concerned. Of course, we do not know what goes on in our homes when we are away from home. I do not know whether my servant girl uses my toilet when I am not there, nor can hon. members opposite be sure that their servant girls do not use theirs when they are away from home. But when it comes to public places the question of the availability or otherwise <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_0605"/>of separate toilet facilities, in the opinion of the Government, is of paramount importance. Sir, I want to endorse the request made by the hon. member for Yeoville in his amendment that the Government should &#x201C;allow all race groups to watch all organized sport, provided adequate facilities are available for Whites and non-Whites&#x201D;. That is the request that I now make on behalf of the Coloured people. Sir, the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is here. He realizes to what extent the Coloured people are anxious to co-operate with the Government in various fields for the benefit of the Coloured people but this sort of pin-prick, this petty apartheid policy practised by the Government is a retarding factor that stands in the way of co-operation.</p>

<p>This policy of petty apartheid does not help the Government and it does not help the Coloured people. We know that when there is a boxing tournament in the City Hall of Cape Town in which the participants are Whites, the Coloured spectators sit upstairs where arrangements can be made for separate toilet facilities. Why deprive these people of the opportunity of attending that boxing tournament as spectators. Why should it be regarded as a crime for them to attend as spectators unless they have a permit? Why hurt the feelings of the Coloured people by saying to them: &#x201C;You cannot go here or there as a citizen of the country unless you have a permit?&#x201D; It is a slur on the Coloured people; it is degrading to them; they do not deserve it. It is not necessary. It does not affect the progress of this country one iota. Sir, I make a very sincere appeal to the Government to do away with this permit system in sport. By doing so the Government will be helping materially to promote better relations between the Coloured people and the Government. I know that the Government is doing its best to create more goodwill between the Whites and the Coloureds. The Coloured people are only too anxious to co-operate but why put a halter around their necks and pull them back as if they were horses? Why say to them in effect, &#x201C;You can go here because I lead you there but you cannot go there because the road is not open to you &#x201D; Why not remove these petty pin pricks?</p>

<p>If the Government does away with these petty pin pricks it will find that it will lead to a better understanding between the Whites and the Coloureds; that there will be a greater response from the Coloured people and that greater progress will be made. Coloured people have said to me; &#x201C;The Government does not want us to take part in sport together with white people; that we do not mind, but somehow or other that only applies to this country; our Springboks go overseas to countries like New Zealand where they play against the Maoris.&#x201D; There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but the reverse is not allowed to happen in this country. Why should mixed sport be allowed in a foreign country but not here? I can understand that the Government&#x2019;s answer will be that if mixed teams were allowed to come to this country it would be an acknowledgment of the Government&#x2019;s willingness to allow mixed sport, which is contrary to the Government&#x2019;s policy, Sir, I want to conclude by saying this; Please try, as far as possible, to keep the Coloured people out of squabbles in this House when they are brought in merely as a political football. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs to use his influence with his colleagues, and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister of the Interior and the hon. the Minister of Community Development to remove the restrictions which apply to Coloured spectators as far as sport is concerned. They will then be doing the Government and the Coloured people a great service.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland pleaded here that nothing be done in this House which would be detrimental to the position of the Coloureds; in fact, he pleaded that we who are gathered together here should try to improve the position of the Coloureds. I should like to associate myself with that point of view, but then I want to add immediately that the hon. member does not always understand how this ought to be done. He made a plea here this afternoon to the effect that Coloureds should as it were be given a free pass to attend White sports meetings. He tried to give us a lecture here on what the tradition in South Africa is and, more specifically what the tradition here in the Western Province is. But the hon. member is after all not the only one who knows the Western Province and who grew up here. We also know the Boland tradition. According to the Boland tradition there has always been separation, and the Boland tradition is that that separation must be maintained. What was our experience on a few occasions here in the Western Province in regard to mixed spectators at major rugby matches here at Newlands? I am not mentioning this in order to speak derogatively about the Coloured population, but our experience at important rugby matches at Newlands has time and again been that because of the level of development of a large number of the people present there, matters simply got out of hand. Even their leaders realized that things could not go on like that. I want to go further and with reference to the debate held here a few days ago on the question of mixed sport, in which I was only able to begin talking and could not proceed, I want to say that reference was made there to the question of Maoris in a New Zealand touring side. The hon. member for Durban (Point) levelled the accusation that what this Government&#x2019;s policy amounted to was that we wanted to prescribe to overseas powers how they should compile their teams and that we wanted to make racial classifications in those countries. I then told the hon. member that that was not correct. In New Zealand the Maoris classify themselves separately. They form their own Maori rugby <span class="col_1177-1178" refersTo="page_0606"/>board, etc. [Interjections.] We play against them, says the hon. member. But the hon. member does not understand this matter and that is why I want to deal with it now because it is the same as the matter he raised here this afternoon. The standpoint of this Government is not one of hostility to any other country&#x2019;s sportsmen or any section of their sportsmen. On the contrary, we have the greatest respect for the Maori rugby players of New Zealand and that is why this Government allowed two Maori rugby administrators to come here as guests of the South African Rugby Union during our festival celebrations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>But those two Maori rugby administrators had more sound commonsense than many hon. members in this House, because upon their return to New Zealand one of them, Mr. Ralph Lodge, said that after his visit here he understood fully why we in South Africa could not have mixed sports. It was because of the level of development of a certain section of the population. He has so much sound commonsense that he stated that because of those circumstances he understood why mixed sport could not be allowed in South Africa and that the presence of a few Maoris in a New Zealand team would create problems for us in the domestic situation with which we have to deal. That is not because we have anything aginst those people: Our players go and play against them in New Zealand. We have respect for those Maori players, but they themselves have so much understanding that they realize that the moment they played here it would cause a chain reaction of complications with which we&#x2014;and not they&#x2014;would have to deal after their departure. That is what hon. members on that side of the House do not realize or understand. One of the hon. members said the other day that the statement made by the hon. Minister of the Interior to Mr. Alexander resulted in two South Africans and a Rhodesian being dropped from the world cricket team. Mr. Speaker, surely that is not so? It is part of a hostile set-up aimed at South Africa. The hon. member who is laughing there must get his facts straight. He will then agree with me that the Pollock brothers, whom we respect because they remained loyal to South Africa in spite of the slap in the face they received, and Colin Bland had previously played for the world team after the attitude of this Government to mixed sport in South Africa had been made clear. Then there was nothing wrong with that and they were good enough to play in that world team. This was another attempt on the part of hostile countries to get at South Africa. But I say that South Africa and this Government will not allow itself to be put off its stride by that. We will respect sportsmen, wherever they may be in the world, and whatever their colour may be. But then we ask that politicians in other countries of the world take into consideration the situation with which this Government has to, deal in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into this matter any further. I want to return to the subject which has been raised here this afternoon. I only want to say that I am very sorry that the Opposition does not see its way clear to discussing financial matters in this financial debate. I was prepared to deal with them on that score, but it makes one look forward with so much more satisfaction to the Budget debate which is still to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the question of labour in the Boland and the Western Cape was raised here this afternoon. The hon. member for Sea Point, a Boland farmer, who is again not present here, availed himself of this opportunity not only to bring his fellow-farmers in the Boland into discredit and present them in a bad light, but also to present the Coloured population of the Western Cape in the worst possible light. What his entire argument this afternoon amounted to was that the Coloureds were too hopeless to serve as a source of labour for the Boland and that the farmers were so hopeless that they used liquor to compete for labour and that the only solution for us was to introduce as much Bantu labour as possible. That was the gist of his argument. The hon. member for Newton Park even went so far as to say that they saw no objection to that because they regarded the Bantu as a permanent part of our population structure. That is why there is nothing wrong in allowing as many of them as possible to come in. Now as a Boland farmer I want to say that I want to object very strongly to those reprehensible words which the hon. member for Sea Point used here this afternoon when he alleged that farmers in the Boland were enticing one another&#x2019;s labour away with liquor. I do not know whether the hon. member has interests in the liquor trade in a Coloured area here in the Peninsula and whether for that reason it is easy for him to accuse farmers of trying to entice one another&#x2019;s labour away with liquor.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question? How much liquor, on an average, do farmers in the Boland give their farm labourers these days?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member what I do on my own farm, but the hon. member will not account for what he does on his farm and in his neighbourhood. The farmers I know and with whom I associate are people who do not use liquor as a means to acquire labour, nor <span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_0607"/>do they allow their labour to deteriorate through liquor. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is present here and he is a farmer himself. I take it that he himself adheres to this rule amongst us Boland farmers that liquor is not intended to reduce our people&#x2019;s capacity for work and productivity or in that way to entice those people away.</p>

<p>In keeping with what the hon. member for Boland said here, I want to say nothing to detract from the potential of our Coloured labour. I want to admit that there are shortcomings and that there are numerous cases of Coloureds who are not in full-time or effective service, but at the same time I want to ask myself this question: Is there not in the Coloureds with all their problems, and all their shortcomings, but who grew up here amongst us and who speak our language, a very much greater potential than in the raw Bantu from the Transkei who are only accustomed to lying in the sun?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member will allow me to do so, I want to make the point that nobody denies that labour is becoming scarcer. It is not only the case in the Western Cape, it is a countrywide phenomenon. It is becoming scarcer throughout the entire world in countries which are in the same position as we are, namely which are becoming industrialized. But the first possibility for the Boland farmer, if we want to deal specifically with agriculture lies in Coloured labour which has always been the source of labour on the farms. If some of this labour is drifting to the cities then it is a purely normal phenomenon which is taking place throughout the entire country and which is also taking place in the case of the White section of the population. Now I want to wipe out a wrong impression which the hon. member for Sea Point created here. He created the impression that all the Coloureds were leaving the farms. I want to state that farmers who treat their Coloured labour in the old traditional Boland way do not have labour problems. They are not experiencing difficulty with labour. That hon. member must not make those kind of derogatory remarks now. In any case he does not understand these things. All he can talk about is wool. I should like to take hon. members who do not know the Boland with me on a tour to show them what is being done to-day by our Boland farmers, not only to keep their Coloured labour on the farms, but also to improve the productivity of that labour. I should like to show hon. members how many Coloured farm schools there now are in the rural areas of the Boland and what good results are being achieved with those schools, what the consequences are and what the percentage is of Coloured migration there. It is disappearing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>How many of those school children remain on the farms?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>In the regions where farm schools are being established the percentage of migration, which is large in other regions, is small. They develop a love for that region and that school which becomes their cultural centre. In this regard I want to mention an example from my own constituency. A group of farmers teamed up and bought a small farm of ten morgen. Thanks to the assistance we received from the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, they are going to transform the little farm into a school in the first instance and also into a Coloured community centre where they will have their own entertainment and where a clinic and sport facilities will be organized for them. I want to predict that that example will soon be followed by numerous other constituencies in the Boland. It costs those farmers money, but that is what they are prepared to do to keep their Coloured labour at their disposal in the first instance before looking to other sources of labour such as Bantu or bandits.</p>

<p>I should liked to take hon. members who have not lived in the Boland with me to our Boland farms to show them how mechanization is taking place to-day, how our dairy farmers are to-day using milking machines and how labour, which is becoming scarcer, is becoming less and less necessary there. I want to show them how mechanization has taken place on our fruit farms as far as the picking of fruit is concerned, so as to limit labour to the minimum, and how the farmer and his family themselves take a hand whenever possible to share in the work on those farms. I should like to take hon. members with me to our wheat-growing districts to see how mechanization is taking place on those farms to-day and how labour is being organized in such a way that only the minimum is necessary. The picture of our Boland farmers held up to us here by the hon. member for Sea Point is a false one. It is a picture which is unworthy of him as a Boland farmer himself. [Interjection.]</p>

<p><span class="col_1181-1182" refersTo="page_0608"/>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the hon. member is on the run now, so to speak, but this afternoon in this House he created an impression of the Boland farmer which is a totally false one. The Boland farmer has, in his attempts to utilize the labour potential and because of the expansion of his industry, growing undertakings and the increasing number of farming directions, more need of seasonal labour. That is why he has to look to other sources. The impression which the hon. member gave here this afternoon of the Boland farmers implied that they wanted to grab an unlimited number of Bantu labourers for that purpose, and that impression is also an erroneous one. It is necessary to obtain additional labour for seasonal work, but we do not have any problem in that connection.</p>

<p>It has always been my view that even if we were to bring Bantu to a region such as this for a season only to pack fruit, or whatever it may be, we would in no way whatsoever be affecting the principle of the policy of reducing Bantu labour in the Western Cape. That is the attitude which the hon. Deputy Minister adopted towards that deputation to which the hon. member referred. If the hon. member would only try to become better acquainted with the attitude of the Deputy Minister and of the deputation which went to see him he would have had something which he could have discussed with some degree of knowledge here this afternoon. But now the hon. member has bruited abroad the impression that the Boland farmer is a terrible person who handles his Coloured labour badly. The Boland farmer is doing everything in his power to expand his industry on the basis of Coloured labour in the first place. He is going out of his way to mechanize and to create facilities for his Coloured labour on his farm and elsewhere.</p>

<p>There is nothing strange about that. What I do find strange is that the hon. member does not agree. To my way of thinking it is strange that the hon. member wants to allow the Bantu to come in here by the hundreds. What we find strange is what the hon. member for Newton Park says, i.e. that they regard the Bantu as a permanent part of our population and that they see nothing objectionable in their coming here. The Boland farmer regards Bantu labour as a supplementary source of labour. As they are able to utilize other means, less and less use will be made of Bantu so as to fit in with the pattern which the Government is striving to establish. The Boland farmer also knows that if problems, apart from political problems arise in regard to the Bantu who are not acquainted with the White part of the country, the population will look to the authorities, the Government, for a solution. The population do not look to the Opposition with their attitude of, &#x201C;let them come in as they please&#x201D;, for a solution. It is sufficient for me to say that the picture of the agricultural industry in the Boland which the hon. member for Sea Point painted here this afternoon is a totally false one, one which the Opposition ought to feel ashamed of.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member for Stellenbosch will excuse me if I do not follow all the arguments which he raised. There is, however, one point I should like to mention. He says it is our policy that the Bantu should be allowed into the White areas in uncontrolled numbers. I must make it quite clear that that is not our policy. My hon. leader has explained that on several occasions. He made it clear that the flow to the White areas should be controlled to a minimum, but that the Bantu who are here should be used to the best advantage. That is the policy of this party, and not as the hon. member for Stellenbosch stated it to be.</p>

<p>I am really concerned with the position in the Eastern Cape, being a representative of Port Elizabeth, an area where large numbers of Bantu are employed. I listened with great interest to the speeches made by the hon. the <span class="col_1183-1184" refersTo="page_0609"/>Minister of Bantu Administration and his Deputies. I was interested to hear what plans the Government has in connection with that particular area. I was disappointed in that no reference was made as to what the position will be in Port Elizabeth. I did understand, however, by way of interjection from the Minister of Bantu Administration that the policy of the 5 per cent repatriation of Bantu applied more specifically to the Western Cape, but as far as he was concerned it could apply to the whole of South Africa. This causes, as far as I am concerned, a certain amount of confusion and concern, because last year during the debate on the Bantu Affairs Vote we were given to understand that the policy of reducing the Bantu labour force did not apply to the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex. I think that we were justified in coming to this conclusion in view of what the Minister said in the Bantu Administration Vote debate on the 12th October, 1966. I quote from Hansard, column 4106&#x2014;</p>

<p>The position is simply as follows.

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">Deputy Minister</person>:</from>

<p>Port Elizabeth is a border-line case, because it is very close to the border areas.</p>

<p>Therefore I say that we assumed that this question of the moving of the Bantu labour force away from the Port Elizabeth area did not apply to us. We naturally welcomed that statement because we have a very useful and well-settled labour force, we did not wish it to be interfered with, and we were very happy to have that information from the Minister. But, Sir, in view of the Minister&#x2019;s remarks now, and the report of a statement made by the hon. the Minister of Planning which appeared in the Press, the position again becomes uncertain as far as the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area is concerned. I will now quote from <i>Die Burger</i> of 20th January, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Plan vir &#x2019;n verdelingslyn in Oos-Kaap-land, sodat die Kleurlinge en Bantoes elk &#x2019;n invloedsfeer verkry waarin arbeidsvoorkeur &#x2019;n rol speel, word genoem in &#x2019;n verklaring wat gister deur mnr. J. F. W. Haak, Minister Van Beplanning, in Kaapstad uitgereik is. Volgens die verklaring leen die Visrivier met verlenging noordwaarts langs die Katrivier en dan verder noord langs gemeenskaplike distriksgrense tot by Aliwal-Noord hom geografies tot so &#x2019;n verdeling op &#x2019;n grondslag van arbeidsvoorkeur. Oos van die Vis Kat/Aliwal-Noordlyn waar die Bantoe-invloeds-feer oorheersend is, kry die Bantoe arbeidsvoorkeur en wes van die lyn die gekleurde. Dit beteken dat die gekleurde nie oos van die lyn bestendig behoort te word nie.</block>

<p>Now the position appears quite different as far as Port Elizabeth is concerned. We are now west of this particular line and it means that the Port Elizabeth area falls in an area where Coloured labour gets the advantage. It appears now that the old Eisselen line, as we knew it, has been scrapped, and this new line established which is referred to as the Cat-Fish line. We must now assume that as far as we are concerned we must also be subject to the same labour disturbances as can be anticipated in the Western Cape. I can say without hesitation that if it is going to be disastrous in the Western Cape&#x2014;as we anticipate it will be&#x2014;then it will be even more disastrous in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area. I say &#x201C;more disastrous&#x201D; very advisedly, because we in the Port Elizabeth area and in the Eastern Cape are even more dependent on Bantu labour than is the case in the Western Cape. One has only to study the statistics of the area to have this fact confirmed.</p>

<p>In the first instance Port Elizabeth has a settled Bantu population of 158,000 souls of whom 40,000 are working males. Of this entire labour force there are at the present time only 134 who are unemployed. It shows, Sir, that that Bantu labour force is in full employment. To make matters even more serious from our point of view, we in Port Elizabeth&#x2014;because of our settled labour force and unlimited water supplies&#x2014;are expecting a growth rate in that area of something in the region of 7 per cent per annum. It is clear that this anticipated expansion will absorb all the Bantu labour which becomes available in the foreseeable future. In fact one of the prerequisites of this expansion which will play an important role in increasing the national productivity is this settled labour force which we have in Port Elizabeth. Port Elizabeth cannot afford to have this labour force disturbed in any way.</p>

<p>In addition the people of Port Elizabeth have gone out of their way and spent a great deal of money to provide adequate housing for the Bantu who reside in Port Elizabeth. No less than R15 million has been spent on housing for the Bantu. So I feel that those people will feel very upset indeed if there has to be any retrenchment of this labour force which they are fortunate to have now.</p>

<p>Apart from the industrial expansion and apart from the industries which are presently active in Port Elizabeth, a tremendous number of Bantu are recruited in the reserves each year to augment the labour force which we have there. Not only are the S.A.R. making use of recruited labour, but there is tremendous <span class="col_1185-1186" refersTo="page_0610"/>road construction work being executed which requires Bantu labour. The municipality is also busy at the present time extending the natural infra-structure of the city, and the work makes great demands on the use of imported Bantu.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, I think that I have made it quite clear that we in that area are in no position whatsoever to lose any of our presently active Bantu labour force. If it is the intention of the Government to replace the Bantu with Coloured labour, it is interesting to see what the figures are in relation to the Coloured labour force. We find that at the present time there is a Coloured population of some 93,000, of whom 20,000 are employed at the present time. There is no unemployment to speak of and Coloureds are able to find work very readily. This again emphasizes the fact that there is nobody available to replace any displaced Bantu workers. There is no influx control over Coloureds entering the area and all who come in are readily absorbed and readily employed. It must be apparent, therefore, that there is no Coloured labour available whatsoever to take the place of any Bantu who may be moved to the Transkei areas. In this connection it is rather interesting to read something that appeared in <i>The Farmer&#x2019;s Weekly</i> of 8th February of this year, which I now quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lieutenant-Colonel J. J. de Wet Steyn, District Commandant of the King William&#x2019;s Town police, recently issued a three-point safety plan for Border farmers near African areas at a meeting of the Border Farmers&#x2019; League. He said that the police could not keep pace with the gowing African population. The problem arose because there were almost 10,000 Africans in the Stutterheim area and only 700 of them had been provided with employment.</block>

<p>I raise this little point&#x2014; it might be an insignificant point&#x2014;because we in Port Elizabeth are concerned that, if these people have to move back to the areas whence they came, they will be going to areas, as this little cutting illustrates very amply, where there will be no employment for them. Thus the position of control will become even worse.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, on behalf of the people of the Port Elizabeth area, I must emphasize very strongly that we are against this policy of the Government if it is to apply to Port Elizabeth also. We do not want any meddling in our labour force. We are not quite clear as to the position. We should like to hear from the Government what is intended in regard to the Port Elizabeth area, and we will be very grateful to have an answer in that respect as soon as possible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that with the setting of the sun outside the feelings in this House have also cooled off. It gives me greater courage to raise the subject on which I should like to say a few words. Since the year 1910, 887 hon. members have been elected to this hon. House. Soon, after the election at Worcester, it will reach the interesting figure of 888. What is interesting is that 885 of these hon. members have made their maiden speeches in this House. The 886th one now wants to try to do so. The other one never did. He was elected to the House of Assembly, but he never got here. In the past few days, while I was sweating here in many conflicts of soul and nerves, I frequently wondered whether that friend had not been the most fortunate of all.</p>

<p>In the days and months that have passed since the death of my predecessor, the late Dr. Verwoerd, great and capable men have paid tribute to him in this House. You know, because you had the privilege to be here. The people of South Africa paid tribute to him. The aged shook their heads and told themselves that never in all their years had they seen anything like that. The little children stopped their play and wondered wide-eyed what had happened, because South Africa had visibly come to a standstill. Thus the people and the country paid tribute to him.</p>

<p>To-day I should like to pay tribute to him by order of my voters, not as a Prime Minister, but as member of the House of Assembly and worthy member of parliament, which he was to our constituency, Heidelberg. Our happy association with him began in the year 1958, when the then member of Parliament, Mr. Stephen Eyssen, did not stand for election again and a small group among us had already noticed the potentialities of the then Minister of Native Affairs. We persuaded him and he stood for election in Heidelberg. Since then, until six months ago, it was our pleasant privilege to follow the road of South Africa step by step in the company of our great M.P.</p>

<p>Shall we ever forget how he returned time and again to his constituency, despite the pressure of his work, to attend his constituency management meetings faithfully. Three times a year he regularly addressed report-back meetings in his constituency. He granted an interview to every voter, large or small, rich or poor, yes, no matter how humble, who wanted one. None of their affairs was too small or too insignificant for him.</p>

<p>Shall we ever forget how proud we were in our constituency when our M.P. led our nation into the long desired land of the Republic? When many doubted, the one beautiful facet in his life, namely his great faith, was once again a light on his way and a rock under his foot. He gave his people and his people gave him the Republic of South Africa. Shall we ever forget how his farsightedness unfolded to become the vision of a prophet, and how he led our country timeously out of the Commonwealth? Who would want to be in the Commonwealth to-day?</p>

<p>How clearly his patriotism and his faith in South Africa came to the fore when he spoke <span class="col_1187-1188" refersTo="page_0611"/>about the Orange River Scheme. Then he saw 20 years ahead in his mind&#x2019;s eye, as we may perhaps see it in 20 years&#x2019; time. In his mind&#x2019;s eye he saw the beautiful irrigation farms, the great power generating installations, the heavy and light industries, the businesses, but above all he saw his contented, prosperous and happy compatriots.</p>

<p>Constantly at his side was a tiny and friendly woman. To him she was a source of strength and an inspiration, and to the mothers and daughters of Heidelberg and South Africa she was an example worthy of following. And in years to come she will be lonely, she will be terribly lonely, because the great figure that protected her and that frequently protected his people, is no more. I therefore want to appeal to our people that we should in future regard her as the mother of the people of South Africa, that we should treat her accordingly, that we should give her the love that would embrace her, for is that not what she gave to us, everything she could give? She is indeed a living, a beautiful legacy from H. F. Verwoerd to his people.</p>

<p>There is an old proverb that says that to be truly great one must also be small. How frequently we had the privilege to see him like that. When he visited the constituency and relaxed on his farm, it was our privilege to see him enjoy himself in his motor boat like a young boy, to see him take the children of his friends on boat trips, and how, when he and his friends travelled across his farm by car, he always refused to let anybody but himself open the gates. For even if there were boys in the car, he always said that he was the host and that he would never allow his guests to do that.</p>

<p>What has left an ineradicable impression was the day we went to help him cut fodder on his farm. That night, when the work was done and the workmen, about 20 of them, were on the lorry and ready to leave, he, the great Prime Minister, the acknowledged Western leader, walked up to the lorry, looked up with a smile, lifted his hand at the workmen and said: &#x201C;Thank you, men, thank you very much, and fare you well.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What was also typical was the faith that emanated from his entire being when he persuaded the superstitious Bantu to be ferried across the Vaal River. When his farming on the Vaal River started, his fields adjoined the Vaal River, that is, on the Transvaal side and on the Free State side. Credulous, lacking in faith and superstitious as the Bantu are, they at first refused to cross the Vaal River to the fields on the opposite side. That meant that they had to travel seven miles by road every day to cross a bridge to the fields on the opposite side. For some weeks this detour claimed valuable work hours. The first week-end Dr. Verwoerd visited the farm he solved the problem. That Saturday morning he invited the workmen to get into his boat with him. They looked at him, got into the boat with him, and it is unnecessary to say that that problem of superstition was solved, because up to that point the Bantu had believed that an invisible spirit lurked in the waters of the Vaal River.</p>

<p>His faith in South Africa, in his Creator, in the future was infinite. Thus we in the constituency will always remember that his last words to us were: &#x201C;South Africa will find oil and the rain will come again.&#x201D; The rain came again, but he was no longer there. But every time the rain comes we in the constituency will hark back with grateful hearts, but then we will also realize and know with grateful hearts what he would have wanted, namely that we should put our shoulders to the wheel and continue building our Republic of South Africa, his Republic which he loved so very, very dearly.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a tradition in this House to congratulate a new member on his maiden speech. I may say that on this occasion it is a real pleasure to congratulate a new member on a speech which in its way has been one of the nicest tributes that we have heard to the late Prime Minister in this House. When I congratulate the hon. member, I do so most sincerely and wish him well in the company in which he now finds himself.</p>

<p>In the course of this debate we have not heard much of finance, and yet the fact remains that every single one of us wants to see South Africa economically strong because on that economic strength can be based not only the prosperity and advancement of the entire population, but also military strength which can safeguard us from dangers outside. It is for that reason that in the course of the past few days attention has been directed to certain aspects of Government policy which in themselves not only would interfere with the normal economic development of the country, but might by forcing up costs of production and by forcing uneconomic development have an effect upon the economic growth of the country and the well-being of all its citizens.</p>

<p>I think attention has been directed particularly to two aspects of that policy. The one aspect is the question of the establishment of industry in border areas subject to certain privileges and certain inducements, and the other aspect is the attempt to limit the labour force in certain areas and in fact to try to direct it away.</p>

<p>I think that we on this side of the House have felt that both those activities were in danger of having an inflationary effect upon the economy. It was for that reason that particular attention has been directed to it. We have been met with replies which would seem to indicate, certainly in so far as the Western Cape is concerned, that the industrialists in this area supported this policy, and that in so far as the farmers in the Western Province were concerned they in their turn supported this policy.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I have had great difficulty in appreciating how that situation can arise. I am <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_0612"/>faced with a statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister dealing with this question of the industrialists in the area. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek wil nou kom na die Wes-Kaap en ek wil aan die agb. Leier van die Opposisie sê dat hierdie vermindering van vyf persent wat ek aan die hand gedoen het, geheel aanvaar is deur die Kamer van Nywerhede van Wes-Kaapland. Ek het een van hul vergaderings bygewoon en die posisie duidelik gemaak. Ons het lank daaroor gesels en een na die ander &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2014;and the Deputy Minister mentioned certain people&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; het hulle opgestaan en gesê dat hulle daardie beleid ondersteun.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Daardie beleid&#x201D; in this respect is the 5 per cent reduction annually of the Bantu labour force in this area. The names mentioned are those of Mr. Mossop, Mr. Marks and Mr. I. L. Back.</p>

<p>I see also that this Deputy Minister gave an interview to the <i>Financial Gazette</i> last weekend in which he claims that he has received unanimous support from industries and farmers in the Western Cape to carry out his policy of clearing the Western Cape of Bantu labour. He said that both the Cape Chamber of Industries and the Federated Chamber of Industries have given him the assurance of their full support. He spoke of deputations from the farming community who had also come to see him, and from no one has he received any complaint.</p>

<p>I, of course, cannot query the word of the hon. gentleman, but if that is the sort of support that he is getting, then it seems to me a little bit extraordinary that we have had a certain statement, after his visit to the Cape Chamber of Industries, by certain of the leading officials of that Chamber. First of all there was the speech made by the retiring President of the Cape Chamber of Industries, after the hon. the Deputy Minister had visited that Chamber. In that speech the retiring President says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration attended the October meeting of the Chamber&#x2019;s Executive Council, it was pointed out to him that the Chamber had never opposed influx control because without it the migration of Bantu would get out of hand. We also informed him that the Chamber supported the utilization of Coloured labour as the Coloureds were indigenous in our region, but on the basis stated by Mr. Leslie Barrett when he was President, that Coloureds were available and adaptable. The Chamber continues to contend that the policy of replacing Bantu by Coloureds is only viable on the basis of Coloureds being available and adaptable for work requiring to be performed. On the facts presented to him, we showed that industry in the Western Cape is only a marginal user of contract labour. Mr. Blaar Coetzee himself said that in this matter the industrialists were good boys. It is, therefore, regrettable that the good boys are at present being given a very bad time. Various firms which have labour categories which have been approved for Bantu labour because the Department of Labour can find no Coloureds to work in these categories, have recently been refused authorization to bring in replacements of Bantu employees when they return to their homelands. Replacements have been sought in these instances, not additional numbers of Bantu workers. Authorization has, however, been refused through shortage of housing. There is now adjudged to be a shortage of accommodation for Bantu because the authorities concerned have come to the conclusion that over-crowding has occurred in the Bantu townships. The thinning out process begun has been abrupt and drastic, and has involved the refusal to allow any replacements. Dr. Verwoerd, when he was Minister of Native Affairs, and his successor in that portfolio, Mr. De Wet Nel, and recently the present Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, declared that the reduction of Bantu labour in the Western Cape should not be over-hasty and should not disrupt industry. What is being done at present is hardly in accord with this dictum and stated policy, because the action which is being taken is hasty and disruptive. Manufacturing companies supplying essential materials to the furniture industry and the building industry, and important products for agriculture and export, are among those most seriously affected. Other services outside secondary industry are affected, but meanwhile the Railways have increased their intake of Bantu into the Western Cape, which they are justified in doing because, like various manufacturing industries, the can find no local alternative for certain manual work.</block>

<p>That speech was by the retiring President, Mr. Mossop, from whom the hon. gentleman claimed support. This speech was made on the 24th November, 1966, after the visit of the Deputy Minister to the October meeting.</p>
