<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was referring to the new system of equalizing tax rates which is being introduced for farmers. I was about to refer to a leading article in an important agricultural journal in which, to my mind, incorrect statements were made. I just want to refer to that in brief. It is an important agricultural journal of 4th April of this year. The leading article contained, <i>inter alia,</i> the following statement (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What equalization amounts to is, in brief, that a farmer will not be taxed on that year&#x2019;s income but on the average of a number of years.</block>

<p>That of course is a misleading statement which must be corrected. What this system amounts to is that under the new system a farmer will in fact be taxed on his actual income for any particular year of assessment, but at a rate calculated on his average income for the year of assessment plus four previous years. This leading article also contained a further misleading statement. It stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Organized agriculture endeavoured to effect a system of equalizing income over a period of five years, but Dr. Diederichs <span class="col_3769-3770" refersTo="page_0500"/>did not find that practicable. After further discussions he decided on a system of equalizing tax rates and not income. In essence this is very much the same thing and an important concession is now being made to farmers.</block>

<p>I want to refer to the last sentence in particular, &#x201C;In essence this is very much the same thing and an important concession is now being made to farmers.&#x201D; That definitely is not the case ether. One does, for example, have the year in which a farmer shows a loss. Under the system which the Minister is now introducing, a farmer will pay no income tax in that year, and under the system of the equalization of income it may very easily happen that a farmer will have to pay tax if he shows a loss in any particular year. I now want to appeal to the agricultural journal concerned to give the correct information in this regard as soon as possible, and I also want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to issue a full statement in regard to this new system at the earliest possible opportunity in order to eliminate any misunderstanding.</p>

<p>In the quotation I read out. organized agriculture is given the credit for having made representations and it is quite right that credit should be given to organized agriculture, which advocated this system over a period of many years. But for the record I do regard it as being fair and necessary to say that this system is finally being put into operation by the hon. the Minister after intensive representations over a period of two years from National Party representatives of farming constituencies. In this regard I want to convey thanks and pay homage not only to our present Minister but also to the previous Minister of Finance as well as to the Secretary for Inland Revenue specifically for his patience and advice and for the sympathy he showed in this regard to our National Party representatives who discussed the matter with him.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to mention a few of the advantages of this system in view of the fact that the hon. member for Durban (Point) interjected here last night that the system was not what they had asked for. It may be that the system only goes half way, but in taxation proposals one can never give everyone everything they ask for. There must be fairness and reasonableness and other groups must also be taken into consideration. In point of fact the system we are now getting is the Australian system but has major advantages over the Australian system.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; Does the hon. member have any objection to other businessmen being given the same advantage as that now being given to the farmers&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>That is a question which should not be put to me but to the hon. the Minister. I am specifically discussing the proposals before us. As I was saying, this system is in fact the Australian system, but we do have a very important advantage over the Australian system. The Australian system is in fact limited to primary producers whose taxable incomes and average incomes do not exceed R8,000 per annum; and the system which the Minister is giving us has no limits, it has no ceiling, which is a tremendous advantage over the Australian system. Speaking of the R8,000 per annum income group, I just want to furnish a few figures to illustrate in what way this equalization of rates benefits this R8,000 per annum income group.</p>

<p>If a farmer earns R40,000 over a period of five years which is made up as follows over that period of five years&#x2014;R5,000 for the first year, R10,000 for the second year, R4.000 for the third year, R10.000 for the fourth year, and R11,000 for the fifth year, his taxes, calculated on the tax rates for last year, will be the following under the old system and under the new system, respectively. Under the old system he will pay R6,926 over that period of five years. Under the system of the equalization of tax rates he will pay R5.746. Therefore he will pay R1.180 less over that period of five years. There is, of course, another side to this picture. If a farmer suddenly experiences a year in which his income is low, after a year in which his income was high, the shoe will pinch on the other foot. For that reason I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to introduce attractive savings methods so that a farmer may follow a Joseph&#x2019;s policy in good years by making provision for difficult years. But I want to agree wholeheartedly with the Australian author, A. B. Cleland, who stated the following in regard to this matter in a recent publication&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is difficult to lay down any general rules that will apply in all cases, but it is felt that where the averaging provisions apply every year, irrespective of the amount Of income, the overall result should be a no benefit to the taxpayer.</block>

<p>Just before resuming my seat, I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions. In Australia the equalizing principle applies to the entire income of a person, even if farming income forms a small part of his income. What is the position going to be here&#x003F;</p>

<p>In addition I want to put the question whether we should not have a definition of &#x201C;farmer&#x201D; for the purposes of this new system. As you know. Sir. our Income Tax Act contains no definition of &#x201C;farmer&#x201D; and the whole matter is based on decided cases. In Australia, &#x201C;primary procedure&#x201D; includes fishermen. I want to conclude by thanking the hon. the Minister once more for this system. It will bring about a much better balance in the annual obligations of a farmer whose income is subject to marked annual fluctuations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad has raised the question of the <span class="col_3771-3772" refersTo="page_0501"/>tax concessions which the hon. the Minister of Finance has granted to the farming community. It is not necessary for me to say that we on this side of the House welcome this measure. We had hoped that the concessions would go a little further, but at this stage we express our gratitude for the fact that concessions have in fact been made. I think we must also applaud the hon. member for Kroonstad for having raised this matter, because quite obviously there has been confusion about the matter in the press and certainly the quicker this matter is cleared up the better.</p>

<p>I listened with interest in the previous debate to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration when he said that every Minister accepted that there was room for improvement in their respective Department. Obviously we on this side concur with that. We believe that there is plenty of room for improvement in all the Government Departments. The Minister went on to say that it was the honest and earnest endeavour of every Minister to see that these improvements were brought about. We accept that. We think it is a very laudable statement and we look forward to this improvement which he has offered us.</p>

<p>Now I wish to refer to one particular aspect of the activities of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, namely the Soil Conservation Department, and the manner in which the Department of Technical Services is handling this particular department. I really believe that if there is one side of the activities of this Government that is in real need of improvement, and where we must really look to the Minister to see that the improvement is brought about, it is in this Soil Conservation Department. I have listened in recent months to statements which have been made by the Ministers of Agriculture, the Minister and his Deputy, and I must say that I have been encouraged to see what a realistic attitude they are taking to this problem. It is gratifying to know that the Ministers responsible for administering this most important department do realize the urgency of the problem. We have a Soil Conservation Act. I think that Act has been on the statute book for some 20 years, but if we look around the country and see what is happening then we must come to one of two conclusions. We must come to the conclusion that ether the Soil Conservation Act is not an effective measure or that the administration of the Act is not being effectively carried out. Sir. the Act as we have it is an excellent piece of legislation. It can only be so because it was placed on the Statute Book by this side of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWELL</person>:</from>

<p>But I feel that the administration of it leaves a lot to be desired. I do not believe that it is a wise thing to come along here and criticise the Government for the way in which they are administering the Act and to point out to them that soil conservation continues apace without putting to the Government certain suggestions that might assist in this matter, and during the course of my speech I propose to do just that.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are concerned and perturbed that such a big proportion of the national budget has to be spent on Defence, but we have said time and again that where it is necessary to defend this country against all the military perils that might beset it, we endorse and second every cent that is appropriated for Defence, but at the same time we must warn that we will watch very carefully how that money is spent. Many valuable man hours are being taken up by the young men in our country serving in the armed forces and we must be quite sure that every one of those man hours is being wisely used and wisely spent. Sometimes one wonders if that is actually happening. As far as our fight against soil erosion is concerned, I think the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services himself used the words &#x201C;we must wage war against soil erosion&#x201D;. Sir, I think that is a very sound appreciation of the situation. This matter is so serious that it demands that we wage war upon it. I can assure the Minister that every penny that is appropriated or budgeted for the combating of soil erosion will be fully endorsed from this side of the House because we do realise the urgency of this great problem that beset the country, but at the same time, as in the case of Defence, we will watch very carefully to make sure that every cent that is being spent in the fight against soil erosion is being spent wisely and well.</p>

<p>There are thousands of farmers in the country today who are deeply perturbed about the present trend of matters; they are deeply perturbed that the measures which have been taken hitherto in our fight against soil erosion have not been effective. They stand there prepared to do their duty. I think that most farmers in this country today are very soil conservation conscious but they are hamstrung by the fact that they simply have not got the financial resources to undertake the works which they would so keenly do if they were in a position to do so. Sir, I think we must look at some of the reasons why the farmer himself today is not in a position to undertake the works which are so essential. If we look at the geography of our country we will see that the greater extent of our country is farmed in a pastoral manner. Due to the rainfall and the topography of our country, pastoral farming takes place on the bulk of this southern tip of Africa. It is also true to say that wherever you have pastoral farming, that is where you find the greatest incidence of soil erosion. The reason is simply to be found in the fact that where you have stock you have over-grazing and over-tramping of veld and in consequence you expose the soil and the earth to the ravages of soil erosion. It is in these areas therefore that we find the problem in its most urgent state and it is with particular reference to these areas that I wish to make my remarks here this morning. Sir, we must take into account the <span class="col_3773-3774" refersTo="page_0502"/>fact that in these vast areas where pastoral farming is undertaken the main products, products like wool and mohair, have to be marketed overseas. We rely on the international market for the price we get. There is nothing that we can do about it; we have to take whatever price is offered. If that price is low we simply have to accept it and make the best of it. Over the last five years the price of wool and mohair has been low. The price of wool, for instance, has been in the region of 36 cents per lb. and there has been nothing that the farmer has been able to do about it. He has to take the 36 cent per lb. and try to defray his running cost and his living cost out of it, but at the same time he is subject to all kinds of economic storms, over many of which he has no control whatsoever. Sir, I just want to quote a few of these items to which the producer of wool is subject and which make his living and his farming conditions more and more difficult. For instance, over the last five years the cost of labour has gone up about 100 per cent and there is nothing that he can do about it. He simply has to meet his labour costs out of the same 36 cents per lb. that he has been getting for his wool over the last five or six years. Farm labour is becoming more sophisticated; it demands better living conditions and who is responsible for building the housing for that labour&#x003F; The farmer is responsible: the provision of housing is costing far more and here in the Cape Province when he builds better houses the Divisional Council comes along and places extra taxation on the very houses which he provides. Apart from that, the farmer also has to provide schools for his labour. Farm labour today demands that its children shall have the privilege of attending school, and the wool farmer has to accept the responsibility for providing that schooling. All this is costing him more and he has to meet these costs out of the same 36 cents that he is getting for his wool. Apart from that there is the interest on his capital, and capital plays a very large part in the financing of an agricultural undertaking, indeed the most important part. What happens to the farmer here&#x003F; He invested money, much of which he borrowed at 6 per cent interest, and today he finds that he is being charged 8 percent, and the return on that capital has not increased in a like manner. All along the line therefore the farmer is on The losing side. The price of tractors, an essential part of farm equipment, has gone up by something like 60 to 70 per cent over the last five or six years. Repairs to his tractors, which play such an important part in the running expenses of the farm, have gone up considerably. The salary of the mechanic who does the job has gone up from R1.50 per hour five years ago to R3 per hour today. All this has to come out of the pocket of the farmer. Railway tariffs on wool, dieseline. petrol and lubricants have all gone up. All this has to be paid for out of the same 36 cents. Cement, a most important item in the fight against soil erosion, has gone up by 20 per cent in the last five years. The farmer lives way out in the bundu; he has to get his children educated. School fees have gone up and boarding fees have gone up by something like 20 per cent. Then last, but not least&#x2014;indeed probably the most important of all&#x2014;is the fact that the cost of fencing material which is such a basic requirement in the combating of soil erosion, has also gone up by something like 50 per cent in the last 15 years. Sir, we find this sorry story leading to this inescapable fact that when the farmer has met all these rising costs out of the constant price that he is getting for his product, there is no money at his disposal in his fight against soil erosion. I would say that the Government and the Ministers responsible for this department must take full cognizance of this fact; they must realise that the farmer is no longer in a position to undertake these essential works and that the Government simply have to play a far greater part than it has played in the past.</p>

<p>What are the problems that are facing the Department of Soil Conservation&#x003F; Do they realize that they have to play a bigger part&#x003F; They will simply have to do so otherwise soil erosion will continue in its devastating way. One of the problems of the department is that they have a shortage of staff. There is apparently a shortage of personnel in every Government department, but in this particular department the position is probably at its worst. Do you know, Sir. that in Rhodesia there is one soil conservation or extension officer to every 45 farmers, and I believe in this country the figure works out at something like one extension officer to every 700 farmers.</p>

<p>The fact remains that in Rhodesia, a smaller country than South Africa, the farmers are better served in this particular field than we are. I say that the only way in which the department can rectify this situation is by making more and more use of the farmers who are available to serve on soil conservation committees. They can play a really active and vital role in meeting the shortfall that the department suffers today in this particular matter. I was very pleased some four months ago when it was announced by the department that they were going to institute a system whereby farmers could be employed on a part-time basis to supplement the shortage of personnel in their particular department. I thought that this was a great step forward. As a matter of fact I had suggested if myself in a previous speech. I cannot claim that they reacted to my suggestion but quite obviously it was a step in the right direction. Sir. I said in this House previously that this was a sound system, but I investigated the matter and I found again that as in the case of so many other processes in this department, this matter was going to be bogged down because of red tape. These applicants had to fill in so many forms that it would probably take months and months before the personnel <span class="col_3775-3776" refersTo="page_0503"/>became available to the department. Sir, that is the very thing that has happened. I took the trouble to persuade two young gentlemen who were eminently suited for this task to apply for appointment to serve in this particular capacity. I enquired yesterday, after a lapse of three months, to find out whether these particular gentlemen had been signed on and given a job of work. Sir, they have not heard another word from the department. Here are these young men anxious to do a service but because of red tape nothing is happening, and that is happening right throughout the department, and as long as it continues to happen soil erosion will continue to wash this country away.</p>

<p>Another problem that the department faces is that quite obviously they are deploying their limited forces in the wrong way. and in saying this I wish to cast no reflection whatever on the very excellent personnel we have in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, in the soil conservation department. They are well-trained people. There are people there who are anxious to do a job of work, but as long as the supreme control in this department confines those people to their offices and does not get them out into the fields and on to the farms to do the work where it has to be done, this department will never really be an effective department. Sir, when a general is fighting a war he does not sit back in his office: he gets into his reconnaissance vehicle and he gets out in the middle of the fight, and that is where these people should be&#x2014;in the middle of the fight, on the farms, with the farmers, discussing matters with the farmers and planning together with the farmers, and to get these essential works done as speedily as possible. I can see no possible use in leaving these people in offices, drawing magnificent maps., making wonderful plans and keening hundreds and hundreds of records. I would like to know how man hours have been spent by these limited numbers of people that the department has at its disposal in doing work in offices that is in effect not really essential. My most earnest recommendation is that arrangements should be made to enable these people to get out to do practical work where practical work is crying out to be done. I want to make this suggestion that it might be wise for the department to have mobile offices where these people can do the necessary clerical work out in the country. If you confine them to their offices their efforts will never be effective. The farmers are looking for assistance from these officers; they want to meet them but they never see them. They never make contact with the farmers, and where they do make contact with the farmers, that contact is far too limited. I can assure the Minister that if he takes to heart what I am saving here, and if he institutes steps of this kind he will find that he will get the most gratifying results from the farming community.</p>

<p>Now. I come to another aspect of the matter. I say that the Department of Soil Conservation has failed to co-ordinate the experiments, many of them very effective ones, which are being conducted by the farming community itself, on its own initiative and out of its own desire to get on top of this problem. Sir, I am going to mention the name of just one, although I actually know of several. I have visited them and I have studied their methods. I want to quote the example of a farm in the Free State owned by Mr. Len Howe. Here is a farmer who in co-operation with an official of the department, whose name I do not wish to mention, has done an experiment in the Free State that must have a profound effect on the future farming methods in this country. That experiment has been going on for some time; I have seen it and I am most impressed. I honestly and sincerely believe that the pattern that has been established on that farm will set the pattern for farming in this country in the centuries to come. I believe that if those methods, which will probably have to be modified in the course of time, are implemented, it can have a profound effect on the earning capacity of the farmers in this country. Not only can it increase their income but it can also arrest soil erosion and, better still, it can improve the nature of the vegetation. Sir. we do not realize to what extent the country&#x2019;s good grass and bushes are being eaten and tramped away.</p>

<p>It is being discussed. Recently a visit to this particular farm was arranged by some 100 farmers. A prominent farmer in my area wished to go to that experiment and a too official in the Department of Agriculture said to him: &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t go and see this experiment because it has nothing in it as far as your farm is concerned.&#x201D; Sir, I take a very serious view of this.</p>

Sir, I do not wish to labour that point any more. I wish to come to my final point. I think sometimes there is a lack of planning; there is what my hon. Leader has often called a lack of foresight. I want to quote such an example now in the sphere of agriculture. As you know, Sir, we went through this very serious drought, the effects of which were most serious indeed on the farming land of our country. The Government I would say came with generous financial aid. I think we must commend them for the machinery that they set in motion to assist the farmers through this difficult period. But what happened when the first rains fell&#x003F; The first rains had hardly fallen&#x2014;there was just a sort of smell of rain&#x2014;when we heard an announcement from the department that the feeding subsidy schemes were now being suspended.</p>

<p>Surely if we are going to be wise in this matter, we should know that the most important time to look after our veld is after the first rains have fallen. I would say that if the department had acted wisely and with knowledge and with experience, they would have allowed these schemes to go on for a full two months after the first rains had fallen so that that veld which had been subject to such a drubbing would have had all the necessary time to recover. If that had been done I would have said that the department was acting wisely and well.</p>

<p>I find it a very pleasant task to participate in this Budget Debate immediately after the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I have the greatest appreciation for the way in which he made his contribution. I want to give you the assurance that he and I are of one mind, and I also think that not only all the members of this House, but also those who are really interested in South Africa are in complete agreement with what the hon. member said about the conservation of our soil. For my part I want to tell him that I appreciate very highly the constructive way in which he made his contribution to this debate. At this juncture I do not want to go fully into the matter in regard to whether all the points of criticism which he expressed were justified or not. I should prefer to let the emphasis fall on the points in regard to which we agree and are of the same opinion. We are all concerned about our soil. We know that we have a limited amount of agricultural land; we know that the supply of agricultural land in South Africa is extremely limited and we are all concerned about every square foot of soil which could have been conserved and which is being washed away. I am appreciative of the fact that the hon. member expressed his appreciation for the realistic approach of the hon. the Ministers concerned in the matter who have been entrusted with this task. The hon. member once again referred to expenditure on Defence. This has become quite a common pattern in this debate. He did not criticise it but referred to the large amounts which are being applied for Defence in this budget and had been applied in previous budgets. It is really a pity that it has become necessary for such large amounts to be spent on defence. However, I do not think there is anybody in this House who will deny that it is imperative that we in South Africa should be militarily defensible, that our young men should be trained, and that the necessary funds should be made available. We cannot criticize expenditure on defence, but I want to say here, as Paul did, we must do one thing and not neglect the other, and when I say that then I am not detracting from the attempts which have to be made to conserve our soil. The hon. member referred quite rightly to the shortage of trained and efficient staff, and he asked whether the available staff was always being utilized efficiently. I do not want to make any comment on that. I have every confidence in the departmental heads, in the Secretary for Agricultural Technical Services, in the Minister for Agricultural Technical Services and in The Deputy Minister. I believe that they will go out of their way to make use of the available staff in as efficient a way as possible. We know, however, that we are not dealing with robots but that we have to deal with the human factor. In one respect I cannot agree with the hon. member, and now I am talking specifically of the area which I have the privilege of representing here. I find there that the extension officers and the available staff do not spend their time sitting in their offices; we find them along the road and in the veld, and we find that they remain in contact with the farmers and the community which they are serving, and we want to express appreciation for the work they are doing. However, I do want to agree that we can perhaps go out of our way to obtain additional trained staff. The hon. member also referred to the announcement that farmers can be used to be of assistance in this major task, and that they may also be used after the administrative delay which was experienced with the appointment of persons who had made application. I do not know <span class="col_3779-3780" refersTo="page_0505"/>what happened in individual cases, but the policy is to use these people and I support this principle, just as the hon. member does. Although I say that, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to make an appeal to everybody, particularly those who have some influence on our school children and our university students, to make our young people at all times soil conservation conscious from an early age. In the same way as the child in Holland is encouraged to help keep the dykes intact, to maintain his country as his communal possession, so every young boy and girl, and every person in South Africa must be roped in to help conserve the soil. As I have already said, I am in full agreement with the positive suggestion which the hon. member made, and I find it very pleasant to participate in this debate after a member like that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. member for East London North is not present at the moment. I do not take it amiss of him for not being here, but I should like to refer to a statement which he made yesterday in an unguarded moment, and I think it would be a good thing if the hon. member were to rectify it. The hon. member referred to a case where two head of cattle in his neighbourhood simply disappeared off the face of the earth. Apparently the cattle had been slaughtered and all that remained was, to quote the hon. member&#x2019;s own words, the &#x201C;stomach dung&#x201D;. The hon. member referred to the circumstances existing there. He was referring to excess nonwhite labour on the farms and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The stock would just disappear. This problem is very serious, but we cannot blame those people for stealing as they are. They are jobless.</block>

<p>I regard that statement made by The hon. member in a very serious light simply because those people are unemployed does not mean that the hon. member can justify stock theft or say that they cannot be blamed for it. Theft is being directly encouraged by the hon. member here in the highest legislative council chamber of South Africa. He justifies the fact that people who are out of work commit theft. I repeat that it is very likely that the hon. member made this statement in an unguarded moment and I should be glad if he would rectify it because I regard it in a very serious light that in this House, which offers us all a forum, people should be told that they can steal merely because they do not have a job. Mr. Speaker, under the United Party Government we experienced conditions like these in South Africa in the past. On the Witwatersrand I saw 19,000 young men and women walking around looking for work. They could not get work and they queued up in front of labour bureaux looking for a job, but that was no justification for them to commit theft. It was due to the circumstances. I repeat, in all fairness, that I cannot let that statement of the hon. member pass unanswered. As I have already said, I think he did it in an unguarded moment and that is why I hope that as soon as he is afforded an opportunity to do so he will rectify the matter. If the hon. member&#x2019;s statement remains unqualified it could create a serious situation here in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the past few years, but particularly during 1966, the prevailing drought dealt agriculture a serious economic blow&#x2014;we are all aware of that. Now I want to state here that this damage cannot be undone by good rains in one year. We must not expect super-human achievements from agriculture. We must not expect it to be able to make up the backlog in one good year and undo completely the damage which was done. We cannot but be grateful for the assistance which has already been granted to agriculture by the Government, and yet I am pleading here today that the farmer and his problems be approached with greater circumspection. In those years when he was plagued by droughts, by elements outside his control, he had to incur obligations, obligations not only in his own interests, but also in the interests of agriculture as a whole. It was, therefore, in the national interest that he had to incur those obligations, because the farmer has to be kept on the land. The Government did not find it possible to help all the farmers. That is why there were those who had to go and borrow money at expensive rates of interest from private bodies in order to remain on the land. Because these farmers happened to be in a better financial position and because their credit standing was greater and they were, therefore, able to receive assistance from private bodies, such as commercial banks, does not mean that they are a less important unit in our agricultural industry, or as far as the task and function which they perform in agriculture is concerned. That is why these people should also be treated with great circumspection and sympathy. I do not have enough knowledge at my disposal to be able to say what steps should be taken to combat inflation successfully. However, I do know that it is the task of each one of us to make his own humble contribution and to try and influence the people with whom he comes into contact to do without luxury items so that we will be able to restrict inflation. However, there are certain essential items which we cannot do without. In agriculture, for example, there are certain essential things which agriculture cannot do without. In cases like that the agriculturist was forced to go and borrow money from private bodies. It is that person who is now being hard-hit by high rates of interest. I want to plead that we should treat these people, who were forced to incur loans of that nature, with a large measure of sympathy. I have already said that the present crop alone will not enable them to meet all their obligations. The young Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is doing a tremendous task, although it has not been in the field for long. I want to plead that we do not express a premature <span class="col_3781-3782" refersTo="page_0506"/>judgment on its activities. As far as I am concerned, I am convinced that it is serious in its intention to help agriculture, to make working capital available at a lower rate of interest, to help the young farmer to obtain money, and, where there are uneconomic units, to consolidate them. We know that that is the policy and we know that the hon. the Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Water Affairs has already emphasized this strongly. We are grateful for that. However, there are problems, but I believe that in time it will be possible to eliminate these problems. But it is essential that we should help these young farmers by consolidating uneconomic units. The question of land barons&#x2014;those people who have too much land&#x2014;is often discussed. But I want to suggest that, as far as I am concerned, a far greater evil is those people who possess too little land. Here we are faced with the problem of the injudicious sub-division of agricultural land. We are in a responsible position here, and that is why we must assume responsibility for pointing out certain matters. The logical consequence of this process will be that we will ultimately have fewer farmers in South Africa. It therefore remains our task to see to it that the smaller number of farmers are able to maintain an efficient enterprise. It is of no avail having a large number of farmers in the rural areas when some of them are suffering hardships. We must consolidate, therefore, and see to it that economic units are formed so that all farmers can make a proper living. I am not only pleading for this in the interests of the farmer, but also in the national interests of our country. It is imperative that the farmer of South Africa be placed on a strong economic foundation. He must be placed in a position where it will not be necessary for him to be continually asking the State for assistance. On the contrary, it should be made possible for him to build up his own capital so that in times of drought, times which we will continually be experiencing in South Africa, he will be able to finance himself. That is why I say that this state of affairs should be approached with great caution.</p>

<p>It is emphasized here each year, and has also been emphasized in this debate, that the farmers of South Africa have been entrusted with a task, a task which is making increasingly greater demands. This task is to feed a steadily increasing population, a population which is growing not only in numbers, but one which is steadily maintaining a higher standard of living. The millions of nonwhites in our country are also maintaining an increasingly higher standard of living. Their eating habits are continually changing. It is the task of agriculture to meet this growing demand. That is why we all have a task in regard to agriculture. We are grateful for what has already been done in this connection, and we are convinced that our hon. Ministers and their Departments will continue to keep a watchful eye on this sector of our economy.</p>

<p>Again I want to ask here that we should, in our research, pay more attention to the standardization of agricultural implements. I am concerned about the state of affairs which has arisen in South Africa in this connection over the years. We find that agricultural implements which are purchased become outdated very rapidly. That does not mean to say that these implements have been used up in the service of agriculture, but only that better implements have been introduced to replace the old ones. That is why I am pleading for a greater degree of standardization of agricultural implements.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>We must have a smaller variety of implements. The result of that will be that we will need a smaller variety of spares and, consequently, fewer agencies will have to be erected at tremendous capital expense to accommodate the large variety of spare parts and make them available to the farmer. It is the farmer who in the long run pays for the building as well as for the implements and their spare parts. That is why I say that the time has come for us to think very seriously in the direction of greater standardization as one of the aids to making the means of production cheaper. The country must take cognizance of the fact that the farmer is only able to deliver his products on the market as cheaply as his means of production enables him to do so.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that there is one safe reassurance which we do have, and that is that in the place of his predecessor we have a Minister of Finance who is very sympathetic towards the inhabitants of our country. He is not a Minister who will necessarily take popular steps, but the steps which he will in fact take will be in the interests of a sound economy in South Africa. I think our farmers can rest assured in the knowledge that the National Party will govern for many years to come in South Africa. Up to now we have had no properly-organized plan of attack from the Opposition. There was no real pattern in their argument. We may conclude from that they are not serious about ever coming into power again. They know, therefore, that they are safe and that they will not be called upon to accept this responsible task in regard to the country. On the contrary. We may rest assured in the safe knowledge that the National Party will continue to govern the country for many years to come. That is the greatest reassurance which we can give to the nation of South Africa in the political sphere.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad in regard to the contribution made by the hon. member for Walmer. In fact, I think the hon. member for Walmer is the only person on the opposite side of the House who has up to now in this Session made any contribution to agricultural matters.</p>

<p><span class="col_3783-3784" refersTo="page_0507"/>It is significant that as the condition of our farmers, since the parliamentary session last year, has changed with the coming of rain, the tremendous propaganda which has been made in regard to our farmers has also decreased. I want to dwell for a moment on this aspect and consider how this propaganda began. Agriculture has always been the first sector to be exploited in the attempt to bring the United Party back into power. I have taken a great deal of interest in the contributions to and the behaviour of the United Party in regard to agriculture over the past few years. As is the case in all other fields, the Opposition have not availed themselves of these fine opportunities to make a contribution, a constructive contribution, to agriculture. Their criticism has merely been destructive&#x2014;there was nothing constructive about it. In 1948 they began to make propaganda in regard to agriculture and the alleged decline of the farmer and his product. [Interjection.] It comes as no surprise to me that, after 18 years of decline, the interjections and arguments from hon. members on the opposite side continue to indicate that they are still in a state of ignorance. In 1948 there were people who blamed me personally because I had helped to put the U.P. into power. They blamed me and said that we were heading for a famine in this country, (that people would not have the money to buy our products and that they would, therefore, lie and rot. Those same people who blamed the National Party and said that the party would be the cause of a decline in our agricultural industry, those people who were so pessimistic about their future&#x2014;where are they today&#x003F; Those same people in my constituency are today, in their scores, in their hundreds, members of the National Party. They have joined the N.P. because they have lost confidence in the propaganda of the U.P. Over the years the United Party has been conjuring up spectres in regard to the N.P. I do not want to say that their stories were misleading, but they were, nevertheless, distorted. The stories in regard to the policy of the Government and the situation of our country were distorted. The U.P. hoped that (they would influence the people of South Africa by conjuring up these spectres along the road being taken by the National Party. What has become of those spectres&#x003F; Their corpses are lying heaped up along the political wayside in South Africa. They have died off one after the other. Where are they today&#x003F; Not one of the U.P.&#x2019;s predictions have come true.</p>

<p>I want (to tell the U.P. and hon. members on the opposite side that their stories are no longer making any impression on our people. Their distortions of the true state of affairs are no longer being accepted. They are people who do not know the ordinary man or the ordinary farmer. Our people are mature, they have the ability today to judge matters and their future for themselves. Why must their intelligence be underestimated&#x003F; That is why I say that, although our farmers did suffer hardships and, although there are some of them who are still suffering hardships, their judgment and common sense in very sound. That is why they know whom to support and whom to trust in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell on (the actions of the Opposition. I want to try and make a contribution here in regard to our agricultural interests. I represent a constituency which consists almost exclusively of agriculturists. It is a fact today that agriculture does not have a specific framework within which estimates may be made. There is no framework or norm in respect of which the agricultural policy can be laid down is it may be done in other departments because our agriculture is unpredictable and subject to changeable circumstances. That is why our agricultural ministers have such a great responsibility and why it is so important to them to watch developments to the best of their abilities and to judge what /the future is going to bring. I want to congratulate our agricultural ministers for having obtained, effected and provided so many things in these changing circumstances. They have met the requirements of agriculture to such an extent that the industry can continue in a way as close to normal as has ever been the case before. In these changing circumstances our population throughout the country has been fed as well as possible, and our farmers have been given as much assistance as was humanly possible.</p>

<p>I notice that in the Other Place propaganda was made in regard to the Orange River settlement, which falls within my constituency. I want to express my appreciation for the attention which the Government has been giving to this part of my constituency and its voters. They have gone through hard times, they have survived severe tests and disasters. Our agricultural departments have given those people every assistance the Opposition could have thought of giving. They have been given assistance in consolidating their debts&#x00B7; production loans have been granted; assistance for the purchase of seed has been granted. Loans for the purchase of fertiliser have been granted; assistance for repairs to their canals has been granted: assistance for repairs to their flood walls has been given; assistance for repairs to their storm water channels has been given; assistance in respect of implements has been given. They have been given fuel. Steps have even been taken to make funds available in case they are not able to pay their labourers. I am proud to be able to represent a constituency and people who have been accommodated a very great deal by the State. I am proud of our Government and the agricultural department. When these people were faced with disaster, five heads of departments were sent that area. The Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Deputy minister also went there. One can almost say that the departmental heads sacrificed 24 hours of their work in the interests of that part of my voters. On behalf of my voters I also want to express our gratitude for everything which has been done, and also for the interest which the <span class="col_3785-3786" refersTo="page_0508"/>hon. the Prime Minister has displayed in regard to their difficulties.</p>

<p>Because I want to make a contribution in respect of agriculture, I should like to express a few thoughts here. I do not in any way want to allege that our farmers are not at this stage going to flourish. Unfortunately my constituency is still suffering heavily under an unabated drought. I know that the farmers are going through a bitter time. The needs of these farmers will have to be seen to&#x2014;special concessions and special services will have to be arranged in order to save them. We know that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure is rendering a great deal of service to those farmers. I want to express my appreciation for what is being done; I also want to express my appreciation for what the Land Bank has done in recent times for these farmers. I notice in the report that there were 244 applications this year for bank loans, of which 235 have been approved. In these circumstances one appreciates the fact that these loans could be granted. Yesterday I found it interesting to learn from the hon. member for East London (City) that he was satisfied for a change with the production prices in our agriculture. He was quite a different man a year ago. In any case, there is no choice in the matter. I represent the interests of sheep farmers. Just look at what we have achieved during the past two, three years in respect of prices. Not only has the guaranteed price been increased, but we have recently been receiving an average of 5.2 per cent more than the guaranteed prices. It is true that a certain percentage of our farmers have been unfortunate, but 90 per cent of our farmers today are satisfied with this scheme. They adhere to it and they have asked for a request to be made in this House not to depart from this policy but to retain this agricultural scheme as far as possible. They are requesting that it should be developed and where possible, improved upon. As I have said, about 10 per cent of our farmers are unfortunately not receiving these prices owing to circumstances over which we often do not have control. That is why I want to request&#x2014;and I know that it is already receiving attention&#x2014;that the guaranteed prices for the wool farmers should to a certain extent be increased.</p>

<p>I want to refer here to a few other matters. We are receiving a very great deal of assistance and instruction from the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. There are various remedies which are being used today to combat internal parasites. Some of these remedies have an effectiveness of between 80 and 100 per cent, but unfortunately their prices are very high. Certain other remedies, remedies which are not as effective, are also being marketed to-day. I want to ask the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to give more specific attention to this matter in order to see to it that only remedies which are very effective and which fall within a reasonable price range, so that the farmer can spend money on it, appear on the market and that the other remedies which are not as effective disappear from the market.</p>

<p>There is another matter too which is associated with this. I wonder whether the South African Bureau of Standards cannot offer something with which these remedies can be applied. Recently I acquired seven one-dose injections from a certain co-operative with which these expensive remedies to which I have referred are injected. Not one of the seven was accurate. I want to ask that the S.A.B.S. should approve a standard injector with which these remedies can be applied, so that we can have a product on the market which will give us the efficiency we desire. It is recommended that these remedies be supplied in certain quantities, and if a sheep is injected with less than 60 cc&#x2019;s for example, the remedy is inefficacious. We cannot therefore allow that these expensive remedies be wasted in this way and do not have the desired result. That is why I am asking the Department to give some attention to this matter so that the remedies may be utilised efficaciously.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with a last thought. Years ago some of our farmers invested money with the State. I do not want to talk about the rates of interest which that money is earning today. Unfortunately many of the farmers who invested so much money at that time are in a position today where they need that capital but are not able at this stage to obtain it. I know of farmers who, at that time, invested more than R20.000 and whose money is stiff being held by the State but who cannot today get an overdraft from the Bank. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible to accommodate those farmers so that they may have that money at their disposal to continue their farming activities. This is a very important request, a request which not only I am making, it is also one which comes from the farmers I represent. They are asking whether they cannot be accommodated in this respect. That is why I am asking the Minister whether it is not possible to have something done in regard to this matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to associate myself with the previous speaker, and also make a request to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I have to do so in sincere acknowledgment to the hon. the Opposition and also to the hon. member for Walmer, who spoke earlier. He received praise for his speech, but in certain respects he did a great injustice to our agricultural officials in particular. Firstly, he said that the sheep farmer had to be satisfied with 35 cents a pound for wool, while the prices of production requirements were increasing. I ask the hon. member: Who is responsible for that price of 35 cents a pound received by the wool farmer&#x003F; Is it the Government&#x003F; Secondly, the hon. member referred to extension officers and said that a certain part of their office work was a waste of time. It is not fair of the hon. member not to specify which work is supposedly <span class="col_3787-3788" refersTo="page_0509"/>such a waste of time. Thirdly, the hon. member complained that our extension officers were doing so much less than the Rhodesian extension officers. I maintain that it is unfair to make such an allegation. There are far fewer farmers in Rhodesia than in this extensive country of ours; for that reason I think he did our extension officers a great disservice. They are certainly people who work very hard.</p>

<p>I also listened to the hon. member for East London (City). Yesterday afternoon he read a long extract from what Mr. Cilliers, director of the South African Agricultural Union, had allegedly said. It was a hoary old museum piece from which the hon. member quoted, because it still refers to pounds, shillings and pence. The hon. member also quoted Mr. Cilliers as using the word &#x201C;African&#x201D;. I know Mr. Cilliers, and I know he definitely does not refer to &#x201C;Africans&#x201D; when he means Bantu.</p>

<p>I consequently want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to make a gesture of acknowledgment towards the Opposition. I should like to ask that their agricultural politics be declared drought-stricken. That also includes the hon. member for Houghton. Apart from being politically drought-stricken, she is suffering from political blight, such as we find on maize. The flames are fanned, the molehills become mountains. Once they have been declared politically drought-stricken, I ask the hon. the Minister of Finance for a further subsidy of 50 per cent in order that they may appoint capable liaison officers to devise some positive ideas for them, because in this House they produce nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>A very fine speech has been made about soil erosion. Now it so happens that storm water which always flows along the same footpath causes serious erosion, and that is what is happening on that side of the House. Their political erosion has gone so far that from the bottom of their erosion dongas they are no longer able to see the beautiful fields in our agricultural landscape. In view of the fact that within the foreseeable future the Republic will be a one-party state as a result of the political erosion on that side of the House&#x2014;and it will be their own fault; it will be due to their own senility&#x2014;I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to grant a further subsidy. It can also be 50 per cent. We must find out whether on the stretch of state-owned land here in the Gardens we still have a few square yards available for some more statues. Once all the Opposition members have disappeared from the House, it will be a good idea to get that sculptor to erect another statue next to that of the Field-Marshal. I am thinking in particular of a certain general, a certain brigadier and a certain captain whose statues may be erected on that stretch of state-owned land. A further 50 per cent subsidy may be requested to display some political waxworks in the Parliamentary museum.</p>

<p>Speakers on agricultural matters on that side of the House make it very easy for one to address report meetings. In the first part of this debate I heard Opposition members raise very serious objections to any further allocations of State funds. They want State expenditure to be curtailed. Now they ask for more this and more that for agriculture. How does that tally&#x003F; The farmers have been given the voluntary choice of changing over to a voluntary equalization of tax rates. Now the United Party comes along all of a sudden and claims that honour for itself. For years organized agriculture, farming members on this side of the House and in particular the hon. member for Kroonstad have been working on this matter. The United Party discovered that and now they want to make opportunistic pleas for that just to catch a few votes. In farming language we would now call them political back riders. Hon. members on that side who are farmers will know very well what I am referring to. The farmers are fond of using that word&#x2014;back riders. I want to tell them that no matter how much they like riding on the back of the S.A.A.U. in this House, the outside world knows, organized agriculture in all the provinces&#x2014;even that of Natal, where they give their heartiest co-operation to the National Party Government and National Party members of the House of Assembly&#x2014;they all know that organized agriculture and the National Party members in Parliament deal with matters on merit. They know that we do not try to make political gain from matters in order to catch some votes. At my report meeting I am going to tell my farming voters that the United Party advocated in this House that State expenditure be curbed considerably&#x2014; consequently also State expenditure intended to render assistance to farmers in drought-stricken areas and elsewhere. Is it fair that the Opposition should want to treat our farming community this way, people who have had a hard time and who are still having a hard time in certain places, people who are still afflicted in the Karoo and in other parts of the Cape Province&#x003F; Is it fair that the United Party should want to deny these people State assistance on merit&#x003F; I think in this respect the Opposition has really shown its true colours in respect of the farmer. They insist on using the farmer as their political foot wiper.</p>

<p>I now want to come to co-operatives and the advantages they offer the consumer public in meeting the problem of the rising cost of living. During the no-confidence debate I asked who was responsible for these rising costs and for the inflation. The Minister of Finance replied quite unequivocally by calling the culprits to account. It is my sincere hope that the companies which show flourishing profits and which provide commodities to agriculture and to the consumer will not succeed once again in passing on their larger share in State financing to the consumer. I am referring specifically to the profiteering companies which are attuned to profit only and not to service as well. Here in Cape Town the bus workers are at present using their bargaining power to obtain higher wages, no matter how negatively. Why do they not use the bargaining power of their trade union positively, as is done by the farmers through their agricultural <span class="col_3789-3790" refersTo="page_0510"/>co-operatives, by entering into positive negotiations with the business world in order to reduce their cost of living&#x003F; If all bus-service staff united in an organized co-operative effort, they would be able to reduce their cost of living by 10 per cent within a month&#x2014;that is, they would be able to go 10 per cent further on their salaries and will thus be enabled to save. But they, as consumers, must take the initiative themselves, because commerce will not do that for them. Commerce did not do that for the farmer in agriculture ether. The organized farmers in this country set the example by co-operative buying and selling organizations. As a result the farmer of South Africa at present controls 80 per cent of agricultural economics himself. Without it he would simply not have been able to survive inflation, droughts and the risks involved in farming. These agricultural co-operatives are the channels through which they can effect liaison with the State to a large extent.</p>

<p>It is time our urban consumer masses gave thorough consideration to their bargaining power as buyers of consumer goods. The lack of organization among consumers in the cities and the resultant licence of the profit trade is a major cause of this rising cost of living and the concomitant inflation. Although the consumer himself controls the fate of his salary, as an individual he nevertheless has no bargaining power whatsoever in the face of well-organized commerce, just as in the thirties the farmer had no bargaining power whatsoever in the face of the profit trade. If the Government wants to do something good, it should establish a co-operative branch under the Department of Commerce and Industries, or of Economic Affairs, in order to give consumers positive guidance in this connection. In other words, what is needed is a section similar to that of the Registrar of Agricultural Cooperatives, which in the thirties, those difficult years for our farmers, helped to organize the agricultural co-operative sector. Lacking alert and fully-fledged co-operative consumers&#x2019; organizations, the cost of living will simply continue rising and demands for wage increases will continue and will follow the same pattern every year. What is as plain as a pikestaff is the fact that in this matter the consumer masses need purposeful guidance from the State with a view to its practical implementation. Without this active and positive guidance from the State the consumer will not succeed in achieving the objectives as outlined, because he is simply too badly informed on the advantages of co-operative buying and selling. He is also too completely at the mercy of the profit trade. With rare exceptions the profit trade will not take the initiative to help the urban consumer, just as it never assisted the farmer ether. The consumer will have to be taught to help himself by means of planned co-operative action. The sooner that is started in this country, the better.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wolmaransstad made a statement here, and took the hon. member for East London (City) to task because he allegedly approved of the fact that Bantu around the border area, in Mdantsane and so on, should steal. Now, that is not the case at all. We on this side by no means approve of theft in any form whatsoever. We merely stated that we understand why those people do steal. Surely understanding something is quite different to approving thereof.</p>

<p>Then we come to the hon. member for Prieska. He had much to say about the way we on this side have in the past&#x2014;according to him&#x2014;&#x201C;verdraaid&#x201D; things to the voters. If I may say so, if anybody is responsible for &#x201C;verdraaiing&#x201D;, then there is nobody more responsible than this Government and the National Party outside. They never ever state a thing as it is in fact but they twist it to suit their own purposes. That is exactly how they put across their policy to the people, a policy which they never carry out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (District) spoke here about droughts and said that the Opposition were in a drought area politically speaking. Talking about droughts, the worst drought that South Africa has ever had in its history is the drought of initiative, planning and foresight on the part of the Government which we are experiencing at the moment. They use, and they have used for years, the Budget as a cover up for their political failures. They have rationalized the extraction of these vast sums of money from the people by talking about patriotism. They say: &#x201C;Be patriotic&#x2014;and pay.&#x201D; They say it with the same monotonous regularity as we on this side are accused of being unpatriotic because we dare criticize the Government and its functioning. If it were not so pathetic it might have been amusing to see how hon. members on that side lay claim to all the good things, to all the little developments that have taken place as and where they are to be found.</p>

<p>Yet, in each and every instance for their failures they blame conditions outside, they compare their achievements to those of the outside world. Those are excuses for their failures. They say: &#x201C;It happens outside, so why must it not happen here&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Indeed, if we had an efficient and capable Government, where would South Africa not be&#x003F; You can take every single department.</p>

<p>We would not be in the position where, as has now been quoted twice in this House, we have been awarded an Oscar which in a matter of months has to be returned because it was granted for ineffectual action. No action has, in fact, taken place to warrant that. It has had no result. We had here a few days ago the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in discussing the developments of the Bantu Reserves, making the statement that agriculture was absolutely fundamental to this development, and indeed we agree with him that it is fundamental. Just as it <span class="col_3791-3792" refersTo="page_0511"/>is fundamental to the development of the homelands, so it is fundamental to the development of South Africa itself. It is important because we all appreciate that through it will come the food for the people and all the subsidiary services in connection with this industry, but what is happening&#x003F; We hear of areas which have been declared soil conservation areas; we hear of millions of morgen that have been declared as such, and we hear of planning taking place. What is the good, if we have all these areas declared soil conservation areas and all these plans are drawn up but the plans are not carried out&#x003F; I quote nobody less than the Deputy Minister, who on 17th March, at Queenstown, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons moet dit egter duidelik stel dat om net te beplan en nie uit te voer nie, nie van veel waarde is nie. Die eintlike vordering van grondbewaring in di&#x00E9; deel word weer-spie&#x00EB;f daarin dat die fisiese beplanning tans nog net op 65 plase, of 10 per cent, wat &#x2019;n oppervlakte van 78,100 morge, of 13 per cent, dek, volledig toegepas is. Ons moet probeer om ons boere sover te kry om die plaasplan toe te pas, want daar gaan nog in die gebied wat u bedien jaarliks 4,500 morg-voet slik verlore, wat besonder hoog is &#x2026;</block>

<p>Efficiency is dependent on planning, and this planning must be done scientifically and cannot, as at the present moment, be entirely a matter of experience only. The capacity of any farmer to produce, if he wants to be really efficient, depends on his knowledge of his land, knowledge not only of his agricultural land but also of his paddocks and camps. He must know exactly what each and every one of these areas can produce. What has the Government done to supply the farmer with a knowledge of his ground that he has to look after&#x003F; Rhodesia was mentioned here. Indeed, I should think that the Ministers must look again at what Rhodesia is doing, because there they operate on the documents of which they are justly proud which they have as farm plans. If a farm is planned, they know exactly in the minutest detail what that farm is capable of and what different crops can be planted and they know exactly what they can produce, so much so that today you do not even have to go and look at the farm; you can walk into a Government office and buy a farm knowing exactly what it can produce. Can we do that here&#x003F; If we go to the farm here in South Africa we do not know what it can produce. You have to rely on your background and your experience only to find out. [Interjections.] What should be noted is this, that the whole development of Rhodesia is being done by our own people, by South Africans who have gone there. We do not decry what our officials are doing today. They are doing their utmost in every department, but they get no assistance and the Government is not helping to provide more men to do this job which the few of them are doing so well.</p>

<p>Productivity has many facets, and many of them have been covered in this debate. I would just mention, in passing, that it was the hon. the Minister of Finance who said &#x201C;Spend for Prosperity&#x201D;, and of course the farmers answered his call and they spent and improved their farms and built things and took up loans because they wanted South Africa to prosper. They answered the call of patriotism to their country, to spend for prosperity, and what happened&#x003F; They have been unable to repay those loans and now it is going the other way. Now they have to pay rates of interest they never foresaw. How can they go on making a living&#x003F; Another facet of productivity is the question of labour. Quite apart from the fluctuations we have heard about in the different parts of the country, there is the question of the efficiency of our labour force, particularly in agriculture. Where can you find a more inefficient labour force than we have in South Africa&#x003F; Where, in considering the Bantu labour on the farms, is there any effort made to give them the basic training for what they have to be used for on the farms, whether it be driving a tractor or looking after implements or building a hut or herding sheep, other than what the farmer himself puts into it&#x003F; We have heard often enough from the economic speakers in this House that to curb this inflation, which we have to do, we have to see that we become more productive, and one of the biggest measures to achieve that productivity is the question of the efficiency of the labour force. We know that as far as the farmer is concerned, his contribution towards combating inflation must be to curb soil erosion, and he must do so with his labour force, but that requires trained labour. When we go further in considering this labour question, we find that the man cannot even use his labour indefinitely. The labour varies from year to year. The labour comes and goes and now we understand from the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration that even this inefficient labour force is going to be limited through the action he is taking. We wonder where it is all going to lead to, because if we consider the agricultural development in the homelands, what comparison is there between the white areas and the homelands&#x003F; We find that inasmuch as there are areas planned for the white sector, we heard yesterday from the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration that 54 per cent of the homelands of South Africa have been planned. We can even go further. I can tell him that in the Ciskei virtually the whole of the Ciskei has been planned. He mentioned the thousands of dams and the miles of fencing and the millions of rands that have been spent on all this planning, but again, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, where do you get unless the plans are carried out&#x003F; If we take the Ciskei and the Transkei together, you have a population there approaching two million people, and what is their productive capacity agriculturally&#x003F; Take one matter only, grain. The average over the last six years&#x2014;not taking last year, because then there was a drought&#x2014;was 1,880,000 bags of grain, or one bag of grain per person. If you want to work that out in terms of what that means to the <span class="col_3793-3794" refersTo="page_0512"/>people, it is &#x00BD; lb. of mealiemeal per person per day, and that is their staple diet.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lindsay">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>I can give that in detail. Wool production is only about 3 lbs. per sheep, but what is the standard of that wool&#x003F; Whereas that hon. member may get 50 to 60 cents a lb., the wool produced in the homelands is only sold at about 20 cents a lb. He must not come and talk here about things like that. What is more, Sir, do you know what the position is in connection with the population there&#x003F; Except for the Rand complex, we have the heaviest concentration of people in South Africa in the Ciskei, 91 people per square mile. It was very noticeable that the hon. member for Soutpansberg when mentioning the development of the border areas the other day mentioned Rosslyn and Phalaborwa, but he did not say a word about the King William&#x2019;s Town/East London area, and yet that is the true border area in South Africa, an area squashed in between the Ciskei and the Transkei. But what is even more important is this. Do you know, Sir. that in that area 47&#x00BD; per cent of the total Bantu population in the homelands is concentrated&#x003F; Then we hear of border development and border industries. We see that last year there was R10 million for border development, and we see this year in the Budget R13 million for border development.</p>

<p>We see that provision is being made this year for R4&#x00BD; million and R1 million for the Bantu Investment Corporation and for the Xhosa Development Corporation. I would like to ask the Minister how much of these millions has come to the one true border area in South Africa, the King William&#x2019;s Town/East London area. One wonders why, when the people are there to be employed, when the people want to work, there are not opportunities for them. Why with all the advantages and all the concessions which are available to border area industries, do we not find more development in an area such as that&#x003F; Let me mention some of the concessions which are made to border area industries: Leasing fully furnished factory premises; loans for buildings, machinery, plant and working capital; assistance as far as basic services such as power, water and transport are concerned; rebates on the depreciation of buildings, plant and machinery; income tax rebates and even a 10 per cent railway rebate. Why, Sir, with all these advantages do we not find more development in an area such as that&#x003F; What has been the position just of late&#x003F; Since 1963 only 11 new industries have been established in East London. As a matter of fact, in 1963 not one new industry was established there. In 1964 five were established; in 1965 two, and in 1966 four, and only two of these 11 employ more than 100 Bantu, and the 11 altogether employ 729 Bantu. Sir, the next big town there is King William&#x2019;s Town, and what have we had there during this period&#x003F; Nil, a round nil. There is one in the process of developing now. Sir, I think the answer to this is quite simple; the answer is security. Which investor will go and invest money in an area unless he is certain of the future of that area&#x003F; A great deal has been said here by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development about investments inside the Bantu areas and about how people can lend money to the Bantu Investment Corporation. Sir, are you going to lend money to somebody else if you do not know how he is going to invest it&#x003F; No, there must be security; it is a basic requirement for any sort of investment. When we come to the question of security, why do people feel insecure&#x003F; There is insecurity because we have people like the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration going round and saying, for example, that the borders of the Ciskei are not final. This statement was denied emphatically hundreds of times by hon. members on that side of the House when the question of borders was discussed here and I do not wish to re-open that discussion. The hon. the Deputy Minister says that the borders are not final. Furthermore he says that 100,000 morgen of land must be bought in that specific area, not additional land but in exchange for white land. Sir, a 100,000 morgen is not a penny stamp; it involves a terrific amount. The hon. the Minister of Finance talks about saving. Is this the time now to exchange land merely in order to consolidate&#x003F; We are not against the principle of consolidation but surely one must view everything in its correct perspective. Sir, it goes further than that. When we ask him about this consolidation, about the black spots which are still within the white area and ask him what he is going to do about them, he comes along and gives the sort of reply which he gave me last year and says, &#x201C;we have not decided yet whether we will consolidate these black spots; we have not yet decided whether we will consolidate them or remove them&#x201D;. Sir, have you ever heard anything of the kind&#x003F; How can you consolidate a black spot other than to move it but he says that he does not know yet whether he is going to consolidate or remove it. How can one interpret that sort of remark&#x003F; Sir, what would you say if somebody told you that about something within your own area&#x003F; No, one cannot go on with that sort of reasoning and then expect development to take place. It hampers the development of the whole area. I do not wish to suggest that industrialization is the be-all and end-all of everything, because I believe that industrialization itself, on its own, is but a small part of that development. I think that has been proved in an area such as Johannesburg where even today there are 344,427 economically active Bantu, only 16 per cent of whom are employed in industry. Thirty eight per cent of them are employed in other services, in Government services, provincial services, municipal service and even domestic service. The big thing about industrialization is not what it itself does but what it brings with it, just as in the case of immigrants, for <span class="col_3795-3796" refersTo="page_0513"/>example. It is not just the number of immigrants that comes; it is the bonus in the shape of their children that matters. What is important is not only the numbers by which they increase our population. The same applies to industry, but, Sir, a prerequisite to any development such as that is security. There must be certainty as to which areas are going to be white and which are not going to be white. We must know so that when a man comes along and makes inquiries we can tell him what the position is. I would say specifically that in order to stimulate industrial development we all know that a nucleus is necessary. We have found in the past and it has been stated here that this nucleus is ether the raw material or the market, and occasionally there is some specific industry which forms the nucleus around which the whole development takes place. We have had examples of that and we have even seen it in Port Elizabeth, one of our four industrially developed areas, where the motor industry played a major part in the development of that area. But in any case what we require for both of them is capital. Can we find a nucleus for the King William&#x2019;s Town/East London area&#x003F; I say without fear of contradiction that if this Government really wants to show that it has initiative, that it has planning in its mind and that it has foresight, this is the opportunity for it to display wisdom. Sir, at the moment consideration is being given to the positioning of a third Iscor. The hon. the Minister of Finance said, while he was still Minister of Economic Affairs, that this would be decided solely on economic grounds. Sir, I say that he must change that idea of his. We have for him in that area a ready-made piece of land around Berlin where a third Iscor can be established. We can supply him with everything; we can supply him with water, labour, power and transport, with a little bit of development, and if it should be uneconomic, what of it&#x003F; Because around this uneconomic nucleus we could build up an economic whole for the whole area. That is the point that we want to make. If we do have a small nucleus which does not pay and we could then have development which would be to the benefit of South Africa, to the benefit of that area, to the benefit of the Whites and to the benefit of the Bantu people who are looking for work all the time, I say that the establishment of that industry in that area would be justified.</p>

<p>It seems to me everything needed in this country may be found at King William&#x2019;s Town&#x2014;the land, the water and the ore. The previous speaker is certainly very proud of King William&#x2019;s Town, and that is good. Time and again the Opposition sets out on an agricultural debate and then stops at a Bantu debate. The hon. member alleged that our agricultural technical services were poor and he compared us to Rhodesia. Well, it is true that Rhodesia renders good technical services to a small number of farmers, but why criticize our services&#x003F; The hon. member is aware of the fact that Rhodesia&#x2019;s entire maize crop totals 4 million bags. Our kaffir-corn crop totals 8 million bags and our maize crop 100 million bags, spread over a tremendous area. Ours is a growing and developing country and we cannot always succeed in finding the necessary staff. Why should our agricultural departments be belittled every time&#x003F; Sir, agriculture is referred to most disparagingly. May I just quote the following to demonstrate what has happened as regards agriculture in the past 18 years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Approximately 20 years ago a new era dawned when our entire agricultural industry commenced with the scientific application of the results of research. This produced better animals, better grass, better methods and better machinery, so that in 1966 fully a third fewer farmers than in 1946 produced approximately 75 per cent more in physical volume in agricultural produce. In gross value our production in this period increased from R262 million &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was shortly after the time when Mr. Koos Strauss was Minister of Agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in 1964 to R980 million in 1966. Over these 20 years the number of tractors increased from 20,000 to more than 130,000.</block>

<p>But hon. members of the Opposition get up time and again and say that the agricultural situation is hopeless and that it is deteriorating. Sir, when the hon. member for East London (City) spoke yesterday, he forgot what he had said in this House seven months ago. On 25th August, 1966, the hon. member said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why not announce a long-term price policy&#x003F;</block>

<p>You will remember that he alleged that the farmers were going under as a result of too low prices. Seven months ago he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Instead of provision having been made for a long-term price policy for the farmer &#x2026; absolutely nothing has been done for the farmer.</block>

<p>Yesterday he got up here and said that it was ridiculous to propose an increase in the prices of agricultural produce because regard should be had to the world price. Seven months ago, when he was asked: &#x201C;What about the world price&#x003F;&#x201D; his reply was: &#x201C;We have nothing to do with the world price; we are talking about South Africa.&#x201D; If the hon. member can swing around as quickly as that, I think he will be voting National seven months from now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said that the Government misrepresented everything, but he did not tell us in what respect the Government misrepresented everything. He said that we threw dust in the eyes of the voters. How can one insult the voters by telling them that we have been throwing dust in their eyes for 18 years and that they are nevertheless supporting the National Party <span class="col_3797-3798" refersTo="page_0514"/>in ever-increasing numbers&#x003F; The hon. member should think before he speaks. Sir, I look forward to the next general election. If we use this Hansard and the things said here by hon. members of the Opposition, there are going to be fun and games at the next election!</p>

<p>From time to time we hear speeches by members of the hon. Opposition, such as the hon. member for East London (North) yesterday, who was worried&#x2014;I actually pitied him because he was so worried&#x2014;about the poor native boy he wanted to discharge but did not know where to send. But he is only thinking of his own restricted locality. I do not know whether it is true that there is so much redundant labour, but the rest of the country is crying out for labour, is looking for labour. But it appears that at East London and in that vicinity &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should just like to ask the hon. member the following: If the Bantu homelands are to be developed as suggested by the hon. member, has he ever asked himself whether it is the duty of the Whites only to develop those Bantu homelands&#x003F; Should there be no initiative on the part of the Bantu&#x003F; I would be grateful if the hon. member would consult the documents of the Bantu Investment Corporation, to which they refer sneeringly and say, &#x201C;In six years R5 million has been spent&#x201D;, and then laugh about the matter. If you investigated and spoke to those people, you would see what loans are applied for at the Bantu Investment Corporation: for a motor car, a light delivery van, a lorry, a dealer&#x2019;s licence. And the Bantu Investment Corporation has its hands full ensuring that one Bantu does not exploit the other. He is still on a very low level of civilization and it will take generations to cultivate an awareness of these matters in the Bantu. Primarily one surely starts with agriculture, as the hon. the Minister said. One cannot tell the Bantu right at the outset: &#x201C;Here are so many millions of rands. Proceed with a factory&#x201D;. The white has to do the thinking for them, but surely we cannot do everything for them. Surely one cannot bring about this development overnight.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out to the hon. members that the white capital may be mobilized by the Bantu Investment Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation or development corporations still to be founded. But the Bantu cannot even put his agriculture in order; how is he to straighten out his industry on his own&#x003F; Hon. members should have regard to the practical situation. What is happening at the moment, seeing that in your opinion those homelands are not being developed&#x003F; In the area I have in mind, one cannot obtain labour at present because the Bantu say: &#x201C;Why should I work&#x003F; It has rained in my homeland. I can eat <i>morog&#x201D;.</i> Some of them, who as a result of this technical guidance harvested 85 bags of maize last year, are dissatisfied. The Bantu woman is dissatisfied and says: &#x201C;Now my husband can get an additional wife&#x201D;, or, &#x201C;He will no longer work at all, because he now has food for two years&#x201D;. Hon. members should not merely generalize, but should have regard to the stage of development of the black man. To divorce him from his context and to try to treat him as a developed white is wrong.</p>

<p>Our people started developing in the agricultural sphere. It took generations. After that we developed industrially. On our own we developed as a nation. One cannot simply do spoon feeding and put matters right on paper. It takes generations. Every time I ask myself whether the Opposition wants us to cause the Bantu to develop so rapidly that we will disrupt his life, as happened in the rest of Africa. Who is to develop his agriculture&#x003F; It is said that 54 per cent is planned. But go and see what those Bantu are doing on their own. They have the opportunity to farm on the best land in our country. What do they actually do for themselves&#x003F; Have hon. members asked themselves why that development is taking place so slowly&#x003F; Is it only the white man who is to blame&#x003F; It is only the white man who is at fault&#x003F; I tell the hon. members who are so fond of coming back time and again to Bantu-homeland development. It is a source of concern. I myself am concerned about it. But what is the true problem&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this: South Africa was an agricultural country and a mining country. today agriculture and mining together are only slightly more than the industrial development. Even if the Opposition criticized us time and again, even if they are aggressive&#x2014;I know that is the duty of the Opposition, although they do it very badly&#x2014; and bring reproaches without suggesting alternatives, I still maintain: Agriculture in this country is on a sound basis. All those reproaches of last year, of seven months ago, were washed out by the rain. As a result of the rain those arguments by the Opposition are worth very little at present.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town abandoned the discussions on agricultural matters and wandered about, and I think as the last speaker on the Opposition side he will not hold it against me if I do not follow him. We have had more than two weeks to set up the Budget as a target for all critics and in particular for the hon. the Opposition, and they have had an opportunity to let fly at it with might and main. Upon inspection of the target after all that time and virtually in the final moments of this debate, one comes to the conclusion that the bull&#x2019;s eye of the target is in point of fact intact. The hon. Opposition saddled the inflation horse immediately and gave it the spurs, but unfortunately that Opposition horse had been fed the wrong fodder and soon foundered. It actually surprised me to hear in this connection that the State was spending too much on defence and water affairs. At <span class="col_3799-3800" refersTo="page_0515"/>present it is world politics that a good, healthy and developing economy must be protected by a strong defence force. The hon. members of the Opposition actually believe that we are spending too much on defence at this juncture, at a time when it is not only necessary to defend our economy but when we are being threatened from all over the world, when the entire world is hostile to us.</p>

<p>I recall the days during last year&#x2019;s session when the entire country was still in the grip of the drought and when we had interviews virtually every day with the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, and I remember the criticism and the reproaches and everything said in connection with water conservation and the things that go with it by the hon. Opposition. And now that the hon. the Minister is asking for even more money to do more in this respect, there are actually complaints about too much expenditure on water affairs. Now that the debate has progressed so far and we are beginning to summarize and to draw conclusions, I want to say unequivocally that the hon. the Opposition has taught us nothing. Once again it was a case of much talk and much criticism without any statement of an alternative policy. I should like to address myself to the hon. the Opposition in this regard. It has become tradition for the Government to be attacked and criticized without the Opposition proposing an alternative for those things of which they do not approve. In this regard I should like to address a few words to the hon. member for South Coast. Last year he said the following, <i>inter alia</i> (Hansard, vol. 17, column 2578)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I had intended making an appeal &#x2026; that we should start off on the basis of approaching all these problems on the basis of accepting the <i>bona fides</i> of the other side. While allowing for the difference in party principles in so many of the things which radically divide us from the Government side, I had hoped to appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister and that side of the House that we should accept as a basic principle, when we are discussing these matters, that our approach should be along the lines of accepting the <i>bona fides</i> of the other side; that we should accept the <i>bona fides</i> of that side and that that side should accept our <i>bona fides</i> &#x2026;</block>

<p>Last year, when the hon. member used these words, I was still a novice in this House, and I have to admit that as such I was rather receptive to such fine words and was inclined to attach some value to them. Apart from that, those words were used at a time when we had to attach importance to the acceptance of each other&#x2019;s <i>bona fides</i> and to believe that both sides were honest and sincere in their attempts to seek the best for the country. I want to assure the hon. the Opposition in advance that the words I want to address to them are free of any hostility, of &#x201C;venom&#x201D;, to use a word they will be better able to understand. I believe that if we are to make mutual appeals to each other, we should be sincere and render proof of our sincerity. If in everyday life a man wants to assure me of his sincerity and honesty, I want him to render proof that I will in fact be able to rely on his integrity. Similarly, I would gladly rely on the integrity of my fellow-politicians in this House, even if they are on the opposite side of the House.</p>

<p>As I said, I was inclined to accept the words of the hon. member for South Coast. After all, he is an experienced politician, enthusiastic&#x2014;sometimes perhaps too passionate. He is a political veteran and he has marched a long way in politics. I thought to myself that the hon. member might perhaps have calmed down through the years, and might perhaps have changed his views. In any event, I was impressed by his words.</p>

<p>All that was needed, however, was that this side of the House should introduce legislation such as the legislation for the establishment of a national education policy, to reveal the true state of affairs. In the opposition to that legislation the hon. member for South Coast took the lead. It was a thorn in the flesh of the hon. members from Natal, in particular, that we wanted to give our education a national and a Christian character.</p>

<p>That is true. I have become firmly convinced that hon. members of the Opposition are most allergic to the concept &#x201C;national&#x201D; and that they want to restrict that concept to the narrower political concept and thus link it to the National Party. They are opposed to any idea related to that. It was then asked whether our education was not Christian. We discussed the matter at great length, and I therefore do not want to elaborate on it any further at this stage. But what shocked me were the following words by the hon. member for Kensington in the course of that debate. In reply to the question of another hon. member, the hon. member for Kensington said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason why he sends his child there is not to obtain some special kind of education for him, but that he wants an education with a strong religious background, which one can get only in an Afrikaans-medium school. One cannot get that in an English-medium school.</block>

<p><span class="col_3801-3802" refersTo="page_0516"/>If hon. members on the opposite side of the House and the English-speaking section of our population do not want that, it is none of my business, but why did we get so much opposition from hon. members on the opposite side when we introduced this policy&#x003F; What I found most disconcerting in that respect was the fact that hon. members of the Opposition said that they were acting in good faith, and yet they made such an issue of the so-called language medium or parental choice. I want to summarize the matter very briefly. Experience has taught me and many others in this country that no English-speaking parent, or at least, very few of them, send their children to Afrikaans-medium schools. Similarly, few Afrikaans-speaking parents will send their children to English-medium schools. Why make such an issue of the language medium and of parental choice&#x003F; I come to the conclusion that hon. members on the opposite side are merely pleading for that small group of Afrikaans speaking members of the United Party who want to send their children to English-medium schools in order to have even more United Party politics instilled in them.</p>

<p>There are more of them in the National Party than you would like to see. I ask myself the question, is the hon. the Opposition in earnest&#x003F; I take it that the hon. member for South Coast spoke on behalf of his Party, because he is a senior member of his Party. Are they in earnest when they oppose us in this connection&#x003F; Are they acting in good faith and do they expect us to accept their <i>bona fides,</i> their good faith, if they say unequivocally that they are going to restore the Coloureds to the common voters&#x2019; list&#x003F; Does the Party realize what it is doing and where it wants to take us back to&#x003F; I believe that one should always compare. Now it so happens that the present Opposition was in fact in government at one stage. What happened then&#x003F; At that time the Coloureds also had the vote. In fact, we may say that that was all the United Party Government did for the Coloureds at that time. That the Coloureds no longer believe the United Party, is most strikingly proved by the fact that at the Provincial Election of 1964 the Coloureds did not return any United Party members to the Provincial Council, but two Progressives. Therefore they do not believe the fine talk of the United Party ether.</p>

<p>In the course of this debate we heard that they were considering a race federation: then again it was a geographical federation, but I do not want to elaborate on that at the moment. I just want to tell them that I think it is absolutely unfair to expect a party which includes thinking people, people who can do their own political reasoning, to come and tell us that they seek the salvation of South Africa through this kind of politics. They have now been forced into a position where they are no longer able to take a unanimous stand even on their Bantu policy. In this connection I believe that there are at least three groups among them. One group is in favour of a geographical federation; the other of a race federation; and a third in favour of nether of those two.</p>

<p>Just before I conclude, I should like to say a few things in connection with an election pamphlet which was issued by the Opposition and which is exactly a year old today. The heading on the pamphlet is in thick black print: &#x201C;Dit is die Verenigde Party erns&#x201D;. (&#x201C;The United Party is in earnest.&#x201D;) That is where I started doubting the words of the hon. member for South Coast last year. In the pamphlet it is stated that salaries and wages should be adjusted regularly to keep abreast of the cost of living.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. P. J. VORSTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree with that. The hon. member should just give me a chance to say so before asking me. But now these hon. members are the people who, as soon as expenditure increases, tell us to apply the brake. They asked for more water conservation, but now that it is being undertaken, they say the expenditure is too high. In the pamphlet it is also stated that the farming industry in South Africa should be built from the ground by means of equitable prices, efficiency and water conservation. I agree in so far as it concerns equitable prices, efficiency and water conservation, but in the meantime the Opposition has changed its attitude because today they tell us that we are spending too much on water conservation. Of course the hon. member for Orange Grove asked for television, and here in its pamphlet the United Party stated that they would provide television. But the pamphlet contains something in connection with the suppression of crime which I find most interesting. Here in the pamphlet they ask for a larger and better-paid police force. I agree with that, for the edification of the hon. member for Durban (Point). But what government has ever done more to suppress crime in South Africa than this National Party Government. Under what government has more been done to build the police force into a strong unit than under the National Party Government&#x003F; The day this pamphlet was put into my hand, there was a gathering of quite a few people. By coincidence there was also a retired policeman. Now I want to ask hon. members to listen to the words he used in connection with this pamphlet. He said: &#x201C;The United Party will not impress the police by means of this, because in the days when they were still in charge of us, they put us in the internment camps and goaled us without a trial.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, nowadays the United Party pretends to champion the Railwayman, the small man, the man in the street, the farmer, etc. I say they pretend to champion these people, but the fact of the matter is that the United Party is merely seeking votes and they will even fish in troubled waters in an attempt to get those votes. During their regime these very people, i.e. the railwayman, the small man, the man in the street and the farmer, could hardly make a living under the United Party Government. Now, in the year 1967, after the National Party has been in power for 19 years and has governed in the best and most efficient fashion, they come along and try to court those people&#x2019;s votes. Now I maintain that this Government and the hon. the Minister of Finance and all the Cabinet members of this Government look after every section of the population of South Africa. The Government looks after every population group in South Africa and even after the United Party members and their children. Let me say at once that there are certain things in South Africa, as is the case in any country in the world, which cannot be squeezed into ripeness. Frequently there are also matters which should not be discussed unnecessarily. Certain matters have to be approached with the wisdom of a statesman, and judiciously. I am thinking of one of the hon. members of the United Party who pressed the question of the independence of the Transkei. Is it in the interests of white South Africa to emphasize these matters continually&#x003F; [Interjections.] Hon. members may shout till they are blue in the face.

<p>I say that those hon. members are guilty of that, but one should be greater and should rise above that if you are a statesman. Now I ask the United Party, what is the difference between a statesman and a cheap politician&#x003F; I point a finger at the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District), who proves his ignorance unambiguously every time he opens his mouth. [Interjections.] What everybody in South Africa has to accept and admit today is that under the 19 years of National Party Government South Africa has gone from strength to strength and has reached the greatest heights. Nobody can deny that. We have reached those heights despite the Opposition in South Africa. At present South Africa is experiencing an economic upsurge and self-reliance. Relations between the various population groups are sound, including the good and the best relations between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. Under the National Party Government there is progress and vitality and dynamic progressiveness in every field. All these are products of the conscientious and thorough administration of the National Party Government, a stable government which fostered productivity in spite of a frivolous&#x2014; and I emphasize this&#x2014;insincere Opposition, an Opposition which cannot penetrate to any depth and which cannot take its politics seriously, an Opposition which displays a great lack of statesmanship, an Opposition which does not keep in touch with the electorate outside, an Opposition which lay down like a tortoise and drew its head into its shell, and which refuses to put out its head no matter how much one kicks it and what one does to it. That is demonstrated by the fact that all arguments raised by this Opposition are refuted by members on the Government side. Now it is our responsibility to ask them as the Opposition: &#x201C;What is your attitude in respect of the major problems of South Africa&#x003F;&#x201D; May I remind the Opposition of the year 1948, when they were in power&#x003F; May I remind them of the days preceding 26th May, 1948&#x003F; May I remind them of the days when their erstwhile leader said: &#x201C;If the Nationalist Party comes into power, the Whites in South Africa will have to pack up&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>He did say that. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Yeoville says the erstwhile leader of the Opposition. General J. C. Smuts, did not say that. Seeing that he has so much to say. I want to deal with him. Here I have <i>Verkiesingsnuus:</i> which was published during the 1948 election by the United Party, which was then in power. It was drawn up by Mr. O. A. Oosthuizen. All political reports were compiled by Mr. Marais Steyn. Now I want him to open his mouth and answer me. Mr. Speaker, do you know what is written on page 15&#x003F; &#x201C;Every statement appearing in this book is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&#x201D; I wish I had the time this afternoon to deal page by page with this book of the hon. member for Yeoville, in which he claims that everything contained in it is true. But I just want to mention a few things. On the back page of this book the following words appear: &#x201C;Why conjecture&#x003F; Why should you wonder whether the Nationalist Party will proclaim a republic&#x003F;&#x201D; This afternoon I say that if the hon. member for Yeoville had been on this side of the House, he would be the first person whom we would get rid of. One cannot allow anybody in one&#x2019;s party to make such irresponsible propaganda during an election. He stated that if the National Party came into power, it would proclaim a republic without more ado. According to Mr. Marais Steyn&#x2019;s statement that republic would be proclaimed even against the will of the electorate of South Africa. That is <span class="col_3805-3806" refersTo="page_0518"/>what he said. That is what it implies. The United Party was and is still the greatest scaremonger in South Africa. They have not learnt that the people of South Africa are not afraid of ghosts. But let me quote from page 15 of this brochure (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We know that the Nationalist Party will take steps to establish a republic. True, they may perhaps hold a referendum on the matter, but with their knowledge of the Nazi technique they will see to it that the referendum has the result they desire.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Yeoville said. It is scandalous that a man who pretends to be a statesman in South Africa should sink to such a level and say such things. Because he told the world that if this Government came into power we would have a Nazi government in South Africa. That is his patriotism. That is his loyalty to South Africa. And all for mere political gain. Five years have passed since Republic. Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Yeoville say that we used Nazi techniques at the referendum&#x003F; Look at him. He is silent. All he can do is to laugh with embarrassment, but he is laughing with embarrassment before South Africa, which has seen him in his nakedness. The hon. member predicted Nazi techniques, and in the brochure it was called &#x201C;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&#x201D;. In other words, this hon. member for Yeoville stands before South Africa during an election and swears&#x2014;he takes an oath&#x2014; that what is written here is true, and then he talks such rubbish and nonsense. I am grateful that he is not a member of the National Party, because I think he is a disgrace and the greatest disgrace for the United Party, apart from the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). I want to go further and point out that the following appears on the back page of this brochure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why conjecture&#x003F; Why should you wonder whether the Nationalist Party will rob you of your vote&#x003F;</block>

<p>If I say to the hon. member for Durban (Point) that the Coloured was, as he says, robbed of his vote, and that it was done in the interests and for the preservation of white South Africa, would he be against it&#x003F; That reminds me of the words of one of their leaders of the time who said: &#x201C;Vote for the right to vote again.&#x201D; South Africa did vote for the right to vote again, and that is why it voted National. I come to the third statement made on the back page of the brochure. Here we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why conjecture&#x003F; Why should you wonder whether the Nationalist Party will bring about a Fascist regime&#x003F;</block>

<p>Can anybody with a political conscience say such things without blushing today&#x003F; There have been 20 years of National Party Government, and his predictions have not been validated. Yesterday afternoon the hon. member for Musgrave said that the United Party had not scared English-speaking South Africa. But on page 16 of this brochure the following appears: &#x201C;The vote will be restricted to supporters of the Nationalist Party.&#x201D; Even the hon. member for Yeoville, who is not a supporter of the National Party, is not only a candidate of the United Party today but also has the vote. And here it is alleged that the vote will be restricted to supporters of the National Party. Furthermore, the following is alleged: &#x201C;The supreme power of government will be vested in the Nationalists.&#x201D; that is the hon. member for Yeoville, Mr. Speaker. Furthermore, the hon. member says on page 16 of the brochure: &#x201C;The republic must be achieved. How it is achieved, is of no importance.&#x201D; He assumed that even Nazi techniques would be used. Look at him&#x2014;he does not even blush, because he is politically without a conscience, absolutely without a conscience in politics. The hon. member for Durban (Point) cannot get up now.

<p>No. The hon. member continued and said&#x2014;this was his prediction to the voters of South Africa: &#x201C;Those who are opposed to the republican system will be charged with high treason.&#x201D; I ask him whether he, who was an anti-republican, has been charged with high treason in South Africa&#x003F; Has anybody been charged in the five years since we held a referendum&#x003F; Has anybody been charged with high treason&#x003F; The hon. member continued and said: &#x201C;The democratic government machinery will be abolished.&#x201D; I ask him: Where has it been abolished&#x003F; I ask this entire United Party: Are you proud of such statements by your chief propagandist&#x003F; The United Party should all put their heads under their benches.

<p>Even if the hon. member for Durban (Point) got a new look, he would still remain the versatile person he is today. He said the naturalization laws would be tightened up. British citizens would have to become naturalized and would have to live in the Union for seven years before being able to apply for naturalization.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The year 1956 was a very important year for the United Party. In that year they chose a new Leader, not because their old Leader had retired or because they had been deprived of him in some other way, but because they stabbed their old Leader in the back and appointed a new Leader. That new leader was announced by the hon. member for Yeoville at a special meeting in Johannesburg and I should like to read this announcement now because today, 11 or 12 years after the event, it makes very interesting reading. The announcement reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Sir De Villiers Graaff comes to us like a Moses to lead us out of the terrible situation in which South Africa finds itself today to a new promised land.&#x201D; This is what Mr. Marais Steyn, M.P., said yesterday when he introduced the new Opposition Leader at a meeting on the Rand.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;He will lead the United Party to victory.&#x201D; The sneaker had no doubt about that whatsoever. If you had seen and heard Sir De Villiers Graaff speaking, you would have been proud and you would have left inspired with one mission in life, namely to make him Prime Minister.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I want to quote another section&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;This moment,&#x201D; Mr. Steyn said, &#x201C;is a great moment of revival in the United Party. There is a new spirit of enthusiasm abroad such as I have never seen in my whole life before.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was in 1956. It appears to me that that enthusiasm and fire, that tremendous revival, has had no effect on the United Party because subsequent to that it has been deteriorating steadily. It appears to me the hon. member for Yeoville thought he had found a Moses, but he forgot that 40 years in the desert lay ahead before they could reach the promised land, and that they would first have to survive those 40 years in the desert. But do you know, Sir, what the true facts of the matter were, in my opinion&#x003F; The true facts of the matter were that the hon. member for Yeoville had not found a Moses at all when he described Sir De Villiers Graaff as such. What he had found was one of the ten scouts who went to spy out the promised land and were so affrighted at what they had seen there that they stated upon their return that they had never been there. That is why they are still wandering about in the desert of political isolation, and in the meantime the true Moses has led the nation of South Africa to the promised land, and we are already there. We have bypassed them, but those members are plodding contentedly on in the desert and will remain there for many years to come. I spoke about Moses and the ten scouts, but what we have here now are three scouts which are all taking the lead in the United Party. I do not know whether they want to revive the old Republican idea of a triumvirate but it seems to me that there are three leaders at the moment, and fortunately all three of them are present here in a row. There is the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Yeoville, and the small voice of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. These three members have had something to say about everything which one could consider worthwhile discussing and, strangely enough, each had something different to say, although they are members of the same Party and adhere to the same principle. Perhaps that is the reason why the Opposition, after five days of this debate, has immediately taken refuge for comfort&#x2019;s sake in purely financial discussion each time we pinned them down on colour policy. I have never heard so many experts in the financial field in the United Party as I have heard this year. They are all financiers and all speak with authority on finances because they are afraid that we may perhaps pin them down on their colour policy. I accept that some of their leaders are still going to speak in this debate, and I should like some guidance from them on a few points. I shall tell you why, Sir.</p>

<p>In South Africa at present two by-elections are being held, one in Worcester and one in Johannesburg (West), and I think the voting public is entitled to know who the Leader of the United Party is and whose point of view <span class="col_3809-3810" refersTo="page_0520"/>is the official point of view of the Party, that of the hon. Leader, so-called, that of the hon. member for Yeoville, or that of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, because they contradict one another in quite a few fields, as I shall try to indicate.</p>

<p>I want to commence by saying that the United Party is, according to the admission made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout the other day, undergoing a policy change in regard to their Bantu policy; a new one once more. The United Party with its colour policy puts me in mind of a joke I heard about the mountain zebra. I should like to tell them this joke because it is so apposite. They tell me the mountain zebra is becoming extinct. They say it is a very nervous animal and has one great difficulty. The moment it takes fright it snorts, and the moment it snorts it takes fright, and with all this snorting and taking fright the mountain zebra are becoming extinct. [Laughter.] It is a permanent perpetual motion. The United Party has the same theory in respect of its policy. They announce a policy with loud acclaim and enthusiasm, and then we fight an election on that policy and the voters tell them they do not want that policy. They then take fright, return to their &#x201C;backroom boys&#x201D; and formulate a new policy. Then we hold another election and precisely the same thing happens again. Sir, you will remember how many different policies they have already had. I do not want to spend much time on that. At the same meeting from which I quoted the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also spoke and after having said a few things he ultimately concluded with these words (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers Graaff said that the policy which he had just sketched was the new &#x201C;forward-looking&#x201D; policy of the United Party.</block>

<p>If we start with the &#x201C;forward-looking&#x201D; Party policy of 1956, then we find that it was followed by the Senate Plan of the United Party, after that the policy of economic integration and political segregation, after that the policy &#x201C;ordered advance&#x201D;&#x2014;they never said in which direction they were &#x201C;advancing&#x201D;&#x2014;after that the policy of white leadership with justice, after that the policy of race federation, and now suddenly a brand new picture in regard to which I should like more details, the policy of geographic federation has been put forward by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I want to say at once that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout raved about this idea last year. He spoke last year in the debate on the Vote of the Minister of Bantu Administration about a geographic federation and he used the example of South-West Africa and stated that, as he saw the matter, South-West Africa was associated with us on a federal basis. We did not count heads when we decided how many representatives South-West Africa should have here. If we had counted heads then they would only have had two representatives here, but because it is on a federal basis, South-West Africa has six representatives in this House. He said that we should do the same in regard to the Bantu states, in other words the Bantu homelands here; that we should not count heads but that we should decide that that area should have so many representatives and another area so many, and that as soon as an area became autonomous we should decide how it would be integrated with the Central Government. That is the idea which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was hawking around last year. After that statement the hon. member for Yeoville had to re-align himself immediately and he did in fact make a statement on the same matter. I am quoting from Hansard of 17th October, 1966, column 4541. The hon. member for Yeoville was then following a middle-of-the-road policy. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Politically we will encourage them to accept a federal association with South Africa. In their case &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the homelands&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in their case with a geographic content, and in the case of the detribalized Natives, with a population content.</block>

<p>In other words, he was advocating both; it is a race federation but it is also a geographic federation. Mr. Speaker, I have here an official document of the United Party, <i>Handleiding vir Beter Rasseverhoudinge,</i> and in this document I have sought the United Party&#x2019;s official policy which I take it the Leader of the United Party would subscribe to, because if the Leader does not subscribe to his own policy, who does&#x003F; What does the hon. the Leader say&#x003F; He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a federation of races, not of geographic locations. One should take note of the fact that race federation is not a territorial federation such as that of the United States of America, or the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland. It is another idea altogether. As far as the United Party&#x2019;s plan is concerned, the emphasis falls on the race group and not on the geographic unit.</block>

<p>That is very clear, and he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For a country like South Africa where the races cannot be divided geographically a federation of races is obviously the right system. In addition to that it is extremely practicable.</block>

<p>I am asking with every good intention now: What is the United Party&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; Is it a race federation, as their official documents state&#x003F; Is it a race federation and a geographic federation as the hon. member for Yeoville has stated, or is it a geographic federation as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has stated&#x003F; Which one of the three leaders is the true <span class="col_3811-3812" refersTo="page_0521"/>leader&#x003F; The people of South Africa want to know, Johannesburg (West) wants to know, Worcester wants to know &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Durban (Point) knows least of all because he still has to wait to see which leader is really the true leader. The nation wants to know what their policy is, because if it is a geographic federation, then it is fraught with even more dangers than the so-called race federation, which is bad enough, because if it is a geographic federation then I should like to know how it is to be constituted&#x003F; Is the Transkei to be regarded as a separate geographic unit which has to have representation in this Parliament&#x003F; Who will represent them&#x003F; Will it be Whites&#x003F; Could it be Whites&#x003F;</p>

<p>Are they, in terms of the United Party policy, part of the geographic federation, or are they part of the mixed area&#x003F; How are they to be represented here&#x003F; I think the voters of Worcester and Johannesburg (West) want to know; they are entitled to know. I should like to know whether the United Party can make this matter clear to us. Which one of these three standpoints is their official standpoint&#x003F; Or will they have to take fright once again and go and snort in the &#x201C;back room&#x201D; and decide which one is the policy they will announce for the next election&#x003F; There are numerous other dangers implicit in this geographic federation, which is even less acceptable, but there is also another matter in regard to which they differ fundamentally from one another, and that is the question of representation in this Parliament by White or by Bantu. In regard to that subject only two of the United Party leaders have had anything to say. The youngest leader has not yet adopted an official attitude in regard to this matter; he will wait for the right opportunity. But the other two have announced their points of view. The hon. the Leader stated his point of view in this brochure issued by the United Party and he expressed it very strongly and very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu in all the provinces will be represented in Parliament by at least eight white representatives in the House of Assembly and six in the Senate.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Whites&#x201D;; that is what is stated in this yellow paper being distributed amongst the voters. The voters must never make the mistake of thinking that they will be nonwhites. But what does the Leader himself say&#x003F; I want to begin first with the hon. Leader&#x2019;s own speech. A few years ago he made a speech at De Aar in regard to this subject. He spoke about the question of representation in this Parliament.</p>

<p>The chief leader, the &#x201C;leader&#x201D; in inverted commas. He states his attitude clearly, and here he is already differing from what was stated in that yellow-press puplication. This is the policy of the United Party (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the Bantu in the Central Parliament must be represented by the Whites, but if the United Party want to convince the Bantu with its race federation plan, it is clear that it will not be able to continue withholding representation by their own people from the Bantu.</block>

<p>That was the first concession. But then the hon. member for Yeoville came along, and what did he say&#x003F; I am quoting from Hansard, column 605 on 5th February, 1965. He was referring here to a speech made by the then Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, Minister Botha, and he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He quoted me as having said that on our advent to power the Bantu would be represented in Parliament by Whites, and then in reply to a specific question I said that I accepted that in due course the Parliament would allow &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not by means of an election or by means of a referendum, but Parliament would allow&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Bantu to represent Bantu in Parliament. That is the gist of it. Sir. I said that, and I believe that that will happen.</block>

<p>I am once again asking the United Party, because Worcester and Johannesburg (West), and the voters, want to know: Is it their policy that this Parliment can decide that Bantu can be represented in this Parliament by Bantu under their federation plan&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to begin with this yellow Press publication and quote from it (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cape Coloured will be acknowledged as Westerners. Not only will their former political rights, i.e. the right to be included on a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in the Cape and Natal and to vote, be restored to them, but they will also be allowed to sit in Parliament if they are elected.</block>

<p>There is no mention of a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll here. They will be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. That is the United Party&#x2019;s official policy. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the United Party&#x2019;s authority on Coloured affairs. The small leader has taken over here; he did not give the hon. member for Yeoville a chance to speak; he spoke first and he stated his point of view very clearly. I am quoting now from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 18th April, 1965. This is not a report from the <i>Sunday Times&#x00B7;,</i> it is an article written by the hon. member under his own name, Mr. J. D. du P. (Japie) Basson. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact is that there has always been a school of thought on the Opposition side which favours direct group representation for the minorities. I and many others believe that it is essential for the Coloured man to have his own representatives in Parliament, few as they may be. Only in this way can proper political leadership be established for the Coloured people.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principle of direct group representation is entirely different. It is not based on the doctrine of apartheid or on any doctrine of race discrimination.</block>

<p>And then he adds this afterthought&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In my own view the future points to a rejection of the policy of the separate roll as an apartheid measure and the acceptance of the Coloured people on a system of direct group representation as the most suitable way of achieving equality of political status and co-operation.</block>

<p>In other words, it is very clear. The official United Party policy is that the Coloureds be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, as they promised the Coloureds in 1953-&#x2019;54. That is the official party attitude. But for more than two years now the junior deputy leader, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;this article appeared in 1965&#x2014;has been stating that the Coloureds will not be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. They must be placed on a separate roll and they must represent their own people and must come and sit in this Parliament. Now I am asking: Are such ideas, which are fundamentally different, reconcilable within the same party&#x003F; Or must the party first have reached such a stage of disintegration as the United Party has done, before anything like that is possible&#x003F; They are two fundamentally different points of view. I want to say it again. The voters of Worcester want to know, and the voters of Johannesburg (West) want to know what is the difference in plain language&#x003F; If the hon. member&#x2019;s for Bezuidenhout is the correct one, and it is the official policy, then it means that alt the first opportunity the United Party has of coming into power the Coloureds will sit in this House. That is what it means. [Interjections.] They will sit here.</p>

<p>The hon. member is aggravating his position considerably now. His official party policy is to restore only those who were on the Voters&#x2019; Roll to the Common Roll. But his policy is to place all the Coloureds in South Africa on a separate roll and give them representation here. But I wonder whether the hon. the Leader is aware that that hon. member is adopting an attitude like that. Can a leader sit here and remain silent while one of his lieutenants is announcing a policy which is directly opposed to his own&#x003F; Can he do it&#x003F; [Interjections.] Where is the party discipline&#x003F; Nobody has ever repudiated it. It is very clear. Under the United Party&#x2019;s policy of restoring the Coloureds to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and the right of Coloureds to be elected to this House of Assembly, it means that it does not follow naturally that if they come into power the Coloureds will sit here. What it means then is that the Coloureds will first have to have a majority on that Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in that constituency, and will have to put forward a Coloured candidate and that he will have to be elected before a Coloured can sit here. But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s attitude is the direct opposite. The moment they come into power&#x2014;if his attitude should triumph&#x2014;with the Coloureds on a separate roll, then they elect a number of Coloureds who will sit here. There is a fundamental difference between the two. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must discuss this matter a little and find out what is going on there. I just want to tell him this. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is renowned for differing from leaders and adhering to his own point of view. The National Party had the <span class="col_3815-3816" refersTo="page_0523"/>courage, when he differed from them fundamentally on a point of policy, to say to him: &#x201C;Off you go, back to where you belong&#x201D;. I just want to tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition that unreality is nursing an adder in his bosom and that he will have to put up with that adder for a long time. I am convinced of that.</p>

<p>I think that South Africa and the electorate in general are entitled to know which of these two attitudes is the official party point of view. I think it is necessary and I think it is no more than right. I want to leave that matter now and return for a few minutes to the hon. member for Durban (Point), if he will allow me to do so. The hon. member has been sitting here the whole afternoon eagerly waiting for me to pay some attention to him as well. The hon. member is not a leader yet. I think he is deputy leader in Natal, and that he is doing his best. What I should like to know from the hon. member for Durban (Point) is this, and I want to put it to him in the form of a hypothetical question. I hope he will reply to it. I know he is an honest &#x2026; [Interjections.] I know he is a reasonably honest member and that he will perhaps reply to my question. [Interjections.] I want to state it hypothetically.

South Africa was still a complete blank. This is a hypothetical question. A blank map of Southern Africa.

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. C. P. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Our policy has always been ultimate total separation. [Interjections.] Ultimately. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville is feigning great surprise. But I shall read to him from a speech made here by Dr. Verwoerd in 1958. It is very, very clear. [Interjections.] Will the hon. member for Yeoville pay attention now, because he is pretending that this is something altogether new. On 15th September, 1958, the late Dr. Verwoerd said in this House of Assembly (Hansard, Col. 3805)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3817-3818" refersTo="page_0524"/>The ideal of total apartheid gives one something to aim at. We have said clearly &#x2026; that the policy of apartheid constantly moves in the direction of ever-increasing separation. The ideal must be total separation in every sphere &#x2026;</block>

<p>Is there any doubt&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in all spheres, but everyone realizes to-day that is impracticable &#x2026; But everyone realizes also that if one has such a clear and definite aim &#x2026;</block>

<p>Wait, if the hon. member would only be patient, he would get his reply. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But everyone realizes also that if one has such a clear and definite aim then one can test one&#x2019;s daily deeds by that yardstick to see whether one is leading the country towards more and more separation, whether it be within our country, as long as White and non-White are both here, or whether it be territorially to the extent to which one can promote it &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member is uttering the kind of demented laugh somebody would utter who is cornered. Our ultimate policy&#x2014;and this is what we are aiming at&#x2014;is total apartheid and separation in all spheres. I repeat it with emphasis. That is what we are aiming at. Every piece of legislation which is placed on the Statute Book is tested against that yardstick, i.e. is that piece of legislation moving in the direction of increased separation, or is it prejudicial to the ideal of total separation&#x003F; If it promotes that ideal, it is accepted, and if it is prejudicial to that ideal, it is not accepted. The few points of difference which have been raised here between the two parties in this specific debate I now want to test against the ideal state of affairs which the hon. members also admit would be the ideal state of affairs.</p>

<p>I want to begin with white capital in the Bantu homelands, the so-called releasing of general white capital in the Bantu homelands. Does it serve to promote the ideal of ultimate total separation, which is the ideal&#x003F; Surely one would be then creating precisely the same problem which you have now created here and in regard to which everybody has stated, &#x201C;I could not help it&#x201D;. Surely you would then deliberately be creating a similar problem in the Transkei from next year on. You would be promoting it every day. Surely that is so. Surely you would then be working directly against this policy of total separation. I want to put it like this. Sometimes economic laws have to yield to practical politics. It is essential. I want to quote two examples from our history where economic laws did in the one case yield and in the other case did not, and indicate what the results were. In 1860 the Natal sugar farmers requested, for economic reasons, that Indians be imported as workers because the Zulus did not want to work in the sugar industry. For economic reasons Indians were imported. The Indians came to Natal as workers, remained there, and their numbers increased rapidly. At the moment we are saddled with an Indian question in South Africa. Economic measures required it; politics never came into the picture. To-day we are sitting with an Indian question in South Africa. In the year 1902, shortly after the Second Anglo-Boer War, the gold mines demanded that Chinese be imported to work in the mines because they could not obtain workers. Economic laws demanded that Chinese workers be imported. The Chinese workers were imported for economic reasons, but practical politics resulted in the Chinese being eliminated and sent back in 1906 and 1907. There the economic laws had to yield to practical politics. What was the result&#x003F; To-day we have an Indian question, but we have no Chinese question. There will be many occasions in future when economic laws will have to yield to practical politics. If it should be necessary in this case, and I do not want to say that it is an economic law that they will have to be removed, then I say that in the interests of South Africa, the economic laws in regard to the development here, will also have to yield to practical politics to ensure the survival of South Africa.

<p>I hope the hon. member will give me a chance now. I did not interrupt that hon. member once. I listened to him all the time and that is why I have got up to reply.</p>

<p>We have dealt with the effects of the taxation proposals on the country in all its aspects and we have dealt with the financial aspects. We have dealt with the position of the ordinary man. We have dealt with inefficiency in Government. We have dealt with overlapping of different departments, authorities and duties. We have tried to show the Government where it can save money. We have tried to show the Government how it can become more efficient. We have moved an amendment to that effect and we have adhered to the amendment, trying to improve the position of South Africa. What has the Government side done&#x003F; They have tried to divert the discussions at every possible point. What have we <span class="col_3819-3820" refersTo="page_0525"/>heard from them about the ordinary man and how the Budget is going to affect him&#x003F; What suggestions have we heard from them as to how the Minister&#x2019;s slogan of &#x201C;Work and save&#x201D; can be carried out&#x003F; He obviously wants us to work harder so that we can produce more. That is what he wants in order to curb this inflation. What suggestions have we had from the Government&#x2019;s side&#x003F; We have had none at all. They tried to bring in colour politics hoping to divert us from the effects of the Government&#x2019;s policy on the ordinary man in the street. They have tried to avoid discussion on the financial state of the country and inflation. We have persisted and in the end we thought that perhaps we should move on to something about which they can talk&#x2014;we will bring them on to farming. But what has happened&#x003F; The last two members to have spoken from that side of the House have run away from farming as well. We have had to listen to the hon. member for Klip River and the hon. member for Randfontein making purely political speeches.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I will reply to the hon. member for Randfontein. What they have done, and not only these two hon. members but other members on the Government side as well, in order to divert the discussions, was to attack our patriotism. Why have they spent so much time on patriotism and attacking our lack of patriotism, as they put it. Mr. Speaker, do you know why&#x003F; It is because they are worried. In the past they were able to attack us with the false cry that we were not South African. When they found that the public was no longer falling for that and will no longer follow them on the statement that we are not South African, they tried to change this Because they found that people did not want to go to their meetings any more to listen to this from public platforms and their Press is no longer prepared to stress this point, they are trying to propagate it in Parliament. They have failed again. They attack us for a lack of patriotism, but I want to say a few words to the hon. member for Klip River. If we want to go back into the past we can embarrass them far more than they can ever embarrass us. I have merely got to remind them of a little book we issued after the war, the &#x201C;Black Record of Nationalism&#x201D; which contained excerpts of speeches by Nationalist Party members of the time. The hon. Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education knows this very well. I think he helped to compile this booklet. All we have to do is to refer back to the speeches made then. One of these hon. members made a speech about how the English-speaking people are joining the Nationalist Party. Must I go back and remind the English-speaking people of what the Nationalist Party members said about the English-speaking people during the war&#x003F; Must I go back and remind the English-speaking people that General Hertzog and Mr. Havenga were kicked out of the Nationalist Party because of the question of English political rights&#x003F; They were prepared to guarantee the English language and cultural rights but not their political rights and Mr. Havenga and General Hertzog left them. They have claimed that they are now getting Jewish support as well but must I remind the Jews that they were not allowed to become members of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal until quite recently, that they were barred from membership&#x003F; Must I remind them of Mr. Eric Louw&#x2019;s attack on English-Jewish capitalism&#x003F; Must I remind them of all that&#x003F; Our Leader, in speaking to the present Prime Minister, said, &#x201C;We will forget about what happened in the past&#x201D;&#x2014;because we know what happened to the Prime Minister during the war. We are prepared to forget the past and give you a new start, but do we get any encouragement when we hear speeches such as this&#x003F; Why do we have to have speeches like this&#x003F; It is because of desperation. They are trying to rally support again. The hon. member for Randfontein accused us of having changed our policy. The way he addressed us it would appear to be a terrible thing to change your policy. I do not agree with everything he said about changing policy but I am not going to reply to him in this regard. I do not have the time now and we will do so later. [Interjections.] If it is such a sin to change your policy, I would like to tell those hon. members this. They got into power originally in 1948 on a certain policy and they have changed that policy continually without going to the country for its approval. I want to ask the hon. member for Randfontein what happened to Dr. D&#x00F6;nges&#x2019; immigration policy. Mr. Speaker, you will remember this, because you were in the House and you must have been shocked to hear Dr. D&#x00F6;nges say he was scrapping General Smuts&#x2019; immigration policy.</p>

<p>Why was General Smuts&#x2019; policy scrapped&#x003F; It was because General Smuts had given a guarantee to Union Castle Company that if any berths were empty on a Union Castle ship &#x2014;two ships were set aside to bring out immigrants&#x2014;he would pay for them. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said it was quite wrong that the Government should give a financial undertaking to bring out immigrants and we should not pay for immigrants. When General Smuts asked Dr. D&#x00F6;nges whether he had paid anything he said no, nothing, the ships were full. But what is happening now&#x003F; Not only have they to-day the same system of screening as we had &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<p>Who said so&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Minister Trollip said so, your Minister of Immigration. He said so in this House. I think he was replying to a question from Mr. Tucker. In any event, he said the screening was exactly the same. But not only is the screening the same. They are also paying people to come out here! What about the native policy&#x003F; Where and when did they tell the public that they were prepared to make the Bantu areas independent states&#x003F; Never! They never got the approval for that.</p> <p><span class="col_3821-3822" refersTo="page_0526"/>We heard it the first time in this House here. Did they ever tell the public when they got into power in 1948 that it was their policy to do away with the Native representatives in this House&#x003F; Of course not. In 1948 they proposed to give the Coloured separate representation but they were to be given second class members of Parliament. Well, are they second class members of Parliament&#x003F; Of course not. And what about the Orange River scheme&#x003F; They abandoned Mr. Conroy&#x2019;s scheme but now they have started implementing it&#x2014;again too late. Think of all the water we could have been using down the Fish river. Once again they are too late. What is their policy in regard to sport&#x003F; Can any one of the hon. members opposite get up and tell me what this policy is now&#x003F; Let the hon. the Minister of Finance when he replies to this debate tell us what this policy is. When are Japanese white and when are they not white&#x003F; The Population Registration Act was passed shortly after they gained power but as yet we do not have a proper definition of a Coloured man. During this Session we are still debating another definition. What about group areas&#x003F; How often was it not necessary for them to change that legislation&#x003F; The hon. member for Randfontein said &#x2026; Mr. Speaker, that hon. member has run away from the Chamber. That is typical of him. He makes accusations and then he runs away. He wanted to know what would happen to Soweto under our policy. Well, I will tell him what will happen to Soweto under their policy&#x2014;it will not remain a Native township, a Black spot within a white area but it will become part of the Bantustan. That is what they will do, the same as they did with Mdantsane. Then the whole of Johannesburg will become a border area. I am very sorry the hon. member for Randfontein is not here. I should like to have it placed on record that he made accusations and thereafter ran away. He talked about total apartheid but when was total apartheid part of their policy&#x003F; Certainly not when they got into power in 1948. Hon. members here will remember that it was Dr. Verwoerd, when he was still a senator, who announced that the policy would be total apartheid. Older members here will remember that Dr. Malan denied that the policy was total apartheid. Dr. Malan said it was an ideal. That is not what Dr. Verwoerd said. Dr. Malan said it was an ideal, as it was an ideal for everybody to go to heaven one day. Unfortunately everybody would not, he said, go to heaven one day&#x2014; which must have been sad news for some hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>But I do not want to deal with this any further because I want to get back to the Budget. We have made certain suggestions to the hon. the Minister about the way in which he can improve productivity and avoid inflation. We proposed to him a better training of Bantu workers in order to make them more efficient and more productive; we have suggested a greater degree of efficiency in Government departments; the elimination of unnecessary overlapping and duplication of the authorities and duties of the various departments; and improvements of conditions in the reserves, proposals especially aimed at increasing productivity. We spent considerable time in pleading the interests of the breadwinner, for the poorer man and the man in the middle income group. Did we hear a word coming from the other side, a word of concern about the condition of the man in the middle income group&#x003F; Well, we got two hon. members so far as to say that they were not satisfied. What comfort is there in this Budget for the ordinary man in the street&#x003F; The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) already dealt with the complaints of the bus workers who complain that they cannot come out on their salaries because of the rising cost of living. The chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs the other day appealed to the Government to do something about the rising cost of living because, he said, the Coloured man could not cope with it any longer. The ordinary man who saves by insuring himself and by contributing to a pension fund, what value for his money is he going to get when he is eventually paid out&#x003F; The value of the rand of to-day is equal to the value of the pound as it was in 1948. It has depreciated to that extent. Only the other day the Reserve Bank admitted that the rand was being devalued at the rate of 3.5 per cent every year. And how many Government members expressed their concern about this&#x003F; Sir, to-day one needs twice as much as you needed in 1948 to keep up your standard of living. Even a new cost-of-living index had to be compiled in 1958 because the curve of the old one was going too high. It was already over 200. So, in 1958 they compiled a new one starting again with 100; and already it stands at 120. This Government always neglects the ordinary man in the street. It is not only this hon. Minister who does it&#x2014;it has been the policy of the Government in the past.</p>

<p>Here I should like to remind the House of what happened last year. Interest on first series savings bonds was declared tax free up to an amount of R6.740 per annum for any taxpayer. The incidence of tax free interest is such that the tax benefits is as much as almost 17 per cent to the wealthy taxpayer. The tax curve is such that the tax free benefits gives substantial relief to the wealthy man and very little to the lower income groups. How can the ordinary man in the street and the poor man invest in bonds&#x003F; The rich man can buy tax bonds and he gets his interest free: it comes off his income tax, so he can combat the rising cost of living by investing in that way. He gets it both ways. If he invested it in any other way, he would have to pay income tax on the interest, but by doing it this way he avoids income tax both ways. Perhaps the hon. member for Queenstown can answer this, too. [Interjection.] The poor man cannot afford to put away money in the Post Office, and if he does he gets much less interest. [Interjection.] The hon. member for <span class="col_3823-3824" refersTo="page_0527"/>Queenstown should tell me how this relief to the rich man helps the middle income group man or the poor man. Last year the self-employed person also had his allowance for annuity contributions increased from R1,200 to R2,000. If he wanted to buy himself a pension previously, he could deduct R1200 from his taxable income, and last year that was increased to R2,000. To whom did this give relief&#x003F; Can the poor man pay R2,000 a year for a pension&#x003F; [Interjection.] I am not against that scheme at all, but what does the poor man get to help him to combat the rising cost of living&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I am going to give you something, Sir, that does get at the poor man. The increase in building society interest has affected every person in the middle income group. A man with a loan of R6,000 on his house who wishes to repay the loan over 20 years will have to pay at 6&#x00BD; per cent, R44.75 a month. At 8 per cent it will cost him R50.40, and at 8&#x00BD; per cent, as it is now, it costs him R52.20, an increase of R12 a month. With the rising cost of living these people cannot afford to pay this extra amount of money, and so I can go on.</p>

<p>Now I want to get to the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, but unfortunately he has left. I want to deal with his policy. [Interjection.] I am talking Ito the Budget because I am dealing with productivity and labour affects productivity. Even that Minister will realize that. I am sorry the Deputy Minister has left. I suppose he could not take it either and therefore he also left. He has given the impression here that the Chamber of Industries and the Municipality of Cape Town were accepting the policy of the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dieselfde Kamer van Nywerheid van Kaapland het nou &#x2019;n spesiale komitee aan-gestel wat niks anders doen as om nyweraars raad te gee hoe om Kleurlingarbeid in die hande te kry nie.</block>

<p>He says that because they have done that, they have accepted his policy, but what they have done was to appoint their own body to avoid the mess they landed in through the actions of the Minister&#x2019;s Department. They would rather try to find ways and means themselves than to leave it to the Deputy Minister. That is why they appointed their own body. It is a sign of no confidence in the Minister and his Department. Then this really amazed me. He quoted from <i>Die Burger</i> in regard to a resolution taken by the Cape Town Municipality&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Bestuurskomitee van die Kaapstadse Stadsraad het besluit om deur die Administrateur verto&#x00EB; tot die Regering te rig om &#x2019;n bepaling in die dorpstigtingsplan in te sluit van elke nywerheidsgebied in Wes-Kaapland wat die gebruik van Bantoearbeid sonder die toestemming van die Regering sal verbied.</block>

<p>He said that was proof that they wanted this policy. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Met ander woorde, die Kaapstadse Stadsraad pleit daarvoor dat Bantoe-arbeid hier ook moet uitgaan.</block>

<p>But the Minister should know what the position was. He forbade the use of any Native labour in the new industrial areas in the Cape, and the Municipality made representations to the Department so that they could get the Native labour there with the permission of the Government, and so they passed a resolution asking the Administrator to assist them to get the Government to amend its policy so that they could get the labour with the approval of the Government. It is certainly not, as he suggested, that they wanted to get rid of Native labour altogether. The Minister is not here and I do not wish to continue dealing with points raised by him. I am sorry the Minister of Bantu Administration himself is not here, because he said some amazing things in his speech the other day. He said that nobody had ever done anything to develop farming in the Reserves. He said that the white entrepreneur, the white farmer, did nothing. Now I want to ask that Deputy Minister sitting there to tell his Minister that we want to know from him when he comes back under another Vote how any white farmer could have taken part in developing farming in the Reserves. Surely they know that white farmers, except in certain areas, could not own land in the Reserves, and where they could own land, for (instance in Umzimkulu, I should like the Minister to tell us what complaints he has against the white farmers there. What complaint do they have against the method of farming of the white farmers on their own farms&#x003F; Did he have any trouble there, or with any of the white farmers where they owned farms in the Transkei&#x003F; How could they develop farming&#x003F; It is nonsense. The Deputy Minister gave us a list of dams they had built, showing what improvements they have made to agriculture, but unfortunately that Minister does not know as much about the Transkei as I do. That particular rehabilitation was started before the war. The Minister knows about the dams built at Quamata, and one which is now nearing completion near Cofimvaba.</p>

<p>That just shows the ignorance, and that hon. member is Chairman of the Native Affairs Commission! On 5th March, 1948, the blueprint was handed in to the Department by the engineers. They had completed the whole scheme, but it took over ten years before they started building the dam. [Interjection.] The Minister also dealt with the development of the Reserves. He could not avoid mentioning it because the policy originally announced for the Reserves was that no <span class="col_3825-3826" refersTo="page_0528"/>white initiative or white capital would be used. When the Tomlinson Commission made its recommendations everybody knows that Dr. Verwoerd then turned them down. I have the White Paper here, but I do not have the time to read it. In 1962 Dr. Verwoerd made a speech about investment, but the suggestion has always been that if Whites want to invest there they must do so through the Development Corporation. The other day they were shocked when the hon. member for Hillbrow asked how many Ministers had invested in this Corporation. There was not one. But if it is the policy now to allow Whites to go in to develop the Reserves, that is only the old policy of the United Party. I want to remind the hon. member for Heilbron that the development of mines in the Reserves was started by us. Who started developing mines in the Reserves&#x003F; Was it the United Party or the Nationalist Party&#x003F;</p>

<p>He knows very well that the Nickel Corporation was granted the right to develop a mine near Mount Ayliff. This Government afterwards got Anglo-American to go and prospect there too but nothing seems to be happening. Two other companies working there went insolvent. But, Sir, the policy is nothing new. The United Party used to allow that sort of development. What about the industries which were established in Umtata&#x003F; There is a clothing factory; there is a mineral water factory; there was an engineering works; there was a big furniture factory and all that sort of thing. Whose idea was it initially that the Government should give assistance for the establishment of industries in the reserves&#x003F; It was the United Party&#x2019;s idea. What about the Good hope Textile industry&#x003F; You know, Sir, what happened there. The United Party had decided to start industries in the reserves. King William&#x2019;s Town was selected for this particular industry, but the land which was suitable for it on the borders of a reserve was in a white area so the Bantu Trust bought it and made it part of the reserve, just the reverse of what this Government is doing now in buying white areas and making reserves alongside the industries. Dr. Verwoerd, while Minister of Native Affairs, said that he was going to take it out of the reserve again because he did not want industries in the reserves. He never did it. But, Sir, that industry was started by the United Party in co-operation with an oversea company. They put in half the money and the Industrial Development Corporation invested the other half. But you cannot get an industrialist to go and develop an industry in the reserve unless he is going to be fully compensated. He wants to be assured that he is going to make a good profit. After all, we are capitalists; we are not a socialist regime.</p>

<p>Unless you can give an entrepreneur an inducement to establish his industry in the reserves, he is not going to go there. That particular industry had to be assured of tenure and they were given a 99-year lease because they said quite frankly, &#x201C;It will take ten years before we make profits.&#x201D; Sir, we have had experience of establishing industries of this nature. I do not want to go into all the details, but I want to point out that unless you give industrialists an incentive to make decent profits, they are not going to risk their money there; they are rather going to invest it in shares listed on the stock exchange.

<p>The hon. member for Transkei opened his speech here this afternoon by levelling the charge that we had introduced colour politics into this debate and that we did not want to discuss financial matters. Surely the hon. member is not so unenlightened as regards the rules of procedure of this House that he does not know that all sorts of matters may be raised in the course of a budget debate. We on this side of the House were not alone in introducing colour politics into the debate. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a special point of discussing that topic. That is why we on this side of the House did so too. But I want to tell the hon. member that this complaint of his is nothing but a fig leaf. We know that it is a fact that the United Party, as far as its colour policy is concerned, is completely naked at the moment. It is now trying to find cover behind a financial debate because it no longer has any policy in regard to colour questions. At the moment it is engaged in a new search for a new colour policy. The hon. member for Transkei had a great deal to say about quite a number of things. He said, for example, that we did not have any immigration policy; that we had taken over the immigration policy of the United Party; that we had taken over General Smuts&#x2019; immigration policy. Sir, let me remind the hon. member what the immigration policy of General Smuts was. I am quoting from the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 14th August, 1946. General Smuts said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us throw open the doors of South Africa. We want an influx of immigrants to our country. After the discovery of diamonds and gold there was a great rush to our country. The good and the bad came. We are now going to have a repetition of the development of South Africa. I say: Let us open our doors to the good and the bad. Let them come in their thousands, in their hundreds and in their millions.</block>

<p>The immigration policy of the National Party has always been that we welcome immigrants to South Africa who are assailable by the Whites of South Africa. For that reason it is our policy that immigrants must be screened before they come to South Africa. Accordingly we will not take both the good and the bad; we will only take those who are assimilable by the white community in South Africa and who can be of service to us. For that reason we do not take unskilled labour either but only skilled labour and selected persons, something which the hon. the Minister of Immigration reiterated recently.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of Soweto and intimated that Soweto and the south-western townships around Johannesburg were the products of their policy. The hon. member should really not think that we are all fools. The hon. member knows that we inherited many squatters&#x2019; settlements around Johannesburg from the United Party Government, that we cleared those squatters&#x2019; settlements and moved their inhabitants to townships which had been established in the south-western parts of Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The hon. member then said that he wanted to come back to the Budget, said a few words about the Budget, but then reverted to the question of native policy in regard to which he expressed certain criticisms. He criticized our policy as far as the removal of Bantu from the Western Cape was concerned. Sir, as regards the removal of Bantu from the Western Cape, I want to make the position very clear, I consider it necessary to do so, because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout expressed himself in vile terms here when he spoke of the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I object from this side of the House to the negative approach in respect of the removal of people. It is negative. They are behaving as though all white civilization depends on removing a small group of people from the Western Cape, while there are millions in the vicinity of Johannesburg.</block>

<p>He said that they objected to this removal and that he warned to remind this House that we objected if white persons were removed from black states and that we were doing exactly the same thing here. In addition he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is a negative and repugnant approach. If the leaders of a black state in Africa say that they are going to drive cut the Whites, we shout that they are savages.</block>

<p>In other words, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made out as though this policy of ours in regard to the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape was something barbaric. Mr. Speaker, what is the real state of affairs&#x003F; Here in the Western Cape we have a large Coloured population. I want to remind hon. members that the Coloured population in South Africa already numbers much more than one million; that their traditional home has been and is the Western Cape; that the Western Cape is the traditional place where they have to sell their labour.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for the purposes of this policy I shall tell the hon. member where the boundary is. For the purposes of this policy the boundary extends from Colesberg to Humansdorp. West of that line, as we know, we have always had Coloureds in earlier years. It was only in the thirties that Bantu started penetrating into the Western Cape. What has been the result of that&#x003F; Bantu who are penetrating into the Western Cape are forcing the Coloureds from their employment and they are able to do so because the Bantu have a much lower standard of living. He is able to sell his labour more cheaply than the Coloured. The Coloured also has a right to be protected in South Africa and it is for the sake of protecting the Coloured in his traditional home where he has always lived, namely the Western Cape, that this policy is being implemented. This policy is not, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made out, a barbaric policy under which we simply want to drive people out of an area. In the first place that is being done for the protection of the Coloured. This involves a whole number of socio-economic problems. There is for example the interbreeding of the Bantu and the Coloured in the Western Cape We have to guard against that as well, we have to see to it that that does not happen. Then there is also the problem of the large number of illegitimate children here; another thing to which we have to pay attention. This matter is bound up with a whole number of socioeconomic problems: hence the policy that we have to remove the Bantu from this area for the protection of the Coloured in his traditional place of employment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout in particular raised many objections in the course of his speech to accusations &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether it is the Government&#x2019;s policy that Coloureds may not seek employment in other parts bar the Cape Province&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No. There are other parts where we also have Coloureds, and special areas have even been set aside where those Coloureds may seek employment. That does not mean that we will move all of them to the northern provinces for example. We know that their traditional area is here. As I was saying, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout strongly objected because we accused them of being integrationists. He said, <i>inter alia</i>, that he was getting tired of this integration story. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_3829-3830" refersTo="page_0530"/>But, quite cordially, I say that we are rapidly getting tired of the integration stories and the deliberate misrepresentations of our policy.</p>

<p>I now want to ask hon. members, &#x201C;Is it this side of the House which made integrationists of them&#x003F;&#x201D; The United Party has always been in favour of integration. They, and not we. are the people who spoke of integration. Let me remind them what Adv. J. G. N. Strauss, for example, said in regard to this matter. He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that unless the United Party&#x2019;s policy of integrating white capital in the reserves is accepted this burden will become unbearable and nothing worth mentioning will ever be done for developing those reserves</block>

<p>Here, even in regard to the development of the Bantu areas, he used the word &#x201C;integration&#x201D; on purpose. This brings me to this new cry which is being heard in South Africa&#x2014;a cry which mostly goes up from the United Party &#x2014;namely that white capital and white skill should be employed in the Bantu areas. I may add that there are certain newspapers and magazines which expressed the same idea in recent times. I came across an article in <i>Volkshandel, inter alia,</i> which stated (translation), &#x201C;The time is now ripe for the authorities to give attention to the possibilities of developing the Bantu homelands with the aid of white initiative and capital with a view to long-term planning&#x201D;. I also came across that in another magazine. But the United Party in particular is now making out as though there has been a complete change in the policy of the National Party, that the National Party has now reached maturity and that we are now going to employ white capital and skill in the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me remind you what our standpoint is. I want to state once more, and I want to state unambiguously, that there has been no change or departure from the ideas expressed by the late Dr. Verwoerd in the course of a speech in this House when he gave his reasons for not accepting a certain part of the Tomlinson Report. It will be recalled that the majority recommendation of the Tomlinson Report was that white capital and white skill must be employed in the Bantu areas. Dr. Verwoerd, amongst others, then set out his standpoint. Is it necessary to repeat that if white capital is allowed into the Bantu areas it will be necessary to grant white persons rights of ownership in respect of factories in those areas&#x003F; It will also be necessary to grant white persons rights of ownership in land for residential purposes. White skill will have to be employed in those areas and white skill will mean that white persons will have to go and live there. That will mean accommodation for those Whites. That will mean that services will have to be provided for those Whites. There will have to be schools and churches.</p>

<p>In other words, many white spots, to use that description, will appear in the Bantu areas, if white capital is allowed in, new vested rights will come into existence in those areas. The hon. member for Transkei quite rightly said that persons would want to go there on a long-term basis because no one was going to risk his money on a short-term project. And if they go there on a long-term basis it will mean that vested rights will have to be granted. What, in point of fact, will then become of our Bantu areas&#x003F; They will be penetrated by Whites and the Bantu areas will again become White.</p>

<p>Seen from the Bantu point of view, is it not true that the employment of such white capital and skill, as proposed by the United Party, should take place without any restrictions&#x003F; Will that not mean that we will be depriving the Bantu of their economic future where they have already settled themselves in their own areas&#x003F; I say that this approach is a wrong one. This approach to the Bantu areas is wrong because it takes place from the white man&#x2019;s point of view and not from the black man&#x2019;s point of view.</p>

<p>What position do we really want to achieve in the Bantu areas&#x003F; I say that there are certain prerequisites which must be imposed for the development of any Bantu area in South Africa. The first requirement is that the human factor must be taken into account. Let me explain to hon. members what I mean by that. I have here a report of a committee of the Senate of the U.S.A. On account of the capital they had given to the black states in Africa, they caused an investigation to be instituted and the following is what that committee found. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">American and free world policies can marginally affect the pace of transition, but basically that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and human attitudes, political institutions and social structure which each society must generate.</block>

<p>In other words, the Bantu community itself must generate its own development and its own social structure, its own political institutions and it itself has to develop its own human attitudes. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It follows that any effective policy towards the under-developed countries must have a realistically long working horizon. It must be marked by a patience and a perspective which have not always been its trade mark.</block>

<p>I want to point out that the late Dr. Verwoerd emphasized this very aspect when he discussed the Tomlinson Report. He pointed out that it would be unpsychological if action were not taken in accordance with the abilities of the Bantu himself. The Bantu himself had to learn to absorb the things which came about there. He himself had to generate those things and be able to absorb them. This is what Dr. Verwoerd <span class="col_3831-3832" refersTo="page_0531"/>said in that regard as far as the Bantu was concerned (Hansard, volume 91, columns 5307-5308)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Psychologically he is not adapted to industrial life and certainly not to private enterprise, to be able to start on a big scale. Nor would he be in a position in ten or 20 years&#x2019; time to take over big industries which have been developed there if his relationship towards industry has been simply that of the recipient and the outsider. The psychological mistakes which have been made in connection with developmental work in the rural sphere must not be repeated in the industrial sphere. That is why the Government believes in the principle, not only that the Bantu should start on a small scale, that in his own area he should be given the opportunity, but that in the main he must start on the basis of self-help.</block>

<p>I now want to emphasize very strongly that everybody who wants to make out that the policy of Dr. Verwoerd is now being upset and that we are now on the eve of a new era and that we want to allow white capital and white skill into the Bantu areas undiscriminately is completely on the wrong track. Our policy still is as he set it out at that time. We must, in the first place, have regard to the human factor. The Bantu is the most important person in the Bantu area and he must be able to generate his prosperity himself. That cannot be handed to him on a tray. The second thing which this report of the U.S.A. established is that there must be a political and social structure. And let me say it now: We are working on that political and social structure. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has launched a programme for activating all the Bantu authorities; for developing their institutions and their forms of government, in other words, to make it possible for them to be activated so that they will be able to develop their political and social structures. A few days ago on that occasion the hon. the Minister also referred to the infra-structure which was being established. Again this is an infra-structure which is being established by the Bantu himself. He is building his own schools, he is constructing his own roads and he is establishing his own forms of government. He then emphasized the importance of primary production. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration indicated what progress had been in that sphere. The hon. member for Transkei, however, came along this afternoon and said that that was done under the United Party. That, I must say, was the height of foolishness, because you yourself, Sir, is aware of, for example, the many miles of grass strips planted on the farmlands of the Bantu in the Transkei in order to introduce soil conservation and combat soil erosion. All those things were done under this Government. The hon. member for Transkei also prided himself on that party allegedly having done such a great deal and allegedly having made so many plans. The building of the dam at Qamata was allegedly one of their plans. It seems to me that they only made plans but never carried any into effect. This Government is the one which carried all the plans into effect. It drew up better plans and carried them into effect. I just want to come to one further matter because my time has nearly expired. I want to come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, because the member for Bezuidenhout is now being presented as the new policy maker of the United Party. The other day he said the following very important thing, <i>inter alia,</i> here in the House of Assembly. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is and will always remain a state consisting of many nations.</block>

<p>Do you recall. Sir, that the Opposition never used to adopt the point of view of South Africa being a state consisting of many nations, but that it always referred to South Africa as being a multi-racial state and that their starting-point was that of the individual and not of the nation. The Opposition said that the human rights for which it fought were those of people who were all equal in South Africa. At that time it did not refer to a state consisting of many nations but to a multiracial state. It said that every person in South Africa had inviolable human rights. Now the hon. member is maintaining, however, that South Africa will always be a state consisting of many nations. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot be anything else.</block>

<p>Those are the words of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as regards that matter. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Zulu will not become a Xhosa and a Xhosa will not become a white man. This will remain a country of numerous nations and no one on earth will change that.</block>

<p>We have progressed to the stage where something like that comes from the ranks of the United Party. Then the hon. member came to light with the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have accepted the federal idea because in that we acknowledge the existence of diversity.</block>

<p>I now want to elaborate on that point. I want to ask him the following question. About a year ago they fought an election. At that time they adopted certain points of view. The hon. member said, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have accepted the federal idea because in that we acknowledge the existence of diversity. Secondly, because that is the only way in which one can avoid the domination of one by the other.</block>

<p>But on what basis did they conduct their election campaign only a year ago&#x003F; This is what they said. It was published by the member for Orange Grove and contained the 17 points of the United Party. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3833-3834" refersTo="page_0532"/>We stress most strongly that we shall maintain enlightened white leadership over the whole of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is what the member for Orange Grove said in his manifest issued on behalf of the United Party. I also have a pamphlet of theirs here in which they speak of &#x201C;White leadership over an undivided South Africa&#x201D;. Now. however, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that diversity is the only way of avoiding the domination of one by the other. Am I to deduce from this that they have denounced their &#x201C;White leadership&#x201D;; that they no longer want the domination of the black man by the white man but that they want that to be equal and that they have now accepted our policy on that point&#x003F; I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I should have liked to continue but my time has expired. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. P. G. J. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I may summarize the general complaint of the Opposition in this debate in the words that this is a bad government. And then they have a great deal to say on that score. But that is not the point. The point is that at the moment this country is saddled with the poorest opposition, both in numbers and in quality, this country has ever had in its history&#x2014;and I think the country deserves considerably better. And that is the United Party we see in the benches over there. And now I want to say the following: If I had belonged to such a tattered little political party, to such a little nincompoop of a party as the United Party, I would not adopt such a cocky attitude in this House as some of their sneakers. And I want to address myself specifically to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, with whom the hon. member in front of me has just dealt. He is not in the House at the moment, but I want to tell him that as a speaker he has in my opinion mastered everything but the art of being a convincing speaker. And as a politician he has mastered everything but the art of being a good politician. He came here and told us that the National Party Government and the National Party should not slander the United Party by saying that they advocate integration. Can you imagine that that should come from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. We should not slander the United Party by saying that they promote integration in South Africa. I regret to bring the following to the attention of the United Party, and specifically to the attention of the hon. member who spoke about slander. But before doing so &#x2014;and I do so most unwillingly&#x2014;I first want to say&#x2014;and I hope that in doing so I will, if possible, put paid to this thing in the ranks of the United Party once and for all&#x2014;I want to refer to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also charged us with in this House. I refer to the nasty phrase he used, namely that in dealing with the Population Registration Act this Government was engaged in what reminded him of &#x201C;overtones of a master race&#x201D;. When will the United Party learn that to use expressions and statements such as those in this House do us incalculable harm abroad&#x003F; And yet the hon. member said that there should be no slandering. I just want to read to you three statements made by delegates of the United Party at the 1964 congress of the United Party in Pretoria. If anything in South Africa can beat this for political slander, I hope it will never reach my ears. I quote these three things most unwillingly, because they verge on sacrilege, and I hope they will feel ashamed when I do so. The first I want to quote is this: &#x201C;All Dr. Verwoerd has ever done for South Africa, was to sabotage the country.&#x201D; That is the first one. The second one is: &#x201C;The curse of a nation is that it gets a foreigner to govern it who has not even sacrificed the foam on a glass of beer for his country.&#x201D; The United Party&#x2014;shame upon shame! But listen to this. It verges on sacrilege of the worst degree, and I regret to quote it in this House. According to a newspaper report a United Party representative said the following at that congress in 1964. I quote his words: &#x201C;Where is Dr. Verwoerd in 50 years&#x2019; time&#x003F; Then he is safe and sound in heaven.&#x201D; Despicable! Shame upon shame on the United Party! But then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout gets up in this House and wants to lecture to us that we should not accuse them of advocating integration. Let us take a closer look at this matter. Let us dissect the matter to the core. If they do not want to hear those accusations&#x2014;and we shall continue making those accusations&#x2014;let me say immediately &#x2026;</p>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. P. G. J. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>I have very little time, Mr. Speaker, and I would therefore prefer him to give me a chance to complete my speech. [Interjections.] But this was said by United Party people. It was never repudiated. It was said at the United Party congress and never repudiated. It was widely published. I am very grateful that the United Party feels unhappy about remarks of that kind, because they are a disgrace to politics in South Africa. If they wanted to do something they should have repudiated statements of that kind, which would have prevented me from quoting them afterwards in this House.</p>

<p>Let us take a closer look at this question of integration. There are four forms of integration which may be applied in South Africa. The first is biological integration, the second is social integration, the third is economic integration and the fourth is political integration. Now we just want to know: If the United Party does not want us to charge them with defending integration in this country, what was their attitude in respect of each of these basic aspects when apartheid and integration were at issue&#x003F; Then their attitude was most characteristic. From the outset, when this Government proposed separate voters rolls in this House, the United Party fought it tooth and nail. By the way, I see that at the <span class="col_3835-3836" refersTo="page_0533"/>time, before the election, the United Party said &#x201C;White leadership for ever&#x201D;. But now I see that there has been trouble, because the hon. member for Newton Park and Mr. Rudman clashed, after Mr. Rudman had said that they were no longer prepared to say &#x201C;for ever&#x201D;. Now they are adopting another subterfuge and are saying: One cannot say &#x201C;for ever&#x201D; because one has no control over time and eternity. We should like to know from the United Party: Do they still advocate white leadership &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D;, whatever that may mean, or do they advocate white leadership for whatever it may then mean, &#x201C;for ever&#x201D; in this country, as opposed to what we advocate, namely &#x201C;white control&#x201D; for ever in South Africa, as long as it pleases the Almighty. That was their attitude towards the separate voters&#x2019; lists. Surely we are justified in saying, in view of the fact that they oppose that, with all the implications arising from that through their actions they are not promoting apartheid in South Africa. And the alternative for apartheid is to further integration. That is what they are doing. That is why the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and quite a few of the hon. members of the United Party are in this regard virtually the legal fathers of the Progressive Party at the U.N.O. That is why we so frequently accuse them of that. Thus they fought group areas up to the last time it was discussed in this House. Group areas was fought on every level. Thus they fought job reservations, separate trade unions and separate universities, from the outset. Thus they also fought apartheid tooth and nail in every field with every bill introduced in the House, and the United Party Leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, said fairly recently that if they came into power they would repeal the following Acts, and he mentioned the Acts by name: The Population Registration Act, the Bantu Education Act, the Separate Universities Act, the Group Areas Act, the Immorality Act and the Industrial Conciliation Act, in particular the provisions relating to job reservation and the separation of trade unions. We are therefore quite justified in asking the United Party: What is your attitude as regards the greatest problem facing South Africa, namely the preservation of the white nation and the problem of Bantu and non-white relations in South Africa&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout should therefore not be so quick to say that when we make these allegations we are mistaken. Then we expect them to produce proof that we are mistaken in levelling these allegations against them. In his De Aar speech in 1962 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;as far as I know, it has not been denied&#x2014;said most explicitly, and I quote, that they envisaged &#x201C;a multiracial Parliament in South Africa&#x201D;. He said that they would repeal the Acts I have just named. In respect of the Coloureds he said, for example, &#x201C;Reform will include, <i>inter alia,</i> restoring the Coloureds to the common voters&#x2019; roll in the Cape and Natal, and immediate provision for the representation of natives of all provinces in Parliament by eight representatives in the House of Assembly and six in the Senate.&#x201D; Now we should like to ask them; are they still in favour of restoring the Coloureds to the common voters&#x2019; rolls&#x003F; What is their policy in that respect&#x003F; One asks oneself: Why is the United Party such a poor opposition&#x003F; Surely an opposition has not only one task, namely to criticize negatively. Pre-eminently it is surely the duty of the Opposition to think positively about alternatives. That is where the Opposition fails so badly in South Africa, in that it does not think effectively about positive alternatives, and it cannot think effectively about such alternatives because it is afraid of taking a stand, because it always wants to please both left and right. That is why it always falls between two stools. As long as this Opposition in South Africa fails to appreciate that by merely acting negatively one can make no progress, they will not be able to make any progress in this country. This country deserves an opposition which is stronger and better than this Opposition. Show me a medical doctor who can save a life by being merely negative in respect of it. Show me a minister who can save a soul by being merely negative in respect of it. Show me an advocate who can win a case if he adopts a negative attitude to it. Show me the man who can win a race if he adopts a negative attitude towards it. Show me anybody anywhere in the world, any person who can achieve victory if he continually adopts a merely negative attitude. I think it has become time the United Party realized how miserably it is failing as a result of its negative attitude, also and particularly with regard to our most burning national question, namely the preservation of the white nation in South Africa. But if one asks oneself why that is the attitude adopted by the United Party, the old Dutch poem is always most apposite: &#x201C;In het verleden ligt het heden van nu wat worden zal&#x201D; (The past contained the present, the present contains the future). For if one examines the past of the United Party, one sees very clearly where their present-day attitude originated. The hon. member for Benoni quoted words which showed that at one stage General Smuts was strongly in favour of apartheid. In 1932 he made a most eloquent speech in the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, on &#x201C;The new policy of apartheid&#x201D;, and his speech in the Sheldonian Theatre concluded with these words: Statesmen of the future will be able to derive great benefit from this new policy of apartheid. What happened to make Gen. Smuts change his attitude&#x003F; That is the secret of the United Party&#x2019;s attitude. I shall tell you what happened. In 1932 the Native Affairs Economic Commission was appointed. In respect of the Transkei that commission came to the following conclusion: &#x201C;That unless soon remedied, desert conditions will prevail.&#x201D; That is the secret. After Gen. Smuts had made a penetrating study of those matters, he became more and more convinced, and the United Party of the time became convinced, and in 1939 he stated <span class="col_3837-3838" refersTo="page_0534"/>categorically that one could just as well sweep the ocean with a broom than to think that one could stop the Bantu from leaving the homelands to come to the white cities. What are the implications of that&#x003F; Even in the years 1933 to 1939 the United Party, first through Gen. Smuts and to-day through the Leader of the Opposition, simply put up their hands and surrendered to the numerical superiority of the Bantu from the homelands. That is the secret, and that is why their policy is still a defeatist policy, and that is why they cannot go to the people and assume the garb of patriotism and the preservation of the white nation. It always reminds me of Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf. If the United Party, like that wolf, dons the cloak of patriotism and the preservation of the white nation, the ears of the United Party stick out too far, and the long muzzle of political opportunism sticks out much too far to bluff the people into thinking that they are dealing with the grandmother and not with the wolf. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I should like to ask the United Party a very important question, and I want to express the hope that during this Session they will have the courage of their convictions and will give the nation an unequivocal reply. In terms of the development which has now taken place in Africa and specifically in Basutoland, which has now gained independence, and in Botswana, which has also gained its independence, and in Swaziland, which will shortly gain it, how do they see the ultimate political development of the Bantu in South Africa&#x003F; Do they still advocate the policy that these Bantu homelands can only develop to provincial status, more or less, as the Leader of the Opposition said repeatedly, or what is their policy in this respect&#x003F; How do they see that issue&#x003F; Because the attitude they adopt on the ultimate development of the Bantu homelands will be of cardinal importance to the policy of the United Party. I just want to remind you that on one occasion the Leader of the Opposition expressed himself very strongly on this matter, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I have to choose between eight separate independent states in South Africa or eight representatives in Parliament, even if they are black, I choose Parliamentary representatives every time.</block>

<p>If that is their attitude, I want to ask them, in the further light of the development which has taken place in Africa, whether they are blind. Can they also reply to this other question: If they still adhere to their policy of race federation or geographical federation, in terms of which eight Bantu representatives will be elected to Parliament, what is their attitude, against the background of the fact that 12 to 15 years ago 6 million Natives in Kenya had only 14 representatives, as against 70,000 Whites who had 46 white representatives, and I ask what has become of those white representatives&#x003F; I may also mention Tanganyika, where 9 million natives had only ten representatives as against 20,000 Whites, who also had ten. What happened there&#x003F; Thus I may continue giving various examples. How can they approach both White and Bantu in South Africa with this policy and hope to sell it&#x003F; Can they not see that&#x003F; Therefore I conclude by saying that I would rather round Cape Horn ten times with Sir Francis Chichester in his Gypsy Moth IV than to join them once on the United Party benches, because it must be unbearable.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The speech made by the hon. member for Primrose is a tremendous disappointment to one on this side of the House who knows the hon. member well. The hon. member for Primrose is supposed to be one of the intellectuals on that side of the House. Firstly, we heard that hon. member give some quotations from a little yellow book which the Nationalist Party uses to train its young candidates in politics. The hon. member quoted from that book what certain unnamed United Party people had supposedly said about his deceased leader. But let me tell the hon. member that it is the easiest thing in the world to get quotations, without proof, of what people have to say about one&#x2019;s leader. If I were to say in this House what Nationalists, supporters of that side of the House, have said outside the House &#x2014;not hon. members on that side, but supporters of that Party&#x2014;about deceased leaders on this side of the House, it would be unprintable. But the hon. member uses that to illustrate to us what the United Party people said about his leaders. [Interjections.] The hon. member also asked me to reply in respect of the Rudman case, but I think the Rudman case is of so little importance to this Parliament that I do not want to devote any of my time to its discussion. I think enough time has been spent on that by the public Press.</p>

<p>But I was also surprised by the tactics of hon. members on the opposite side. I was surprised that the hon. member for Primrose Budget. In his constituency the hon. member has thousands of workers, people who are involved in the economic life of South Africa, but he did not even have anything to say which could be relevant to those people. His speech was typical of all speeches we have said absolutely nothing in respect of this had from that side of the House. There were very few of them who tried to defend this Budget and the few members who did try to defend the Budget merely said that the workers of South Africa were satisfied with it. But what is the real position of the workers of South Africa&#x003F; What do they think about the rising cost of living under this Government&#x003F; I quote what trade union leaders say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cost of living heading for disaster.</block>

<p>This appeared in a Sunday paper on 5th Febuary this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3839-3840" refersTo="page_0535"/>Trade union leaders last week expressed their concern about the rising cost of living and warned the Government that unless urgent steps were taken, an industrial crisis was imminent.</block>

<p>This type of thing was said by the secretary of the S.A. Trade Union Council, Mr. J. A. Grobbelaar; this type of thing was said by the chairman of the National Liaison Committee of Engineering Trade Unions, Mr. McLelland; this type of thing was said by the secretary of the S.A. Iron and Steel Trade Union, Mr. J. L. van den Berg. Mr. J. A. Liebenberg, chairman of the S.A. Trade Union Staff Association expressed his concern about the position; and yet the hon. member for Mayfair came along and told us that the workers of South Africa were satisfied with what this Government was doing. A correspondent of one of the newspapers which support the Nationalist Party, <i>Die Beeld,</i> made an inquiry into cost of living four months ago, and what does he say in this report&#x003F; He says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cost of living rocketing: Now one really catches it.</block>

<p>This is what this correspondent says&#x2014;</p>

<p>Until I saw for myself this week, I little realized how bad the rise in the cost of living really was.</p>

<p>This is the type of thing said by the people of South Africa, and yet the hon. member for Mayfair claims that the workers of South Africa are contented. Here before me I have <i>Die Sondagstem</i> of 22nd January, 1967, and I quote the heading (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cannot make ends meet on their salaries &#x2014;wolf at officials&#x2019; door. Anxious eyes turned to the Government. State employees face alarming financial problems and the general feeling that the Government should take urgent steps to bring relief, has taken root among officials.</block>

<p>And yet the hon. member for Mayfair and other hon. members on that side come along and say that the people of South Africa and the workers are satisfied with the situation. Apparently hon. members on that side of the House are totally unaware of the effects and the pressure of inflation, and for that reason I cannot refrain from quoting these reports. The Government tells us that unfortunately they cannot curtail State expenditure in this Budget and that we on this side of the House should tell them where they are to economize. The hon. member for Orange Grove and other hon. members on this side mentioned steps that may be taken with a view to saving, and the hon. member for Pinetown did the same. The hon. the Minister of Finance says that he cannot cut expenses, yet he asks the people of South Africa to work and to save.</p>

<p>If the people of South Africa are to save, then I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance and hon. members on that side to tell us where John Citizen is wasting money and how he can economize. The Government tells the people of South Africa: You must save. In other words, if the people are not saving at this stage, the inference is clearly that they are wasting money, and then the hon. the Minister of Finance and other hon. members on that side should tell us where John Citizen is wasting money and on which items he can save money. Can John Citizen economize as regards the education of his child&#x003F; Can he economize on the rent he has to pay his landlord; can he economize on the rent he has to pay for his flat&#x003F; We know that the rates of interest of building societies and the flat rentals were recently increased once again. In his reply to the debate the hon. the Minister of Finance should tell us where John Citizen is to economize as far as his essential commodities are concerned. John Citizen is trying to make ends meet on a personal budget which he has already had to curtail. Instead of a 5 per cent loan levy, the hon. the Minister of Finance now expects taxpayers paying R100 or more in income tax to the Central Government to pay a loan levy of 15 per cent. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has ever asked himself who those people are who pay R100 or more a year in income tax. Has the hon. the Minister ever considered that those are people who earn slightly more than &#x00A3;80 or R160 a month if they are married and have no children&#x003F; Has the Minister ever considered that those are people who earn slightly more than R2.000 a year if they are married and have one child&#x003F; Does the hon. the Minister think that these are highly-paid people&#x003F; The man who earns R2.000 per year, who is married with one child, earns only slightly more than R160 a month. If the taxpayer is married and has no children, then according to the Minister he needs an income of only R1,800 a year. Are these among the highly-paid people in South Africa&#x003F; Sir, these people are not among the highly-paid people in this country; they earn less than the person in the middle income group in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then, too. I cannot refrain from referring briefly to the duty to be levied by the hon. the Minister on motor cars. This has now become fashionable, because I notice that the excise duty levied on motor cars has increased considerably in the past few years. This method is used every now and then to tax the motor-car industry in the country even further. Essentially it means the taxation of an important industry which is situated mainly in the area I represent in this House. Although we know that motor-car sales have increased considerably in recent years, I do want to ask the hon. the Minister to be careful not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. I should like to compare the motor-car industry with the wine farmers of South Africa. We cannot expect the wine farmer of South Africa to pay <span class="col_3841-3842" refersTo="page_0536"/>higher and higher taxes on his product although he himself does not sell that product. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the motor-car industry is in exactly the same position. The higher the duty on motor cars, the greater the effect on the industry itself and on a place such as Port Elizabeth. I want to caution that in this process of imposing increasingly higher taxes, the Government should not be indifferent to the motor-car industry of the country.</p>

<p>In his Budget speech the hon. the Minister of Finance also said that the people of South Africa should not only save more, but should work harder. If we are so dissatisfied with the people of South Africa, who are these people who are not working hard enough&#x003F; Are they the public servants; are they the teachers of South Africa; are they the artisans; are they the engineers; are they the industrial workers; are they the police; are they the Defence Force&#x003F; If we are dissatisfied with what is taking place, we should say who are the people in South Africa who are not working hard enough.</p>

<p>If we consider the industrial development and our achievements in recent times, then we as well as hon. members on the opposite side are particularly proud of the economic achievements of our country. Where is the laziness of which they speak&#x003F; Would they suggest that the people of South Africa are not working hard enough&#x003F; I know the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police once said that we spent too much time drinking tea. He said we wasted too much time drinking tea&#x2014;the tea-break should actually be eliminated. I do not think that was the only solution offered by that side. The hon. the Minister should tell us that they are dissatisfied with the achievements of this country, that they are dissatisfied with the achievements of the artisans, of our managers, of our engineers, of our industrialists, because according to them South Africa should work harder and should save more to meet inflation.</p>

<p>Why did hon. members on the opposite side say so very little about this Budget and do so much to exploit colour prejudee in South Africa once again&#x003F; Why did they do that&#x003F; Why did they come to the fore once again with the old scare-mongering tactics we have seen so many times in the past&#x003F; As I listened to many of the speeches made by hon. members on that side of the House, I was reminded of a time in 1948 when a real old 1948 &#x201C;political happening&#x201D; with the same kind of tactics took place. The reason for their tactics is obvious. The Nationalist Party cannot defend this Budget to the electorate of South Africa, and the people of South Africa, and in particular the electorate, are no longer interested in the exploitation of colour prejudice. The people are now interested in its bread-and-butter politics and therefore these tactics on the part of hon. members on the opposite side will not succeed. In the Worcester and Johannesburg (West) constituencies the people of South Africa are now thinking about matters which affect their every-day lives, and that is why that side is now trying to exploit colour prejudice once again in the House of Assembly. Why will hon. members not succeed with those tactics&#x003F; Because in the past few years, and particularly under the new Prime Minister, the Nationalist Party had to render account for so many things to its own people. It tries to change the image of the Nationalist Party and tells the people: &#x201C;Look, we have to go to the outside; there is a possibility that the Maoris may come and South Africa will also include non-Whites in its overseas teams.&#x201D; They even sit down at dinners together. Hon. members on the opposite side know how this hon. Prime Minister is criticized by his own people.</p>

<p>Mr.Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>With the Bill we have before us at present, we have come a long way on a long road requiring much patience. It may perhaps be a good thing if I reminded this hon. House of the history of this legislation. This Bill was born out of a deep concern amongst our people, amongst all mothers, amongst all families, at the rise in medical costs, which are still increasing all the time. At present we have reached a stage where every family lives in dread lest any of its members should become ill&#x2014;it dreads having illness in its midst. Every family knows that illness may prove to be a severe setback to it, may even ruin it. It knows that if it were to suffer a major illness, it might never overcome that setback in all its existence. It is a fact that all over South Africa our people are to-day making more and more use of medical services, and that we should try to do something positive about bringing the cost of medical treatment, the cost of being <span class="col_3843-3844" refersTo="page_0537"/>cured of illness, within their reach. That was in fact the reason why we appointed a commission of inquiry in 1959&#x2014;under the distinguished chairmanship of Prof. Snyman&#x2014;to inquire into the reasons for the high cost of medical treatment. Along with that commission a committee was appointed which was subsequently joined to it. This committee of inquiry was under the chairmanship of Dr. Reinach, who was specially instructed to investigate the operation of medical schemes. The findings made as a result of these two inquiries led to the report of 1962, an excellent report, which has virtually become a standard work on medical services in South Africa. They investigated this problem and tried to indicate to us the course we had to follow in order to combat this problem of high medical costs for every family.</p>

<p>The cost of medical treatment is increasing steadily, mainly because of two factors. The first factor is the improved medical services all of us are getting at present, and the second is the improved medicines which are available to everybody at present. These are the two main, overriding factors. In the first place, medical services are becoming more expensive mainly because we have discovered that, when some complaint cannot be overcome quickly, it is usually worth taking the trouble to consult a specialist. Owing to the better or more extensive use of specialists, medical expenses are soaring at present. When any person continues to show a certain symptom, the first step taken by his general practitioner is to refer him to a specialist. It is quite possible that this specialist will, in turn, refer the patient to another specialist, such as urologist, a gynaecologist or an orthopaedic surgeon. These specialists, in turn, eventually call in the services of an anaesthetist and a radiologist to help them. So this process continues. It is an excellent process, an essential process, a process which takes into account the knowledge and the scientific advances of modern man. But it is a process which makes matters increasingly expensive and increasingly impossible for the ordinary person who falls ill, because the bills now received by him no longer amount to a few rands only, but may run into hundreds or even thousands of rands.</p>

<p>The second factor in connection with these rising medical costs is the problem of more expensive medicines, which are excellent medicines if used correctly, but which are mainly the product of years of research and of the work of teams of scientists and experts, at enormous costs. If these remedies are used correctly, they are a boon to mankind to-day, because they shorten the duration of illnesses. Where such illnesses might previously have lasted for months, these modern remedies often shorten them to days. They cure diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and the disease to which so many men succumbed previously, namely the common pneumonia, which claimed so many victims in the past. These things prove to us that the solution to this problem of increasing medical costs is not to be found in another form of the use of medical practitioners nor in cheaper medicines. but that we should seek the solution along different lines. Another solution was found in England, amongst other countries, in the form of their National Health Service. That is a system whereby every person in England is entitled to free medical and hospital services, but it is an alarmingly expensive system. It is a system which already cost the English taxpayer more than R2.000 million last year. It is a system which has been followed partly in several Western countries. It is a system which we in South Africa cannot possibly follow. It is simply impossible for us to follow that system in a country where a small population of 3&#x00BD; million has to bear the burden of a large population of 18 million. One cannot introduce that scheme in South Africa. For South Africa a different solution is essential. The Snyman Commission&#x2019;s view is that we in South Africa have already found that solution and that all we need to do here is to elaborate further on that solution so as to make it a more systematic, a better and more comprehensive one.</p>

<p>In the first place, here in South Africa we have a system whereby the lower-income group of the white population and virtually the entire non-white population have already been afforded adequate cover through an extensive system of free hospitalization and a system of free medical services rendered by district surgeons. But the large majority of our population, the large majority of the population representing the average man&#x2014;not the rich man, but The average man, who struggles and only just manages to make ends meet&#x2014;are hard hit by medical costs to-day, which, as I have said, are simply rising all the time. Necessity has gradually forced these people to try and find their own solution. This was found in the form of sick funds or insurance schemes or medical aid schemes. The basis on which such schemes operate is that, when one takes a large group of people, one finds that all the members of that group will never fall ill simultaneously, but usually only a small percentage of that group. A second principle underlying such schemes is the fact that every person is in good health for the greater part of his life and is ill during a small part of his life only. A further principle is that when one is young, one is usually in good health. It is as one grows older that one falls ill more frequently. These are the principles underlying these medical schemes which are operating in South Africa. They are in actual fact forms of insurance schemes.</p>

<p>The first medical scheme to be introduced in South Africa was established by the employees of the De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1889. Up to 1938 there was no appreciable increase in the number of such schemes. Even in 1938. just before the last World War, there were only 38 such schemes in operation here. Since the Second World War there has been a tremendous increase in the number of these schemes. In 1960 there were as many as 14 <span class="col_3845-3846" refersTo="page_0538"/>million white persons who were covered by these schemes. Over the last six years, from 1960 to 1966, this number increased by more than 600,000; in other words, at an average rate of 100,000 a year, so that the number of persons covered by such schemes to-day, amounts to 1.87 million out of a white population of approximately 3&#x00BD; million. At present there are 256 of these schemes. To a large extent this tremendous increase can be attributed to the course which was indicated to us by the Snyman Commission. The Snyman Commission not only recommended to us the principles which we find embraced in this Bill to-day, but also pointed out to us that it would be desirable to appoint a council which, under expert guidance and with expert advice, would help that section of the White population which has not yet been organized, to establish new schemes, and which would at the same time iron out shortcomings and eliminate difficulties in existing schemes. It was on the advice of the Snyman Commission that such a body, namely the Central Council for Medical schemes, was established as far back as 1st October, 1962. That Central Council has done excellent work and is largely responsible for the fact that new members have been joining medical schemes at an average rate of 100,000 a year.</p>

<p>The Bill, as we see it before us to-day, has a long history. We went out of our way to incorporate all reasonable requests and suggestions in this Bill, but you will admit that it is never&#x00B7; possible to accede to all requests and to all demands, because if one were to accede to them, one would eventually reach a stage where one would accomplish nothing. The Snyman Report was made available to us at the beginning of 1962. In the same year&#x2014;in October, 1962&#x2014;the Central Council for Medical Schemes was established: this Council had to assist in the establishment of further schemes and in drawing more members into those schemes. Soon after that, in February, 1963, the first draft Bill was framed and submitted to interested parties, including the Medical Council and the Medical Association. That was followed by difficult negotiations which extended over a period of two years, negotiations conducted with the Medical Association in particular, for the purpose of obtaining the co-operation of all parties. The Medical Association made two absolutely firm demands: firstly, that the first tariff of fees to be drafted was to be drafted, unilaterally drafted by the Medical Association: and secondly, that medical benefit funds were not to be included in this Bill. The Medical Association laid down these two conditions for its co-operation. But the medical benefit funds, on the other hand, came forward with a contrary demand, namely that medical benefit schemes were to be included in this Bill. As a matter of fact, they even went so far as to threaten that if those schemes were not included in the legislation, we might perhaps have to face a strike of all mineworkers and perhaps of all steel-workers as well. Mr.Speaker, you will understand that the State cannot have that position. For the purpose of obtaining the co-operation of all interested parties and of accommodating all sides as far as possible and as far as is reasonable, while not defeating the object of the Bill, this Bill was referred to a Select Committee after the First Reading. The Select Committee arrived at a finding which was unanimous except on one point. There was only one point of difference, and that was that when negotiations had to be conducted on behalf of medical practitioners in regard to the medical services they had to render and the tariffs for such services, those negotiations had to be conducted on their behalf by the Medical Association and not by groups of medical practitioners. But for a few exceptions, the Bill before this House to-day, corresponds with the Bill submitted by the Select Committee in all other respects. In the main this Bill differs from the Bill which was submitted by the Select Committee in respect of three aspects only. In the first place, the Select Committee recommended that a schedule should be added at the end of this Bill, a schedule setting out the fees which medical practitioners may charge for the various services. However, the legal advisers said that if we did that, it would present us with an endless number of practical difficulties and that it would therefore be better if it were promulgated in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> In accordance with this recommendation the schedule with the doctors&#x2019; fees does not appear in this Bill, but will be promulgated at a later stage. Secondly, there is the position of the registrar. The Commission recommended that the registrar should be a semi-independent person&#x2014;that is to say, semi-independent of the Department. However, owing to financial and administrative difficulties it was decided that the position of the registrar would be that of any high-ranking public servant. He will therefore be a high-ranking public servant. The third point of difference between the Bill submitted by the Select Committee and the Bill under discussion, is that in the present Bill we are to a large extent acceding to the request made by one of the members of the Select Committee, Dr. Jurgens, namely that when there are negotiations about the determination of fees for the various services, they will not be determined by various groups of medical practitioners with whom negotiations will take place, but in negotiation with the leading body, the body which represents all medical practitioners in South Africa. The object is that fees should be the same throughout South Africa. Apart from these three points of difference, this Bill corresponds almost exactly with the Bill the Select Committee submitted to us. For the benefit of hon. members, I may perhaps give a brief summary of the most important provisions of this Bill. The first is the provision in connection with the establishment of a council, called the Central Council for Medical Schemes, whose task it will be to promote medical schemes and to assist all existing medical schemes in ironing out their problems, and <span class="col_3847-3848" refersTo="page_0539"/>to ensure that these schemes provide reasonable services to their members and to the dependants of members. All medical schemes will have to register with this council. In the second place, provision is being made for any dispute over fees to be referred to arbitration. This arbitration will be handled by an arbitrator who will be nominated by the medical practitioners, an arbitrator who will be nominated by the medical schemes and, thirdly, an umpire who will be nominated jointly by the medical practitioners and the medical schemes. The decision of those arbitrators will be final. In the event of a dispute arising about a bill sent out by a medical practitioner, the matter is to be referred to a committee which will be nominated by the Central Council for Medical Schemes. This committee will consist of four members, two of whom will be selected by the Central Council from a panel of ten medical practitioners nominated by the Medical Association.</p>

<p>The next important point in this Bill is that when one deals with medical benefit schemes, that is, schemes where the remuneration of the medical practitioner consists of either a salary or an amount he receives for every patient he treats, and a dispute arises about the salary or the fees, such a dispute is also referred to arbitration. Then each party also nominates an arbitrator and the two parties together nominate an umpire, and then the decision of those arbitrators is final.</p>

<p>The fifth important point in this Bill is that medical practitioners are prohibited from organizing strikes and boycotts, because the principle which has always been upheld by eminent medical practitioners throughout the country, is that the medical profession is above strikes and boycotts. But we know that in the ranks of any body there are always elements that try to lower the tone and the high standard of that profession. It is to prevent that that this provision has been introduced into this Bill. No strikes or boycotts may be organized by medical practitioners, because the principle of the medical profession, like that of all other professions, is that when a dispute arises, an attempt is made to settle that dispute in a national way, either through discussion or through settlements or eventually through arbitration.</p>

<p>In the main these are the provisions of this Bill. This Bill was drafted very carefully and very thoroughly. It is a Bill which is to everybody&#x2019;s advantage. It is to the advantage of medical practitioners, of medical schemes, of patients and of the entire nation. I am convinced that it will contribute a great deal to keeping medical costs within the financial reach of every family. At the same time I am convinced that this Bill will contribute to upholding and enhancing the standing and the honour of one of the finest professions in the country, the medical profession. I also want to avail myself of this opportunity to express my thanks in the first place, to every member of this Select Committee for all the sacrifices they made and for the scrupulousness with which they examined and considered every provision in this Bill. I want to thank them for the fine results of their work, <b>I</b> also want to thank each of the competent officials who were responsible for submitting to us this Bill in its present form. Thirdly, I also want to thank Professor Snyman and every member of his Commission, particularly also Dr. Reinach, who gave us such a careful analysis of the problems of the high costs of medicine and who showed us that there was in fact a solution which we ourselves could find to this problem of high costs, which can sometimes be so destructive to families. I am convinced that this Bill, once it has been placed in the Statute Book, will give the Commission the satisfaction that everything they recommended in the sphere of medical science, will have been carried out.</p>

<p>This Bill naturally is most interesting to the whole population of the country, and is one which can seriously affect the health of the whole population.

<heading>AGED PERSONS PROTECTION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to move the Second Reading of the Aged Persons Protection Bill.</p>

<p>In view of the special position of the aging section of the population and in order to plan effectively for the promotion of their interests on a national basis, my predecessor appointed a work group in 1964 to inquire into the interests of the aged. Amongst other things this work group recommended that there should be compulsory registration and inspection of all homes for the aged and that statutory provision should be made for the protection of the aged against neglect and exploitation. In consequence of this inquiry an Aged Persons&#x2019; Protection Bill was drafted which also incorporated the Old Aged Pensions Act of 1962.</p>

<p>Some amendments were made after all welfare organizations that apply themselves to the care of the aged, all universities and all interested concerns had been offered an opportunity to comment. I may mention that all these persons and concerns were allowed adequate time to study the report before submitting their comments. The proposed Bill has <span class="col_3849-3850" refersTo="page_0540"/>in fact been welcomed in all quarters and enjoys the support of all persons and concerns engaged in welfare work among the aged. The National Welfare Council also supports all aspects of the Bill as it is now submitted to you.</p>

<p>Broadly the Bill envisages the following: Firstly, the registration and inspection of homes for the aged which accommodate and care for aged persons; secondly, the protection of aged persons against exploitation and neglect; thirdly, empowering the Minister to establish and maintain homes for the aged; fourthly, subsidizing registered welfare organizations in respect of institutions and social services for aged persons; and fifthly, repealing the Old Age Pensions Act, 1962, and substituting it by certain provisions which will empower the Minister to pay old age pensions to certain aged persons, and the promulgation of regulations prescribing the scales in accordance with which old age pensions are calculated.</p>

<p>It is a long-felt need that statutory provision should be made in one comprehensive Aged Persons Protection Act which will replace the Old Age Pensions Act and place the present administrative schemes on a statutory basis. Such an Act would then present a complete Survey of the national planning of the Department in respect of the social protection of the aged.</p>

<p>In the first place it should be emphasized that old age is a relative concept and that there is at present a tendency to treat persons of an advanced age as productive units in the economic life of the community as long as possible, if they are capable of this. From a social and economic point of view this tendency is basically sound. In the flourishing economic position there is in fact a large percentage of workers in industry, commerce and in the public service who come under this category. Then there is also the group of aged persons who are physically and mentally fit and who can maintain their independence by means of pensions they have earned, insurance policies or earnings from their savings.</p>

<p>These two groups of aged persons are independent of state support and with the assistance of ordinary social provision, which is available to all citizens of the country, they are normally able, with a few exceptions, to cope on their own with the social problems they experience. It is the objective that the large majority of the aged persons belong in the community and should stay there. It should be made possible for them to retain their homes in the community. A well-organized community is actually compelled to meet the needs of all its members and consequently to make equitable provision for all age-groups. The aged person needs financial security, housing, medical and hospital services, as well as happiness and an opportunity to share in the life of the community. His psychological needs are just as important as his material requirements.</p>

<p>A recent survey by the National Bureau for Educational and Social Research on the living conditions of aged persons reveals that 25 per cent of the white aged persons live with their children or relations, 2 per cent with strangers and approximately 68 per cent on their own in flats, rooms and boarding houses. Only approximately 5 per cent are cared for in homes for the aged.</p>

<p>As regards the care of the aged, the functions of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions comprise, <i>inter alia,</i> the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1962, the War Veterans Pensions Act, 1962, State homes for the Aged, and subsidizing welfare organizations in respect of their field work and institution maintenance services.</p>

<p>There are many aged people, particularly those living in isolation in flats or in rented rooms, who cannot play their full part in the life of the community. They need assistance, although full care in a home for the aged has not yet become either necessary or desirable. In such cases social welfare services may contribute to their sound adjustment and happiness and ensure that they continue living in the community and need not be removed.</p>

<p>One of the major problems experienced by aged persons is loneliness. This loneliness is frequently the result of restrictive physical and mental powers, with a consequential lack of communication with members of the community. Frequently, however, it is also the result of the tendency of a large group of aged persons to withdraw themselves socially because they feel that the community no longer needs them, that they have become obsolete and that they have no further function in society. These and other social needs may be met by means of home visits, home assistance services, club activities and service centre facilities.</p>

<p>What about television&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Television may also contribute, but if they were to see the hon. member on television it might perhaps contribute to making them even more lonely.</p>

<p>Church concerns and welfare organizations are already doing a great deal along these lines. This is an important service, and in order to encourage it is provided that the State may pay subsidies to welfare organizations with regard to these services.</p>

<p>A further category of aged persons is those who are mentally and physically able to take care of themselves, but who are in financial need. They need only financial assistance. Another most important aspect is the provision which is made for the protection of the group of aged persons who as a result of their physical or mental debilitation, or both, are no longer able to take full care of their own interests. The evidence that has been collected indicates that cases of neglect of debilitated aged persons occur fairly generally in the community. It is difficult, however, to determine <span class="col_3851-3852" refersTo="page_0541"/>the true magnitude of this problem. The work group found, however, that this is particularly an urban phenomenon. Under certain circumstances these aged persons may deteriorate physically, become underfed, live under unhygienic circumstances and are frequently also exploited financially. This is frequently also accompanied by the loss of a sense of values.</p>

<p>Social welfare officers and social workers of private welfare organizations have to cope with this problem constantly, and at certain late stages it is difficult to persuade aged persons to move to institutions or other suitable places where they may receive better care. These officers and workers, however, have no statutory claim to admission to the premises where such an aged person finds himself. They could render these services only with the consent and co-operation of the owner of the premises, who is frequently the subject of the complaints.</p>

<p>In its report the work group states that a large representative group of welfare organizations and other interested concerns are in favour of legislation in terms of which certain debilitated aged persons may be placed under statutory control, in their own interests, and also compulsorily in a home for the aged or in other protected custody.</p>

<p>Careful consideration was given to this aspect. It was found that such measures would be too drastic and are also contrary to human dignity and the right of self-determination. The solution to the social problems of the debilitated aged person should rather be sought in persuasion and in the methods of social work practice. In many cases unscrupulous persons are responsible for the state of neglect in which an aged person finds himself. This occurs mainly when a person is compensated for his services to the aged person and then economises as much as possible on the keep of the aged person, for his own profit. It is a matter of serious concern to the Government to take the strictest action against such persons.</p>

<p>Frequently, however, there are also cases of persons who neglect aged persons without it being their intention to gain any financial advantage. For example, there are cases where a person or persons lack interest in the aged persons to such an extent that they are insensitive to the elementary needs of the aged persons and consequently neglect them. These persons, too, should not be allowed to accommodate and care for an aged person. Provision is made in this Bill to curb these practices.</p>

<p>In particular I also want to draw the attention to the provision made for subsidizing homes for the aged, for the establishment and maintenance of homes for the aged by the State, and for compulsory registration of all homes where aged persons are accommodated and cared for. This measure is essential, as will appear from the following: The number of white aged persons living in subsidized homes for the aged at the moment represents 4.8 per cent of the total number of white old-age and war-veteran pensioners and 2.07 percent of the total number of white men of 65 years and older and white women of 60 years and older in the Republic.</p>

<p>Apart from the aged persons in subsidized homes for the aged there are also aged persons in other homes for the aged which are not subsidized by the State. These are the private or economic institutions. There is no reliable data on the number of aged persons cared for in the last-mentioned institutions. The National Bureau for Educational and Social Research came to the conclusion, however, that 5.4 per cent of all white aged persons in the Republic are in homes for the aged. In Western Europe approximately 5 per cent of all aged persons are in homes for the aged, while the percentage in the U.S.A. is considerably lower.</p>

<p>In the Republic there is as yet no system of uniform control over all homes for the aged. Many of the existing homes for the aged are under the control of organizations registered in terms of the National Welfare Act, 1965. The Department also has only a certain degree of financial control over and the right of inspection of subsidized homes for the aged. Most of the aged persons are probably in these subsidized homes for the aged.</p>

<p>The Department, however, has no control over the care of the aged in certain boarding houses, nursing institutions and homes for the aged maintained by the owners for their own profit. No demands can be made with regard to the method of caring for aged persons and particularly not in respect of the social aspects of their treatment. The evidence which has been collected indicates that these non-subsidized institutions are not all attuned to caring efficiently for debilitated aged persons, and there is even some exploitation. Aged persons with restricted means are not in a position to pay for good care, nor can a profit-making institution afford to provide care of a reasonable standard for such persons. Then, too, all aged persons in such institutions are not indigent, and there are cases where high boarding charges are paid which are disproportionate to the quality of the services rendered.</p>

<p>It is therefore understandable that welfare organizations and other concerns which have an interest in the care of aged persons urge strongly that all homes for the aged should be registered and inspected on a uniform basis. This attitude is also consistently advocated by welfare organizations in control of existing homes for the aged. It is pleasing to note that these organizations reveal a desire to improve the standards of care of aged persons in homes for the aged. It appears as though there is an increasing awareness in these concerns of many of the physical, social and spiritual needs of aged persons which were previously frequently ignored. Homes for the aged which are run for personal profit will also be compelled to register and will be subjected to the same control.</p>

<p>Another important recommendation by the work group was that the Bill should provide <span class="col_3853-3854" refersTo="page_0542"/>for the incorporation of the existing Pensions Act in this Bill, but that the amount of the pension and also the means test in accordance with which the pension is calculated should take place in the form of regulations, subject to the condition that no amendment to the regulations which may prejudice a pensioner may be effected at any time without the consent of Parliament.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the scales for social pensions have to be amended virtually every year to provide for new concessions and better benefits for pensioners as justified by circumstances and as additional funds become available. That is happening again this year. It results in continual amendments to the Act, which is actually contrary to the ideal of stable legislation based on fixed principles. This amendment will simplify the administration of the Act to a large extent and will bring it into line with similar provisions in the Children&#x2019;s Act, the Public Service Pensions Act, the Pension Fund for Associated Institutions and other civil pensions. It will mean that after concessions have been made, there will be no need to await an amendment of the Act by Parliament, but that the amended benefits may be promulgated by way of a regulation. That regulation will be easily adjusted from time to time as it becomes possible for the Government to grant concessions. The only reservation in this connection is that the amendments shall never be to the disadvantage of the pensioners. Only amendments to their advantage may thus be effected administratively.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Budget proposals&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in accordance with the Budget proposals, of course. It happens from time to time that in consequence of the Budget proposals certain administrative problems are experienced which may easily be set right by way of a regulation, as we do from time to time with regard to the Public Service Pensions Act and as we do under the Pension Fund for Associated Institutions. There are continual amendments to the regulations which facilitate the administration and eliminate bottlenecks. We now seek the same power in this regard.</p>

<p>A special concession which is made in the Bill relates to the period a person has to be resident in the Republic in order to qualify for a pension. In terms of this provision a person will qualify for an old age pension immediately after having obtained South African citizenship. The existing Old Age Pensions Act provides that such a person shall be a South African citizen for at least five years. This concession should encourage immigrants to obtain citizenship sooner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, however, it should be guarded against that such persons will not merely stay in the country for a short while and then, after having obtained South African citizenship, leave the country and expect to continue receiving an old age pension from the State. For that reason it is provided that the Secretary may suspend such a pension if the pensioner concerned has been absent from the Republic for a continuous period exceeding six months or has left the Republic permanently. In deserving cases, however, the Secretary will still be able to authorize the payment of a pension after the period of six months has elapsed, according to circumstances such as the period spent in the Republic by the person concerned and the services rendered by him.</p>

<p>I have tried to outline the broad principles regarding care of the aged in South Africa as incorporated in this Bill. It is unnecessary to deal with each clause separately, because the memorandum made available to hon. members deals with each clause very clearly and in detail. It will also be possible to deal with it in detail during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill has been sent to all interested concerns in the country for their comments. It enjoys the support of all those concerns and was enthusiastically received by them. For that reason it is a privilege to move the second reading of the Bill and I trust that its provisions will meet with the approval of both sides of this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened with interest to the hon. the Minister introducing the second reading of this most important Bill. Obviously with the advancement towards greater industrialization here in South Africa certain social problems and challenges have as a result to be met. We believe that this Bill is a step in the right direction, as it is in the interests of the aged section of our community that they should be afforded a degree of protection.</p>

<p>The Minister has outlined the main principles underlying this Bill. These principles are obviously of great importance to an increasing percentage of our community. We know that with the advancement of medical science life expectancy has increased in recent years, and therefore a greater percentage of our community are directly affected by the legislation which has now been introduced by the Minister. We feel that the Bill is to be welcomed. We know that it has been welcomed by various welfare organizations. Obviously the practical application of this Bill to a very great extent will depend upon the co-operation and assistance from those welfare organizations, which are doing magnificent work as far as the welfare services in this country are concerned.</p>

<p>There are various aspects which we on this side should like to comment upon, but we feel that, due to the importance of this Bill and the lateness of the hour, this would be an appropriate time to move the adjournment of this debate. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the debate be now adjourned.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.Speaker, at the commencement of my reply to the debate, allow me to express my sincere regret at the fact that the hon. member for Constantia has been unable to be with us during this Budget debate. Although the hon. member for Constantia and I differ sharply with each other on many points, his presence in this House is something which we value highly. I just want to say that I hope that he will make a complete recovery and will be back in our midst soon.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to convey my personal thanks to hon. members on both sides of this House who congratulated me on my first Budget speech. I realize, of course, that the delivery of a first budget speech is a special occasion for every Minister of Finance in view of the responsibility one has in that regard and in view of the influence which such a Budget may have on the economy and welfare of a country. I want to convey my sincere thanks to all the kind people who congratulated me. In the second place, I want to convey my sincere thanks to hon. members on both sides of this House who congratulated me on the good reception this Budget has had. Although there are persons who do not agree with the Budget, they are aware of the good reception it has had in wide circles. There are, of course, persons who react in different ways to any Budget; there are some who criticize it and some who welcome it. You will agree with me, Sir, that there has never been any Budget which was so perfect that it could satisfy everyone. Every Budget, however good, will come in for its share of criticism. But I think you will agree with me, Mr. Speaker, that this Budget has had a reception which has exceeded almost all expectations. I believe that even my hon. friends opposite were sorely disillusioned when they saw how this Budget was on the whole accepted in virtually all sectors of our economy. With a good deal of bravado and in an unmistakably fighting mood the hon. member for Pinetown launched his first attacks on 22nd March after the Budget speech had been delivered, and we expected that after the Easter recess we would have to face a heavy onslaught, but I think the hon. member and his colleagues calmed down considerably during the recess, probably because they realized during the recess that the public did not support them. The Budget debate conducted by that side of this House has therefore been correctly described in the words of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> &#x201C;Budget debate more flop than fizz. The Budget debate on Dr. Diederichs&#x2019;s Economist&#x2019;s Budget has been a bore for lack of controversy and it never looked like being anything else&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I thank hon. members for having congratulated me on the reception this Budget has had. In the third place, however, I want to thank everyone who congratulated me on the contents of this Budget, and they are many; they are inside and they are outside this House; they are people of all political convictions; they include newspapers and periodicals, some of which do not support the Government. It was realized at an early stage that it would be very difficult under the circumstances in which we found ourselves to introduce a Budget which would be of such a nature that it would satisfy all groups and meet all demands of the times, but I think that it is generally accepted that this Budget has succeeded to the extent possible under the circumstances. It is not necessary for me to quote what all the various periodicals and newspapers said about the Budget. I want to refer to the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 23rd March, which wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Diederichs&#x2019;s first Budget is tough, sophisticated and (at long last) a stout shield against another round of inflation.</block>

<p>In the second place, I refer hon. members to the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> which wrote as follows about this Budget&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A friend-winning Budget. Diederichs&#x2019;s model is sound.</block>

<p>The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 23rd March wrote in a leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our Minister of Finance is to be congratulated on an intelligent, workmanlike Budget well suited to the country&#x2019;s economic needs at this moment. In his maiden Budget speech yesterday he handled his subject with clarity and assurance and common sense. It was a firm Budget, as it had to be, but one not as severe as had been expected in some quarters and whose tax burdens have been skilfully disposed so as to cause a minimum of pain.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] Those opponents are much more honest than these opponents want to be. The <i>Sunday Times</i> said in its leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By and large Dr. Diederichs has made a successful debut. His Budget is thoughtful and understanding&#x2014;it would be carping to complain that it does not solve every problem. What Dr. Diederichs has shown is a keen perception of the problems themselves. That augurs well for his stewardship in the future.</block>

<p>I am modest enough not to reply to that. I leave it to these people to speak. I have here a great many telegrams, one of which comes from a very well-known financial writer in our <span class="col_3857-3858" refersTo="page_0544"/>newspapers whose name I need not mention and which is typical of all the telegrams I received. It reads, &#x201C;Congratulations on your very sound and workmanlike Budget&#x201D;. [Interjection.] During the past week hon. members opposite themselves paid me the highest tribute that any opposition can pay a government, the fact that they were unable to detract in any way from the basic principles of this Budget in the course of a debate of five days, is proof to me of the Budget&#x2019;s soundness. They naturally tried to criticize various minor points and they often contradicted one another, but they never touched on the essential ideas, the basic principles of the Budget. Of course, the hon. member for Hillbrow, who is not present now, said that this Budget contained no basic principles. The hon. member complained that there were no long-term monetary or fiscal policies. He said we had no fundamental policy, what we needed was a permanent and long-term plan. But the National Party Government has never tried to plan and control our country&#x2019;s economy all along the line. Ours is not a socialistic state which tries to control the course of the economy down to the minutest detail. Hon. members know that we have a five-year economic development plan which indicates general direction. The hon. member also knows that we have been guiding the economy of the country during the government of this Party but that we have left it to private initiative itself to plan its undertakings down to the minutest detail. The hon. members know that under the guidance of the National Party the economy of South Africa has reached unprecedented heights, heights comparable to those in any period in the history of our economy and any comparable country, because we know that we should place our trust in the private entrepreneur.</p>

<p>It seems to me as though the hon. member for Hillbrow wants the State to plan business life down to the minutest detail. According to him we ourselves have to say where money is to be invested and where not. We have to take a hand in the simplification of tasks in industries. We, as the State, must directly interfere in the labour turnover and in the work in the factories. The hon. member wants us to take on our shoulders things which are the responsibility of the employer and of the entrepreneur. Apparently the hon. member has no confidence in the quality and in the ability of our entrepreneurs. He apparently has a very low opinion of them. The hon. member for Hillbrow spoke of our economic strength. He said that our economy was strong but that that could not be otherwise because we had goldmines and mineral riches and cheap labour. To him those are the elements of wealth. He never mentioned the Government, but let us forgive him for that. Nowhere in his speech did he refer to the power of the entrepreneurs in South Africa and did he mention that they would achieve something. We on this side of the House have the highest regard for our entrepreneurs and for what they have already done. Our policy is to give guidance and not to lay down a plan in a socialistic form for regulating the entire economy. The hon. member for Hillbrow said we had three choices. We had the choice either of mass production and mass consumption, as in the United States, or of the welfare state as in Britain, or of the state that strived after prestige projects as in Russia. He said we had to choose one of those three alternatives. But, Sir, those are not the only alternatives, because it is possible for some of those things to go hand in hand. We are not seeking one of those alternatives in our endeavours, but our endeavour in our economy and in the Budget is to reconcile the greatest measure of growth with the highest degree of stability&#x2014;growth and stability; stability with growth.</p>

<p>During the past number of years under the rule of the National Party, we have succeeded in achieving major successes in the growth of our economy. The records which we set up in all spheres prove that, and hon. members also admit that now. We have succeeded in achieving a high degree of stability in our economy. Throughout the entire period of our government we have reconciled the two to a very high degree, better than in many other countries. It was only in recent times that the stability of our economy began to be disrupted by a too rapid growth and that inflation began to make its appearance. That is a recent, and we hope a temporary, phenomenon in our country, something which we also find throughout the world, and the time has now arrived for more emphasis to be placed on stability within the framework of our entire policy of stability and growth and for slowing down the rate of growth so as to ensure steady growth for the future. Therefore we are asking in this Budget for inflation to be curbed even if growth is to suffer temporarily. We must slow down our rate of development; we must slow down the rate of growth. That is the central theme of our Budget.</p>

<p>In this regard there are two misunderstandings which I should like to clear up. The first misunderstanding was again on the part of the hon. member for Hillbrow. He complained that by imposing taxes and levies on companies the Government was taking away their capital and that consequently they were no longer able to grow and expand as rapidly as before. It was at that stage that I made an interjection and told the hon. member that I thought that he had a better understanding of the nature of inflation, because that was precisely what we wanted. That is precisely what is called for at this very moment, that at this stage there should not be so much growth; we must now have a smaller number of undertakings, a more marked slowing-down, more consolidation and greater stabilization, and we must achieve those things for the sake of our long-term policy. If we do not make fewer investments now, if we continue spending and growing, our long-term growth will be adversely affected in the long run. We have to suffer now and we have to pay now in order to reap the advantages and the fruits later. This <span class="col_3859-3860" refersTo="page_0545"/>is the whole nature of our struggle against inflation. Hence our plea for greater savings, not only on the part of the man in the street, but also on the part of companies, and hence our plea that we have to spend and expand less, build up more reserves and consolidate and stabilize to a larger degree. The second misunderstanding was on the part of the hon. member for Kensington. The hon. member for Kensington misunderstood the hon. member for Queenstown. The hon. member for Kensington alleged that the hon. member for Queenstown had said that inflation was a prerequisite for prosperity and progress. But that is not what the hon. member said. There are other people who say that inflation is a prerequisite for prosperity, for economic growth. There are American economists who maintain that, but that is not what we say. What is true, however, and what the hon. member for Queenstown said, is that here in South Africa at this stage, inflation is the result, not the cause, of a too rapid growth. We all know that.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the price we are now paying for a too rapid growth. That is the result. Because we have grown too rapidly, and every economist will tell you that, for our available sources of labour and capital, etc., we are now experiencing inflation and that is the price we have to pay for a too rapid growth. If hon. members accuse the Government of being the cause of inflation they must also accuse the Government of being the cause of prosperity in the country. If they accuse us of being the cause of the prosperity in this country, we can only say that that has come about because the public, locally as well as abroad, has this tremendous confidence in South Africa under this Government. The hon. member for Parktown once more used the words &#x201C;too little and too late&#x201D;. This empty cry, which is dramatic in its effect but quite meaningless, was the highlight of his speech. In that he closely followed what his Leader and others had previously said in this debate, but when I asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition what he really meant by that and what the implications of his remarks were, he was not able to give a reply.</p>

<p>That was during a previous debate. I now come to the hon. member for Parktown and ask him what he meant by the words &#x201C;too little and too late&#x201D;. In the first place he accused the Government of having done too little in combating inflation. What does he mean by &#x201C;too little&#x201D;. Does the hon. member want, in the first place, that we should have done more in the form of taxes and loan levies on companies&#x003F; Should we have hit companies harder and should we have imposed higher taxes and higher loan levies on them, because then we would have been doing more&#x003F; Is that what the hon. member wants&#x003F; What would the hon. member for Hillbrow have said had we imposed even higher taxes and even more loan levies on companies&#x003F; There are members, however, who maintain that we are already taxing companies too much. If the hon. member for Parktown agrees then I put my second question to him. Should I have imposed higher taxes and loan levies on individuals&#x003F; What would the champions, the so-called champions on that side of this House for the man in the street, have said in that case&#x003F; In the third place, should I have increased indirect taxation by which the man in the street would really have been hit harder&#x003F; I want to place it on record here and now that that hon. member, who is one of the important speakers on that side of this House, clearly stated here that the Government was doing too little. I now ask him whether we should have imposed heavier taxes, loan levies, company taxes, individual taxes and indirect taxes&#x003F; [Interjections.] That has nothing to do with this matter. Not only did the hon. member say &#x201C;too little&#x201D; but he also said &#x201C;too late&#x201D;. We should have acted earlier. But what did the hon. member himself say in 1964; in 1964 when inflation in this country was nearly three years old&#x003F; As we all know taxation is one of the means of combating inflation. That hon. member said at that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister not only could but should have given back to the taxpayers a portion of the money which he unnecessarily took away from them last year.</block>

<p>That was at the time in which, as they allege, action should already have been taken and when the previous Minister of Finance had already begun imposing heavier taxes. At that time that hon. member pleaded for tax relief and for concessions in that sphere. Mr. Speaker, I think it must be clear to you that they all complain about inflation, but that the hon. members have not suggested anything for combating inflation, but have done exactly the opposite. To have acted sooner and to do the right thing, one must have a correct diagnosis of the position. One must know what a disease is and that there is a disease before one can prescribe something. If one wants to know whether a party has made the correct diagnosis, one must look at the leader of that party to see whether he knew what was going on. What did the leader of that party tell us just over two years ago when inflation was in its fourth year&#x003F;</p>

Mr. Speaker, where can one find a greater accusation than that against a party from the mouth of its leader who maintains that we should have acted much earlier but who said 2&#x00BD;years ago that there was no boom, that there was no prosperity in South Africa and that the boom which had existed was &#x201C;short-lived&#x201D;. In other words, the boom ceased to exist, long ago. Hon. members opposite never wanted to admit that there was prosperity in the country and that we were progressing.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that right now. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and hon. members opposite often accused me, though I did not regard that as an accusation but as a commendation, of having said at a certain stage of our economic development that we should make greater use of our buying power. I did so in a Press interview in Durban and I said that we should increase our consumption. To that I added that I did not desire a spending spree but that everyone was to buy what he could afford, because the country&#x2019;s consumption had not grown as it ought to have done. There was at least one hon. member on that side of this House who saw matters as I did. He is a person who played an important role in the economic debates, namely the hon. member for Jeppes. In January, 1961, he said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why, despite this comparatively high rate of investment in the past, have we had such a comparatively low rate of economic growth&#x003F; &#x2026; Sir, there are many reasons and I do not intend to go into all of them. I would like to mention what I regard as some of the main reasons and what policy should be followed to counter them. In the first place there is no doubt at all that consumption has not expanded rapidly enough.</block>

<p>Is that not very clear&#x003F; The hon. member for Jeppes, who was an important speaker of that side, said in this House in January, 1961, &#x201C;Consumption has not expanded rapidly enough&#x201D;. On 23rd March, 1961, the same hon. member said that there were two things which the Minister should have done. In the first place he should have stimulated consumption. In the second place he should have stimulated investment. He said, &#x201C;Of course there is no point in stimulating investment if you have not got consumption first&#x201D;. Therefore, from the point of view of stimulating consumption, the hon. member said on 21st June, 1962, in regard to our prices which had increased to such an extent, &#x201C;This points to a static condition as far as consumption itself is concerned&#x201D;. It should be very clear to hon. members that one of the most important former members used three different occasions in this House for saying that consumption must be stimulated. But when I said that in 1962, it was a great sin.</p>

<p>As regards inflation, if one has diagnosed a disease one must know what to do to cure that disease. One of the remedies which is always suggested for trying to arrest inflation is that one should relax import control if one has the foreign exchange to do so. I notice that the hon. member for Yeoville is lowering his head. He will lower it even more when I have finished. What does the hon. member for Yeoville say about that&#x003F; Is it true that one has to relax import control if one has the foreign exchange to do so and there is a period of inflation&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, with certain people one cannot argue. Hon. members opposite consistently adopted the attitude that this Budget was not disinflationary. Some said that this was a &#x201C;mild budget&#x201D;. Some said that this was a &#x201C;neutral budget&#x201D;. At the risk of being boring I just want to mention a few points to hon. members&#x2014;because they are such important points&#x2014;in respect of which this Budget really is disinflationary. In the first place the surplus of the previous year, both on Loan Account and on Revenue Account, is not being transferred to the next year. I see that some writers <span class="col_3863-3864" refersTo="page_0547"/>say that this is the first time that this has happened. I do not know, but if a Minister of Finance does not transfer the surplus of the previous year on his two accounts to the next year&#x2014;an amount of more than R60 million&#x2014; and thereby in fact withdraws R60 million from circulation, is that not disinflationary&#x003F; In the second place net taxation is being increased by R57.5 million and loan levies by R45.8 million. That is a net increase of R103.3 million. Is that not disinflationary&#x003F; In the third place this Budget shows a total surplus of R7 million. In the fourth place this Budget is not being financed by means of bank loans but is being financed in a non-inflationary way. I may just add that a large portion of State expenditure will take place abroad whereby even more money will be withdrawn from circulation. In the fifth place there is no additional taxation for the lower income groups. In respect of those with slightly higher incomes there is only a higher loan levy. In the sixth place this Budget encourages productivity. The Productivity Advisory Committee is being given R50,000. There are tax concessions in respect of students. There are concessions in respect of donations for bursaries and technological education. There is increased provision in the Budget for technical and higher education. In the seventh place this Budget encourages concessions in connection with estate duty. In the months ahead the Government will do its utmost to draw more savings from the public by means of savings bonds. In the eighth place the Government is proceeding with its policy of issuing treasury bills in excess of its immediate requirements, in order to drain the excessively high liquidity of the country by those means. If such a budget, in respect of which I have just mentioned eight points, is not disinflationary, then I do not understand the meaning of the word &#x201C;disinflationary&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite alleged that the Government had done nothing for arresting inflation in the country. The hon. member for Salt River said that they had been warning the Government for many years and that the Government had at long last woken up. The hon. member for Musgrave said that the Government was &#x201C;quite unconcerned&#x201D; about inflation. Do the hon. members not know what the Government has been doing with a great deal of success since 1964&#x003F; The Stellenbosch Bureau for Economic Research and the Reserve Bank have stated on more than one occasion that those Government measures have exerted a great influence, and that if they had not been taken inflation would have assumed much greater proportions. Six months ago, when the debate in this House was in progress, the Opposition was asked whether it supported those measures taken by the Government in the past. That was six months ago and they refused to give any reply. The hon. member for Parktown even asked for lower taxes in the past. I now want to ask hon. members whether they support the measures&#x2014;monetary and other measures&#x2014;taken by the Government up to now for combating inflation.</p>

<p>Accusations were brought against us that expenditure by the authorities was too high. Hon. members wanted to know how a government could ask other people to save when it itself was not saving. In the first place it is true of course that a government has to cut its expenditure as much as possible in a time such as this. That has also been done, but there are limits beyond which it is not possible to cut expenditure without causing harm to the country. You must remember, Sir, that there is a major difference between expenditure by the private sector and expenditure by the Government. Expenditure by the Government is not expenditure for itself. Expenditure by a government is expenditure for the country and for the nation. In the case of an ordinary company, we may accept that its expenditure is mostly incurred for enhancing its own prestige, for expanding and for increasing its profits or for strengthening its position, mostly in its own interests, but the Government does not spend for itself, it spends for the public and everything it spends goes to the public. The expenditure is in the service of the public. The Opposition was often asked in the course of this debate what they wanted to cut from the Budget. I now want to allege that it never brought any economic evidence for justifying any cutting of expenditure. Hon. members opposite came forward with ridiculous proposals&#x2014;the number of Cabinet Ministers had to be decreased; the Public Service had to be investigated in order to avoid overlapping. The latter is important and it is something into which we shall look. They also came forward with the senseless statement that the Government had to abandon its ideological activities and promote integration.</p>

<p>The entire plea of hon. members opposite and virtually the only point which they made in the entire debate, was that non-Whites had to be absorbed to an increasing extent in the economy of the white man in order to combat inflation.</p>

<p>But you are doing so.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Their entire point revolved around the Government&#x2019;s so-called ideological activities. In other words, this Government has to abandon its policy, it must not implement its political principles. Does the Opposition think for one moment that we shall do so&#x003F; That is why we are here. That is why the nation elected us, namely on account of our political policy. The nation that placed us here to implement a specific policy is also prepared to pay for the implementation of that policy. One election after another proved that. The nation asked us to ensure its future, to ensure the continued existence of Western civilization here; it asked for internal security, it asked for protection against outside dangers; <span class="col_3865-3866" refersTo="page_0548"/>it asked us for many other things. The nation is prepared to pay for that and we shall carry out its instructions. This Government is not prepared to abandon its policy merely on account of financial considerations in order to satisfy the Opposition and to please countries abroad.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite adopt the attitude that we are governing here and not them, and, because they are the Opposition, they need not make any positive contribution. Their attitude is that they have to make no positive proposals for combating inflation. On a previous occasion in this House I said that a party that adopted that attitude showed that it had abandoned all hope of ever again coming into power and that it had reconciled itself to the idea of always remaining in opposition. But what is more, in a democratic country such as our Parliament consists of, <i>inter alia,</i> a government and an opposition. An opposition forms part of Parliament and because it forms part of Parliament it is expected to make its contribution in a positive and constructive way. If it cannot do so and will not do so it has to make way for a better opposition.</p>

<p>It was alleged here that Government expenditure was too high. That is not true. The hon. member for Florida quoted figures in a very clear and competent way to illustrate that Government expenditure in South Africa compared favourably with that of other countries. I do not want to repeat those figures. Hon. members must bear in mind the fact that we in South Africa are in a unique position. Ours is a large and growing country. Ours is a country with a colour problem as no other country has. I sometimes wonder whether hon. members realize what costs are involved for the State if a country has to deal with a colour problem as we have to do. Had the United Party been in power here, that would have applied to them as well. Ours is a country which has to deal with the development of our non-white areas; be they homelands under our policy or geographic federal components under the policy of the United Party, the expenditure has to be met. Ours is a country which has to be protected against dangers and threats from within and from without. We are in a unique position. And all these things cost money.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown alleged,&#x201C;the Government is the main contributor to capital spending&#x201D;. But that is not true. If the hon. member would only go to the trouble of looking at the White Paper with which all hon. members had been supplied, he will find on page 13 that that is not so. If we simply take the year 1966 we see that the capital expenditure of all &#x201C;public authorities&#x201D; amounted to R721 million whereas the total gross domestic investment amounted to R2.117 million. Therefore expenditure by public authorities represents approximately one third of the country&#x2019;s total expenditure.</p>

<p>Whose is increasing most rapidly&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can quickly work out the figures for the hon. member. I also want to ask the hon. member: &#x201C;For whom is the expenditure increasing&#x003F; For whom is the State building railway lines&#x003F; For whom is it building post offices&#x003F; For whom is it building universities and schools&#x003F;&#x201D; To say that Government expenditure is unproductive&#x2014;as the hon. member apparently means&#x2014;is also false of course. Just as it is incorrect to say that the work of the directors of the staff or the management who work in offices and who do not work with their hands is unproductive, just as incorrect would it be to say that the work of a government and the public service is unproductive. The State organization forms just as much a part of the economic structure of a country as a country&#x2019;s infra-structure, as its fixed investments, as its working capital, etc. Many a good country has been ruined by a bad state organization and many a poor country has been taken to great heights by a good government.</p>

<p>Hon. members spoke of increased Government expenditure. Now I want to draw their attention to the question of the infra-structure. The infra-structure which we have to provide in a country such as ours, things like roads, railway lines, telecommunications, education, public services, etc., costs a great deal of money. The Government does not spend that money for itself but for the growing commerce and industry and for the business life of our country. It cannot always curtail that expenditure, because a good infra-structure is sometimes required for decreasing costs, increasing production and combating inflation. A main characteristic of this Budget is that Government expenditure is not being financed in an inflationary way. It would have been a completely different story had hon. members been able to allege here that we had extremely high expenditure which was being financed by means of loans from banks. That happened once when the Government could not do otherwise. But in this Budget all expenditure is being financed by means of taxes or real savings, which is in a disinflationary way, and not by means of credit from the banks.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say this. It is striking that hon. members who complained about increased expenditure constantly asked for more and more concessions. They asked for more and more expenditure. The hon. member for Kensington even asked R10 million more for pensions. Had we complied with all demands made by hon. members opposite our expenditure would have been much higher.</p>

<p>It is striking because one asks oneself the question whether they have now left the big man or whether the big man has left them because he no longer saw any future in them.</p>

<p>This Budget is also to the advantage of the little man. I quote from <i>The Cape Times</i> of 23rd March&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are happy, say workers. Trade unions who represent the bulk of the country&#x2019;s workers welcomed the Budget yesterday. Although they had some reservations the predicted that it would go a long way towards solving the problem of inflation.</block>

<p>In addition <i>The Cape Times</i> of 23rd March stated. &#x201C;Little man welcomes concession&#x201D;. In one of the reports in the <i>Sunday Times</i> the financial editor wrote that although the Budget was sound in general there was one thing which had to be guarded against and that was that the big man would be taxed and that the money would be transferred to the lower income groups. That is the opinion of the public. The little man benefits from this Budget firstly because his taxes and his loan levy are not being increased. Only taxpayers who pay R100 or more per annum in income tax to the Central Government will have to pay an increased loan levy and do you know, Sir, how many these people number&#x003F; They number 430.000 approximately one half of the taxpayers. From a population of 18 million 43,000 people are being effected. [Laughter.] Mr. Speaker, I do not know why hon. members opposite are laughing. Are they not the ones who tell us all day long that we are a nation of 18 million people&#x003F; We hear every day that we are a nation of 18 million people. Our inhabitants number 18 million and of that number of 18 million 430,000 are directly being affected by this Budget by means of increased levies, in other words, 2&#x00BD;per cent of the population. How can hon. members say that this Budget is affection the little man if it only affects 2&#x00BD;per cent of the population&#x003F; I think there is no other country in the world, in other respects comparable to South Africa, which is comparable to South Africa in this respect and which can impose an increased loan levy on only 2&#x00BD;per cent of its population in a time of inflation.</p>

<p>The hon. member may be right; if that is the case then there are still more persons who are exempted.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point complained here about the extra tax burden which was now going to descend on the person who earned R3,000 per annum and who had two children. The hon. member apparently made a mistake in his calculations, because a person whose income is R3,000 and who has two children is not being asked to pay additional tax or an additional loan levy. It is only the taxpayer who has a taxable income of R3,070 and who pays normal income tax of R100 per annum who will have to pay the increased loan levy. The real lower income groups are not being affected by this Budget.</p>

<p>The Budget does not even make provision for indirect taxation, except on cars, which would affect the little man. This Budget is to the advantage of the little man in the sense that it makes major concessions in the social sphere. I need not again refer to the concessions in the sphere of education and to pensioners. But the main point as regards this Budget is that it is aimed at curbing inflation and nothing can be of greater importance to the little man in particular than the Government being successful in combating and curbing inflation in this country. If this Budget, along with the monetary measures we are taking, succeeds in curbing inflation, the little man would benefit much more from that than the big man and much more than he would have benefited had we not taken these measures.</p>

<p>In conclusion, as regards the little man, there are very many subsidies which this Budget is giving him. On butter there is a subsidy of R6.6 million, on bread R23&#x00BD; million, on mealies R31&#x00BD; million, on fertilizers nearly R14&#x00BD; million, fertilizer which affects production and the eventual price of products. Subsidies which in the long run benefit the little man amount to no less than R74 million.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the course of the debate a number of questions and various subjects were put to me. Hon. members will realize that I cannot reply to all those questions. In the first place I shall not reply to questions dealing with taxes because taxes will be dealt with when we go into Committee of Ways and Means. But I do want to deal briefly with a few of the odd matters which were raised here. In the first place the hon. member for Pine-town asked what control there was over defence expenditure. I can understand the hon. member being concerned about defence expenditure possibly getting out of hand. That is a fair question. In order to reassure the hon. member and this House I want to say that quite exceptional control is being exercized in respect of defence expenditure. In the first place we have the normal departmental and Treasury control and control by the Tender Board. In the Treasury there is a special section which occupies itself with defence matters virtually to the exclusion of everything else <span class="col_3869-3870" refersTo="page_0550"/>and to which all contracts for the procurement of goods which fall outside the normal are submitted for consideration. As regards the Tender Board, a special committee on which the Treasury is represented has been appointed to consider contracts for the procurement of supplies. In the third place, there is a defence board which advises the Minister of Defence in regard to all projects and in the fourth place there is a Cabinet committee on which the Ministers of Defence and Finance serve under the chairmanship of the hon. the Prime Minister. This committee approves defence programmes and watches their progress. In the fifth place, there is the Controller and Auditor-General and in the sixth place there is the Select Committee on Public Accounts. I think hon. members will agree with me that there are a whole series of bodies of control for exercising control over this expenditure.</p>

<p>A second question put to me was the following: I mentioned here that national earnings in the form of increased exports might bring money into circulation in the country which might have an inflationary influence; on the other hand I announced certain measures for promoting export, and hon. members asked me whether these two things were not in conflict. I do not believe that hon. members of the Opposition wanted to intimate thereby that we were to discourage exports; that would of course be unwise. Whereas we hope to overcome the threat of inflation, as a temporary phenomenon, within the foreseeable future the promotion of exports must be one of the permanent objects of our economic policy. With the anticipated decrease in the production of gold and with the anticipated expansion in the economic field, larger exports of other commodities than gold have become an essential requirement in our economic endeavours. The inflationary effect which increased exports may have, can be warded off by other means, for example, by increased imports or by increased savings and by fewer bank loans, etc., and added to that there is the fact that increased exports, as a result of the increased production which they may bring about in an industry, may bring about decreases in costs as well as decreased prices as a result of the decrease in costs on account of the larger volume and that that may be anti-inflationary. In other words, I want to hope that the acquisition of permanent markets and of larger exports will be permanent elements in our economic structure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside also asked questions in regard to the Usury Act. I appointed a committee which is at present conducting a detailed investigation into the entire operation of the Usury Act with a view to drafting legislation, if necessary. The detailed remarks of the hon. member for Durban (Central) will also be taken into consideration in that investigation.</p>

<p>I now come to a point on which hon. members often criticized me here. More than one member on the opposite side of this House as well as in the Other Place blamed me in previous debates and in this debate for being responsible for the increase in sugar production and consequently for increased exports of sugar at a lower price, which led to an increase in the local price. That hon. member is nodding his head; he is saying that that is true. Because hon. members would perhaps not believe me, I approached the Sugar Association through the Department of Commerce and Industries and asked it to furnish me with a reply to this accusation. [Interjections.] Does that hon. member have no confidence in the Sugar Association&#x003F; In reply to my inquiries the Association said the following in a telex communication under the heading &#x201C;Proposals to increase sugar production&#x201D;, and it referred to a document which accompanied a letter addressed to me by the Sugar Association at the end of 1963, and which stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In its representations to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Secretary for Commerce and Industries in Pretoria on Wednesday, 4th December, the South African Sugar Association expressed the firm opinion that speed is absolutely essential in expanding South Africa&#x2019;s sugar production to protect the long-term interests of the country. The Association feels that there is little likelihood of any new international agreement being introduced before 1968. All the information it can obtain suggests that world sugar production, consumption and replacement of stocks will not come into any sort of permanent balance before 1970. The possibility is that the world demand for sugar will continue to increase at a rate of approximately 1,000,000 tons per annum for many years to come. This increase is based on the natural population growth of the world, together with the rising standard of living in many countries. The S.A. Sugar Association, on all the information available to it, believes firmly that there is room immediately for developing new areas for sugar production together with limited expansion of the existing areas. If the S.A. Sugar Association is to take advantage of the markets open to it, it must be able to put sugar into them at once and increase the tonnages progressively during the next three years. This essential production of sugar can come only from existing cane-growers and existing mills. A limited quantity could come in the third year from new areas if immediate approval were given to their development. For these reasons the S.A. Sugar Association suggests that sugar production should immediately be expanded and that this be done in four stages, bearing constancy in mind the urgent need to bring new growers and new areas into production as rapidly as possible.</block>

<p>At the bottom of the telex communication the Association stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3871-3872" refersTo="page_0551"/>We trust this is the information you require &#x2026; It came from Sugar Association representatives of all sections of the industry.</block>

<p>Sir, I believe that it is not necessary for me to say anything more about this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown saw nothing in this Budget &#x201C;to convince us that the inflationary process will be completely contained&#x201D;. I want to concede that to a large degree the hon. member for Pinetown is correct in saying that this Budget, taken by itself, cannot contain inflation completely. But it is not the intention that this Budget should take on itself the entire burden of putting an end to inflation by means of fiscal measures. The Budget must be seen as something supplementary to the monetary and other measures already taken, because inflation is an enemy which must be combated on a wide front. The struggle is not one for the State alone to wage; it is a struggle in which everyone must take part&#x2014;every individual, every group, every company, every organization must take part in that struggle because it affects the interests of all of us. The Government can, of course, put a sudden end to inflation. The Government can take such drastic measures that a virtually immediate end will be put to inflation, but then the danger always exists that that may lead to a recession from which it will be very difficult to free ourselves. At present we have examples of that in several countries in Western Europe where measures were somewhat too drastic and led to a recession. Hon. members opposite will agree with me that the economic structure of a country is a very delicate mechanism which one has to handle with a great deal of care. We, with our particular position in the world, cannot run that risk of landing our country in a recession or a depression. I can hardly imagine hon. members opposite wanting something like that, but I should like to give hon. members the assurance that we are not quite powerless. We can take drastic action if we have to do so. The co-operation of the public and of the business world and also that of the Opposition will determine to what extent we shall have to take more drastic action if that becomes necessary. In addition I want to tell hon. members that ours, as I said before, is not a socialistic state. We have always prided ourselves on the fact that our economy rests on the basis of private initiative. The State does not interfere unless it is obliged to do so in the public interests, and we should like to retain that freedom in our economy. But then the public and the private sector have to contribute their share as well as the investors and the consumers, the labourers and the entrepreneurs; everyone has to contribute his share.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to make a serious appeal to everyone to co-operate in all respects in the endeavour to curb inflation in our country. In the first place I want to make an appeal to our Press. There is a section of our Press which often goes out of its way to wrest any increase in price from its context in regard to inflation and by so doing to arouse fear amongst the people. I want to make an appeal to our Opposition, which forms a part of this Parliament and a part of the nation of South Africa, to co-operate with us in a positive and constructive way, to speak less of inflation in an exaggerated form and not to belittle the measures of the Government to such a degree as though they did not exist and as though they would have no influence. I want to make an appeal to our business world to be careful and judicious in regard to further expansion, rather to proceed at a slower pace, borrow less money and consolidate more. Here I want to address a word of warning to everyone. Optimism in our future is a major reason for the tremendous expansion we experienced in the past. Optimism in our long-term future is a good thing, but I have to warn the country to-day that if the Government&#x2019;s measures succeed, and they will be persisted with until they do succeed, some over-optimistic expectations amongst investors on the Stock Exchange and in other quarters will not be realized. We want growth in this country but we cannot allow there to be excessive growth at a rate which is too high in terms of money and which will lead to inflation. Those people who buy shares on the Stock Exchange or who expand their businesses in the expectation that such excessive growth will always take place in our country in the times ahead, may find that they will be disappointed in their over-optimistic expectations and that they will burn their fingers. I appeal to our businessmen to be more careful as regards the future. I appeal to our financial institutions to contribute their share to decrease the amount of money in circulation in order to slow down capital and consumption expenditure. I appeal to the public to work and to save, to be more productive and to spend less. And if we co-operate in this common task of us all, we can and we will soon overcome the danger of further inflation.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members will know that it is not customary to have a discussion on this Vote. Nor am I getting up now to break away from that custom, but I do so because this is the last Vote on which matters affecting the State President, who is due to retire on 31st May, may be discussed. The thought may have occurred to some members that we should avail ourselves of this opportunity to say a few words of farewell to the State President as far as this House is concerned. My attitude in this connection&#x2014;and I may say the hon. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me&#x2014;is that the status of the office as well as the worthy manner in which the State President and Mrs. Swart have discharged the duties attaching to this office for a period of five years justifies that it should be done not through this Committee, but by means of a substantive motion introduced in this House. Accordingly I have discussed this matter with Mr. Speaker, and I shall introduce such a substantive motion in this House on 30th May&#x2014; the day before the present State President is due to retire.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with the discussion of this Vote we reach in a sense the end of an epoch, in that it is the Vote which makes provision for the succession of the first State President of the Republic by a second State President, the present State President Elect. While I agree with the hon. the Prime Minister that this is not the occasion for an expression of appreciation towards the State President and his consort for the manner in which they have conducted their duties during their period in office, I want to raise two other matters in connection with this somewhat historic occasion.</p>

<p>The first concerns the participation of the public in the inaugural ceremony by which the new State President will assume office. The second is the manner in which office will be handed over from the existing State President to the new State President. I have been at pains to look for precedents in respect of this matter. One&#x2019;s mind has naturally gone back to the old South African Republic and the old Oranje Vrystaat. I have been unable to find any account of a handing over or an inaugural ceremony in the old Oranje Vrystaat, but on inquiries made, I have received a report of the first time President Kruger was sworn in on the 9th May, 1883, as President of the South African Republic. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Vir die geleentheid is &#x2019;n eenvoudige pleg-tigheid op Kerkplein, Pretoria, gere&#x00EB;l voor die ou Regeringsgebou wat &#x2019;n aantal jare daarna verdwyn het. Daar is &#x2019;n tribune opgerig met die Vierkleur en die vlae van Engeland, Nederland en Amerika. Voor die ingang tot Kerkstraat was daar &#x2019;n groot ere-boog met die woorde &#x201E;Lank leef die President&#x201D;. Op Kerkplein het twee afdelings erewagte oosisie ingeneem. Kruger het in &#x2019;n rytuig deur vier perde getrek, aangekom, die tribune bestyg, gevolg deur Volksraadslede en ander hoogwaardigheidsbekle&#x00EB;rs. Na &#x2019;n gebed deur ds. Bosman (die latere welbekende dr. A. S. Bosman) het die President &#x2019;n lang eed af gel&#x00EA;. Dit ds gevolg deur &#x2019;n toespraak deur Kruger. Aan die end van die <span class="col_3875-3876" refersTo="page_0553"/>toespraak <b>is</b> die President met kanonvuur engeweersalvo&#x2019;s begroet. Dit is gevolg deur toesprake deur Hoofregter Kotz&#x00E9; en die Britse verteenwoirdiger. Die middag was daar &#x2019;n ontvangs in die Volksraadsaal. In werklikheid was daar geen uittredende President nie aangesien Kruger oorgeneem het van die Engelse onder Shepstone wat vir Burgers, die vorige President, in die pad gesteek het.</block>

<p>President Burgers of course took over from President Pretorius. I tried to find out what happened on that occasion. Although it is not entirely substantiated, it seems that President Pretorius was so dissatisfied that he refused to participate in the ceremony.</p>

<p>In England you have the legal principle &#x201C;The king is dead, long live the king&#x201D;, and one monarch never hands over to another. A monarch is crowned, normally speaking, only on the demise of a former monarch. So I looked for precedents to the United States of America. There of course the inaugural ceremony is one of the greatest occasions in the whole period of presidential office. There is a tremendous attendance. Every possible effort is made, as in the case of the coronation in Great Britain, to allow the public to play the maximum part. I would plead that things be so arranged here, when the new President takes over, that the public, with due regard to the religious ceremony which I know will take place and which has its rightful place, as it does in a coronation ceremony in England, be given the maximum opportunity to participate on this occasion.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of whether there should not be some ceremony in which the existing State President hands over to the new State President. In the U.S.A. the President and the President-elect are both on the platform at the same time during the ceremony, and I understand the position is that the President who is relinquishing office remains President until the new President has finally taken the oath of office. At that moment he ceases to be President and there is in a way a symbolic transfer of the insignia of office to the new President.</p>

<p>I wondered whether we should not consider the introduction of some such occasion in the ceremony here when one President takes over from another. I appreciate, of course, that the resident of the U.S.A. occupies an executive position, a very different position from that of our President. Nevertheless, it is the place of the first citizen of our country, it is the most distinguished post in the country at the present time, and one feels that there should be some symbolic handing over of office from one President to the other.</p>

<p>It is possible that it may not be possible to arrange these matters in such a way on this occasion, but it does seem to me that it is right that there should be thinking in that direction so that this will be a ceremony in which there is maximum representation by the people, a ceremony worthy of the history of the country, and a ceremony worthy of the office involved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has raised two matters. In the first instance he spoke about participation by the public. In our country, as the hon. member knows, and as was also quite evident on 31st May, 1961, the main emphasis at the induction of the State President falls&#x2014;if I may put it this way &#x2014;on the religious aspect and on that ceremony, which in fact takes place in the church. In this case it will take place in the Groote Kerk. I can assure the hon. the Leader and the public that the Arrangements Committee has gone to great pains to invite representatives of as many organizations as possible, in addition to persons on the protocol list, to the Groote Kerk in order to give as many representatives of the public as possible the opportunity of taking part in the ceremony. Thereafter, as was the case in Pretoria, the State President will appear before the people&#x2014;an announcement in that connection will be made later&#x2014;and the public will be afforded an opportunity of taking part in the further ceremonies. In other words, as far as this matter is concerned, we shall in the main follow the same pattern that we followed in Pretoria at the induction of the State President. Of course, much will depend on the weather conditions in Cape Town on that day, particularly as far as 31st May is concerned. It is still fresh in our memory that even on that day five years ago it rained heavily in Pretoria. A great deal depends on that. To summarize&#x2014;considering the nature of the ceremony, we should like the public to take part in the ceremony as much as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader also mentioned the question of the handing over of office by one State President to the next. We have given attention to this matter as well. There was the one line of thought that one should consider having such a ceremony. Then there was the other line of thought that one might to a certain extent detract from the dignity of the ceremony in that way. I do not want to cast any reflection, but I just want to compare these two offices: this ceremony should not be placed on the same footing as that of mayors succeeding one another, where the one mayor hands over the chain of office to his successor. We have in any case discussed this matter in full. Apart from the fact that one would like to discuss the matter further, it appears to be impossible in practice to have such a ceremony, as the commitments and appointments already accepted by the outgoing State President in this connection are such that it would unfortunately be impossible for any such ceremony to take place, even if one would at this stage be in favour of it.</p>

<p>While on this subject I may just mention to the hon. the Leader that I have made a certain request to hon. members on this side of the House and to the caucus, and I am now <span class="col_3877-3878" refersTo="page_0554"/>making that request to hon. members on the other side as well. We are breaking new ground. We are establishing new traditions in this connection. I have told hon. members on this side of the House that I shall welcome any suggestions they may have to make in this connection. I shall also welcome any suggestions from hon. members opposite. Indeed, I shall welcome any suggestions from members of the public outside who have an interest in these matters. If they submit those suggestions to us, we will have them before us for consideration when the whole matter is reviewed. We shall then be able to establish as fine a tradition as possible as far as the State President is concerned.</p>

<p>With those few words I think I have replied to a large extent to the points raised by the hon. the Leader.</p>

<p>Vote put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote 2,&#x2014;&#x201C;Senate, R342,000&#x201D;:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as an old Parliamentarian I should like to raise a certain matter which, I believe, comes under this particular Vote. I wish to refer to the question of the opening of Parliament. You will recollect, Sir, that after the elections last year there was the normal ceremonial opening of Parliament. When the opening took place this year it was decided, presumably by the wisdom of the Cabinet whose function it is to decide these maters, that there should not be a ceremonial opening of Parliament. I believe that that was a great pity. As it is, we have little pageantry, little ceremony in this country, and the result of that decision regarding the opening of Parliament this year&#x2014;and I think I voice the opinion of many members &#x2014;was that the opening was a dismal affair. It was a half-baked affair. What happened was this. The President, as convention and custom demand, gave his normal banquet for the Cabinet and other leading persons, for instance the diplomatic corps, and quite rightly so. I believe the hon. the Prime Minister entertained Ministers and others, to lunch in the House, which is the normal thing. But as far as the rest of the House was concerned there was little or no participation in the opening of Parliament. What I am more particularly concerned about, for the public outside, too, there was little or no participation in the ceremony. I believe that in a democratic Parliamentary system it is essential for the public to be brought into it. By doing so we reaffirm, we demonstrate to the public that this is a democratic Parliamentary Government that we are under in this country. I do not believe that it is something which can be done too often. I do not know what reasons actuated the Cabinet in coming to their decision&#x2014;perhaps to save money&#x2014;but to their minds it may be a good reason why it was not done. As a result I feel&#x2014;and I feel quite strongly on this matter&#x2014;that the opening went off as a damp squib. I hope that in future, although it may entail two ceremonial openings of Parliament fairly close together, that we shall have a proper opening of Parliament, everybody participating, with a proper procession through the city of Cape Town. I do hope that this half-half manner of opening Parliament, observing some of the things whilst doing away with the others, will not be repeated. I believe that it is essential that we should make known that Parliament is opening; that this is the system under which we work. We should publish it. If I may say so, there is all too little pageantry and ceremony in South Africa. I believe that as far as the opening ceremony is concerned there might be room for improving matters. Perhaps the political parties could get together in the same way as was done in the previous matter which has just been mentioned. They could then consult on the matter and, according to our traditions, perhaps other matters suitable to the opening of Parliament could be incorporated in the ceremony.</p>

<p>The matter which the hon. member has just raised was discussed at length in the Cabinet when my predecessor was still there. The question was whether there was to be a ceremonial opening last year or this year. The practical problems in connection with bringing the police and the horses here and everything connected with that made it very difficult to have two ceremonial openings within the short spare of a few months. The Cabinet then decided that the ceremonial opening would be held in the middle of last year because it was a new Parliament that was to meet then. In view of the fact that the duration of the recess was only two or three months, it was then decided&#x2014; and I fully agree with the decision that was taken&#x2014;not to have a ceremonial opening this year. I think the hon. member is aware of the fact that the question was raised whether the present Parliament was a new one and whether this Session was merely a continuation of last year&#x2019;s session, and purely in view of that the Cabinet decided not to have another ceremonial opening within so short a space of time. Those are the facts, and one cannot read anything more into the position.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It always distresses one to see how much valuable time is lost through divisions in the House of Assembly, and I have wondered whether it is not possible for us to have the introduction of an electronic system of voting at divisions investigated. Divisions form an essential part of our parliamentary procedure. There are occasions when one wants to have the individual votes on record. I do not think it will be argued that an Opposition should not call for divisions, but it usually takes eight minutes of the time of the House to complete a division and in cases where mistakes are made in the counting it takes as much as ten to 12 minutes. Of course, the number of divisions depend on the amount of contentious legislation. but we have already had one session, in 1959, in which 210 divisions took place. Under the new rules we have between 60 and 120 divisions per session. At an average of about 100 divisions per session one is able to work out the approximate cost to the State, but the figure arrived at will not be quite accurate. I do not think one can calculate accurately what Parliament costs the State per minute, but if only the direct costs are taken into account the cost is calculated at R31 per minute. In other words, if there are 100 divisions during a session it will cost Parliament R24,800. To my mind not only considerable time but also considerable expenditure will be saved if another system is introduced, and I suggest that we should consider investigating the system being used in Norway and whether it cannot be introduced here. In Norway they have an electronic system. The system simply amounts to this, that there is a panel and a button on every bench and that by simply pressing the button, indicating either &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;, one has the result available within seconds for announcement by the Speaker. Moreover, this instrument also records the names of members, and the names of the members and how they voted are printed in the Minutes of Proceedings the next day in the usual way. I should like to suggest that we give serious consideration to introducing such a system in this House with a view to saving time and money and achieving greater efficiency.</p>

<p>The suggestion which has just been made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to provide us with &#x201C;electric chairs&#x201D; is, of course, something we cannot discuss amongst ourselves here. To my mind this is a matter for the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders. I think one should leave the matter at the speech made by the hon. member. I am sure the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders will take cognizance of it and will consider it at its next meeting. I feel it is a good thing to save time if one can do so, but in passing I want to warn against the suggestions which also appear in the Press from time to time to the effect that a session costs this or that amount of money. We are paid in any case whether we divide or not, and I think that these calculations of the cost involved are completely divorced from their proper context. The impression is sometimes created that we are merely wasting money when we assemble here, and one must at all times guard against the impression being created that whenever we meet here it is a waste of money. That cannot be so, and it is certainly not a waste of money.</p>

<p>While the matter which I wish to raise to-day is important, it is not one with which I shall detain the House for any length of time. I have had discussions with members on both sides of the House about the lighting in the House of Assembly. It appears to me that members on both sides are dissatisfied with the lighting in this House. I am given to understand also that a committee of the C.S.I.R. has recently investigated the lighting and has found it unsatisfactory. I therefore trust that the necessary steps will be taken to improve the lighting, at least before the next sitting.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side welcome the amendments as proposed by the hon. the Minister. They add a great deal of clarity to section 1 (2) (b), particularly as far as the form is concerned. With your permission, Sir, I want to move two amendments as printed in the Order Paper. The first one is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 20, after &#x201C;person&#x201D; to add &#x201C;except where such person is in appearance obviously a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In order to explain this amendment, I should first of all like to read the subsection as it reads at the moment. It reads that &#x201C;it shall, in the absence of proof that any person is generally accepted as a white person or a Bantu, be assumed that he is generally accepted as a Coloured person&#x201D;. In other words, if a person were to appear before the Secretary or before the Board for the purpose of being classified or reclassified, and no evidence is led in regard to his circumstances&#x2014; where he lives, etc., that he is generally accepted as a white person or as a Bantu&#x2014;it is indisputably assumed that he is accepted as a Coloured person. But may I just refer to clause 6 of this amendment Bill which converts section 19 (1 <i>)bis</i> into section 19 (1). I shall read section 19 (1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person who in appearance obviously is a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed to be a Bantu unless it is proved that he is not in fact and is not generally accepted as such a member.</block>

<p>In other words, in terms of this section, if a person who appears for classification before the Secretary or the Board is obviously a Bantu, the onus of proof is transferred to him to prove that he is in fact not a Bantu and also that he is not generally accepted as a Bantu. But now I can picture to myself an example of a person appearing for classification. He is obviously a Bantu, but before this section applies to him, so that the onus of proof is transferred, he does not lead any evidence whatever; he merely sits down. Then this first section which I read, comes into operation, namely that &#x201C;it shall, in the absence of proof that any person is generally accepted as a white person or a Bantu, be assumed that he is generally accepted as a Coloured person&#x201D;; consequently it is possible to have the position that, when he does not lead any evidence, it must indisputably be assumed that he is a Coloured person, while he is a person who is obviously a Bantu.</p>

<p>The amendment I propose is as follows: to add at the end of that clause &#x201C;except where such person is in appearance obviously a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa&#x201D;. In other words, what we are effecting by means of this amendment is that we are bringing section 1 (2) (b) into line with section 19 (1), so that&#x2014;if I may refer to my example again&#x2014; if a person who in appearance is obviously a Bantu, were to appear, then this section would not have applied to him if he were indisputably accepted as a Coloured person, and then the onus of proof in terms of section 19 (1) would rest on him to prove that he is not a Bantu. The consequences of these two sections are that if these sections were to remain as printed, we shall find that Bantu persons, persons who are obviously Bantu in appearance, will, in this way in terms of clause 1 (2) (b), find a loophole for having themselves classified as Coloured persons. We on this side of the House are of the opinion that what we are contemplating by means of this Bill, is a pure classification of the various races, so that we view the possibility of a Bantu being classified as a Coloured person as seriously as we view the possibility of a Coloured person being classified as a white person. We feel that if the Bill remains as it reads at present, it is unfair to the Coloureds, because it makes it possible for Bantu persons to be classified as Coloured persons by using this loophole. What my amendment aims at, is that in the interests of the Coloureds a stop should be put to that sort of thing.</p>

<p>My second amendment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 40 and 41, to omit &#x201C;or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I should like to read that clause. Clause 1 (2) (d) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in considering whether or not any person is a white person, he shall be deemed also to admit freely and voluntarily and on the ground of facts that he is by descent a Bantu or a Coloured person if &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">(ii) in any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him, there appears a statement to the effect that as far as his race is concerned, he is not a white person; &#x2026;</block>

<p>As the clause reads at present, it means that if a person fills in a form for his spouse, or if his guardian has filled in a form on his behalf, the facts in that form may at a later stage be used against him at a classification. With the amendment I am proposing now, it means that we shall now have the position that only such facts as are taken from a form which he himself has filled in personally in his own handwriting and which he himself has signed, may be used against him at his classification. <span class="col_3883-3884" refersTo="page_0557"/> That, in my modest opinion, corresponds entirely with the recognized rules of our law of evidence. I am referring here to page 142 of Scoble&#x2019;s <i>Law of Evidence</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general rule may be succinctly stated as follows: That which a party admits against himself is generally presumed to be true. The basis of such principle rests on the proposition that what a party has said on a former occasion, inconsistent with his present interests, may without injustice be presumed to be true against himself.</block>

<p>With this amendment we are providing now that the contents of this form may only be used against a person who has completed and signed it personally. In passing I may just add that, in my modest opinion, this does not deprive him of the rights he has in terms of the proviso in section 1. The definition of a white person means a person who in appearance obviously is a white person or who is generally accepted as a white person, but does not include any person who for the purposes of his classification under this Act, freely and voluntarily admits that he is by descent a Bantu or a Coloured person &#x201C;unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact&#x201D;. In my humble submission that last part &#x2014;&#x201C;unless it is proved that the admission is not based on fact&#x201D;&#x2014;still stands part of this clause, in spite of the subsection we have here. In other words, if a person were to admit that he is a Coloured person and it should for some reason or other transpire later that that fact is not correct&#x2014;for instance, that he was brought up by Coloured parents and that he might perhaps have been a foundling and that at a later stage of his life he discovered that he had in fact had white parents but was brought up by Coloureds&#x2014;such a person would be able to prove that his admission was not based on fact. He will still be able to prove that, but what he will not be able to deny, is that he did in fact make that admission. That is the effect of this provision, namely that he cannot claim now that the form has no significance and that he made a mistake. He has to prove that the facts contained in that form, are wrong.

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are going to oppose this clause in spite of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Prinshof, part of which indicates that he should be on this side of the House arguing the Bill with us, because he has put the point of view of the person effected, a point which we have hammered again and again in respect of every amendment in this Bill. He has now come to the conclusion that we are right and that the hon. the Minister is wrong. I sincerely hope, in spite of that, that the second part of his amendment will be accepted by the hon. the Minister. I am not so sure about the first part of the amendment. Why does the hon. member not adhere to the original wording which was inserted by the 1956 amendment. Let me read section 3 of the 1956 Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A person who in appearance obviously is a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed to be a Native.</block>

<p>That is where he stops but section <i>ibis</i> goes on and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless it is proved that he is not in fact and is not generally accepted as such a member.</block>

<p>That is the spirit in which this was inserted in 1956, namely that the possibility is allowed that he is not accepted as a native. But this hon. member says that to stop them creeping through the fences it were, that part must now be left out so that a person cannot creep through the fence. In other words, he wants to defeat the object of the amendment brought in by the 1956 Act. But this will be dealt with more fully as we go along.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment. We are prepared to accept it except for the fact that he has, in my opinion, put it in the wrong place. He has put it in line 44 after &#x201C;he&#x201D;. Surely he has made a technical mistake. &#x201C;He&#x201D; for the purposes of classification &#x201C;admits or has admitted&#x201D;. Surely this should go in after &#x201C;has admitted&#x201D; so that it will read &#x201C;He admits or has admitted for the purposes of his classification&#x201D;. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he take cognizance of that technicality and removes his amendment to the right place because here it is only for the purposes of classification if he admits now but not if he has admitted in the past. I am sure that that is not the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention.</p>

<p>We are opposing this clause because by opposing it, if we succeed, we will revert to the 1962 section 1. That is what we want to do. We would in fact like to go further back and revert to the 1950 position for the sake of continuity so that the people affected, the borderline cases, these people sitting on either side of the chasm would have some continuity and know where they are going and would know where they are going to stay and which side of this fence they are going to be allowed to stay. What is happening here is that although in this clause we are not in fact amending the description of a white person, we are laying down such a set of circumstances and we are tinkering with the description to such an extent that we are virtually making a completely new description. Apart from everything else the new section 5 (5) is being introduced by this Bill which we will discuss later. By the time that we have amended and passed this clause the description of a white person, governed by all these new factors, is going to be something completely different from the 1962 amendment which is still on the Statute Book because this clause lays down so many new factors which must be taken into consideration. It is so set out that it virtually changes the whole description. This is what has happened since 1950 until we get to this <span class="col_3885-3886" refersTo="page_0558"/>Bill. In the 1950 Act we started off and said that the community will be the judge. There will be no other judge, the community will judge. For 12 years that succeeded. This hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor made that case for this 1950 legislation. From our point of view you could have no finer advocate. I do not want to refer to Hansard but I might quote a little later from what he said. He made out the perfect case for us wishing to go back to the 1950 amendment. Then came the 1962 amendment because of a man called Song. I think that it was sparked off by him. Then we had a different picture. The community still judged but appearance now came into it and a little descent if he made an admission under a certain set of circumstances. Now we have come to this. Let us have a look at a few of the provisions.</p>

<p>This hon. member does not listen. I have just said that the description remains the same as in the 1962 Act. Let us read the provisions which now govern it in this clause. The new section 1 (2) (a) provides, apart from the new section 5 (5) to which we will come later and which is rather a vicious clause:</p>

<block name="quote">In deciding whether any person is in appearance obviously a white person or not a white person within the meaning of the definition of &#x201C;white person&#x201D; in subsection (1), his habits, education and speech and deportment and demeanour in general shall be taken into account.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>No, it does not say upbringing. It says &#x201C;education&#x201D; quite distinctly, if the hon. member can read. Is a man&#x2019;s colour now going to be decided by the standard of his education&#x003F; How stupid can we get. If a man has bad habits, what colour will he be made&#x003F; If he has good habits, what colour will he be made in terms of this amendment&#x003F; What do his habits have to do with his colour&#x003F; I do not see by any stretch of my imagination how this can be done. In regard to deportment the only thing I can think of is that this position has become so stupid because a judge in his judgment said that a man must for instance be able to walk into a European hotel and be acceptable there. What happens&#x003F; The Minister then puts in the word &#x201C;deportment&#x201D;. I take it he means the way in which he walks into a European hotel. Is that what he means&#x003F; I do not know. I have only just started and this clause continues over the page. What does his &#x201C;demeanour in general&#x201D; mean&#x003F; I honestly do not know what this clause means and I want the hon. the Minister to tell us what it means. Because I frankly do not know.</p>

<p>I think I understand the English language reasonably well. But let us go on a little. The hon. member for Prinshof now has an amendment to the next clause, which I think is a bad amendment. Then we lay down, to comply with the judgment of Judge De Vos Hugo, in paragraph (c) provisions in regard to a man&#x2019;s association with the members of his family. Surely we are not going to go this far in our mad chase to make sure that everything is exactly white, exactly coloured, etc. Surely we are not going to go this far. The paragraph goes further: &#x2026; and in his association with the members of his family and other persons with whom he lives&#x201D;. The Act at the moment provides that a person who is not exactly white can in fact become white according to the legislation of this Government. It is this Minister and his Department who have made this position possible. Now he is introducing another factor. If a man is classified differently from his parents either way&#x2014;and here we must remember that his parents come into this very much at the moment&#x2014;his classification can be upset. There are so many factors in regard to this matter&#x2014;my time is short&#x2014;which can now change the compartment into which a man has been placed, and where he has been compartmentalized in this first clause, that we could go on discussing each one for a long time. I sincerely hope that the Minister will take up these various aspects. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have heard what the hon. member for Umlazi had to say. He tried to ridicule some of the underlying principles of this clause. In the beginning it was not clear to me whether he said that we were changing the 1962 concept or whether he said we were not changing it. I could not hear him very well. I beg the hon. member&#x2019;s pardon if I did not follow him well. I want to make the request that we should not return to the 1950 or even to the 1962 debate. Let us confine ourselves to the clause before us, as adopted by this House during the Second Reading stage. In the first place, I want to make the statement that the <i>status quo,</i> as we find it in the 1962 Act, has not been disturbed. Section 1 of the 1962 Act becomes subsection (1) and that definition has been retained. The <i>status quo</i> has not been disturbed, all that happens here, with the addition of this subsection, is that certain rules, giving specific indications and instructions, have been drawn up for the furnishing of evidence. The contents of the principal section, which now becomes subsection (1), remain unchanged. The concepts of appearance acceptance and admission in respect of descent are the three fundamental concepts in subsection (1). They have been retained. They are in the 1962 Act. The hon. the Minister has already told us in the Second Reading that the courts <span class="col_3887-3888" refersTo="page_0559"/>had experienced certain difficulties in determining the contents and the interpretation of these three concepts. Arising out of those court rulings, and in order to clarify the intention of the legislator, we have decided to give this provision its present wording. In his Second Reading speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that a person had to comply with all these categories from now on. He called them &#x201C;categories&#x201D;, and that argument was repeated by the hon. member for Umlazi in the same tenor, as it were. I want to make the statement that we are not dealing with people who are being subjected to a whole series of categories. We are merely dealing with people who are being tested against the concepts of the 1962 definition&#x2014; concepts of which the components are now being defined. They are not new categories. They are things which one&#x2019;s common sense would tell one to take into account. It is not merely a statutory still-life of man, but the overall picture of man. After all, his appearance does consist of the way he looks, the way he is accepted, the way he behaves himself, the way he talks. Now it is being asked, &#x201C;How does one determine his habits, and so forth&#x003F;&#x201D; It is an overall picture. It is not a matter of separate categories. It is the overall picture a person with common sense will take into account in deciding on a person&#x2019;s appearance. Likewise, the factors mentioned here as a guide to the courts, are nothing but the natural components which define acceptance. For instance, there are the following questions: Where does he live&#x003F; With whom does he live&#x003F; With whom does he mix socially&#x003F; Who are the members of his family&#x003F; Where does he work&#x003F; Surely, these are the natural components of a single concept, namely how is he accepted and what does he pass for&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#havemann">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, all these things are part of one&#x2019;s personal appearance. If the Minister has sinned in this regard, I refer hon. members to the fact that the courts themselves said the following in the case of May:</p>

<block name="quote">There are certain other factors which might assist one in coming to a conclusion, such as accent, education, habits &#x2026;</block>

<p>That was after the courts had been limited to a visual observation; in other words, what I mentioned a moment ago&#x2014;a statutory still-life of man. All that happens now is that those components are being grouped together in this Bill&#x2014;components for furnishing proof, in respect of appearance and acceptance&#x2014;components which our common sense and our experience prescribe to us as guides for determining these concepts. There is nothing wrong or ridiculous about them. If they were ridiculous, our courts would also be ridiculous. I do not think hon. members on that side will go as far as to say that.</p>

<p>Thirdly we come to the question of admission. That is the third element of the 1962 definition. It is now being prescribed how such admission may take place. In respect of that admission, I want to say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has given guidance to his Party and has stated his point of view. He told us that he had objections to the fact that a person might, for instance, have admitted that one of his natural parents was not generally accepted as a white person, and that it might then count against him. Then he said: Where did he have to make that admission&#x003F; In passing&#x003F; In the course of conversation&#x003F; That was never the intention. The Minister stated clearly what his intention was. Now I want to state this. As regards the objections raised by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the contents of this clause, he was accommodated all the way. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, &#x201C;There are certain circumstances where a man makes an admission before a board, and I have no objection if they hold that against him&#x201D;. That is one of the subsections. He said, &#x201C;I have no objection if they say that should be held against him. There are certain cases where he makes an admission under oath, and one would accept that.&#x201D; Then the Leader of the Opposition said that it worried him that one person could state in a return in respect of someone else that the latter was &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;, that is to say, that he was of mixed descent. In this respect, too, there was willingness to oblige so that there might not be any doubt. If that were to count against him, all he has to do is to prove that he is indeed a white person. Now I come to the census which is being dealt with in sub-paragraph (d) (ii). The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Prinshof has eliminated that problem as well. What a person has completed and signed himself, will count against him now. Consequently, if we read this clause in the light of the objections raised by the Leader of the Opposition, we are complying with all the requirements in respect of which they had problems. They ought to accept it <i>in toto</i> now, because they themselves are saying that if certain things were said by a person, that person ought to be bound by them. The Minister has now gone all the way without invalidating the legislation, and every reasonable objection raised by the Leader of the Opposition has now been covered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with interest to what has been said by the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. I think that he misses one point, and that is that in the clause now before us there is an attempt to give some rules of guidance to the Court as to how it should interpret &#x201C;appearance&#x201D; and &#x201C;acceptance&#x201D;. I would be indebted to the Minister if he would explain to us in this House why this guidance to the Court is necessary.</p>

<p>The information which he gave to me in reply to a question shows that the classification appeal board appears to have been dealing <span class="col_3889-3890" refersTo="page_0560"/>with these appeals quite reasonably and quite successfully. During the year 1966 119 objections were lodged with the Race Classification Appeal Board of which 70 were upheld and 49 rejected. 108 persons who had been classified coloured were re-classified white. No persons who had previously been classified white were re-classified Coloured.</p>

<p>Is the Minister suggesting that the board found extreme difficulty in determining appearance and acceptance to the extent that it must now have all these rules of deportment and so forth brought into the Act&#x003F; If one goes further and one looks at the figures of the appeals from the board to the Supreme Court then one sees that of 17 appeals five were allowed. It is not an unreasonable number of appeals when it is a question of applying rules. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not now at this stage tell us&#x2014;and I am sure it would help the debate&#x2014;why it is necessary that the Court or the classification board which has to apply the 1962 definition, namely one of appearance and acceptance, should now be told specifically that it must consider all these interns mentioned under paragraph (a). I do not want to go into their effect&#x2014;we have already debated their effect. But will the Minister tell us why it is necessary to attach those items to the definition for the purpose of classification&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to say that, from my experience of these cases, and after having handled some of the successful appeals, the successful appeals were those of white people who had to prove that they are white after being wrongly classified as Coloured. They succeeded in proving that they were white. They were not Coloureds &#x201C;trying for white&#x201D;. [Interjection.] I can only talk of my own personal experience. The Minister was good enough to have certain cases continue before the tribunal whilst we are debating this matter here. Only last week a case which the department refused to reclassify was reclassified by the classification board and the individual concerned was accepted as white. I wonder whether, if we accept this clause <i>in toto,</i> we are not going to upset the very basis of the Act as it was given to us in 1962, and that is that public opinion is the best judge as to how a person should be accepted by way of appearance and general acceptance.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was rather astonished at the way the hon. members for Umlazi and Green Point argued. They did not try to meet or refute the arguments raised by the hon. members for Prinshof and Odendaalsrus, because they were unable to do so&#x2014;there are no holes to pick in those arguments. Apparently they take delight in regarding the entire additional provision concerning appearance which is being inserted here, as separate categories, as the hon. member for Odendaalsrus expressed it so clearly. On the strength of their experience, the boards, officials and also the Judges have repeatedly emphasized the fact that it is not so easy to judge and classify a person merely by looking at him.</p>

<p>The hon. member said here that the cases of which he knew were all, without exception&#x2014; or if there were any exceptions, they were in the minority&#x2014;cases of white persons who had been classified wrongly. I am not going to argue with him by saying that it is not true. Those boards judged to the best of their ability. But even the officials who had to make classifications in the first instance, would perhaps have made different classifications if they had taken into account what the intention was originally, an intention which was not stated. If they had had to take these factors into account by law, they might perhaps have decided differently. I think that in all probability most of them took these factors into account as a matter of course. If they took the other factors into account, if they did not only have to take the description of a white person into account&#x2014;and, as everybody admits, it is extremely difficult to give a description of the appearance of a white person&#x2014;and if they were not bound by that vague description but knew or were told that they could also take the other factors into account, they could have given a different classification originally.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell hon. members something. After this measure had already been laid upon the Table, I saw a certain person with my own eyes, and if I had to judge on visual appearance only&#x2014;and the person concerned was White enough in colour, but I know what a non-White looks like&#x2014;I would, without having regard to the other factors, have put my foot down and I would not have condoned reclassification. But when I had taken these other factors into account, I decided differently. We do not provide here that a person has to comply with all these factors. The person who makes the classification can determine by himself how much importance he is going to attach to certain factors, how many marks he is going to allocate to them, and how high or how low he is going to assess these additional provisions which are being inserted now&#x2014;where the person is ordinarily resident, is employed, carries on business, the area in which he lives with other people, and so on&#x2014;in order to get the correct overall picture. It does not follow that, if it is found that some or other factor tends to classify a person under a certain race group while other factors tend to classify him under another race group, he has to allow that particular dubious factor to count for so much. He himself has to decide on the appearance of that person, due regard being had to the other additional factors. After all, a human being is never a still-life. Then he <span class="col_3891-3892" refersTo="page_0561"/>has to decide how to classify that person, and it is possible for him to do so. I have quoted how Mr. Justice Diemont said that it was difficult to judge merely by looking at a person, and what a tremendous help it would have been to him if he could also have taken into account other factors, factors which are being inserted now. I checked these cases&#x2014;the Secretary reclassified them&#x2014;and they occurred after this Bill had been laid upon the Table. The reason for this addition is actually to make it easier for the person who classifies to come to a correct decision, but, on the other hand, I want to say that it will perhaps be much more difficult for many people who apply for classification or reclassification into a higher group, to obtain a decision in their favour on the strength of appearances only. If these factors are taken into account, it will perhaps be more difficult for a person to be classified into a higher race group, and I think that the gist of the objections raised by hon. members on the other side is to be found in that. As the hon. member for Odendaalsrus said. I really went out of my way with the amendments I myself proposed to accommodate the real objections, the objections which I regarded as valid and which I thought deserved consideration. The hon. member for Prinshof proposed two amendments. I am prepared to accept both of them because I have received letters, <i>inter alia,</i> from Coloured leaders whose complaint it is that it is very clear to them that in this Bill we are making it much more difficult for people who do not belong to the white race group or who are of dubious descent, to be assimilated into the white stream. But they are telling me that they would like us to protect the Coloureds as well against integration on the part of the Bantu. It worried me and I felt that as the Bill read, without this amendment proposed by the hon. member for Prinshof, there was a very large loophole for Bantu persons to cross the colour bar and to be classified as Coloured persons. J discussed the matter with jurists and they told me that it could not happen so easily under this Bill as it read before the amendment. It is not really necessary to accept this amendment, but if it will make the position more clear, also for the people who have to interpret the Act, then I do not see anything wrong in it, because it is not my intention to keep people out of a race group to which they do in fact belong.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi advanced the argument, <i>inter alia,</i> that we were changing the definition. No, the definition has not been changed. The intention is merely being stated more clearly. The definition is merely making it easier for people to arrive at a decision within the purport of the legislation so that we may achieve our aim with this Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that I have now replied to the important questions which were put to me.</p>

<p>We say that there are thousands of other cases similar to that particular case and we say to the Minister that they should all have an opportunity of proving what this man proved to the Minister&#x2019;s satisfaction. I think the hon. the Minister has indicated that as far as third parties are concerned he is prepared to have second thoughts and that he will accept the recommendations which have been made from this side of the House. The hon. the Minister says, in so far as paragraph (c) is concerned, that the person affected need not comply with all the requirements mentioned there; that he need only comply with one of them. That is the way the hon. the Minister reads it. Sir, that is not the way we read it, but if the Minister now says that the person affected need not comply with all the requirements, then I think we have gone a little bit further in this matter. But I would like to point out that now that the Minister has accepted the amendment of the hon. member for Prinshof, there will have to be a further amendment. I would like the hon. member for Prinshof to listen and to tell me whether he agrees that the words &#x201C;or in respect of him&#x201D; will also have to be deleted if the Minister accepts his amendment to omit those words in lines 40 and 41. I submit that there will have to be a further amendment in line 50 and also in any other clauses in which those words appear. If the Minister accepts the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment to omit &#x201C;or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him&#x201D; in lines 40 and 41, I submit that the words &#x201C;or in respect of him&#x201D; also be omitted in line 50. Paragraph (ii) of paragraph (d) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him, there appears a statement to the effect that as far as his race is concerned, he is not a white person &#x2026;</block>

<p>Paragraph (e) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact that any person was generally accepted as a White person or a Coloured person or a Bantu on the date on which a form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 was completed by or in respect of him &#x2026;</block>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>If the principle is accepted, as the hon. member for Prinshof has said, that nothing shall be counted against the person unless he himself has made the statement, then it seems quite wrong that in the one form it shall be evidence supplied by the person himself while in the other form under (e) the Minister will accept what somebody else says about the person affected. It seems to be contradictory unless the Minister is prepared to accept my suggestion as well. Sir, I do not want to make a joke about this question of speech, habit, education, deportment and demeanour, but what about the queers who walk our streets&#x003F; Their deportment and their speech are most peculiar. One cannot tell from their deportment and their speech whether they are White or Coloured. There are many Coloured people whose habits, education and speech and deportment and demeanour in general are as good as, if not better than, those of many Whites. If a man does not walk too well or speak too well or if his education has been neglected, surely that has nothing to do with whether he is a White or a Coloured person. I feel that these things should not be taken in consideration in deciding whether a person is in appearance obviously a white person or not a white person. I feel that the provisions of paragraph (c) will cover the position adequately. They give the board or the secretary sufficient information upon which to decide whether a person is white or not, and I feel that the Minister does not need what I regard as the stupid and unnecessary provisions contained in paragraphs (d) and (e).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to correct a point which I myself made. I referred here to the extension of the definition of &#x201C;appearance&#x201D;, and I do not want there to be any ambiguity. In deciding whether or not any person is in appearance obviously a white person, his habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general should be taken into account, but the way in which these factors will be taken into account, is being left to the discretion of the person who does the classification. These factors will help him to form a picture. That is what those words mean. The person who applies for classification or reclassification has to satisfy, jointly, all four requirements which are set out in paragraph (c). If he is ordinarily resident with Coloureds as a Coloured person, he does not qualify; if he is employed or carried on business as a Coloured person, he does not qualify; if he mixes socially or takes part in other activities with other members of the public as a Coloured person, he does not qualify. He cannot be a Coloured person in one area and a white person in another area and then ask to be classified as a white person. In other words, he has to satisfy all those requirements. The hon. member says that I condoned the reclassification of a certain person. but there are thousands more who want to be reclassified. In this Bill we are not depriving any person of the right to be reclassified if he is dissatisfied with his classification. It is still possible for him to apply for condonation. The position remains exactly as it was before.</p>

<p>The Minister has made a strange statement in connection with this clause. In fact, he has made a number of strange statements, but I want to deal with one in particular. That is where he says that the definition remains the same and all that the Government is trying to do by this amendment is to make it a little easier to understand this definition, or to put it into effect in practice. Sir, that is not so. It is correct that the definition remains the same under subsection (1), but the whole object of the proposed amendments in subsection (2) is not merely to enable a court or an official to interpret the clause better, but it in fact makes it more difficult for a person who claims to be white and who claims to associate with Whites and who wishes to be classified as a white person, to be so classified.</p>

<p>Sir, this interjection by the hon. member for Parow shows clearly the attitude of that side of the House. They attempted during the Second Reading debate to lead this House to believe that they were very concerned about the whole question of classification and did not wish to make it hard for anyone; but that they merely wanted all the races in South Africa nicely classified in one box or another. But in the light of this interjection, that is obviously not the case, because the hon. member for Parow asks me what is wrong with prohibiting a person who claims to be white &#x2026;</p>

If they will listen carefully, I will tell them precisely and in very clear language what we on this side mean. We on this side of the House see nothing wrong in <span class="col_3895-3896" refersTo="page_0563"/>classifying as white a person who claims to be white and who is generally accepted as a white person in the community in which he moves.

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, made the following statement at col. 3172. He said the intention of the Legislature at the time was and still is (and I emphasize this) that the classification of a person should be made according to the views held by the members of the community. Their own Minister said this. Now the hon. member for Parow apparently disagrees, because when I made the statement that if a person is generally accepted by the community as white, I see no reason why he should not be classified as white, he raised a hue and cry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Because that is not the only test, and you are not closing any loopholes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>There we have it again&#x2014;closing the loopholes. We pointed out in the Second Reading that the whole intention of these amendments was to make it more difficult, and then hon. members denied it. Now we have it from the mouth, firstly, of the hon. member for Parow and, secondly, from the hon. member for Turffontein. Sir, let me make it quite clear once again. These borderline cases are the ones to be dealt with in terms of these amendments, and they amount to no more than a few hundred. Why, in order to make it more difficult for such persons, should amendments be introduced which are going to be so wide that they will cause a great deal of hardship and injustice to a great many others, not merely to the so-called borderline cases but others also, as will become apparent when we deal with the other clauses of this Bill.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with certain other aspects of clause 1, which is now under discussion. Firstly, I want to deal with the use of information from the census form. I wonder whether the Minister realizes the implications of this clause as it is worded. I would ask him to give serious and careful consideration to the proposition I am about to put to him. I am now dealing with clause 1, the amendment which is being introduced as subsection (1) (d) (ii). This says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In considering whether or not any person is a white person, he shall be deemed also to admit freely and voluntarily and on the ground of facts that he is by descent a Bantu or a coloured person if&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(ii) in any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him, there appears a statement to the effect that as far as his race is concerned, he is not a white person.</li>

</ol>

<p>The words I refer to specifically are &#x201C;there appears a statement&#x201D;. In other words, it is not necessarily a statement which he himself made on that form, as long as there appears a statement in anybody&#x2019;s writing. This is important. It is not far-fetched, because everyone dealing with these census forms will know that there often appears on these forms statements of one sort or another in the handwriting of other people, people other than the person who signs the form. The amendment introduced by the hon. member for Prinshof does not do away with my objection. If he listens to me he might understand why. What he has deleted are the words &#x201C;or his spouse or his guardian in respect of him&#x201D;. But this still leaves the position that on a census form there may appear words which have been inserted by somebody else. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I just want to thank the Minister for accepting the amendments which were requested. It proves that the hon. the Minister is in earnest as regards this Bill and that he is paying as much attention to it as possible in order to make it a good Bill.</p>

<p>I must tell the United Party that what one of the hon. members said a moment ago, was in actual fact amusing, namely that they are glad to see the Minister responding to their agitation. It is almost pathetic to see how a party which is bankrupt, how those hon. members are saying now, after members on this side of the House have set about their task in all earnest and tried to improve this Bill, after this Bill has already been laid upon the Table, that it is as a result of the action they took that the Minister is now effecting changes. I just want to tell them that it is, of course, not so, but if they want to labour under that delusion, they may continue to do so.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to the hon. member for Boland first. He said that if we changed section (d) (ii) in the way it has been agreed to now, we should also change (2) (e) by deleting the words &#x201C;or in respect of him&#x201D;. I must tell the hon. member that it seems to me as though he does not understand the clause very well. This clause does not concern the contents of a form at all. It merely deals with the fixing of a date and does not concern the contents of the form at all. If the hon. member reads it, he will see that it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact that any person was generally accepted as a white person or a coloured person or a Bantu on the date on which the form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 was completed by or in respect of him, shall at all times be conclusive proof that he is so accepted.</block>

<p><span class="col_3897-3898" refersTo="page_0564"/>In other words, this section fixes a date; one has to determine in what way the person concerned was accepted on that specific date when he completed the forms, whether he completed them himself or whether somebody else did so on his behalf. The object of this clause is to fix the date, and it does not concern the contents of the form at all.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to what the hon. member for Musgrave said in regard to the census return. There is absolutely nothing in the census return which is being abused by us. I do not know where the hon. member obtains that information. As the amendment reads at present, (d) (ii) provides that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him &#x2026;</block>

<p>Only such information as was personally completed and signed by him, may be used against him, and there is no mention of third parties who may perhaps have completed his form. The hon. member is making a mistake there. It remains a form which he himself should have completed and signed, and it is not unfair to use that information against him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Then it cannot be used against him as evidence. Those hon. members do not understand the amendment.</p>

<p>It was suggested during the Second Reading and also in the Press that the contents of census returns was absolutely secret, but in this respect we are not divulging the secrets contained in census returns. Let us read the original section 3 of the 1950 Act.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The particulars required for the compilation of the register in respect of the population of the Union as at the fixed date shall be extracted by the Director from the forms and returns received by him under the Census Act, 1910 (Act No. 2 of 1910), in connection with the census taken on the fixed date and from such other records as may be available to the Director.</block>

<p>In other words, for the past 17 years it has been quite clear that the contents of those forms are used for this classification. It was laid down in the Act, but above and beyond that, let us see what the Census Act of 1910 provides. Section 18 provides the following, and I shall read it in English because at that time the Act was drafted in Dutch and because my Dutch is rusty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No entry in any book, register or record made by a census officer or by any other person in the performance of his duties under this Act or the regulations shall be admissible in evidence in any legal proceedings, criminal or civil, except upon a trial for an offence against this Act or the regulations.</block>

<p>Now I just want to tell hon. members that even if it were the case that census returns would be used here, then this is still not a &#x201C;civil proceeding&#x201D;. That this is not a &#x201C;civil proceeding&#x201D;, I shall prove now. In this regard I want to refer them to the case of <i>T.</i> v. <i>Secretary of the Interior,</i> in which Mr. Justice Watermeyer said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before dealing with the facts it is necessary to make certain observations upon the law. I agree with respect with the decision in <i>Lambert</i> v. <i>Director of Census and Another</i> (1956 (3) South African Law Reports 542) that an enquiry conducted by the board is not a list or a lawsuit and that no onus rests upon either party in the sense in which that term is used in ordinary legal proceedings.</block>

<p>In other words, these are not &#x201C;legal proceedings&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timony">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONY</person>:</from>

<p>But the Department uses it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>But these are not legal proceedings, surely, Legal proceedings result when one serves a subpoena on a person and wants to use these forms. Then such a person may say that the information in those forms may not be used because it is against section 18 of the Census Act. But in 1950 it was made quite clear to people that this information was required for their classification. It is being said again here. It is being said here that this information which the person concerned has signed and furnished himself, will be used in his classification. If a person said in that form that he was a coloured person, he cannot change his mind to-day and say that he is a white person. What is wrong with that&#x003F; After all, the person himself said that he was a coloured person. I say that that is quite fair. I want to tell hon. members that they are seeing far too much in clause 1. The definition remains exactly the same. We all grant that. We are <i>ad idem</i> as far as that is concerned. There were court cases in which it was maintained that, as the Act read in 1962, the court first made a note based simply and solely on appearance only. I think hon. members will agree with me as far as that is concerned. However, one of the Judges, Mr. Justice Diemomt, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are other factors which might assist one in coming to a conclusion, such as accent, education and habits, but the definition refers only to appearance and it is, therefore, necessary to come to a decision based purely on observation.</block>

<p>But now hon. members on the other side of the House want to ridicule the words of this honourable Judge.</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. That is so. Now they ask: &#x201C;What does education mean&#x003F;&#x201D; &#x201C;What does accent mean&#x003F;&#x201D; &#x201C;What does habit mean&#x003F;&#x201D; This hon. judge said that if we had taken those things into account, it would have helped us to decide on a correct classification.</p>

<p>The only evidence on which this clause has any bearing, is that evidence which an applicant usually leads when he applies for a classification. When he appears before the Classification Board, he states where he went to school and where he lived, and the Board can, of course, see what he looks like. On those grounds he applies for a classification. This is the evidence to which reference is made in this clause. The effect of that is that, whereas previously a judge only assessed an applicant visually&#x2014;he did not ask him where he came from or about his environment, his habits or things of that nature, but merely looked at the person in question and decided whether he was a white, non-white or Coloured person on the strength of what he had seen&#x2014;the position at present is exactly the opposite. In future, when a case is tried by a judge, there will be no need for him to make a visual assessment only, but he will have to take these other factors into account first&#x2014;in other words, only at the end of the court case the judge will say whether the person before him is Coloured, white or non-white in appearance. At that stage he will have taken all factors into account, as it ought to be. Only then does he arrive at a final finding which tallies with his final classification. Surely, Mr. Chairman, this is logical. I repeat that hon. members are seeing much more in this clause than it actually embraces. All that happens here, is that the same evidence is submitted, with this difference that the judge does not give a ruling on the appearance of a person at the beginning of a court case, but at the end of it.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Prinshof on the fact that the Minister accepted his amendment, particularly as far as the latter part of it is concerned. To my mind it is a great improvement. But as far as the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is concerned, I think that the hon. member did not take into account everything that had been taken into account in paragraph (a). In terms of paragraph (a), if there is any doubt about whether a person is a white or a Coloured person, his habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general are also taken into account. Now the hon. member asks for the following words to be added at the end of paragraph (b): &#x201C;except where such person is in appearance obviously a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa&#x201D;. Therefore a person&#x2019;s habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general are not being taken into account here. I want to tell the hon. member about an experience I had in the Transvaal a few years ago. I agree with the hon. the Minister that over the past few years experience has shown that there is a great deal of alarm amongst large sections of the Coloured population at the fact that people who are obviously members of other race groups, are being classified as Coloured persons. But I want to remind the hon. the Minister that this amendment does not offer a solution to that problem. The reason is that when the different sub-groups were established, Griqua and Malay groups were introduced in addition to the existing white, Coloured and Bantu groups. It is because of the Malay group that Indians have become Coloureds, and it is because of the Griqua group that Bantu have become Coloureds. It does not really fall under this clause, but these are two absurdities which I shall discuss under clause 2 and then I shall give a clear indication of how wrong they are. In 1964 two cases were brought to my notice and after I had gone into them, I found that there were many more such cases. I want to mention one example to the House. With the battle of Vegkop, when the Voortrekkers marched upon Moselekatse and drove him out of his capital, it inevitably happened&#x2014;from the nature of the operation which was carried out there and of which there are still many other examples &#x2014;that in such a large city there were small children who could not get away. The Voortrekkers did not kill those children, but took them along and subsequently they grew up among the Whites on their farms. In Pretoria I had the case of a person who was a Black man in every respect&#x2014;a big, well-built black man&#x2014;who brought his wife, a Coloured woman, along when he approached me; allegedly it has been proved that she was the granddaughter of one of the earlier presidents of one of the Republics. But she was obviously a Coloured woman. As far as appearance was concerned, the man was a Bantu through and through. However, I was astonished when the man spoke to me, because he spoke Afrikaans like an Afrikaans-speaking person, like a Coloured person. I asked him a few questions. He said that he came from Pilgrim&#x2019;s Rest and he referred to the Bantu as &#x201C;kaffirs&#x201D;. When I asked him how it was that he referred to the Bantu as &#x201C;Kaffirs&#x201D; and what nationality he was, he said that his father had been one of the old slaves. That was a new thing to me and therefore I asked him what he meant by the old slaves. He replied that the old slaves had been those Bantu who had grown up amongst the farmers and who had acquired the language and habits of the Whites and had lived like them. This man could not speak a single word of any Bantu language&#x2014;only Afrikaans. In terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, this man has to be classified as a Bantu. His difficulty was that he was living in the large Bantu township of Pretoria and that his children had to be escorted by a constable from their home to the station and back. Despite the fact that he has been classified as a Bantu, the Bantu do not want to accept <span class="col_3901-3902" refersTo="page_0566"/>him and his wife and his children, because he does not comply with their standards and does not have their way of life. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will agree to the same concession being made here &#x2014;namely that a person&#x2019;s habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general should also be taken into account&#x2014; by making this provision read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; except where such person is in appearance, habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general duly taken into account, obviously a member of an aboriginal race or tribe of Africa.</block>

<p>While the Minister has made that concession where there may be borderline cases between White or Coloured&#x2014;as the judge rightly alleged and as was quoted here by the hon. member for Prinshof&#x2014;I am asking the Minister to take into account those considerations as well when it comes to a case where a person may appear to be a Bantu, but has in actual fact been rejected by the Bantu community or is not being accepted by them, and where it is being made impossible for him to live amongst them because he has no ties with them.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof said that it was not necessary to have an amendment in line 50, as suggested by the hon. member for Boland. Of course he is quite wrong, because his argument was that this particular paragraph only fixed the time. But of course that is quite wrong, because the intention of the measure is quite clear. It says:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The fact that any person was generally accepted as a white person or Coloured person or a Bantu on the date on which the form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 was completed by or in respect of him&#x201D;.</block>

<p>[Interjection.] Yes, that has at all times been so. That is correct. This does not only refer to the 1951 census. It refers also to the details given under section 9 of the Act. [Interjection.] I think the hon. member must listen to me for a moment. Section 9 makes it obligatory for persons to furnish information in respect of their wards of under 16 years of age. That is a thing that goes on and on and on. Now, how is this person going to be held responsible in one case for information furnished by another person and not in another identical case&#x003F; The hon. member cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p>That has to be put right, and I intend to move: On page 1, line 50, to omit the words &#x201C;or in respect of&#x201D;. I want to go further. Subsection (3) reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Where in any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 the race of any person is described as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; or &#x201C;gemeng&#x201D;, that description shall for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) of this section be deemed to be a reference to a Coloured person.</block>

<p>There has to be an amendment here, too, if the hon. the Minister has accepted the first amendment. It has to come in line 50 and also here. As a result, I am going to move: &#x201C;On page 4, in line 1, after &#x2018;return&#x2019;, to insert the words &#x2018;completed by the person concerned and&#x2019; &#x201D;. In other words, let him be responsible for his own destiny. Because in terms of this subsection (3) somebody else can state that this man is a Coloured person and he will, in fact, be deemed to be a Coloured person. In other words, his destiny under sections 3 and 9 can be determined by some other person. These two amendments which I have now suggested are consequential amendments. The hon. the Minister cannot escape it. He has to accept them. He has no option.</p>

<p>There is another question that I want to deal with here. That is the question of the census. The hon. member for Prinshof seems to have forgotten the assurance given to people when a census is compiled. The 1951 census, which is referred to in section 3 of the Act, in particular, is an example. It says:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Information about any individual (this was on the form which the people completed) will not be divulged to any unauthorised person, nor will any Government Department or private person have access to any of the census forms, since these particulars are used solely for statistical purposes.</block>

<p>I accept that the hon. member has brought forward other argument. The other argument is that under section 17 of the Census Act, this can be used by the Board, but it is not admissible as evidence. It has been ruled out already. So it will be in the future. But are people going to be classified on evidence, first of all which is not admissible in a court of law except in a criminal case, where it has to be divulged&#x003F; If this information is going to be used, surely these people must be told on the census forms from now onwards, because we have in our minds a little thought that an instruction was issued to the people who took a census recently that they must make a particular note of what these people look like, on these forms they have to fill in. They had to decide whether they look white or Coloured, whether they associated with Coloured people, whether there were Coloured people running around there. These are facts. But is that put on the form&#x003F; Of course it is not. We must remember that this applies also to reclassification. In a future census a person who is now white, has the information put on the census form by the enumerator. He signs it or someone else does so on his behalf. If these amendments are not accepted, hon. members have to accept that he can find himself coming under the attention of the Secretary, and the Secretary, under a later clause, has the power to either reclassify this <span class="col_3903-3904" refersTo="page_0567"/>man or refer his case to the Reclassification Board. Immediately he loses all the advantages of being white, because my honourable Leader said at the Second Reading that the effect of this Bill is going to be to move people from the white group to the Coloured group. Now we must remember this. The tide is not going to flow the other way.</p>

<p>So, in our discussions, I am taking this particular aspect into consideration, namely that people who are now white, can by a census or by information given by a guardian, not only be classified as Coloured, but they can also be reclassified from the white group to the Coloured group. What happens to the children&#x003F; This is a point that has just been raised here, what happens when they are reclassified&#x003F; Now that the aspect of the census has been brought in here you may have the admission made therein that either of his natural parents is, or was not generally accepted as a white person. Hon. members must remember that on the question of descent, the previous Minister of the Interior gave us the assurance, and I want to ask this hon. Minister whether he is going to give it to us here. He said in respect of the 1962 amendment: &#x201C;I want to give the assurance that the descent of Whites will not be investigated as a result of this power now being given to the Secretary to investigate, because descent is not a decisive factor in race classification&#x201D;. He went on &#x201C;If we were to do that, we will put many people who, for many generations perhaps, have passed as Whites in a difficult position&#x201D;. I hope the hon. the Minister is listening. If he does this, according to his own colleague, his predecessor in this office, this is what he is going to do and I am going to repeat: &#x201C;If we were to do that, we would put many people, who for many generations perhaps, have passed as Whites, in a difficult position&#x201D;. He gave the undertaking that this would not happen and he confined the use of this power to one class of persons only: The person who had admitted that he was not white. He had in mind the case of Song who stood up in the witness box and said: &#x201C;I am a Chinaman. My parents were Chinese. I accept it. But the advantages of being white are so great, I want to be classified as white.&#x201D; And he was classified as a white man.</p>

<p>Of course it was not easy. But the point was that he was in fact classified as a white person. But now, the hon. Minister, backed by the hon. member over there, is introducing factors over which they are going to have no control and which can only work in one way. They can only reduce white people to Coloureds. That is all they can do. They can only bring them down, because the people affected here are white people. The previous Minister of the Interior, this hon. Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, made that quite clear in his speech in 1962. So I want to make this point quite clearly, and I move my two amendments&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 50, to omit &#x201C;or in respect of&#x201D;; and in line 1, page 4, after &#x201C;return&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;completed by the person concerned and&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, regarding the question of the census which the hon. member for Umlazi and other hon. members raised here, I think they have it all wrong. The form referred to in clause 3 of the Bill is only one specific form, namely the census form of 1951 and no other census form.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The impression that the hon. members wanted to create here, and what the hon. member for Umlazi has just said, is that if in future a person said in a census form that he was a Coloured whereas in the past he had said in other census forms that he was white, then he would be classified as a Coloured. That is utter nonsense. I just want to repeat it again quite clearly for the edification of the hon. member and also for the edification of the hon. member for Rosettenville, who understands nothing about this matter. Hon. members on the opposite side try to create the impression that a reference to &#x201C;a form&#x201D; in terms of clause 3 means any census form of any census, for example a census of 1960. That is the point I want to make. Hon. members on the opposite side would suggest that it is any census, any census of the past and of the future. That is not correct. It applies specifically and exclusively to the census of 1951. Does the hon. member for Umlazi understand it now&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Let me explain it further to the hon. member for Umlazi. They say it is dishonourable and unethical to use information contained in a census form for the purposes of race classification. We have to bear in mind that the Population Registration Act was passed and promulgated in 1950. The census on which this Population Register was based was taken in 1951. In 1950, a year before the census, everybody was told, over the radio and in all possible ways, that the census information of 1951 would provide the data for the compilation of the population register. Now hon. members come along afterwards and try to create the impression that we swindled the people. They say that under the protection of the Census Act we asked the people for confidential information but afterwards went and classified them in accordance with that information. That is not the case. In 1950 this Act was promulgated, and a year beforehand, a year before 1951, everybody, the whole world, every person was told that <span class="col_3905-3906" refersTo="page_0568"/>the information furnished in the census would form the basis for race classification. If a person knew a year before the time that the information he would furnish in the 1951 census would determine on what register he would be put, why may it not be taken into consideration to-day&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It was confidential.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>How can it be confidential&#x003F; The hon. member for Wynberg is like a parrot&#x2014;she can only say certain words. I hope hon. members on the opposite side will in future be somewhat more careful when they try to sell this argument.</p>

<p>What did the hon. member for Umlazi say here&#x003F; He talked about &#x201C;any future census&#x201D;. How could he say such a stupid thing&#x003F; It does not relate to &#x201C;any future census&#x201D;. It merely relates to the information furnished in the 1951 census. I therefore hope hon. members will now leave this old census story at that.</p>

<p>Then the hon. members for Umlazi and Musgrave&#x2014;people who come from Natal and who know virtually nothing about this reclassification and its concomitant problems, which we have to deal with here&#x2014;tried to tell us about the problem we are facing here. The hon. member for Outeniqua is an example to them. They tried to poke fun at the fact that in terms of the new subsection 2 (a) of the Act habits, education, speech and deportment and demeanour in general shall be taken into account when deciding about a man&#x2019;s appearance. It is not all that ridiculous. It is not all that ridiculous to the hon. member for Outeniqua, who knows about these cases. Nor should it be all that ridiculous to the hon. member for Green Point, if only he would not be mischievous. It should not be ridiculous to the hon. member for Wynberg either, if only she would not be stupid. They know that that is the case. They know that by taking into account a person&#x2019;s habits, speech and actions a picture is formed when his appearance is decided on in order to ascertain whether he is white or non-white. [Interjection.] I do not expect the hon. member for Rosettenville to know anything about this. I want to call the hon. member for Outeniqua as my witness. The hon. member wants to go further than the National Party. Because the hon. member knows what he is talking about, he wants us to extend the Act and to insert these sentences in other sections as well. It is no use for the hon. members for Natal, who know nothing about this problem, to try to be very clever and very legal here.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Musgrave also advanced an argument. What the hon. member actually said&#x2014;I should like the United Party and its leader to listen to this&#x2014;is that the United Party is prepared to accept as a White any person who &#x201C;claims to be White&#x201D;. [Interjections.] No, wait, I have not finished &#x2014;hon. members should not be so sensitive.</p>

<p>That is what the hon. member&#x2019;s argument means in effect. The hon. member for Musgrave added a tail to it, and I want to step on that tail as well&#x2014;then it will be even more sensitive. The hon. member for Musgrave added this tail to it: &#x201C;Provided that such a person is generally accepted in the neighbourhood in which he lives.&#x201D; But does the hon. member for Musgrave know the circumstances prevailing here in the Peninsula, where we have virtually 99 per cent of these cases&#x003F; Has he paid a visit to parts of the Peninsula where there are still mixed residential areas, after the National Party has done a great deal to clear up certain mixed areas&#x003F; Even to-day there are still residential areas where one may go from house to house without knowing who lives here or there. All the hon. member for Musgrave now wants is that one Coloured should come along and say that his neighbour &#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course, he wants to do that. The hon. member said quite clearly that it should only be necessary for him to be accepted as a White in the neighbourhood in which he lives. Did the hon. member not say that&#x003F; He said: &#x201C;He must be generally accepted in the community in which he lives.&#x201D; If that is to be the case, the hon. member may just as well tell us that any person in the Peninsula who derives from certain areas should be classified as White. I do not want to mention names, but I may tell the hon. member that these areas are sometimes situated on the perimeter of select residential areas. One finds such areas in Newlands, in Rondebosch, in Mowbray and in Observatory. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parow is quite right, of course, when he says that it is only the 1951 census that applies to this amending Bill. Nevertheless, this does not in any way override the objection to the use of that particular census for the purpose of classification, firstly for the reason already advanced from this side of the House and that is that the original undertaking was that information collected in the census would be used for statistical purposes only and, secondly, due to the fact that it was admitted in this House in 1962 when the previous amending Bill was before the House, that a great deal of inaccurate information was furnished in the 1951 census, and therefore his point is quite irrelevant in that respect. The Minister, in giving the House the reasons in 1962 as to why certain investigations will have to be conducted into classifications based on information given in the 1951 census, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is regarded as essential because of the inaccurate information contained in the census forms of 1951 in regard to citizenship, births, marriages, racial descriptions, etc.</block>

<p><span class="col_3907-3908" refersTo="page_0569"/>That was one of the reasons which the hon. the Minister advanced. He went further in 1962 and this is what he said in referring to the provision which allows an investigation into the accuracy or otherwise of the description of the person according to the 1951 census&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This provision is intended to prevent a person, from ignorance or for other reasons &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, he was even admitting the possibility of <i>mala fides</i> &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; admitting that he is a Native or a Coloured, thereby causing distress to innocent persons and relatives from pure selfishness.</block>

<p>These were the reasons advanced in 1962 as to why the 1951 census was inaccurate, and no argument has been advanced in this debate to nullify the very good reasons given by the Minister in 1962 for not relying on the 1951 census.</p>

<p>May I reply to one or two points made by the hon. member for Prinshof&#x003F; Significantly enough, when he was speaking about the use of demeanour and education and speech and all these other criteria which are now being validated, having been declared invalid&#x2014;although having been previously used by the board the courts threw them out as being invalid&#x2014;he used the argument that it was just as well because he said that Judge Diemont in giving judgment had stated that it was very difficult just from appearance only, from the visual impression that one gained, to decide whether a person is Coloured or not. Sir, the hon. member keeps on referring to the Judge&#x2019;s decision, but in the first instance it is not going to be a Judge at all who is going to make this decision; it is going to be the board.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It makes a lot of difference. If the hon. member had read the whole of Judge Diemont&#x2019;s judgment, he would have seen that Judge Diemont had some very derogatory things to say about the way in which officials utilized their powers under the existing Act, let alone how they are going to be able to utilize their powers under this amending Bill which is going to widen their discretion enormously. It is going to widen the discretion of the officials in all those cases which fall outside the easy definition of descent, as introduced by a later clause. Sir, it is impossible to discuss one clause in this Bill without referring to the later clauses because they are all closely interwoven. All those persons who do not clearly fall under the descent clause, that is, where both parents have been classified as White or where both parents have been classified as Bantu belonging to the same ethnic group or where both parents have been classified as Coloured&#x2014;everybody who falls outside that broad general category&#x2014;will now fall under this definition. That is correct, is it not&#x003F; It will be the officials who, as Judge Diemont said, very often act not only incorrectly but in an extremely unfortunate manner towards the people who come up before them, who will now be able to use this wide definition. Everybody outside this straight category of descent, where there is no difficulty in solving the equation that I talked about in the Second Reading debate, everybody who is in danger of being reclassified&#x2014;because this obviously applies to all the border-line cases where there is no clear-cut decision&#x2014;will find that these new criteria are applied to him. These new criteria also apply to all children whose immigrant parents have not been classified; they apply to all illegitimate children where one parent is unknown. All these people now fall into this category and these new criteria with their wide ramifications are now going to be applied to these people. I think this clause does in fact make us look ridiculous in the country. I cannot see any justification for retaining this clause as it is and I am certainly going to vote against it. I think the hon. the Minister has improved it slightly by the amendments that he has introduced, and I think the hon. member for Prinshof has also improved it slightly, but nevertheless they have not removed the broad objections to this clause, which is very important indeed because it covers all the border-line cases; all the reclassifications that are going to take place will fall under these broad criteria which, if read in cold, stark daylight, simply make South Africa ridiculous.</p>

<p>It does not follow that simply because a person is educated he must be White, and it does not follow that because a person is not educated he must be Coloured. Under this definition clause, with its added criteria, demeanour is going to mean one thing in one case and a different thing in another case. Sir, you could not, judging by demeanour, tell an educated Coloured man from an educated white man. You could not tell whether a person is White or Coloured just from his way of life. There are people who are Coloured who live on a higher standard than white people. [Interjection.] Sir, the criteria apply in every single case where it is not a clear-cut case of descent, it applies in every case where the parents of people have not both been classified in the same race group. These new criteria apply to all the reclassifications, and I am very worried about the retrospective aspect of this Bill. In later clauses amendments are going to be moved in an attempt to remove this retrospectivity. The hon. the Minister has given an assurance that there are not going to be reclassifications. If there are reclassifications, all the new definitions, in terms of these criteria which are now being validated, are going to have to apply. I cannot see how the hon. the <span class="col_3909-3910" refersTo="page_0570"/>Minister can say that there are not going to be reclassifications when it is encumbent upon the secretary to keep a correct register. If anybody comes along and says that A has been incorrectly classified, whether the hon. the Minister wishes it or not, there has to be a reinvestigation and that reinvestigation will take place not in terms of the existing criteria but in terms of the new criteria which are being introduced by the amendments in the definition clause. Therefore this is a terribly important clause, and for all the reasons I have advanced I intend voting against it.</p>

<p>Normally one would not reply to the argument of the hon. member for Houghton when she speaks on legislation of this nature, because her attitude is well known. But for one reason I cannot let her speech pass without comment. That is that a grave allegation has been made here. It is an allegation which immediately casts suspicion on officials who are appointed by this Government in terms of a specific act, to the effect that they will commit all kinds of atrocities just to prejudice people. [Interjection.] The hon. member says I should read Mr. Justice Diemont&#x2019;s judgment in that connection, but allow me to say for the information of the hon. member for Houghton why Mr. Justice Diemont could say those things. Mr. Justice Diemont could say that because in classifying persons all possible means are applied to ensure that a person receives the most equitable hearing possible, if he is in the unfortunate position of having to apply for reclassification.</p>

<p>It is taken to the point of making a verbatim tape-recording of the proceedings. And when this is played before a Judge, he can listen to every word in order that he may give a ruling on the basis of that evidence and on the basis of the examination by the members of the board. In view of the fact that the arrangements for a person attending a hearing are so equitable, that he is afforded that protection, that the onus is placed on every member of the board to render account for every word he says and every question asked by him, if he knows that those things may go to the Supreme Court on appeal, and that there is the possibility that a Judge may criticize the actions of the members of the board, I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton: Where could you get more protection for any person who applies for race classification&#x003F; In view of the fact that the Minister has envisaged the appointment of such a board, I object to the fact that this kind of thing should be said continually, not only by the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014; though particularly by her&#x2014;but also by other hon. members, by implication and directly, so that suspicion is cast immediately on the integrity and <i>bona fides</i> of people appointed to such a board to do this work in the interests of our country and in the interests of the various population groups. I know that there are cases where people make mistakes, but from members of this House I have heard irresponsible statements which had the most direct bearing on South Africa&#x2019;s interests, and I think as far as that is concerned the hon. member for Houghton should search her own heart before casting stones at officials.</p>

<p>I have the courage to say everything I have to say. The hon. member should just tell me what she expects me to say. I shall repeat to her what I meant. If she says things about officials, by implication, that they are guilty of dishonesty or <i>mala fides,</i> and if she drags in Mr. Justice Diemont&#x2019;s judgment to cast suspicion on all officials, then I say the hon. member for Houghton has done more harm to the peace of the population in South Africa than any official could possibly have done.</p>

<p>But I also want to read to the hon. member for Houghton the essence of what Mr. Justice Diemont said in his judgment, to which she did not want to listen a moment ago when the hon. member for Prinshof wanted to read it. She gave the impression that this clause, which is merely an extension of the old section, was meant to lay all possible obstacles in the way of the correct classification of people. Now I want to make this distinction between the hon. member for Houghton and some other Opposition members&#x2014;there are also some exceptions. I want to say that as far as this part of the House is concerned, and for my part, we feel that every member of the population should be classified as equitably as possible into his correct group. That is the difference in premise. Hon. members want the wishes of every particular person to be met as far as possible, whether right or wrong. In order to be able to do that correctly, the Supreme Court delivered a judgment calling upon this House for more clarity in the legislation. It has already been read, but it appears to me as though it is necessary to read it once again. Mr. Justice Diemont said, when those people appeared before him and when he had before him the 1962 Act, to which there are several references and of which the first two clauses are still retained&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In deciding whether the person concerned &#x201C;obviously is a white person&#x201D; or &#x201C;is not in appearance obviously a white person&#x201D;, the Legislature must have intended &#x201C;obvious to the person who sees them&#x201D;, and it therefore involves a visual decision by the trier of fact &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then he also quotes other cases&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and accordingly, as this court has independently to inquire into the matter, it involves in my view this court coming to a finding on the appearance of the present applicants.</block>

<p><span class="col_3911-3912" refersTo="page_0571"/>That is what the Judge had before him, and he gave his judgment. He said that he was in the strongest doubt because&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In these matters much will depend on the environment and dress of the person concerned. If the applicant in this case were to appear in a waiter&#x2019;s uniform in the company of a number of non-European waiters, he would pass as a Coloured. If, however, he stood appropriately dressed in a queue at a diplomatic reception, no one would doubt that he was a representative of some Mediterranean country.</block>

<p>And then, with a view to making a correct finding, Mr. Justice Diemont said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are other factors which might assist one in coming to a conclusion, such as action, education and habits, but the definition refers only to appearance and it is therefore necessary to come to a decision based purely on observation. In the task of the appellant I find this a difficult and invidious task. In the case of the applicant&#x2019;s wife and six children, the task is less onerous.</block>

<p>Now I ask, if the court, in the words of Mr. Justice Diemont&#x2014;the same man who, faithful to the traditions of our judicature, had the honesty to criticize people who had acted incorrectly&#x2014;asks the legislature: &#x201C;I think there is a deficiency in the Act, and I suggest that these are things which you may do to make it easier for one to decide correctly,&#x201D; what right has the hon. member for Houghton to say that she is going to vote against the Bill because it is dead wrong&#x003F; Does she think I nearly caught my death of fright when she said that&#x003F; Sir, I think it is a recommendation for the Bill that the hon. member for Houghton votes against it.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that the hon. member for Witbank seems to believe that it is possible to do what scientists and judges have said is impossible, that is, to define on any scientific basis the dividing lines between the races and particularly between the Coloureds and the white people. The very fact that we are discussing this Bill in such detail at the present moment is because whatever definition we enact it must of necessity be an arbitrary definition which we as a legislature think is the most suitable. There is no scientific basis for what we are discussing here to-day as the hon. member for Witbank would suggest. I want to come back to what the hon. the Minister said and I hope that I followed him correctly. I understood him to say that the definition of 1962 stands. What clause 1 sets out to do is to give guidance and more clarity in regard to factors that must be taken into consideration in applying the 1962 definition. I hope I have understood the hon. the Minister correctly. He indicates that that is correct. I want to ask him then, and we have had several amendments suggested including two by the hon. member for Prinshof to this particular clause, whether this clause as it stands will in fact achieve what the Minister wants it to achieve because if we examine it we will find that it says what must be done in a classification. That classification might be done by the Secretary, the official initially classifying, by a Minister under review, by the Race Classification Appeal Board or by the Supreme Court on ultimate appeal. If we look at the new section 1 (2) (a) there is mention of habits, education, etc. It is not that those are factors which may be taken into consideration or that they are matters which can be considered by the deciding body or person, but each and every one of those factors shall be taken into account. In other words, as the clause stands a deciding body or person must inquire into habits, education, speech, deportment and demeanour. Now let us look at the new section 1 (2) (b) which states:</p>

<block name="quote">It shall in the absence of proof &#x2026; be assumed &#x2026;</block>

<p>There is no question that it is a guiding principle or something which may be taken into consideration; it is a fixed assumption which must be accepted by the person applying this definition to a particular individual. If we go to paragraph (c) and inquire what is meant by &#x201C;generally accepted&#x201D; we read the following: &#x201C;A person shall be deemed not to be generally accepted &#x2026; unless he is so accepted&#x201D; under four categories. There are no &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; or &#x201C;ands&#x201D; or &#x201C;ors&#x201D; or that they shall be taken into consideration. It is obligatory that he must be accepted where he is ordinarily resident, where he is employed or carries on business, where he mixes socially or takes part in other activities with other members of the public, and in his association with the members of his own family. A man may be white in all other categories under this definition. He can conform with and meet every test but if he happens to have somebody in his family circle who is classified as a Coloured person and he associates with that person in any form whatsoever, he loses his right to remain classified as a white person, whether it is father and child, child and parent, or brother and brother, because the hon. member for Parow and the other hon. members know that marriage is permitted between persons under a different definition to the definition which applies in the case of a population register. A man and wife can be married legally according to the laws of this country. They can be accepted and recognized in our churches and have lawful offspring, but because one of those people, under this definition, is a Coloured person, that child becomes Coloured and the one parent can no longer have anything to do with the child.</p>

<p>Let us go on to paragraph (d); we find the same position there. It states: &#x201C;He shall be deemed also to admit freely&#x201D;. There is no question about it. Then we come to paragraph (e). There the assumptions and the deductions <span class="col_3913-3914" refersTo="page_0572"/>shall be &#x201C;conclusive proof&#x201D; at all times. I want to say that the hon. the Minister did, in contra-distinction to the hon. member for Prinshof, concede to the House that he had introduced an amendment because of the strong feelings which were expressed by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. member for. Prinshof has not been as gracious as that in telling us why he has moved an amendment. I want to say to the Minister with the utmost sincerity that the clause as it is before us now does not meet the very need which he detailed to us a little while ago. This clause is not necessary. I should like to conclude by referring to an extract from a judgment of Mr. Justice Watermeyer in dealing with this particular question of classification. Mr. Justice Watermeyer said:</p>

<block name="quote">The initial classification of persons by the Secretary from the forms and returns received by him under the Census Act and from other records available to him is an administrative act performed without full inquiry. When an objection is lodged under section 11 (1) it is not the function of the Secretary to investigate the soundness or otherwise of it. He is required by section 11 (3) to refer the objection to the Board for decision and then for the first time the proper inquiry starts. The fact that the Commissions Act of 1947 is made applicable to the Board by section 11 (5) emphasizes that the function of the Board is to inquire into the issue raised by the objection.</block>

<p>He then proceeds to say:</p>

<block name="quote">It seems to me that if insufficient evidence is led and the Board is left in doubt as to how to classify an individual it should itself call evidence in order to resolve that doubt. I find myself in respectful agreement also with the decision of M and others versus the Race Classification Board, another decision that where the Board is faced with a decision between two conflicting contentions it must make the decision on the balance of probabilities.</block>

<p>That is under the definition as we have it now. That is the manner in which the courts are functioning to avoid injustices and hardships through being tied hand and foot by directives as to how they should try to apply this dividing line between the Coloureds and the white people. I do not think that the Minister can say that the decisions which have been taken by the Board&#x2014;108 reclassifications in the last year&#x2014;have constituted a miscarriage of justice because those classifications are under the definition as it stands. I want to appeal to the Minister again to reconsider this particular clause, even to the extent of letting it stand over and go back to his legal advisers, because I say with conviction that it does not meet the objective at which the Minister himself aims, that is, merely to give guiding principles for the Board.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, perhaps I should begin with the last speaker. I cannot take it amiss of the hon. member for Green Point when he states that the entire clause in itself, as it stands, is unacceptable to the United Party. We do not regard the matter in the same light on both sides, and perhaps we do not have the same intentions. It has been our experience in the past that we have had varying interpretations of this definition from the courts, from boards and from officials. In paragraph (a) we state that the customs, education, speech and general demeanour must be taken into consideration. The purpose of the remainder of the clause is to clarify our intentions and our aims in regard to the interpretation of what we want done for those people who have to work with this legislation and administer it. I am convinced that there will now be far less doubt in regard to what has to be done. Take paragraph (c) for example, about which it has been said that it would create terrible problems. As I said in my Second Reading speech, this Bill is intended to make it more difficult for this creeping integration to continue. Now the hon. member for Green Point comes along and says that judges have given different interpretations to the Act and that they were correct in doing so because the Act has not been stated clearly. When we found that the implementation of the Act did not comply with our intentions, the only mode of action open to us was to state our intentions more clearly. Of course we are making it more difficult for members of one race group to cross over to another race group. Whether the United Party likes it or not, or whether or not it protests against the removal of what they call this &#x201C;fine flow which is a strengthening factor for the white group&#x201D;, makes no difference to me. The intention is to put a stop to it and to make it more difficult for members of one race group to cross over to another race group. But while we want to make this process more difficult, a process which has already caused much hardship and will continue to do so, we want to do it as fairly as possible. The hon. member for Houghton has alleged that a continual reclassification will now take place and referred to what the Minister was alleged to have said in 1962, i.e. that there would be no witch-hunt. But nothing like that was contained in the 1962 Act. Nothing was said about it in the Act. But let me say that hon. members of this House, including members of the Opposition, have expressed their thanks for the way in which the 1950 Act has been implemented, even after the amendment of 1962. However, the hon. member for Houghton is now saying that because there is nothing in the Bill to prohibit such a witch hunt, we are now going to start a witch-hunt of this nature. But surely it is not our intention to create more problems. After 1962 people did have an opportunity of making application to the Secretary for a reclassification, or of appealing against their classification, or of asking for their classification to <span class="col_3915-3916" refersTo="page_0573"/>be revised. If they did not comply with the time limit imposed in Section 11 (3), they could, under certain circumstances, have come to the Minister for condonation. What happened then is that the Secretary goes into the case of a person asking for reclassification to see whether reclassification is justified or not. Here I want to tell the hon. member for Green Point that the Minister himself never undertakes classification. All that the Minister does is to use his discretion whether or not to allow condonation in the case of people who have not complied with the prescribed time limit in regard to applications for reclassification. All that the Minister does is to take the circumstances of a case like that into consideration and exercise his discretion.</p>

<p>In this niece of legislation now before us we are going even further. We are going out of our way to refrain from depriving people of those opportunities. Let me also tell the hon. member that there are in fact going to be applications for reclassifications. Anybody may still go to the Secretary and ask for reclassification under Section 5 (4). If the Secretary deems any such application to be a difficult one, he can refer it to the Board, that is to say if he does not want to undertake a reclassification himself. At any rate the Secretary can reconsider the case of such a person.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member is too stupid to understand the Act. If the Secretary classifies a person and that person is satisfied with his classification, then his classification is of course complete. If that person, on the contrary, is dissatisfied with his classification, then I cannot say at what stage it will be finalized because I cannot say how long it will take before the long procedure, which we are allowing him out of decency to prove the contrary, will come to an end. But the hon. member for Houghton made a good and a valid point. She said that the former Minister had admitted in 1962&#x2014;and that I am also doing so now&#x2014;that the census form of 1951 may contain unreliable information. That is so. But we have said that information acquired in that way, information which we need in regard to classification, will be used by us. Surely one is leaving the door open for a person to come and say that the information on which his classification is based is incorrect. This legislation provides specifically that information on the census form, information which is necessary in regard to classification, will only be taken into account when that information has been furnished by the person in question himself and filled in on the form. I want to say here that most errors are those made by census takers and not by those people who have filled the forms in themselves. It is, in any case, very unnatural for a person who is a white person to state in his census form that he is a Bantu, for example or vice versa.</p>

<p>You can do it for spiteful reasons to other people but if you do that then it won&#x2019;t count against you in terms of this Bill because only that information which you have given or written down yourself and which appears under your signature will be taken into account. As a matter of fact, I think that we are getting more clarity now. Because the person who filled in the form, must have filled it in himself or must have supplied the information himself and must have signed the form himself as correct. If a person has himself given wrong information, the only conclusion I can come to is that he was spiteful towards himself. If he wants to be spiteful towards himself, nobody else can help him. Therefore I think that is really a hypothetical question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi moved two amendments, but I am very sorry to say that I cannot accept either one of them. The hon. member does not realize that if I were to accept his amendment to clause 1 and were to introduce the proposed words there, it would mean nothing. The new paragraph (d) (ii) of the new subsection (2) would then read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him, there appears a statement to the effect that as far as his race is concerned, he is not a white person &#x2026;</block>

<p>As I have said, that means nothing and I cannot therefore add those words. It is the person in question who has to do so, and it is the same kind of argument I have just dealt with. This amendment does not improve the measure at all. The second amendment I find equally impossible to accept, i.e. the one dealing with the date. The provision in question, paragraph (e) of the new subsection (2), inserted by clause 1. The hon. member states that there should be a day on which the man&#x2019;s classification begins. If there is no date it cannot be done. How is the date to be determined&#x003F; The date is that on which the form has been completed, either by himself or by somebody <span class="col_3917-3918" refersTo="page_0574"/>else on his behalf. However, his classification will not be according to the contents of that form, but only with effect from the date on the form. If we were, for example, to insert there the words &#x201C;unless he himself has signed it&#x201D;, or the words proposed by the hon. member, then there are going to be thousands of people in respect of whom there is no date because they did not themselves fill in the form but had somebody else fill it in for them. Then the position would be simply impossible. That is why I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. I think that as far as this clause is concerned, we have debated and discussed it to such an extent that I do not know what objections that side has which I can accommodate. The basic reason for this situation is, in my opinion, because we do not view the matter in the same light. Therefore I adhere to what I have said.</p>

<p>The Minister has referred to the census form. I hope that the Minister will listen to me because I consider this an important aspect and I do not believe that he has grasped the precise point that I am making. I accept that the amendment provides that the form must be completed and signed by the person concerned. But the point that I make is that it often happens that somebody completes a form himself and he signs it but he may leave certain parts of the form incomplete, and somebody else may complete the incomplete portions.

<p>The form must be completed. He may complete every section but one. Does the Minister suggest that in that event the court would hold that it has not been completed by him&#x003F; I am reminded that, in any event, his signature to the form is his completion of the form. That is the position in law. The point which I made and which has not been met by the Minister&#x2014;he is treating this in a very light-hearted fashion &#x2014;is that this has created a lot of injustice and a lot of heart-sore because in the past the forms have been completed&#x2014;particularly the 1951 forms which the hon. member for Parow referred to&#x2014;in the main by the persons concerned, but afterwards it was seen that certain sections were not filled in and somebody else filled those in. Once again I want to point out that this can happen, even under the clause as it is proposed to be amended. I hope that the Minister will consider at least changing this to read that this will apply only to statements which appear on the form in the person&#x2019;s own handwriting. At least that will cover the position.</p>

<p>One further point that I make in regard to the census form is this. Surely in matters of this kind the opportunity should be given to the person signing the form to prove that in fact the information is incorrect. As it reads now, provided the form has been completed and signed&#x2014;in the sense which I indicated&#x2014; this is deemed to be correct and that is the end of the matter. I would point out that the <span class="col_3919-3920" refersTo="page_0575"/>Minister has accepted an amendment to subsection (3) which will now read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where in any form or return &#x2026; the race of any person is described as &#x201C;mixed&#x2019; or &#x201C;gemeng&#x201D;, that description shall &#x2026; be deemed to be a reference to a coloured person unless such person proves that in fact he is not a coloured person.</block>

<block name="quote">The intention of the Legislature at the time was, and still is, that the classification of a person should be made according to the views held by the members of the community.</block>

<p>These are not my words&#x2014;they are the Minister&#x2019;s words. For the benefit of the hon. member for Parow this implies not only acceptance by the people who happen to live near him; it means acceptance by the people with whom he works, the people with whom he has his social activities, because all this is part of the process of living. The hon. member has tried to confine my statement; he has implied that I meant only those people with whom the person was residing.</p>

<p>The community in which he lives. Well, living and residing are two different things. The hon. member for Parow said that I had said the community in which the person lives and that therefore I was referring only to those people who were his neighbours. The hon. member for Parow must understand that there is a great distinction between the word &#x201C;living&#x201D; in English and the word &#x201C;residing&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The difference is that one word has an entirely wider meaning. &#x201C;Living&#x201D; includes not only where one resides, it also includes where one works, where one carries on business, where one has one&#x2019;s social activities because all these activities are part of the process of living. In any event, if the hon. member for Parow wants explanations he must ask the hon. the Minister because the Minister referred specifically to &#x201C;acceptance by members of the community&#x201D;. These were his words.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another matter arising out of this clause to which we have not yet had a satisfactory explanation. The Minister and other members on that side of the House have referred to the judgment of Mr. Justice Diemont. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to deal with the points raised by the hon. member for Musgrave. I refer him to paragraph (d) (ii) of the new subsection (2) inserted by clause 1 of the Bill now before us. As the hon. member should know the court will construe this paragraph very strictly because it is an interpretation against the party. Therefore the court will strictly construe the wording of the section. The paragraph clearly reads that the form must be completed and signed by the party. If the intention was for him to only sign it, the clause would have said so. The paragraph clearly states, &#x201C;&#x2026; completed and signed by him &#x2026;&#x201D; As I said, because the court will construe this paragraph very strictly on account of the fact that it counts against the party who signs the statement, the court will construe this to mean that the party has himself completed the whole form. I think that deals with that particular point.</p>

<p>As regards the definition of the applicant, the hon. member has stated that the United Party accepts that the definition should be the manner in which the party is accepted by the community in which he moves. That would be acceptable to the United Party.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>That was acceptable to you in 1962.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite correct. That was the original definition as stated in the 1950 Act and the 1962 amendment. But because of confusion, inconsistencies, delays in decisions, which arose as a result, it has become necessary to bring some certainty into the law, and that is why the amendment is being brought. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Musgrave, if he has to decide whether a person is acceptable to the community in which he moves, what better definition will he find than that contained in the new subsection (2) (c)&#x003F; The court or the board will have to inquire where a person ordinarily resides, where he is employed or carries on business, how he mixes socially, what his association with the members <span class="col_3921-3922" refersTo="page_0576"/>of his family is. Those are the factors which should be taken into consideration in deciding in what community the party moves. Therefore these are factors enumerated here for the benefit of the board in order to arrive at a decision.</p>

<p>The same position arises in regard to subsection (2) (a), dealing with a person&#x2019;s habits, education, speech, deportment, etc. Those are factors to assist the court in arriving at a decision. This is all the whole new subsection contains. This has become necessary on account, as I said, of the inconsistencies which have consistently arisen. It has become necessary to define this more accurately, and it is only for this reason that this amendment is being brought. It is intended to bring more certainty into the position. Actually it is very inhumane to allow the continuation of the indecision in these matters. We want finality, and I for my part am pleased that at last we now have this measure which gives finality in matters in regard to which there are&#x2014;and we all deplore this&#x2014;certain inconsistencies. But that is the make-up of this country, after so many hundreds of years. We now have to clear up the position. For my part I am pleased that at last we have come with a definition which, I hope, will settle the matter once and for all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Omaruru has tried to explain away part of this and to say that paragraph (c) of the new subsection (2) is more or less a restatement of what the position has always been. If the hon. member will read the speeches made when the 1962 amendments were debated he will see that they run entirely contrary to the statement he has made in this House. First of all, there were, comparatively speaking, no delays and there was no confusion. He will see that if he looks at the figures given here by the hon. the Minister. [Interjection.] No, Sir. The fact was that appearance was tied to acceptance, but when it came to acceptance it was not laid down that he had to be accepted in the area in which he was ordinarily resident. Neither did it apply to the place where he was employed or carried on business, or mixed socially or took part in other activities with other members of the public. There was none of that. All that it said was that he had to be accepted by the community. It did not have all the bits and pieces included in this amendment. What is the community&#x003F; The community is the circle in which he mixes. Why go to all these stupid lengths and put all these stupid items into the Act&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Minister&#x2019;s rejection of my two amendments. I want to start with the last one first. As regards the new subsection (3) inserted by clause 1 of the Bill, the Minister rejected my amendment in which I asked that the form should in fact be filled in and completed by the person affected. There is one point here with which nobody has dealt so far, including the Minister, and that is that this information is required under sections 3 or 9 of the Act, as amended. Let me read section 3 of the Act&#x2014;No. 30 of 1950, as amended&#x2014;to make my point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The particulars required for the compilation of the register in respect of the population of the Union as at the fixed date &#x2026;</block>

<p>and this applies to the fixed date because this Bill is retrospective to 1950&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall be extracted by the director (now the Secretary) from the forms and returns received by him under the Census Act, 1910 &#x2026; in connection with the census taken on the fixed date &#x2026;</block>

<p>1951 is the date fixed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and from such other records as may be available.</block>

<p>These things I included when I made my point to the Minister. Let us have a look at section 9 too. The Minister argues my point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The position now is that the man will have to prove the contrary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>No. The Minister refused my amendment solely on the ground that in section 3 the census is taken as the basis, whilst in section 9 the particulars furnished are taken as the basis. Section 9 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the name of any person whose name is by this Act required to be included in the register, does not appear on the register, that person, or, if that person has not attained the age of 16 years, his guardian, shall furnish the Director in the prescribed form with such particulars in regard to himself or, as the case may be, his ward under the age of 16 years, as may be necessary for the inclusion in the register of his or his ward&#x2019;s name.</block>

<p>My point is, and this is why I moved my amendment&#x2014;I want the hon. the Minister to understand this quite clearly&#x2014;that a person stands to be classified on information received from three sources, according to this, and only one of those sources can be information given by himself. This is the point: His chances are one in three. That is why I moved my amendment. The Minister said that he accepted the amendment of the hon. member for Prinshof, because, so he said, it was completely different. But of course it is not different at all. The hon. member for Prinshof keeps arguing that it is. Let us get down to it and find out what it says. It says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any form or return referred to in section 3 or 9 &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_3923-3924" refersTo="page_0577"/>They are the very ones I have dealt with now, the one in three chance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or in any application for an identity card completed and signed by him, or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him &#x2026;</block>

<p>So it brings the identity card application into exactly the same category as where information is supplied on his behalf and not by him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; there appears a statement to the effect that as far as his race is concerned, he is not a white person &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is paragraph (d) (ii) of the new subsection (2). What, I ask hon. members, is the difference between that clause and the two amendments that I have proposed&#x003F; There is absolutely no difference whatsoever. The only difference which has been exploited here by the hon. member for Prinshof, because he has misread this clause, is that it is a question of an application for an identity card. But the identity card aspect is only tacked on to sections 3 and 9, and, according to the reading of this Bill, his wife can sign that for him. So now he moved to omit the words, &#x201C;or by his spouse or his guardian in respect of him&#x201D; and he thinks that he is only doing it in respect of an identity card application! But the case is on all fours with the other two. I want to repeat this; I want to make my point quite clearly and distinctly&#x2014;my amendment is consequential upon the amendment which the hon. the Minister has accepted from the hon. member for Prinshof. If the Minister does not accept my amendment then it makes the clause more stupid than when I read it when this Bill was first put on my desk. Because the Minister is accepting only a part of three things which are identical. He is amending one part and not the other two. How can this House pass legislation in this manner, in this slipshod manner&#x003F; This is a bad clause; it is badly drafted any way. Let us look at paragraph (a) of the new subsection (2). It deals with deciding whether a person is in appearance obviously a white person. Paragraph (b) is totally different. It says that &#x201C;in the absence of proof that any person is generally accepted as a white person or a bantu (it will) be assumed that he is generally accepted as a Coloured person&#x201D;. Paragraph (c) deals with a totally different thing. It is all jumbled up, and no wonder the hon. member for Prinshof gets mixed up in reading the clause. And no wonder the Minister is having difficulty in understanding the points I am trying to make to him. Because he first has to understand this jumbled-up clause. If he goes into this carefully&#x2014;and I sincerely hope he has the opportunity of doing so&#x2014;then the Minister will understand quite clearly that he either has to reject the amendment moved by the hon. member for Prinshof or else he has to accept my two consequential amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, each time the hon. member for Umlazi jumps up with his amendments he refers to me and says that the Minister has already accepted a similar amendment moved by me. But he does not understand what this matter is all about. That is his difficulty. Now the hon. member for Umlazi feels aggrieved because the hon. the Minister does not want to accept his amendment, and he wants to blame me for that.</p>

<p>Let me refer to clause 3 now. The Minister has already made the concession. He has said that unless such person is able to prove that he is not in fact a Coloured person, he will be classified as such. If the hon. member for Umlazi were to glance at clause 3 of the Bill he would see that that clause refers to registration of births, marriages and deaths. It is now being said that this measure concerns only the one entry, i.e. &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; or in Afrikaans &#x201C;gemeng&#x2019;. During the Second Reading Debate the principal objection raised by hon. members on the opposite side was that &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; did not always mean &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;. We said it meant &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;, and they then said no, &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; does not always mean &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D;. They were referring to those kind of cases which Langenhoven spoke about, those people born in Paris while the mother was in Paarl and the father in Japan. They then said that if one spoke of &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; one meant for example the offspring of a Frenchman and an Afrikaner. But now it is very easy. The Minister says that unless such person proves that he is in fact not a Coloured person. The Minister is now saying that if that one single entry occurs on the various forms, the birth certificate, or whatever, as &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; (in Afrikaans &#x201C;gemeng&#x201D;) then we accept that person as a Coloured person. All that remains for him to do then is to say that his father was a Frenchman and his mother an Afrikaner, that being the reason why he wrote &#x201C;mixed&#x201D;. Then the matter is rectified immediately. The only point which was made in the previous section was the following. The person filling in the census form, from where the original information has to be taken, had to fill in the form and sign it himself because the possibility exists that he can be accepted as a Coloured person if he did not fill it in correctly. That is held against him. That is why he must fill it in personally. The other is merely the single word &#x201C;mixed&#x2019; in Afrikaans &#x201C;gemeng&#x201D;, and the Minister&#x2019;s amendment already achieves what the hon. member for Umlazi wants.</p>

<p>As far as paragraph (e) of the new subsection (2) is concerned&#x2019;&#x2014;it remains the mere stipulation of a date. I cannot help it if the hon. member for Umlazi cannot grasp this point; nor can I help it if the other hon. members cannot grasp it either. If the courts were to interpret it one day hon. members would see that it is only the date one is going to look at after the classification of such a person. We cannot state it any clearer, and if hon. members do not want to understand it now there is nothing we can do about it.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) Unknown. As in the case of all other infestations with internal parasites, it is not possible to determine with any degree of accuracy in live cattle whether they are suffering from bilharzia caused by schistosoma mattheei.

<ol>

<li>(b) Unknown. Cattle rarely die from the disease itself, but the parasites are a contributory factor in causing the death of poverty-stricken animals.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) Cattle are liable to be infected if they graze near rivers which flow into the Indian Ocean, i.e. an area including the Northern and Eastern Transvaal, Natal and the Eastern Cape as far south as Humansdorp. Infection is fairly prevalent along the Pongola, Swart Umfolozi and Mkuze Rivers and near False Bay, Natal. Infection, however, rarely occurs above the altitude of 4,500 feet.</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE (for the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions):</from>

<p>(a) and (b) Yes. (i) and (ii). It has been found that the existing meals on wheels schemes are entirely in the hands of two church organizations. The service is still in an experimental stage and does not form part of a comprehensive service necessary for the institution of a subsidy scheme. The home help service is also practised on a very small scale and on an experimental basis and does not justify a subsidy scheme at this stage.</p>

<heading>Fort Hare University College: Re-admission of Former Students</heading>

<p>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION replied to Question *7, by Mr. P. A. Moore, standing over from 7th April:</p>

<question by="#moore">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<p>Whether he will now make a statement, as promised by him on 28th February, 1967, on the reported refusal of the authorities to re-admit former students to the Fort Hare University College.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the 1967 academic year altogether thirty former students did not gain re-admission to the University College of Fort Hare: Sixteen were refused readmission on academic grounds in terms of Section 15 (3) of the University College of Fort Hare Transfer Act, 1959 (Act No. 64 of 1959) and fourteen in terms of section 16 of the said Act as delegated to the Council of the University College in terms of section 36 (2) of that Act. The said section 16 empowers me to refuse admittance to any person who applies for admission as a student of the University College if I consider it to be in the interest of the University College to do so.</p>

<p>Eleven of the fourteen students mentioned above appealed against this decision.</p>

<p>On the 15th March, 1967, full particulars of the fourteen cases were submitted to the Bantu Advisory Council of the University College. Each case was treated on merit. In the eleven cases where appeal was lodged the grounds for such appeal were also dealt with. The Advisory Council found that, with the exception of one case, sufficient reason existed to justify the refusal for re-admission and that re-admission would not be in the interest of the University College. The Advisory Council recommended that the refusal in the case of thirteen students be confirmed and that the case of one student be reconsidered.</p>

<p>On the 21st March, 1967, the Council dealt with the recommendations of the Advisory Council in respect of <i>inter alia</i> the fourteen students together with full particulars including the grounds for appeal. The Council found with sufficient reason that in all fourteen cases it would not be in the interest of the University College to re-admit the students <span class="col_3935-3936" refersTo="page_0583"/>for the <i>present</i> academic year. These students may, however, apply for re-admission in the 1968 academic year or thereafter. The students were informed of this decision.</p>

<block name="quote">I do not deem it in the interest of the University College to reveal the reasons for the refusal of the re-admission of the fourteen students. I would, however, like to give the hon. member the assurance that the Council exercised the relevant discretion judiciously and not arbitrarily.</block>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION:</from>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half-hour&#x003F; Since shortly after his assumption of office the hon. <span class="col_3943-3944" refersTo="page_0587"/>the Prime Minister seems to have set himself the task of improving South Africa&#x2019;s image in the outside world. By demanding that the world should accept us as we are, he has found, I think, by a few adaptations and a few minor changes&#x2014;changes I may say, Sir, very much in line with United Party thinking over the years&#x2014;that he has reaped surprising dividends. As a South African I may say that it is no pleasure to me to have to say that this Government and this Prime Minister have to an extent been dragged into taking these steps by the hair, so to speak, and that it is only recently that they faced up to the problems of the 20th century. Part of the dividends which they have received are evidenced by the statement made recently by Mr. Joseph Palmer II, successor to Mr. Mennen Williams, the Secretary of State in the United States of America. This gentleman is reported to have said on the 31st March, to the African-American Institute:</p>

<block name="quote">Interesting developments have recently been taking place in South Africa&#x2019;s relationships with some independent African states. While it is perhaps too early to assess the full significance of these developments they may nevertheless hold some hope for greater flexibility in general approaches to the problems of this area. In the midst of the divergent views which characterize efforts to solve the South-West Africa problem, it therefore remains our hope that the doors to peaceful accommodation can be kept open through a dialogue amongst the parties concerned.</block>

<p>He was asked by telephone last Saturday, a week later, to amplify his views and it is interesting to note what he says. He says that he agreed in a radio interview that the actions taken by South Africa recently, including the reception of visiting African officials and integrating sports teams, seem to be in line with what the Prime Minister said he would do. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this point the most I can say is that we are following these actions with very close attention in an effort to assess their extent and significance and to the extent that they may prove conducive to improved international and human relations we certainly will welcome them, welcome them very much indeed. The more communication we can have with South Africa the better and I would hope very much that greater communication would result perhaps in some changes.</block>

<p>The immense value of such a reassessment, especially when D-day for the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of XIV on South-West Africa is imminent, is absolutely incalculable. Indeed, I believe that any improvement must be welcomed when one considers the critical low point which we had reached last year in our international relations. I believe that the changes are welcomed by all South Africans. It is against this background that I want this afternoon to examine some of the major problems with which we are faced in the international sphere to ascertain what progress, if any, has been made and whether there has been any change of approach in the light of changed and changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Let us start by looking at the South-West Africa position, a position in respect of which there is a great measure of agreement between the Government and the Opposition in so far as the external relations of that country are concerned. I think that the hon. the Prime Minister and I came independently to the conclusion last year when we spoke on the same night at different times that the decision of the United Nations Organization to terminate our mandate over South-West Africa was both unconstitutional and probably illegal. I think we were agreed that that resolution should be ignored. I pointed out at the time that in my view not even the League of Nations had the right to terminate that mandate. If the League of Nations did not have the right to terminate that mandate, where did the United Nations get the right to do something which the body of which it was not even the heir at law, according to the decision of the International Court in 1955, could not do. I also believe that we &#x00B7; have a right to refuse to serve on that <i>ad hoc</i> committee and I believe that we have a right to refuse them leave to enter South-West Africa. That position has not changed and I think that all South Africans should reaffirm our determination to maintain our legal position in respect of South-West Africa. I think that on that we are united. I believe also that despite the provocative nature of the resolutions taken at the United Nations Organization, we were right not to withdraw from that body at that time. I believe that the arguments which weighed with us then, are even more weighty to-day when we are attempting to present a repolished image of South Africa to the world outside. So far I think we are agreed. But, of course, the recent statement on Ovamboland was part of this new image building. As far as the steps taken to date are concerned we on this side of the House have no objections to a greater measure of self-government for the area concerned, and the introduction of the elective principle. That coincides with our policies.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that one of these days I will be Nationalist. I return the compliment. If the Minister goes on evincing so much common sense it will not be long before he is back in the United Party. In the early days, as you know Sir, he was a member of the United Party. What I want to say is this. If these steps in Ovamboland are an indication that the political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission are to be applied both in the letter and <span class="col_3945-3946" refersTo="page_0588"/>in the spirit, then I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that our ways part at that point. Our ways part at that point for the reasons outlined by me in this House when the report of the Odendaal Commission was discussed and outlined by me in two speeches in South West Africa on this very issue. It does not affect our external relations but it does affect our disagreement concerning the internal management of that territory. I say that that is the position if these recommendations amount to an acceptance of the provisions of the report of the Odendaal Commission because I have been studying with some interest this <i>South West Africa Survey</i> of 1967. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you that I find that apartheid in South West Africa is quite different from apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. It has suddenly become a pragmatic policy, it has suddenly become a policy which varies from place to place. I read from page 48 of this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In truth this policy is nothing of the kind. It is an essentially pragmatic approach to a particular set of facts posing a complicated problem of human relations. It is an attempt in the words of Professor Possony, &#x201C;to tailor methods or responses to specific challenges&#x201D;. It is applied precisely because of being considered the best means of pursuing commonly shared ideals of justice for all, human rights and the self-determination of peoples, on a basis of equal human dignity. Its similarity in approach to general policy applied in South Africa is due to the similarity of the problems involved. But, because circumstances are not exactly the same, the respective policies, though called by the same name, differ in many important matters of detail and emphasis.</block>

<p>Then they go on:</p>

<block name="quote">Another important consideration is that as the political and economic organs and institutions develop amongst the non-White peoples, the importance of contact and consultation between them and the Central Governing Authority must necessarily grow, and in increasing measure their wishes will have to be taken into account on matters of mutual concern.</block>

<p>They do not say how, but they do say that it has to be done. That is also coming closer to the sort of thing for which the United Party has been pleading. I say that doubt exists when one hears this philosophical definition of apartheid. I want to say that if this means the implementation of the political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, we cannot reconcile ourselves to the ideas of that report. The Government is apparently not working to retain a federal relationship with the northern part of South West Africa, nor any relationship at all, while in the southern part its plan involves building homelands, at present nonexistent, by shifting populations and shifting human beings on a scale proportionately hitherto unprecedented in the modern world. I believe that in one portion of the south of South West Africa some 166,000 should have to be moved into reserves where only some 25,000 have their homes at present. A more ridiculous set of recommendations I have not come across in my life. I want to say that we cannot accept recommendations of that sort. The Prime Minister must not look to us for support on that account if that is what his intentions are. That is the position internally. The external position nevertheless remains a difficult one because we have moved out of the legal sphere into the political sphere, as I think I warned last year. I trust that the Government will refrain from any action which will weaken South Africa&#x2019;s moral or legal claims regarding South West Africa. I think we are all agreed that we would like to see our relationship retained with that territory.</p>

<p>Now there is the question of the protectorates which have recently gained, or are gaining independence as the result of action by Great Britain. I want to repeat the question which I put last session to the hon. the Prime Minister. I want to ask him how much progress has been made in respect of treaty relations with the two territories that have attained independence, and especially in regard to the question of extradition treaties. I see from the report of the Secretary for Justice that treaties have been entered into with various territories. These protectorates are mentioned. I see also that there is talk of some big power seeking treaty relations with South Africa, particularly extradition treaties. I think we are entitled to know how far we have gone and how much progress has been made in that regard. For some considerable time now we have been without treaties of any kind with these territories. On their gaining independence the old extradition treaties lapsed. It seems a most unsatisfactory state of affairs that that should be allowed to continue for any length of time. The Government stated some time ago that it was prepared to meet the leaders of African states on a leader to leader basis. Indeed there was a meeting between the previous Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Basutoland and there has been a meeting between our present Prime Minister and the same gentleman. The Prime Minister may or may not think it wise to give us any account of that meeting. Perhaps he will tell us whether any advance has been made in respect of the treaty obligations which I outlined last year and which I dealt with in some detail at that time.</p>

<p>Of course the big problem as I see it is the question of how those areas are to be assisted to develop economically. I have raised this question before. I want to raise it again to remind the hon. the Prime Minister that when I raised it once before I indicated that if we did not help, there was a possibility of other powers helping. I referred to the resolution of the United Nations Organization calling upon the countries of the Western World to establish a fund to help develop these territories so that <span class="col_3947-3948" refersTo="page_0589"/>they would not fall under the economic influence of South Africa. I believe that we have to be first in line amongst the friendly nations of the world in giving a hand to these people. I believe that we have to be first in line to give them advice and to give them money for investment. It is my belief that if we can spend R250 million in a year on defence and defending ourselves from aggressors, we can spare a few million for the protective friendship of our neighbours, neighbours who need it very badly indeed. I believe that this is just common sense and a very good investment. We are a comparatively wealthy nation and we are ideally suited geographically, as a result of our vast store of knowledge which has been built up over the years, our experience, and particularly our technical experience, to be of assistance to these people. I believe that they need it very badly. I believe that they cannot lift themselves up by their boot strings. They need money. They need technical advice. They need guidance, all of which we can give them without making them the victims of economic colonialism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. and learned gentleman from Turffontein asks me why I do not agree with that as far as South Africa is concerned. I was just about to say that overseas investment in South Africa amounts to R3,000 million without our ever having come near to suffering the fate of economic colonialism or thraldom by foreign powers or foreign ideologies. Does the hon. member know that&#x003F; I want to say that in that same spirit we should be prepared to help our less privileged neighbours and that we should start with those which are nearest to us, those with whom we have the closest bonds and from whom we have already had overtures of friendship. They are Lesotho, Botswana and, I believe, in due course, Swaziland. I believe that there is a lot we can do. If they are limited to Britain&#x2019;s help, Lesotho certainly, if I am to believe their advisers, is going to be relegated to the status of a mere labour reservoir for South Africa. Although I believe that her people are welcome here, it is not a future that will contribute either to Lesotho&#x2019;s advancement or to South Africa&#x2019;s advancement. Envious neighbours are dangerous neighbours. It is in the interests of our people to aid these less privileged peoples to achieve their full potential. If the nations of the West fail, I believe that the nations of the East will step in. Sir, do you feel that it is to the credit of the nations of the West that Russia should have built Egypt&#x2019;s Higher Aswan Dam&#x003F; Do you think it is to the credit of the nations of the West that Chinese and Russian technicians should be infiltrating among so many of the emergent states of Africa&#x003F; I believe that it is in our own interests to get on with this job. That is why I am feeling for an indication from the hon. the Prime Minister that we will be prepared to consider assistance in this line. I believe we have the business men, the economically trained people with an ability to see that proper programmes are prepared, conducted and carried through. I want to say that we have noticed, I think with approval, that Dr. Anton Rupert has been appointed economic adviser to Lesotho, apparently with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s consent. Am I right&#x003F; Is it with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s consent&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It was not necessary. Very well. Dr. Rupert&#x2019;s views on industrial partnership are well-known. In case hon. members of this House are not familiar with them they are set out particularly in two lectures, the one entitled &#x201C;Communicating in a growing international organization&#x201D;, an address delivered in Rotterdam at the International Management Congress in September last year, and the other one, &#x201C;Missionaries or Mercenaries&#x003F;&#x201D; which was also delivered last year on the 6th May to the Economic Club of Detroit in Canada, by Dr. Anton Rupert himself. Here is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For nearly two decades the world over I have been pleading that true partnership in industry can supply the answer to the industrial aspirations of the poor nations and can refute the accusation of economic domination by the rich nations. I firmly believe that the advantages of democracy and free enterprise can only be maintained and developed through true partnership between the industrialized nations and the developing countries. Losses through nationalization in many parts of the globe are eloquent proof of the contention that the industrialized countries should get down to understanding that when branching out to foreign countries the ownership of such new enterprises must be shared with local citizens before it is too late.</block>

<p>Then he points out what the local inhabitants do in building up the infra-structure and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We feel they have a moral right to share directly in the progress and development undertaken in their country.</block>

<p>Those are indications of the sort of line in which Dr. Rupert is likely to move and it is an indication of the sort of interest he will try to create amongst private enterprise in South Africa. I feel that in the light of what has happened in the past, private enterprise in the Republic needs reassurance. Because when I raised a matter of this kind in this House with the previous Prime Minister in January, 1962, this is what he said (Hansard, 23rd January, 1962, column 85)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3949-3950" refersTo="page_0590"/>Whilst I am on this subject, I just want to give a hint to the South African firms who intend establishing their private undertakings in the High Commission Territories. It is their own business if they want to do so there in conflict with our policy as I have expounded it; it is Britain&#x2019;s concern whether they want to allow it &#x2026; All I want to say here is this. They should not then come and ask us for assistance. What they are doing is, in my opinion, looking for trouble and it is against the policy of this Government. If later they are faced with such problems as nationalization, they must not seek our protection under those circumstances.</block>

<p>In other words, the Prime Minister at that time left no doubt in anybody&#x2019;s mind that it was contrary to the policy of his Government that private citizens in South Africa should invest in the High Commission Territories. If there is to be assistance to these emergent protectorates then I think we want a statement from the hon. the Prime Minister as to what his attitude is at the present time. I think that private enterprise will have to be reassured before it will be able to go in, and I think it is very necessary that his attitude be made clear. If this is going to be the sort of approach and it is going to frighten away the chances of our people investing in those areas, then we can rest assured that the battle will be lost before we start, and investment will be by foreign powers and overseas investors, many of whom may not be friendly towards South Africa. I think what I say in respect of Lesotho goes also for Swaziland and Botswana, and this raises the whole question of what the attitude of the Republic is likely to be in respect of the Oxbow scheme and the purchase of water from Basutoland. I do not propose to deal with that&#x2014;it will be dealt with by the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>I pass on to the recent treaty negotiated with the independent country of Malawi. I should like to know from the Prime Minister if this is part of the concept of the gradual building up of a Common Market for Southern Africa. I should like to know how far in his view that extends. We have the views of the previous Prime Minister on this subject. We have his vision in respect of a Common Market of the Southern States of Africa on the same sort of lines as a Common Market for Europe. But we have not had it developed since certain of these territories attained independence and I think we should like to know from the Prime Minister in what direction we are moving in this regard, because you see, Sir, as economic ties strengthen, there will come the need for consular ties and diplomatic ties, and as trade is expanded, one wonders whether we shall be able to continue with the present policy of <i>ad hoc</i> consultation between these territories and the Republic. Where one has a daily flow of trade <i>ad hoc</i> consultation from time to time is not likely to be satisfactory. It seems to me that if this is an indication of a movement in the direction of closer trade ties, as it seems to be, then I think the Prime Minister must be encouraged to grasp this nettle of the question of exchange of consular officials and go into the whole question of diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>Now, I have dealt with our relations with two sets of territories. I want to raise one more subject which I believe is of vital importance in international affairs and that is the question of international sport. Because of its popularity it can have tremendous repercussions. It can have repercussions possibly quite out of proportion to its importance or the number of people involved. This matter has an unhappy history under this Government. Members will recall that when the last South African rugby team was in New Zealand we had a statement made by the previous Prime Minister at the Loskop dam stating his position with very great rigidity. Subsequent to that we had arguments between the Minister at the time and the then president of the South African Rugby Board as to what had been agreed between them and what had not been agreed between them. For a while there was quiet, and then out of the blue there came a statement from the present hon. Minister of the Interior which he contends was not an accurate reflection of his views. I regard it rather as the statement that was nearly made but not made. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to give the hon. Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to complete his argument, if he wishes to do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister. I say to him: &#x201C;Thank you very much indeed.&#x201D; The statement was followed by a period of quiet and then came exploratory articles in the Press controlled by the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Party. Then came the Part Appropriation debate in which the United Party made a clear statement as to what its attitude was in this regard. We made it quite clear that we desired of the Government that it should remove the immediate causes which threatened to deprive South Africans of their traditional participation in international sport by&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Allowing all race-groups to watch all organized sport provided adequate facilities are available for Whites and non-Whites;</li>

<li>(2) Entrusting the control and administration of sport in the Republic to the recognized sporting bodies;</li>

<li>(3) Accepting the principle of non-interference in the realm of international sport and leaving the issuing of invitations and the selection of teams to the controlling bodies concerned;</li>

<li>(4) Recognizing in the case of both national and international professional sport <span class="col_3951-3952" refersTo="page_0591"/>acceptable boards of control representative of the sport concerned.</li>

</ol>

<p>Since then there has been a guarded statement by the hon. the Prime Minister at Oudtshoorn on the 4th March, when he promised another statement and indicated that he would consider creating facilities for non-Whites to take part in the Olympic Games. Eighteen days after that we got a statement from the President of the South African Olympic Committee, Mr. Frank Braun, on the 22nd March, 1967, a statement which appeared in <i>The Argus.</i> He said there that he was stating the policy of the South African Government concerning participation in sport outside the country. He listed the main Government principles&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sport in South Africa will be separately practised and administered by the various population groups. Non-White bodies existed alongside the White bodies in the administration and control of sport, with coordination at the highest level. Consultation between the various groups is already taking place, Mr. Braun said. He said that a liaison committee of White and non-White sport administrators would be called under the chairmanship of the President of the South African Olympic Games Committee to advise the committee in the selection of the South African contingent and in the handling of the arrangements for participation in the Olympic Games and other international competitions. This brings into being a parallel non-White committee for Olympic-type sports practised by a non-White sportsman. Where joint contingents participated in the Olympic Games or other <i>bona fide</i> international competitions, each population group would designate its candidates for election.</block>

<p>He indicated that they would go overseas as a South African sports team. Afterwards, Sir, there came another statement that was never made, this time a report to the South African Rugby Board, a report which was not delivered but seems to have got into the oversea press. We are now in a state of very great confusion and it does seem to me that the Prime Minister owes us an explanation as to what the policy of his Party is and what attitude he is going to adopt. Is he going to accept the principles as outlined by the United Party&#x003F; Sir, he is well on the way. Is he going to accept those principles&#x003F; If not. where does he differ&#x003F; I am making it easy for the hon. gentleman. If he wants a joint approach to these things I would be only too happy. If he accepted these principles I am sure that he would solve all the problems in connection with this matter very easily indeed. Sir, I think it is necessary for another reason. I see from the week-end press that there is a statement by the Chairman of the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation who, as the hon. the Prime Minister will know, is a most important man in their hierarchy, which seems to cast criticism on the attitude that is being taken up by the Government at the present time. Sir, is that a warning from the Chairman of the S.A.B.C. to the Government, or is it the spokesman of the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs indicating that all is not well within the Cabinet&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition started off by paying me what I would rather describe as a back-handed compliment, inasmuch as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to suggest that the successful policy pursued by this side of the House&#x2014;and he referred particularly to the period during which I have been Prime Minister of this country&#x2014;was in actual fact the policy of the United Party. Sir, that cannot be so, of course, because to be very candid I do not know what the policy of the United Party is. It is just impossible for any hon. member on this side of the House or, for that matter, for any person in the country, to say what the policy of the United Party is, and in the time at my disposal I will illustrate to the House exactly what I mean when I say that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a speech at East London on the 29th November, 1966, which was reported in the <i>Pretoria News</i> of the 30th November, 1966. This is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said according to this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s blue-print for a greater South Africa included a policy for the country&#x2019;s greater wealth, her greater security and her greater happiness, the Leader of the Opposition &#x2026;</block>

<p>They did not say &#x201C;the greater Leader of the Opposition&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Sir de Villiers Graaff, said at a public meeting here last night.</block>

<p>Judging from this report the hon. the Leader of the Opposition apparently has in his possession a blue-print for South Africa. I would love the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to tell us all about it in this debate. As a matter of fact. I am going to create the opportunity for him to do just that. I am going to invite the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to tell us about his policy. If he does not accept my invitation, I am going to beg him to say what his policy is, and if he refuses to do so after having been begged, I am going to drive him to tell us what his policy is. Sir, here we have a Leader of the Opposition telling us all that he has a blueprint but that it is such a top secret that he does not want to tell South Africa about it. I am just saying this in passing. I think it is time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us exactly what his policy and the policy of his Party is. I discussed this with a friend the other day after I had read this report and I said to him, &#x201C;I see according to the <i>Pretoria News</i> that the Leader of the Opposition says <span class="col_3953-3954" refersTo="page_0592"/>that he has a blue-print for South Africa&#x201D;. His reply was: &#x201C;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry about that. It is not a blue-print; it is just a carbon copy of one of his old speeches that he has.&#x201D; I am afraid therefore that we are not going to get a blue-print from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at all, but I am just warning him in advance that we expect him in this debate not only to ask questions but also to tell us what his policy is. Of course, it is his prerogative to ask questions and I will reply to each and everyone of them. For my part, I will also put questions to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I expect him to be as frank in his replies to me as I will be in my replies to him.</p>

<p>Just to put the record straight, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition first spoke about the South-West African issue. Just for the purposes of the record, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that it was well that we did not allow the committee to come to South Africa. The fact of the matter, of course, is that they did not ask for permission to come to South Africa. I mention that just in passing. I would also mention just in passing that we were not asked to serve on that committee, and as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition anticipated, we would not have served on it even if we had been invited.</p>

<p>* Furthermore, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to the South-West Africa affair. He said quite rightly that he and I were fully agreed that the resolution taken by the Committee was <i>ultra vires</i> its own constitution, if one may put it that way, and that resolution had no legal foundation. I am also pleased that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not pursue that matter any further, because I do not intend discussing it in any detail in this debate, at any rate, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to this document on South-West Africa. Permit me, Sir, to say that it is an excellent piece of work, and that great credit is due to the persons who compiled it, and I believe that to any unbiased person it will be worth his while to obtain this information on South-West Africa. We have in fact had this document compiled because even last year, as the Leader of the Opposition is aware, I expressed my concern about the fact that Government concerns and other bodies which ought to know better appeared from their pronouncements to be so uninformed on what was taking place in South Africa and in South-West Africa. I may therefore commend this document without any reservations to any person who wishes to have authoritative information on South-West Africa.</p>

<p>But I do not think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was being fair when he referred to page 48, from which he quoted to us. I do not know what impression other hon. members received, but I received the impression, from what the hon. the Leader said, that he wanted to suggest that we had tried to run away from the policy of separate development in this document; in other words, that we were ashamed of discussing this matter or presenting it in its true perspective when dealing with South-West Africa. That is not true, of course, but the hon. member simply did not read any further. What is written quite clearly on page 49, just where the hon. member stopped reading, is this, and I just want to read it for the purposes of the record&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another important consideration is the validity of the standards by which the policy is to be judged. It should be clear that from a practical point of view there are only two alternative lines of approach which call for serious attention, namely attempted integration and separate development.</block>

<p>It then continues to say exactly what separate development is. What is stated here is no more and no less than what was said by my predecessor and by myself from time to time in respect of separate development; because separate development is not the puppet the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party and his Press set up from time to time to knock down again, and which they then present to the world as separate development, but separate development is the policy of this side of the House as enunciated by us from time to time. I am now compelled to enunciate it once again, because I want to know from the Leader of the Opposition what his alternative is. I put it emphatically to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that it is not I who am asking what the policy of the Opposition is; the entire country is asking that. Sir, hon. members on the opposite side are asking that, or should ask that, because they themselves are so confused in respect of that policy. Take the attitude of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It is not the attitude of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>I am sorry. I did not want to hurt the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as much as the hon. member for Yeoville is hurting him now, by attributing the various attitudes to him. I merely asked the hon. member for Yeoville whether he subscribed to the attitude of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Now he tells me: &#x201C;Since the hon. member for Bezuidenhout became a member of the United Party again, yes.&#x201D; [Laughter.] Then I ask the hon. member for Yeoville, who is the policy-maker on that side <span class="col_3955-3956" refersTo="page_0593"/>of the House, whether he subscribes to the attitude that now that the Coloureds are on separate voters&#x2019; rolls, they should be represented by their own people in this House on those voters&#x2019; rolls&#x003F; Because that is the policy of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. [Interjection.] You say you subscribe to that. Then surely you could just have indicated that to me. But in any event, I shall hold the hon. member to that, and the members on my side will hold the hon. member for Yeoville to that, and he will get an opportunity to state his attitude in this House.</p>

<p>But I come to the hon. member for Karoo, a leading member of the United Party, who was a leader in the Provincial Council. The hon. member for Karoo adopts a different attitude altogether. I am pleased that he has recovered sufficiently to be back in the House. I do not expect him to take part in the debate &#x2014;I say this in advance&#x2014;if according to medical advice he should not do so. But the hon. member will forgive me if I ask the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;because if it had merely been a back-bencher I would have taken no notice of it, but it comes from the hon. member for Karoo, who was a front-bencher and the leader of the United Party in the Provincial Council, and he holds his own views. I refer to a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 18th January, 1967, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposals of the United Party M.P. Mr. Graham Eden for non-White representation in Parliament go far beyond anything yet suggested by the Party. The final stage of having a qualified franchise for all races on a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll coincides with Progressive Party policy. Mr. Eden, Coloured Representative for Karoo and a member of the United Party&#x2019;s Parliamentary Caucus, has outlined his proposals in a memorandum submitted both to his constituents and to the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry which was constituted after the Government withdrew the Prohibition of Improper Interference Bill. The first stage, he says, would be to give Coloureds the right to elect six or eight Coloured M.P.s, and the Indians two or three. When the second stage is reached, urban Africans should be entitled to buy land in proclaimed African townships in urban areas. After a responsible property-owning class of African has emerged, it should be entitled to elect eight African M.P.s. Consideration can then be given to merging groups on very high qualifications towards and into a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. The Memorandum says this would be the third and the final stage. Mr. Eden continues: &#x201C;The problems of to-day are problems of government, and South Africa&#x2019;s problem is how to introduce black and brown men into politics without harm to themselves or injury to the Whites.&#x201D;</block>

<p>So we have the attitude of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, which I now hear for the first time and which has found a new disciple in the person of the hon. member for Yeoville. We also have the attitude of the hon. member for Karoo.</p>

While I am dealing with this point, I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the question on which political parties in South Africa differ nowadays is mainly the question of separate development. All the other issues have fallen away to a very large extent in South Africa. The people of South Africa have no problem in knowing where they stand with the Government in respect of separate development. They have no problem. Not only do they see it unfold in practice, but hon. members on this side of the House and I myself are at all times prepared to discuss these aspects inside and outside the House.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As for the questions of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the more the merrier. Let us come to a very clear understanding. [Interjections.] I am not going to have the hon. member for Transkei prescribe to me how I am to answer the questions. [Interjections.] I should very much like to give the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the opportunity, and I shall give him as much time as possible&#x2014;and we are by no means in a hurry, neither he nor I myself&#x2014;to ask me as many questions as he wants to ask under the circumstances. Now, the hon. the <span class="col_3957-3958" refersTo="page_0594"/>Leader of the Opposition asked me about the Protectorates. He asked me what progress had been made in regard to the extradition agreements. I discussed the question of extradition with the Prime Minister of Lesotho. The question of extradition between Lesotho and South Africa is under consideration at the moment. The stage reached at present is that officials are working on the preparations in this connection, and I hope and trust that it will shortly become a reality and that such an extradition agreement will be signed. In principle there is no reason why it cannot be done. But in passing I just want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and he is aware of this, that in latter years extradition agreements are by no means what they used to be, because the political clauses contained in all extradition agreements have watered them down to a very large extent. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of that. Be that as it may, we have not had many problems in this regard in the past, and the problems there have been will be solved if and when we enter into such an extradition agreement.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me about assistance to that territory. From the communiqu&#x00E9; issued subsequent to our consultations he will have noticed that we did discuss those matters. It was worded as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our examination of the problems affecting the economic development of Lesotho revealed the close inter-dependence of our two countries and the need for continued close co-operation to promote still further our common weal. The Prime Minister of Lesotho put certain specific proposals for economic aid and technical assistance to the South African Government and the Prime Minister of South Africa has agreed to have these examined by his colleagues as soon as possible.</block>

<p>In other words, assistance was asked for, and for the information of the House I may just add that the Prime Minister of Lesotho told me that he had taken cognizance of my attitude as set out in this House last year, when I said that as regards the assistance South Africa had to offer, we would not simply hand out money to people, because in principle we did not believe in that and because we did not have the superfluous money available, but that we would help them to help themselves. The Prime Minister of Lesotho told me that he fully agreed with that attitude and that point of view. I am pleased about that, because that is indeed the only way in which one can help a country. Since our discussions there has been constant liaison between the Republic and Lesotho through officials with a view to investigating the various subjects raised by the Prime Minister of Lesotho, I have offered him technical assistance, which he accepted, I have offered him advice, which he gladly accepted, and investigations, which include the Oxbow scheme, are already in progress. Pending those investigations, active assistance will be rendered to Lesotho by the Government of the Republic in the spirit of what I said last year. That applies not only in respect of Lesotho, but also in respect of other African States. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me what my attitude was in respect of private investment in the territories which were previously the Protectorates. I assumed that my attitude was quite clear. Here one has to do with independent states, in contrast to what they were when my esteemed predecessor discussed this matter. Here one has to do with independent states, and I neither can nor want to prohibit anyone who wishes to come to the assistance of those states in an honest and equitable way, from investing there. Those states, however, are faced with the problem of finding people who are prepared to invest in them. I have no power to prohibit anybody from going there. I am satisfied that these persons want to be of assistance to those people and want to create opportunities of employment for them. Even if I had that power, they would go there with my blessing. Here we are not dealing with a state which is still seeking independence, nor with a state which has yet to choose its course, nor with a state which has yet to adopt an attitude, but with a state which has already adopted an attitude and which is therefore master in its own house. I want to point out to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that to exaggerate the possibilities for investment in those territories will help neither them nor anybody else. If it is possible to invest there now, or rather, if investing there is an attractive proposition now, the question arises: Why did nobody ever go and invest there in the past&#x003F; [Interjection.] We had no say over the Protectorates under Britain.</p>

<p>The previous Prime Minister was quite right in issuing a warning, if the hon. member considers what happened in Tanzania, with the nationalization of banks, etc., which took place there. Nobody, neither the late Prime Minister nor anybody else, could have prohibited anybody from investing in Lesotho or Botswana or in Swaziland. Those were territories which fell under the British Government. I presume the British Government would have been grateful if anybody wanted to make an investment there, because few or no investments were made, neither by the British nor by foreigners from elsewhere.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me, with reference to the Malawi agreement, whether we had discussed the &#x201C;common market&#x201D;. We did not discuss a common market. We negotiated on a specific bilateral agreement concluded between one independent state and another independent state. The agreement has been laid upon the Table. The <span class="col_3959-3960" refersTo="page_0595"/>hon. member is acquainted with the terms of that agreement, and I do not want to discuss it any further.</p>

<p>The question of diplomatic representation was dealt with by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he spoke in this House earlier this year. There is no need for me to say anything further about this aspect, except that as it becomes necessary to safeguard the interests of the Republic and as it becomes necessary to put the attitude of the Government into effect, the necessary negotiations will be entered into with states, whether for diplomatic relations, trade relations or any other relations. Surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition need not ask me that&#x003F; Surely it is his policy which I am carrying out&#x003F; Surely he should know what I am going to do in this connection&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the last part of his speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to the question of sport. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition raised that, because I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about sporting matters. Sport is a social activity which is most important and which should not be under-rated, but you will permit me also to issue a word of warning on this occasion, namely that it should not be overdone, neither by our own people nor at any time. I also attach tremendous value to sports relations&#x2014;I have in fact said so in public&#x2014;but they must not override all other considerations. I believe that a tremendous deal can be done to form ties with countries and to strengthen ties with countries if there are sports relations. At the same time I believe that unless these are handled correctly, they may cause irreparable mischief between countries. In the case of South Africa there is a special responsibility on each of us and in particular on the Press as to how they are handled, because unless they are handled correctly&#x2014;and I want to repeat this&#x2014;they may do more harm than good. I therefore want to avail myself of this opportunity to appeal to the newspapers of South Africa to handle these matters, which are frequently very delicate and which will be delicate in future, with the utmost circumspection. I am glad that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not succumb to that temptation. Above all I want to request that this matter should not be dragged into politics, because in my humble opinion it is a matter which does not belong there. As I shall indicate in due course, however, it may hold political implications. We cannot lose sight of that, of course. Because it is a social matter, there are certain statements I have to make before I come to the question of sport as such, in order to indicate and to declare unequivocally what the attitude and the policy of this side of the House are in respect of that matter. As I said previously, the policy of South Africa, and not only of the National Party, is separate development. Separate development is a policy which has never been based on hate or prejudice or fear. I also want to make it quite clear&#x2014;that has also become necessary in this debate&#x2014;that it does not mean the denial of a person&#x2019;s human dignity. On the contrary, it underlines the diversity of the various population groups which have to find a home in the same geographical area, as in the Republic of South Africa. Instead of being a policy which may be said to be a denial of human dignity, it is in fact a policy which is aimed at creating opportunities which previously never existed. We can quote many examples of that, should it be necessary. For the sake of the record I just want to reiterate what I recently said in Parow, namely that this traditional and historic policy of South Africa&#x2014;of separate development&#x2014;is aimed, firstly, at preserving the identity of each population group, and that it is the inalienable right of the Whites, amongst others, to retain their identity. Secondly, it is aimed at eliminating and minimizing points of friction and disturbances wherever possible. Thirdly, as I said, it creates for every member of every group opportunities which did not exist previously, and it creates possibilities for future development. In that connection I must also make it quite clear that South Africa has never demanded of any state that it should also accept this policy, and similarly South Africa will never allow the policy of another state to be forced on to her in this regard. As I had no reservations in telling the leaders of the black states with whom I came into contact, South Arfrica&#x2019;s attitude will always be that differences in domestic policy are not an obstacle to peaceful co-operation between countries. As far as that is concerned, separate development therefore also applies to the field of sport.</p>

<p>I therefore want to make it quite clear that from South Africa&#x2019;s point of view no mixed sport between Whites and non-Whites will be practised locally, irrespective of the standard of proficiency of the participants. I am first dealing with our own people. Irrespective of the standard of proficiency, the position is simply that the Whites practise and administer their sport separately and that the other colour groups, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu, practise their sport separately. We have had problems in that connection in the past, but our views and our attitude are quite clear &#x2014;no matter how proficient one of our own people may be in his line of sport, we do not apply that as a criterion, because our policy has nothing to do with proficiency or lack of proficiency. If any person, either locally or abroad, adopts the attitude that he will enter into relations with us only if we are prepared to jettison the separate practising of sport prevailing among our own people in South Africa, then I want to make it quite clear that, no matter how important those sport relations are in my view, I am not prepared to pay that price. On that score I want no misunderstanding whatsoever. I also want to say in advance that if, after I have said on these matters what I still want to say, anybody should see in this either the thin end of the wedge or a surrender of principles, or that it is a step in the direction of diverging from this basic principle <span class="col_3961-3962" refersTo="page_0596"/>he would simply be mistaken. Because in respect of this principle we are not prepared to compromise, we are not prepared to negotiate and we are not prepared to make any concessions.</p>

<p>I am not trying to trap the hon. the Leader of the Opposition or to do anything of the kind now, I do not want to make matters impossible or difficult for him, but I would appreciate it if the hon. the Leader would tell me in due course whether that is his attitude too, in order that we may know whether we are on common ground in this respect. If he thinks it is his policy then he may tell me so right away. In the second place our attitude in respect of sport&#x2014;and I am now merely reiterating what my colleague Minister Maree said here on a previous occasion&#x2014;is that attendance of members of one group at such recreational events of the other group takes place by way of permit, if at all. There are sports grounds where it is not permitted, but that is the affair of those people. Where it is in fact allowed, it takes place by way of permit, provided that separate facilities are available and as long as it does not result in situations which are conducive to friction and disturbances, and I want to add, provided that it will not hamper the development of their own facilities. My concern here is to grant every population group the same sports facilities in their own area and among their own people that I grant the Whites. [Interjection.] The hon. member is bothering me.</p>

<p>The hon. member should just speak louder if he wants to speak to me. I say that in this connection we should guard against one thing, and that is to give the non-Whites the impression that they will always remain mere spectators at our sports meetings. We should rather induce them to value their own sports meetings, to go and watch their own people compete, and if the standard of their own people is not high enough, to help to raise that standard.</p>

<p>We must not bring them under the impression, however, that the sport practised by our Whites is the only sport worth seeing. We should instil pride in them in what their own people can achieve in that field. We should encourage them to be spectators at their own sports meetings in order that these may become paying propositions. We should encourage them to develop their own facilities in that regard.</p>

<p>We now come to the various sporting issues. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition probably did not have adequate time to do so, else he would have itemized them. I shall now do so on this occasion. In the first place there is the Olympic Games, to which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred. He also referred to the announcement made by Mr. Braun in that connection. I want to make it quite clear that a decision was already taken in this regard under my predecessor. It is not a decision taken in my time and I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of that. The Olympic Games is a unique event in which all countries of the world take part, and our attitude in respect of that event was that if there were any of our Coloureds or Bantu who were good enough to compete there, or whose standard of proficiency was such that they could take part in it, we would make it possible for them to take part.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should not be so hasty. The hon. member is more concerned about the question whether they will be in the same team than he is about the provision of the necessary facilities for those people. He is more concerned about seeing whether it is not possible for integration to take place according to the recipe of the United Party in this regard. The hon. member need not even have asked that question, because only one team from each country is allowed to take part in the Olympic Games. He is aware of the fact that although East Germany and West Germany are two separate states, the organizers of the Olympic Games require from them that they send one team. It is quite true that previously, because it would have been better, we asked whether it was not possible to send separate teams. We explored that angle because it would most certainly be better if that could be the case; it would suit us better, but it is not possible and it was therefore decided that the non-Whites could take part. The position is quite clear as set out by Mr. Braun, and I want to repeat here what he said in that connection, namely (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That sport in South Africa is practised and administered separately by the four different population groups.</block>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised this question. It is my attitude that in South Africa sport should be practised and <span class="col_3963-3964" refersTo="page_0597"/>administered separately by the four different population groups. I should like to hear whether that is also his attitude&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) For the purposes of participation in the Olympic Games the various population groups will appoint their own representatives, with due regard to the fact that in accordance with overseas practice South Africans of different population groups will compete against each other over there.</block>

<p>We have always had that in the past, and we have no objection to its taking place in future either&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just as there is already consultation between population groups in various fields, there will also be liaison between white and non-white sports administrators under the South African Olympic Committee in regard to the composition of the South African contingent for dealing with arrangements in connection with the Olympic Games.</block>

<p>Because the Olympic Games lays it down as an absolute condition, the people who are then selected will take part as one contingent under the South African flag. That is our attitude in that regard and I think it is the correct one to adopt.</p>

<p>Then we come to other sporting matters. There is, for example, the question of another world competition which is not on the same footing as the Olympic Games because there are not so many countries that take part in it. It does not have the same constitution nor does it have the same scope, but at present approximately 68 countries take part in that competition, and that is the Canada Cup tournament. I want to tell hon. members that I have no objection to the Canada Cup tournament taking place here in South Africa. In fact, I have issued an invitation to that effect to the organizers of the tournament, and although they are accommodated up to 1970, it is not impossible that the tournament will take place here one day. Personally I would be very pleased if that happened. The same applies in respect of the Davis Cup competition. This is another international sporting event in which we take part, and if it were to happen that we had to play against a Coloured country in the finals, we would do so, whether in that country or in South Africa, because here one has to do with an interstate relationship &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am not referring to the hon. member for Sea Point. I would never compare the hon. member for Sea Point with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. One thing we must understand quite clearly, and I am saying this specifically in consequence of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. We must draw a very clear distinction between personal relations on the one hand and inter-state relations on the other. It is when one fails to draw that fundamental distinction that one lapses into the kind of sophistry one gets from some hon. members on the opposite side&#x2014;not all of them.</p>

<p>I am doing so. As far as the Olympic Games is concerned, we are concerned with an international, interstate relationship, and it is therefore my attitude in principle and the attitude of the Government in principle that one may take part in the Olympic Games on that basis without sacrificing one&#x2019;s personal attitude, without meddling with the separate practising of sport between individuals in one&#x2019;s own country or among one&#x2019;s own people. If one accepts that on the one hand there are those personal relations and on the other hand the various interstate relations &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the hon. member knows that I am not a member of his Party. I have only one attitude, and that is the one I am stating. I say that I draw a distinction between personal relations and inter-state relations. To illustrate it even further to the hon. member, it is not our policy that there should be social mingling of Whites and non-Whites in South Africa, but because I was dealing with an inter-state relationship in that instance, I could receive the Prime Minister of Lesotho as I did, because it was not a personal relationship but an inter-state relationship. I received him as the Prime Minister of his country, just as my forefathers and the forefathers of the hon. member received people of that rank many years ago, as the Free State Volksraad received Moshesh in Bloemfontein. I therefore say that this is my attitude in respect of the Olympic Games and in respect of the Canada Cup tournament, and in respect of the Davis Cup competition.</p>

<p>I then come to the other sporting issues, and I presume that what the hon. members are interested in in that regard are firstly rugby and secondly cricket. I want to make my attitude quite clear. In the first place I start off with the question of rugby. I am going to speak very slowly, because I do not want hon. members to misunderstand me and to ascribe words to me which I did not use. I regret that this matter has gone wrong, and it went wrong because <span class="col_3965-3966" refersTo="page_0598"/>sports writers and newspapers and others did not see the matter correctly in principle, did not see it correctly historically, and I shall tell hon. members why.</p>

<p>We do not have rugby ties with the whole world or with everybody who plays rugby. There are many countries which play rugby but with which we have no ties, and with which I do not believe it is either necessary or advantageous to form rugby ties at this stage, just as we do not have relations with all countries that play cricket. We have no relations with the West Indies, India or Pakistan. In respect of this matter it was my publicly stated attitude that we had no such ties in the past, nor did I regard it as necessary that we should have them in future. I was not the only one to see matters in that light. In other words, as far as these branches of sport are concerned, it is my attitude that we have enough and all I am concerned with is to maintain and if possible to retain the traditional, existing sporting ties. Now in respect of rugby I want to make it quite clear that we had rugby relations, formed in the distant past, with the British, the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish, the French, the Australians and the New Zealanders, and later with the Argentinians, and at one stage with the people of Kenya. The latter relations lapsed for obvious reasons. If I put it to you that we had sporting relations with the New Zealanders, then it was wrong to drag the Maori question into this matter at all, because we had no sporting relations with Maoris as such. We did not have them in the past nor shall we have them in future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But they are New Zealanders.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Give me a chance to complete my argument. The hon. member runs himself to a standstill before the race has started. I say we had no traditional relations with Maoris, and I shall tell the hon. member why. It is because the New Zealanders themselves distinguished between Maoris and Pakehas, as they call the White people. I wonder whether the hon. member is aware of the fact that the first touring team ever to leave New Zealand was a Maori team; they were not Whites. That was as early as 1898. I shall now skip quite a few tours, but in 1924 an All Black team visited Britain, and immediately afterwards, in 1926, a purely Maori team toured Britain. In 1948 a Maori team visited the Fiji Islands, and a team visited Australia in 1949, and Fiji again in 1954, and teams visited New Zealand specially to play against the Maoris. I am now dealing with remote background history. Now, it is true, and this is the only way one can view it, that the Whites of South Africa, as organized in the South African Rugby Board, had traditional rugby relations with these countries, <i>inter alia</i> with New Zealanders. It is true that the 1929 touring team included two Maoris or people of Maori blood. I understand that on the 1949 tour there were at least three who had Maori blood. On the later tour, in 1960, there were also at least three who had Maori blood. These people see the matter differently from us and that is no concern of mine. I do not want to quarrel with that. That is their business. We received those people and we treated them as any other members of the New Zealand touring team were treated in South Africa. There were no problems and there were no difficulties in that regard. Now it so happens that in the past our pattern here in South Africa, namely that White and non-White do not compete against each other, was known to everybody with whom we had those relations, and I want to make it quite clear that we have been set the ultimatum before that our Springbok team would not be welcome unless it included all race groups. If that demand is made of us and is attached as a condition for the continuation of sporting relations, then I say: I am not prepared to comply with that condition, because that is exclusively our own affair. Now the hon. member for Yeoville must listen to me. I want him to understand me quite correctly. In the past we had traditional relations with the All Black team and in that regard we do not want to prescribe to them, nor have we ever done that.</p>

<p>Would the hon. member just wait until I have finished my speech&#x003F; Our South African Rugby Board extended the invitations with the knowledge, in the case of the 1960 tour, of myself, as Deputy Minister charged with education matters at the time. I have gone into the entire history and traditionally&#x2014;and now I am again speaking slowly for the benefit of the hon. member for Yeoville, who now wants to suck poison; and I may give him the assurance that he will not find a drop of poison apart from that which is already on his tongue&#x2014;we have never prescribed to those people whom they may or may not select. That was left to the sound judgment of the rugby administrators in New Zealand. That is what I want to do. I want to make it quite clear, however, that if politicians take a hand in the matter with the object of clouding relations between countries or of dragging sport into politics, as they did in 1963, or of creating domestic difficulties in that way, I would not hesitate to adopt the attitude adopted by my predecessor at Loskop, because then we would not be serving the interests of sport. Then one is not seeking to foster sporting relations between countries, then one is seeking to politicize and to play politics. Then one is seeking to cloud relations and to antagonize countries. I want to make it quite clear that no matter how set I, as a sportsman myself, am on preserving these sport relations, I dare not allow sound relations between my country and that country and sound relations in my own country to be made subservient to sporting matters. It appears to me as though the hon. member for Yeoville does not understand that.</p>

<p>I have set it out in detail for the hon. member. [Interjections.] No, the hon. member is not asking that for the purposes of information. He wants to make political capital out of that. If the hon. member wants to make political capital out of that, then I invite him in advance to enter this debate, and then he may cloud sporting relations in South Africa as much as he likes through his political intervention, because that is his intention. The hon. member is not seeking a solution; the hon. member is seeking a few crumbs&#x2014;and I grant him those crumbs&#x2014; which are to fall from the political table. Very few crumbs have fallen in recent years. I therefore state it as my attitude in this regard that in view of the fact that in the past invitations were not extended by Government bodies, but that invitations to teams to visit us were always extended by the various sporting bodies, invitations will&#x2014;that is how I visualize it&#x2014; continue to be extended by those sporting bodies. If they are asked. &#x2018;&#x2018;What is the attitude of your Government on the matter&#x003F;&#x201D; they will have no reservations in saying: &#x201C;Our Government does not prescribe whom you may select and whom you may not select, because our Government is not your selection committee.&#x201D; We leave that to the sound judgment of the sport administrators in the country which is invited to South Africa. But I want the hon. member for Yeoville to understand quite clearly, if he enters this debate, that that attitude of mine is subject to the condition that relations between that country and my country shall not be clouded as a result, and that relations in my own country shall not be harmed as a result. I believe this will remove any doubts anybody may entertain on the attitude of the Government. I believe that this is the answer to the problems we have experienced in this regard. But I believe that one thing is not the answer, and that is what people tried to do in the past, which was to name an individual lone before a tour was to take place, and to say: &#x201C;Will you or will you not receive him&#x003F;&#x201D; I do not think that serves the interests of sport in South Africa. It is the kind of question which is asked purely to cause difficulties where no difficulties exist. As far as rugby matters are concerned, I want to say that I am quite prepared to leave these rugby matters to New Zealand and to South Africa in the belief and the knowledge that they will iron out their difficulties in that connection. There is to be no tour this year in any case. The French are coming here this year, the British are coming next year and the Australians the year after. I shall regret it if, with a view to the times that lie ahead, people will now go out of their way to make mischief in this regard where no mischief should be made. I believe that sport can make a tremendous contribution towards improving relations between countries. I believe that this attitude of the Government&#x2014;and if there is any doubt about it and if the Leader of the Opposition does not have enough clarity on the matter, then he should not hesitate to ask me about it&#x2014;as also the other actions of the Government to which I shall come later in this debate, will be of great benefit to South Africa, as they have been in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Prime Minister displayed a surprising degree of irritability and an exaggerated sensitiveness here this afternoon, something which I find a great pity. I can only arrive at the conclusion that his irritability was actually directed at people in his own group. The hon. the Prime Minister wants his own way in everything. They can drag anything into politics. Then it is all good and proper. But look out if the Opposition should &#x201C;drag something into politics&#x201D;. Then he explodes into righteous indignation. I must tell the hon. the Prime Minister that we are not prepared to accept his double standard. If we say something we always hear that it is integration, but if they subsequently do something we recommended, then they do not think of it as integration. We would like there to be one standard only. Then we would be prepared to play the game. Let me now as a member who, as the hon. the Prime Minister said, &#x201C;became a United Party man again&#x201D; exchange a few words with him as a member who became a Nationalist again. Both of us belong to a club in this House. It is time the hon. the Prime Minister realized it. It is quite a large club. To that club belongs, amongst others, as I see them here, the hon. the Minister of Transport, the hon. member for Umaruru, the Deputy Minister for South-West Africa, the Deputy Minister for Bantu Administration, the lion, members for Queenstown, Krugersdorp, Christiana, Turffontein, the hon. the Minister of Sport and the hon. the Minister of Immigration. It is a large club, and I do not think it behoves any member of the club to point a finger at another member of the club.</p>

<p>In the ten minutes at my disposal I had hoped to deal with other matters, but I now have to deal first with a few points which the hon. the Prime Minister has raised. The first is the so-called clash on Coloured Affairs between myself and other members of the Opposition which he sketched here. Why does the hon. the Prime Minister not try to deal with the matter in its entirety&#x003F; The policy of this side is clear. It is that the Coloureds who were on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll must be restored to that roll. Another point in the policy is that the northern Coloureds who were never on any Voters&#x2019; Roll must be represented in this Parliament on a basis of group representation &#x2026; [Interjections.] Give me a chance. I only have ten minutes. The difficulty is that those hon. members themselves set up a policy for us and then want to shoot it down. It is stated in back and white. It has been stated there for years. They are never prepared to state our policy correctly. They are entitled to say that our policy is wrong, that they do <span class="col_3969-3970" refersTo="page_0600"/>not agree with it. But then they must first state the policy correctly before they criticize it. The first point is the restoration of those who were on the roll. They are only a limited number now. Then, in respect of those in the Cape and Natal, who were not on the roll, various points have remained an open question in the policy of the party. I am not dealing now with right or wrong. I am just dealing with the facts of the policy. The northern Coloureds must be represented on a basis of group representation in Parliament &#x2026;</p>

<p>The policy is that if a Coloured is elected he can come and sit here. Where is the clash&#x003F; I have stated here in Parliament that in principle I am not opposed to restoring those who were on the list. Coming to the general question of all the Coloureds in South Africa my attitude has always been that the Coloureds of South Africa would themselves prefer&#x2014;this is an opinion&#x2014;to be represented by their own people on the basis of group representation. What is the attitude of my party in this connection&#x003F; The party has always adopted the attitude that it wants to interpret the will of the Coloureds, but it is obvious that, if I am correct in my opinion&#x2014;namely that the Coloureds themselves would prefer to be represented on a basis of group representation throughout South Africa by their own people &#x2014;the party would not be opposed to that, because its basic policy is one of consultation. One does not give a person something he does not want. There is no clash therefore.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister referred to derogatory remarks I allegedly made. Of course, if I want to be derogatory, I will be. But I now want to ask the Prime Minister who was more derogatory than he this afternoon&#x003F; He must not be so sensitive in the position in which he finds himself. Does he claim for himself the sole right of being derogatory towards me, but that I may not be derogatory in politics towards him&#x003F; Nor was I being derogatory in regard to the question of the Mount Nelson. I will tell the Prime Minister what my attitude is, and it would be a good thing if he would realize what our feelings in regard to the matter are. We take exception to the fact that we are continually being accused of being integrationists. It is being done in a derogatory way by the other side, and then the Government subsequently does the very things for which we are being berated. I shall mention a practical example.</p>

<p>We had this afternoon a very important statement from the Prime Minister in regard to sport.</p>

<p>I am talking about it now. It cannot be denied that the attitude which the Prime Minister has now adopted is in direct conflict with the attitude which the former Prime Minister adopted. I do not want to read out a lot of statements. But here is the speech made by the former Prime Minister at Loskop. It was reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of 6th September, 1965. <i>Die Burger&#x2019;s</i> headline was (translation): &#x201C;All Blacks never again in South Africa. Team with Maoris not permissible.&#x201D; It was stated clearly by the Prime Minister and it was repeated in plain language by the hon. the Minister of Education, who was then Minister of the Interior. [Interjections.] The report begins as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An All Black team with Maori members will not be allowed into South Africa. This much is clear from a statement made by the Prime Minister, Dr. H. F. Verwoerd, at the Loskop Dam.</block>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat tried to make the point that the attitude which the hon. the Prime Minister is now adopting in respect of international sport is completely at variance with that of the former Prime Minister. He then referred specifically to the speech made at Loskop Dam. If the hon. member and other hon. members on that side of the House had listened to what the Prime Minister said this afternoon, surely it ought to have been clear to all of them what the position was. The National Party still adheres to the principle to which it has always adhered, in spite of that peculiarly worded motion in regard international sport which the Opposition moved in another debate earlier on in the year. The Government still adheres to the principle that we do not prescribe to the sports teams of any other country how they must make up their teams. Hon. members should have listened to what the Prime Minister had to say, i.e. that if he is forced to do so, as did happen on that occasion to which they referred when the former Prime Minister made the statement &#x2014;by. people abroad with politically ulterior motives&#x2014;and I see many of them sitting in this House this afternoon &#x2026;</p>

<p>Let it be the same old story. There are many old stories which could bear repeating and have very good results. It seems to me one can tell hon. members of the Opposition the same story every day and <span class="col_3971-3972" refersTo="page_0601"/>they will still not understand it. In fact, they have never yet understood their own policy. The Prime Minister stated very, very clearly that if there should be a repetition of what has happened in the past, i.e. that people with political motives, as opposed to people who only have the best interests of sport at heart, should once again force us into unenviable positions, he would adopt the same attitude as that adopted by the former Prime Minister. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout read here from newspaper headlines which states: &#x201C;All Blacks never again in South Africa&#x2014;Black Maoris not permissible.&#x201D; He was reading to us inferences which had been made by newspapers. He was not stating the point of view stated by the former Prime Minister.</p>

<p>If the hon. member in the corner there would just for once try to follow one&#x2019;s argument then he might also come to understand at long last what his own party&#x2019;s policy is. I say that I am sorry to see that the same attitude is being displayed by hon. members of the Opposition in regard to a matter which could have so much significance for our country, i.e. the matter of international sport. It is a field in which our country has attained so many achievements and a field in which one looks forward to continued relations. I have noticed this afternoon the same attitude which was noticeable here in a previous debate when the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;and we know enough about his sportmanship&#x2014;formulated an amendment here on international sport. He set in motion here a debate which was exclusively aimed at dragging this matter into politics.</p>

<p>On that occasion the hon. member for Johannesburg (North)&#x2014;whom I regret to say is not present here now that I am mentioning his name&#x2014;had a few things to say about sport which made me realize that he himself did not know what this matter was all about. And yet he is a man who has a knowledge of sport, <i>inter alia,</i> he said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We know that for many years South African table tennis had been completely isolated. As far as football is concerned &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here of course he means soccer, the game which he knows a great deal about&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we know that professional as well as amateur soccer is completely isolated to-day from world competition.</block>

<p>Factually he is quite correct here. But now he takes his argument further and states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although we do still occasionally participate in test cricket we are no longer a member of the International Cricket Conference.</block>

<p>Are we no longer a member of this conference as a result of steps taken in regard to sport on the part of this Government, or is it because we are no longer a member of the Commonwealth&#x003F; The International Cricket Conference is linked up with the Commonwealth; its constitution is very closely associated with that of the Commonwealth. Now the hon. member for Johannesburg, who, as I said, is a sportsman, came along and reproached the Government for allegedly being instrumental in our being ousted from international competition, specifically cricket. That is not the case because the past few cricket test series were proceeded with unhindered. But the hon. member said here that we were being forced out of cricket on account of the Government&#x2019;s policy. I maintain that those kind of remarks draw attention to the fact that hon. members, when they attack the Government on occasions such as this one, do not have the best interests of sport at heart. I say the same thing in regard to hostile bodies abroad who have often in the past tried to embarrass us, knowing what our domestic views are.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point says I am talking nonsense. Now, if I am talking nonsense, then I wonder if the hon. member knows what sense looks like. I do not think the hon. member knows what the difference between sense and nonsense is. I say that for the sake of domestic peace and order, quite apart from tradition, we have a system here in South Africa where no mixed sport is allowed. Hon. members on that side of the House agree with that&#x2014;they say that it should be so. Now I am telling the hon. member for Green Point that there are people abroad who do not like that. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) can also testify to that fact. The International Soccer Organization&#x2014;known as F.I.F.A.&#x2014;do not like the fact that we apply a policy of sport apartheid within South Africa.</p>

<p>What has that to do with the matter&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>It has a lot to do with it. The body with which the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has had a lot to do, the International Soccer Association, did not suspend South Africa&#x2014;this is something about which the hon. member is complaining here &#x2014;as a result of a statement made by a former Prime Minister in regard to international <span class="col_3973-3974" refersTo="page_0602"/>sport. It suspended the S.A. Soccer Association because within South Africa itself apartheid, separateness, is maintained when soccer is played. If the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) is not aware of that either, then I say he is very stupid in regard to what is actually taking place.</p>

<p>Now I say that, as in the case of that sporting body which controls soccer&#x2014;in the same way so there are people elsewhere in the world who have nothing to do with the welfare of sport, specifically also this organization SANROC, the non-white South African Sport Association with its headquarters in London and whose big boss was a certain Mr. Harris, the man who planted a bomb on the Johannesburg Station&#x2014;who want to use sport in South Africa to get at its traditional way of life. They are the enemies of South Africa. That is why one finds it a pity that hon. members of the Opposition, when they participate in such a debate, do not speak with a thorough understanding of these matters. One would expect them not to play along with, and that they would do nothing which would be grist to the mill of those people, and would encourage them. One would rather expect the Opposition to share in the Government&#x2019;s attempt to keep a matter such as international sport, something which really does not have anything to do with politics, at a level above that of politics. Then we in South Africa, all of us, United Party and National Party, white and non-white&#x2014;also our non-white sportsmen&#x2014;would be able to derive the best benefits for South Africa in international competition. It is a pity that hon. members of the Opposition cannot, or will not, participate in a discussion of this nature in such a vein. They prefer clutching at straws to try to make political capital. What does it really matter to us what was said on some or other occasion in the past&#x003F; Surely hon. members know and they have confessed it here in this House, that our tradition and our practical participation in sport in South Africa, for the sake of many other matters, is one of no inter-mingling and it is important that this should be the case. Does it not suit the purpose of hon. members of the Opposition to try and help us to try and bring about an understanding of this situation abroad, as well as amongst our sporting friends overseas&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch is quite wrong when he states that I only quote here from newspaper headlines; it is not so. Let me quote to him what the former Minister of the Interior, Senator de Klerk, said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Recently I again discussed the problem frankly with Dr. Craven and others and informed him in unambiguous terms that Maoris would not be acceptable as members of a touring team.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the Government announces a change of policy, let it admit that it has come to view the matter in another light. It is not our intention to make political capital out of it if we can reach that stage in our domestic politics where we can accept each other&#x2019;s politics honestly, as it is, and criticize it on that basis without these kind of labels which we are continually trying to attach to one another. When we said that Senator De Klerk and the Government were wrong, that we ought to allow New Zealand to select its own team, what was the reply we got in return&#x003F; I am quoting again from what the former Minister of the Interior said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The survival of and maintenance of order within white South Africa is of primary interest &#x2026;</block>

<p>We have no objection to that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It does not allow of any concession to the United Party&#x2019;s policy of integration.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The former Minister of the Interior, Senator De Klerk said the following in regard to this question of the Maoris: &#x201C;We cannot tolerate this integration policy of the United Party&#x201D;. What does that hon. member expect us as an Opposition to do&#x003F; Must we always sit quietly and simply endure the punishment&#x003F; When the attitude which we adopted has been justified, after we have been berated for being integrationists, must we not avail ourselves of the same methods&#x003F; We have all been in politics long enough to know that if one metes out punishment of a certain kind you are going to be repaid in your own coin. I am telling the hon. the Prime Minister in a very friendly way that he is going to have a difficult task. We have one norm only and that is: Is he acting in the interests of South Africa, yes or no&#x003F; We were right in our view that the Government was playing into the hands of our enemies and that is why we warned them: &#x201C;Do not play into the hands of our enemies&#x201D;. All that we are asking is that there should not be a double standard. But if we are going to get this kind of politics from the Government side then I am afraid that we are going to dish out the same kind of politics to them. It will be of no avail the hon. member for Stellenbosch and the hon. the Prime Minister accusing us of dragging sport into politics because we have most certainly never dragged sport into politics. Our attitude has consistently been that a government should not in any way interfere with sport. The tradition in South Africa has always been that of separate sport; that is what the public wants. Public feeling in South Africa is so strong that it will <span class="col_3975-3976" refersTo="page_0603"/>not accept mixed sport. Why cannot the Government trust the sporting bodies&#x003F; Surely there are times when one must be able to trust public opinion. Public opinion is either against mixed sport or it is in favour of it. If we are convinced, and if the Government is convinced that it is against mixed sport why must the Government make statements and try to steer matters in a certain direction&#x003F; Our attitude has always been the following: Leave sport to the public sporting bodies which will not be able to go against public opinion. That is still our attitude.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>We shall hold thumbs, and we sincerely hope that in the interest of South Africa the statements made by the hon. the Prime Minister will get us through our difficulties. We are satisfied with what he said here this afternoon although what we should like to see is that the Government adopt the attitude that it is not going to interfere in any way with sport in South Africa. If things go wrong and our sportsmen and women are not accepted for the Olympic Games or other international competitions, then the Government will be in the strong position that it can say that it had nothing to do with it, that it is a matter which is in the hands of public opinion and the sporting bodies in South Africa. I do not think that the Government will at this stage accept this advice, but in any case it remains our attitude that a Government should refrain from interfering in any way in sport.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to certain matters in regard to South-West Africa. Just as in the case of sport, the policy of the Government has, in this respect as well, undergone a surprising metamorphosis in the field of foreign affairs and South-West Africa, and one example is the publication of the <i>South-West African Survey.</i> I want to tell the hon. Minister that it is a very good product. I think he should compel each one of his members to read it because here the race policy of the Government is placed in a very different light than it has been up to now. After all, we all know what is happening; we all know that the actual formulation of domestic policy has now passed into the hands of the Department of Foreign Affairs. That is a very good thing; it is in good hands. We are glad that the Government has men such as Advocate Dawid de Villiers and others to keep a watchful eye on the formulation of policy so that our policy is now being presented in such a way that it is at least understandable overseas. I do not want to quote and read out here but there is no doubt at all that the policy is being presented in quite a different light than it has been presented up to now. This <i>South-West African Survey</i> is a very fine piece of work although it has its deficiencies. I cannot help taking a personal interest in it. For years I have been pleading in this House for the publication of a year-book for South-West Africa. In fact I even went so far as to establish a company in 1959 to publish a private year-book. I even had the &#x201C;dummy&#x201D; printed; here it is, <i>South-West African Survey,</i> 1959. The Government has even taken my copyright without expressing a word of thanks! But in the interests of South Africa we are glad that this stage has been reached. Hon. members must forgive me if it affords me a measure of satisfaction, but is this not a lesson to the Government that they should pay more heed to what the Opposition has to say&#x003F; What do we find to-day&#x003F; If you go to overseas libraries, throughout the world, what do you find on the shelves&#x003F; If a student wants to make a study of South-West Africa then they have to rely on books such as the one written by the communist Ruth First, entitled <i>South-West Africa.</i> They have on the shelves their books such as <i>Brutal Mandate</i> by Loewenstein. There are the numerous one-sided reports drawn up by the U.N. on South-West Africa containing nothing which is sympathetic to or which gives the facts on South-West Africa. For eight years we have been pleading, not that a report be made to the United Nations, but that information be made available there, as is now being done in this case. Even if it is late, one is at least grateful that we have at least reached this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to the handling of the cases in regard to Ovamboland, and also referred to the degree to which we support it. I should like to subscribe to what he said and put it to the hon. the Prime Minister that as far as the southern part is concerned, I think the hon. the Prime Minister must reconsider the matter. Mr. Chairman, I have said that this report is a good one, but there remains this problem that in some respects it is a little too clever, because in certain respects there is a conflict between the economic section and the political section. One must never underestimate one&#x2019;s readers. It is of no avail referring in one section to the progress towards &#x201C;independence&#x201D; by areas such as Damaraland and Namaland and Rehoboth if it is stated quite clearly in the economic section that it is totally impossible for the entire South-West Africa to become independent from the Republic. How will small areas like the two mentioned be able to progress towards independence&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<block name="quote">Although his Party accepted the findings of the Van Zyl Commission of 1936, i.e. that the Republic had the right to administer the Territory in its discretion, subject to the terms of the mandate, even to the extent of dealing with the Territory as a fifth province, he nevertheless believes that the alternative proposals to South-West Africa in order to ensure a favourable reaction abroad, are to be found in his Party&#x2019;s policy of race federation.</block>

<p>In the same year the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this House about the independence of those areas. In his speech here in the House of Assembly during the period May, 1964, Sir De Villiers Graaff repeated these points with this exception that he used the word &#x201C;independence&#x201D; in respect of Ovamboland and the northern regions. [Interjections.] It stand in Hansard. [Interjections.] Good, we agree on the northern regions. If it becomes a Bantu homeland, there is no danger of communist intervention as it was alleged there would have been in other homelands. But the southern part must also become a federation. I am reading what he said in regard to the south. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The speaker wants to state clearly in respect of this region that his Party is prepared to consider, on its merits in each instance, the expansion of the powers of this local legislative council of the basis of a race federation so that the various groups will have representation and the powers of local authorities will be expanded by means of joint boards so that the various groups will be able to decide on all matters affecting them intimately.</block>

<p>I am quoting from <i>Die Suidwes-Afrikaner.</i> He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We feel that while we are responsible for them the southern region must at the present moment, and the northern region in time, have a relationship with the Republic which will contain the elements of a federal system and which will make provision for representation in the Central Parliament of the Republic.</block>

<p>Let us analyse this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggests that the northern regions must become a federation, whether they are independent or not, and the southern <span class="col_3979-3980" refersTo="page_0605"/>region must form a federation, and then the two federations, the northern and the southern federations, must be integrated on a federal basis with the Central Parliament. He states that all the population groups in question in the south must then receive representation in the legislative assembly so that they can decide their own affairs. Now I am putting it to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: If those two federal elements must obtain representation in this Central Parliament, who must represent them here&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but then they are separate and have their own government. No, the hon. member cannot evade the issue. Remember, one has various elements forming the federal government. Who represents other federations in their federal parliament&#x003F; Is it done by people other than one&#x2019;s own people&#x003F; Does it happen everywhere&#x003F; Is it so in America, or in Australia, and was it so in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland&#x003F; Did their own elected representatives represent them in the central parliament&#x003F; We are now discussing the policy, and we want clarity in regard to that policy. I as a South-Westerner want to know the following: If the two federations of South-West Africa are going to get representation in this federal Parliament here, who is going to represent them here&#x003F; The hon. member said that if it were to happen, if their policy of race federation were to be applied, it would be acceptable to the outside world. I want to tell him now that if Ovamboland and the northern sections are not represented by Ovambos in this Central Parliament he can forget about the world ever accepting it. And if the southern part is not represented here by the population groups constituting that legislative assembly, he can forget about the outside world accepting that too. What it amounts to is that their Central Parliament here, which then becomes a federal Parliament, will be a mixed parliament, and that is the final outcome of their race federation.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will forgive me if I do not follow him. His speech will no doubt be dealt with, but I really want to deal with a matter of policy in so far as the Prime Minister is concerned. I want to deal at once with the point mentioned by my hon. Leader when he mentioned the Oxbow scheme. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs will, I am sure, not accuse me of discourtesy if I raise this matter under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. I do so very much for this reason, that last year, when the Prime Minister&#x2019;s predecessor was dealing with certain questions particularly in regard to the Tugela and Oxbow, in the Hansard at Col. 117, of 26th January, I said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The position then is that already the Prime Minister is seeing us negotiating on a treaty level, as an international agreement with the Bantu states.</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister We will have to do it with Basutoland and Swaziland.</block>

<p>The matter was taken up in this House on 7th October last year, after there had been a rather untoward incident in regard to the presentation of a gift by this Government to the new Parliament of Lesotho. The matter was raised then specifically in regard to the Oxbow scheme, and the present Minister of Water Affairs then said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have taken a personal interest in the Oxbow scheme for many years. When I was still Administrator of the Free State I was invited by the Commissioner and was taken up into the mountains so that I might see the scheme myself. We must take care that a bonfire will not be made of our future interests. If I had anything to say at this stage&#x2014;but I do not&#x2014;I would never want to be dependent on a foreign country&#x2019;s water without having an alternative source where I can open the tap the day the other tap is closed.</block>

<p>This Session we referred to that in a Private Member&#x2019;s motion and asked whether he still stood by it, that he is not prepared to negotiate as far as the Oxbow scheme is concerned, with a foreign country on which we may be dependent, and he said he still stood by it. Now, let me for a moment leave that. I want to quote from the report on South-West Africa, which I also want to give full praise to. But for a moment I would like hon. members to listen to what I am going to say as referring to the different states in Southern Africa, and not the different tribes in South-West, because I think it is absolutely applicable. This is at page 49&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, at this stage it is impossible to foresee with any degree of accuracy the ultimate inter-action of the various population groups. Circumstances will alter rapidly. What is considered anathema to-day may well become sound practical politics tomorrow, and vice versa.</block>

<p>I say that we are dealing with this question of the Oxbow scheme, and in the Press it has been reported that we are negotiating also with the Portuguese authorities with regard to the Rucana Falls scheme and a new scheme on <span class="col_3981-3982" refersTo="page_0606"/>the Zambesi. I am asking the Prime Minister for a definition of policy here. I am not criticizing what has appeared in the Press or what has been said by the Minister of Water Affairs. Far from it. I am saying that the late Prime Minister said these were matters for treaty and international agreement. I realize&#x2014; no one better&#x2014;that in South Africa we may have a policy in respect to our neighbours, determined on two totally different grounds. We may have a policy based on solid principles of economics. We adopt that policy because for economic reasons it pays us to do so. Or there may be a policy based on different grounds, which have nothing to do with economics at all. It may be a good neighbour policy in relation to our neighbouring states, and because of this policy or that policy, an economic policy or a good neighbour policy, or a conjunction of both, we may follow a certain line. It is quite clear that the Minister of Water Affairs does not like the idea that we are to be dependent on Oxbow, and I emphasize the word &#x201C;dependent&#x201D;. It may well be that we can assist in regard to Oxbow, but that we do not want to be dependent on it, and the same applies to the Rucana Falls scheme and the same may apply to the Zambesi scheme. The hon. the Deputy Minister for South-West Africa Affairs talks about independence for Ovamboland, but what about the Rucana Falls scheme&#x003F; Are they, as was recommended in the Odendaal Report, to be established on the other side of the river, costing many millions of rand&#x003F; What is to be our policy&#x003F; Is it to be based upon a good neighbour policy&#x003F; My leader said, and I agree with him entirely, that we must try to find a method of dealing with our neighbours so as to create good neighbourliness. Some seven or eight years ago I had the advantage of being in India at a Commonwealth Conference and I listened to delegate after delegate from what was then the Commonwealth standing up and condemning Britain for what they called exploitation&#x2014;exploitation up to the time they got independence, and almost the same delegates in almost the same breath said that now they want Britain to aid them. Eventually I was constrained to say that it seemed to me that what was financial assistance before independence was called exploitation today, and the same financial assistance to-day was now to be called aid. It was another name for the same thing. What risks do we run&#x003F; This is the point I want to make, and I want to make it as pungently as I can. What risk do we run that the help we may be giving now, which is called aid, may later be called exploitation&#x003F; As they say in the <i>South-West Africa Survey,</i> what is anathema to-day may be good common sense to-morrow, and vice versa. What guarantee have we got in regard to the aid we are giving, be it in whatever form, not necessarily money&#x2014;it may be given as assistance to develop this kind of work which is suggested at Oxbow and at Rucana Falls and for the Zambesi. Is that kind of thing going to lead to an accusation that we are guilty of this new colonialism&#x003F; People may then dislike us and use just any language. This word has lost its meaning in financial circles to-day. When you read the messages that come from overseas, you ask yourself how far can language be distorted&#x003F; It is absurd. We could give aid with the best intentions in the world, and then be accused of neo-colonialism. Is that where we go from here&#x003F; How can we safeguard ourselves&#x003F; What kind of insurance can South Africa have that we will not be treated that way&#x003F; We see to-day&#x2019;s political set-up. We see certain nations which claim to be stable, but are they&#x003F; What happens if there is a change of Government in our neighbouring countries&#x003F; What was approved of by the present Government might be destroyed by a new Government which suddenly comes into power. That has happened elsewhere in Africa. We need not go further than Tanzania. Compare the policies they followed there after they got independence with the policies they adopted after they consolidated with Zanzibar. That is the point I want to put to the Prime Minister. What is our policy in regard to these huge water works upon which it appears that millions of rands will have to be spent&#x003F; Are we negotiating on the basis of a good neighbour policy, to help to make those countries more viable, or is it purely an economic policy&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast advanced arguments which I think he himself did not understand. I think the hon. member should simply accept it as a fact that we lack certain facilities in Africa, for example for the provision of electricity, which is necessary for the establishment of industries and an orderly civilization. Now it so happens that in Southern Africa we have certain rivers on which certain schemes may be established. A scheme such as that on the Kunene and other schemes on our borders are not only of great importance to South Africa, but are also conducive to the establishment of interests which may be to the benefit of other areas. Before any scheme of this nature can be initiated, a thorough investigation must first be instituted and it must be ascertained that it will be possible for the states involved to utilize the projects concerned advantageously, in the remote future as well. And there, I think, we may drop the argument of the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>Some while ago the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a remark to which I want to refer in passing. In the course of his speech he referred to members on this side of the House who had formerly not been members of the National Party. Now I want to tell the hon. member that it is certainly not a disgrace to change one&#x2019;s views at some stage of one&#x2019;s career and to throw in one&#x2019;s weight with the party which in one&#x2019;s opinion is following the right course. I hold it against the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that he is perhaps the only member in this House who on some occasions adapts his principles to his <span class="col_3983-3984" refersTo="page_0607"/>party and on other occasions his party to his principles. That I hold against him.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with some statements made here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He spoke of our &#x201C;changing image&#x201D; abroad. He quoted, <i>inter alia,</i> what Palmer and others had said. I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition that the course adopted by our present Prime Minister does not diverge an inch from the policy we have been following for years. What did happen, was that as a result of the propaganda of the United Party the outside world received an erroneous impression of our present Prime Minister. To prove that I want to quote some extracts from reports written by two newspapers immediately after he became Prime Minister. The <i>London Times</i> said that Mr. Vorster showed a strong similarity with the Chinese communist Leader Mao Tse Tung. Whereas the latter saw saboteurs of the pure revolutionary state everywhere, Mr. Vorster saw secret enemies everywhere. Like Mao&#x2019;s Red Guards, who acted against the revisionists, Mr. Vorster had his effective military and police apparatus. The <i>New York Times</i> said that South Africa had treated world opinion with the utmost contempt by electing Mr. Vorster as Prime Minister. It said that in their fear South Africa&#x2019;s Nationalists had handed the reins to the most extremistic, ruthless, totalitarian of their party leaders. The newspaper also said that his election almost certainly meant that South Africa would move more rapidly towards total isolation and ultimate conflict with the major part of the world. That, the newspaper said, was a further setback for the hope of a peaceful solution for South Africa. It goes without saying that now that this image, which the Opposition gave to the outside world, has not been validated, the outside world will in fact be under the impression that there has been a change and that our present Prime Minister has experienced a change of heart&#x2014;since he is not as cruel as they said he was. In the same breath with which he referred to our image, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to consultations with Jonathan. Now I want to say that it is generally considered in South Africa and also abroad that a break-through has been made in respect of our relations with African states. But it is no break-through in our policy of separate development. On the contrary, it is a break-through which is in fact made possible by our policy of separate development. It is therefore no new policy. Our policy of separate development and our relations with the various states in Africa, as initiated by the previous Prime Minister and pursued by the present Prime Minister, were followed even in the Transvaal Republic, which received missions from Bantu territories and even sent diplomats to Bantu states. Let me give some examples of this. On 12th July, 1864, it was announced in the <i>Government Gazette</i> of the old Transvaal Republic that the hon. J. M. de Beer had been appointed as diplomatic agent among the tribes in the Lydenburg district; in respect of Soutpansberg, Mr. Schoeman was appointed as diplomatic representative on 17th April, 1868. In 1887 a treaty was concluded with the Matabeles, of which section 6 provided that the State President would appoint a person to reside in the territory of Chief Lobengula as consul, to keep an eye on the local subjects of the Transvaal Republic. It was also provided that such a person would be afforded the necessary protection, both as regards his person and his property. It is still the same policy which this Government is following at present. It should also be borne in mind that the attitude advocated by the party on this side of the House could achieve virtually no stature in the world for a long period, even up to 1948, because we were still a dependency, so to speak. For that reason it could not develop its policy.</p>

<p>We achieved our so-called sovereignty in 1931, but despite that the sword of Britain still remained over our heads. We need not try to get away from that. It was only after we became a Republic and left the Commonwealth that this party could proceed to develop its sound policy towards African states. Hence this notion that we are now engaged in a change of policy. I say that what is taking place at present in respect of our relations with African states is the logical and natural consequence of our policy of separate development. This policy envisages, firstly, assistance to the Bantu nations in the exploitation of their economic potential and with a view to raising the standard of living of the inhabitants of those homelands and, secondly, establishing a stable, independent and responsible economic and political structure.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down has given us a most interesting account of certain events in history which he remembers and which are important in his view, but it is always very difficult to attach due weight to such an argument if its entire premise is marred by such an allegation as that South Africa was still fettered and a dependency as late as 1948. What a slight that is on the legends of General Hertzog and the previous Nationalist Party, who governed South Africa as a sovereign, independent state until 1933! Hon. members on the opposite side would have us believe that a man like General Hertzog and the Cabinet which he led in those years and afterwards, until 1933, were contented to take a subservient, subordinate, inferior position among the states of the world. I simply refuse to accept that, because I have more respect for General Hertzog and his memory than for hon. members on the opposite side. [Interjections.] Now we are also to assume that we misunderstood the history of South Africa. The hon. member for Middelland has forgotten <span class="col_3985-3986" refersTo="page_0608"/>how the old Nationalist Party under General Hertzog wanted to demonstrate the economic independence of South Africa in the thirties by remaining on the gold standard when they should have left it, and ruined South Africa in the process. They had all right to follow a policy completely different from that of England. Nobody could dispute that. I hope that if we are to argue this&#x2014;it is an interesting argument&#x2014;we shall maintain a slightly higher intellectual standard. The hon. member for Middelland is capable of doing so, perhaps more so than most members in the House.</p>

<p>I was most grateful when the hon. the Prime Minister virtually insisted that I should enter the debate. For that reason I am now doing so. I co-operate gladly. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that we on this side of the House are particularly appreciative, firstly of the detailed exposition we have received from him of the sport policy of the Government under his Prime Minister ship. We really feel that it points to great progress. It is just a pity that the hon. the Prime Minister apparently refuses to admit that there were in fact policy changes in South Africa during the past year. That is why I was so interested in a speech made by the previous Prime Minister at Loskop in September, 1965, because there the Nationalist Party policy in respect of sport was set out differently. I have the same report here which my friend the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had. It is a remarkably lucid report. <i>Die Burger</i> says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African rugby leaders had hoped that the Government would adopt a flexible attitude on this point, in order that our rugby relations with New Zealand could be maintained. Dr. Danie Craven went to New Zealand with the message that they should send &#x201C;their best team&#x201D; in 1967. It is highly probable that the best team would have included at least a few Maoris. Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s statement puts paid to the possibility of a mixed New Zealand team.</block>

<p>Then <i>Die Burger</i> continued. It is not I who say this; it is <i>Die Burger</i> who says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s statement was a reaffirmation of the sport policy of the Government, to the effect that others, when they visit South Africa, should conform with our customs, that is, that within our boundaries Whites shall compete against Whites and non-Whites against non-Whites. In accordance with this policy a Maori team would be permitted to come and play against Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, but a mixed team of white New Zealanders and Maoris would be unacceptable.</block>

<p>Nothing could be clearer. But I do not want to take up old sores. I just want to say that the Opposition appreciates the fact that we have a new Prime Minister to-day&#x2014;a relatively young Prime Minister&#x2014;and we assume that he will impress his own personality and his own views upon the policy of the party led by him. I see no reason why he should be ashamed of that. I must say that in this respect, as regards the statement he made to-day on sport, he really has nothing to be ashamed of. But we said that before he did. As long as he lives the Prime Minister need never be ashamed of adopting the policy of the United Party. That day will never arrive. On a previous occasion during this session&#x2014;the Prime Minister will remember&#x2014;we moved an amendment. That amendment consisted of four main items, but the most important was that we should allow countries with whom we have foreign sport relations and who send teams to South Africa to select their own teams. Admittedly that was in conflict with the statement at Loskop in 1965. But now the Prime Minister says exactly the same. I want to congratulate him and I want to congratulate South Africa. I want to go further. I think it is a huge step forward. I also want to say&#x2014;I have the authority of my Leader to say that we say this on behalf of this side of the House&#x2014;that we should like to support the Prime Minister in his appeal to the Press to the effect that the Press and also other people should not make all kinds of hypothetical speculations, some four years before a team is due to come to South Africa, on what may happen to that team and on whether the team may face possible crises and disputes. We think it is not in the interests of sound sport relations in South Africa to anticipate such difficulties. In that respect we also agree with the Prime Minister. From his side he has therefore moved towards us, and now we also move a step towards him.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Prime Minister will permit me to point out to him that he&#x2014;as frequently happpens while one is speaking&#x2014; undertook to deal with this question under the heads of the various branches of sport. He mentioned that he would also deal with cricket. But I think it slipped his mind in the course of his speech. We would be very grateful if we could just know&#x2014;he need not reply across the floor; he may do so in his own way &#x2014;whether the principles which he set out with regard to rugby will apply equally to cricket. It is our sincere hope that that will be the case, but now, because he did not mention it specifically, there is some uncertainty.</p>

<p>And now I want to bring the following to his attention&#x2014;I am not speaking about sport now; I have finished with sport. While he was speaking on sport, the Prime Minister laid down a most important principle on social and similar relations between races in South Africa. He was somewhat annoyed with me when I asked him whether that was his well-considered opinion, and he affirmed that. It was of particular interest to us when the Prime Minister said today what had also been said in <i>Die Burger,</i> in an article by Dawie, some weeks ago. On Sunday there was a most interesting article by Mr. Dirk Richards, of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s <i>Dagbreek,</i> in which he set out the same attitude. I <span class="col_3987-3988" refersTo="page_0609"/>presume, therefore, that the Prime Minister has already explained this attitude of his to the Press of the Nationalist Party. They are certainly all telling the same story. The story is that one may have relations with people of other races and colours if they are not citizens of one&#x2019;s own state but citizens of another state, in which case it becomes an inter-state relation.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one pities the United Party, because it can never state its policy of its own volition but discovers it every time only after the Prime Minister or a Minister on this side has stated his policy. Thus it has happened several times in the course of this Session that the United Party discovered its policy in surprising fashion after either the Prime Minister or another Minister had spoken. Now we want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to try to forestall the Prime Minister and the Government and to state their own policy with regard to other matters. As for this sport matter to which the hon. member for Yeoville referred, I want to say that the statements to which he referred so fervently were in fact statements which coincided with and related to people who anticipated the circumstances and the times and sought statements in connection with people who would possibly come to South Africa, whether Maoris or others. I am convinced that if New Zealand selected an All Black team, whether this year or next year, which included one or two or three players of Maori descent, they would come to South Africa just as in the past, without any objection on the part of the Government or any other concern in South Africa. We are grateful that this matter was set out so strikingly by the hon. the Prime Minister to-day, so that the Opposition may also be pleased, at least as far as this matter is concerned, and may be in agreement with us on this side.</p>

<p>The hon. member will get his turn; he may let me have mine now.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to another development regarding our country&#x2019;s relations with the states of Southern Africa. I want to leave the sport issue at that and just say that in the past year, and also this year, it was obvious that a very good and favourable development took place as regards our relations with the states of Southern Africa. It is quite clear that a political and economic inter-state relationship is developing which promises much good for our future and the future of Southern Africa. In fact, Southern Africa compares very favourably with the rest of Africa, for the very reason that such good relations are developing between South Africa and the Portuguese territories and other states in Southern Africa. Here I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Midlands said a while ago when he pointed out that it was in fact South Africa&#x2019;s policy of separate development which was taking shape, which was unfolding and becoming manifest and clear to the people of Southern Africa, the various states, who see that not only is ours a country of potentiality and magnificent development, but that it is also a country which is not in the least engaged in a policy of neo-colonialism. They see that in our endeavours to achieve good relations with the states of Southern Africa we are only trying to help those states to develop peacefully and orderly, as South Africa herself in fact seeks to do. Here I may refer to the sound relations which are developing between South Africa and the former British Protectorates; I may refer to the sound relations developing between us, Rhodesia and Malawi.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to a specific group of people who have done a great deal in respect of the broad spade-work for these good relations which are developing between South Africa and other states of Southern Africa. I want to refer, namely, to the missionaries of various church denominations in South Africa who more than 70, 80 years ago left South Africa for various African territories&#x2014;Malawi, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, the Protectorates and South-West Africa. They did not go to those countries with the object of making political conquests, but with the object of founding a Christian Church there. They took with them doctors, teachers, nurses and other people, and thus laid the foundation for the development of <span class="col_3989-3990" refersTo="page_0610"/>civilization in those countries. At the recent visit of the delegation from Malawi&#x2014;and this may interest hon. members&#x2014;all three members of the delegation stated that they were members of a certain Afrikaans church in South Africa. They expressed their appreciation for what the Church had done for their country and for them personally. I mention these things in order that we may take note and appreciate the inestimable value of this silent service which was rendered by men who left our country at the turn of the century to go and do that work in Malawi, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and other territories. At the moment there are people, amongst them a capable young man from South Africa, who are founding a church among the Bushmen in South-West Africa. They are learning those people&#x2019;s language and are translating the Bible into their language. In this era in which we see the development of these good relations I think it is proper that we should recognize and pay tribute to the men who did that important spade-work and who laid the foundation for these fine developments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Piketberg has stated that the United Party only discovered its policy after the Prime Minister had made a policy statement. I want to suggest that the hon. member has a look at Hansard of 8th February, at the second amendment we moved on the Part Appropriation Bill. He will admit at once&#x2014; because he is a very honourable man&#x2014;that the policy statement the Prime Minister made to-day is based four square on the policy statement which was submitted by this side of the House several weeks before the Prime Minister made his speech. That just in passing. I was asking the hon. the Prime Minister whether he would follow through the statement he made in regard to inter-state relationships and relationships in other fields to its ultimate conclusion. Because you see, Mr. Chairman, the policy of the Government is a policy of separate development, parallel development, autogenous development&#x2014;one can call it what you like&#x2014;but I take it that the fundamentals of their policy are still the same. The fundamentals of that policy are that homelands be developed for the various ethnic groups amongst our Bantu, and that they are to be allowed&#x2014;even be helped&#x2014;to develop until they ultimately obtain full sovereign independence, if that is what they desire and if they are capable of doing so. I take it that that is still the key to the policy of separate development and that they will develop sovereign independence, if Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy is still the policy of the National Party. I assume there may be changes. For the purpose of this argument I take it that that is the basis of the Government&#x2019;s policy. Would the hon. the Prime Minister tell us whether this policy of his would also be consistently applied if all these areas belonging to our own Natives were also to become independent sovereign states&#x003F; Would it be applied to a sovereign Transkei, a sovereign Zululand, a sovereign Vendaland, a sovereign Tswanaland, a sovereign South Sotholand, a sovereign North Sotholand, and so on&#x003F; That side is very fond of asking this side questions about our own policy. I now want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister what the position is in regard to similar inter-State relationships which recognize the dignity of those people on an official level&#x003F; What happened in regard to such inter-State relationships with our own non-Whites who have much closer links with us and who cannot develop their own sovereign or independent homeland&#x003F; I am talking now about the Coloureds and the Indians in South Africa. I think that before making such lighthearted, and sometimes such derogatory and sharp, remarks about the United Party&#x2019;s policy he should give us a greater degree of clarity in regard to his own line of thought, and that is why I am asking him these pertinent questions. It is all very well to say that as far as Malawi is concerned, as far as Lesotho is concerned, and ultimately that as far as the Transkei and Zululand are concerned, there will be social intercourse on an inter-State level, in so far as it is necessary that there will be diplomatic intercourse and that there will even be clashes on the sports fields in terms of certain existing traditions which we have, but what about the other two coloured communities who will not have their own state and for whom there will be no inter-State relationships&#x003F; How can one justify that logic&#x003F;</p>

<p>Our policy is very clear. Where it is necessary for the head of our state, or for any V.I.P. of our state to have contact, in the interests of the administration of our state, on any level with leading non-Whites of South Africa, that contact is necessary and desirable. General Smuts was in contact with men like Professor Matthews and other well-known Coloured leaders such as Dr. Abdurahman and Church leaders, and it was quite natural and quite right. I do not know why the Prime Minister is making such a tremendous fuss about it, and that is why I am asking whether he realizes that his policy will inevitably lead to his having to accept further aspects of the United Party&#x2019;s common-sense policy. It is inevitable; he will have to accept them. The hon. the Deputy Minister for South-West Africa Affairs has asked us certain questions in regard to our policy. I want to reply to those questions and I want to say to him straight away that the policy of the United Party is that the various races, with the exception of the Cape Coloureds, will be represented by Whites in this House. That is our policy and it is stated in writing.</p>

<p>For how long will the policy of the National Party be carried out&#x003F; This double standard by which they are trying to judge us must come to an end now. Here we have an official statement, the most comprehensive statement in regard to National Party policy which has ever been published, which was published for world consumption and by which means the world must be sold on the National Party&#x2019;s policy for South Africa, and what do they state here to be their ultimate policy&#x003F; I am reading from page 49&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of separate development &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is the United Party&#x2019;s philosophy which they have taken over. They have not only taken over our policy but also our philosophy. We say that any colour policy in South Africa must be of this nature&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is essentially dynamic and flexible, designed to cope with ever-changing circumstances.</block>

<p>It then continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And since economics and politics defy efforts to contain them separately in watertight compartments but of necessity must interact, increasing opportunity for profitable political co-operation will arise.</block>

<p>And now the most priceless statement of all&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another important consideration is that as the political and economic organs and institutions develop among the non-white people the importance of contact with consultation between them and the central authority must necessarily grow.

<p>They then go on to say very clearly that those ultimate relationships could very probably be a form of union, not a federation. It could be a form of union; it could be a form of federation; it could be a Common Market. Here it stands. Hon. members on that side do not know what their ultimate policy is going to be. If I were to debate on the same level, then I am now saying to the hon. the Prime Minister that he should give up and tell us where the policy of separate development is going to end, in view of all the alternatives contained in his own official document, as the future separate development&#x003F; Is it going to be a federal relationship; is it going to be a unitary relationship; is it going to be a Common Market relationship&#x003F; What will it be, because all the possibilities are being presented to the world as the final result of separate development&#x003F; We on this side maintain that we must do what is right and necessary for all the races in South Africa according to the Divine guidance given us in the times in which we are living. We must try and guide the development in the right direction and we believe that the right direction for South Africa is a federal one.</p>

<p>As human beings we do not have the right to say that we will be able to determine the future course of events. Future generations will also have to take their decisions; future generations will also have to make their own adjustments. Mr. Chairman, I want the hon. the Prime Minister to reply to one pertinent question: Why does he condemn us because we say this, but say exactly the same thing when he wants to announce his policy to the world and announce, as he has done on page 49 of this document, the same philosophy, the same basic point of departure and line of thought in regard to colour matters&#x003F; He was an old United Party man and we do not blame him for ploughing with our heifers, but all we are asking him is to have the courtesy to admit that he has taken over the United Party&#x2019;s policy and that he will not try to impute to us things which we do not deserve, because if we are guilty then he is equally guilty.</p>

I want to put this in all fairness to the hon. member for Yeoville: He was acquainted with former Ministers and in particular he was acquainted with former Ministers of Bantu Affairs in South Africa, and I want to ask him this question: In the years during which my predecessor, the late Dr. H.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has stated that it is the United Party policy. [Interjections.] The hon. member is making great play of it being their policy. It is no policy. It is merely what is essential for any Minister to do. But there are many matters in regard to which the hon. member must state their policy. The policy deals with representation in this House. The hon. member for Yeoville must remember that their sixpence policy stated that the person who differed from that policy would be kicked out of the Party. That is why I am waiting so anxiously for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to give me the Eden statement. I hope I am going to get it before this debate has run its course, because the hon. member said just now that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> reported it incorrectly, and I should like to offer an apology to the hon. member for Karoo if I have quoted incorrectly as a result of the newspaper&#x2019;s incorrect report. But I also think it is necessary that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should himself get up here and announce that policy to us.</p>

<p>But I am merely rising to reply to a few questions put by the hon. member for Yeoville. He asked what the ultimate goal of separate development was. We have stated the ultimate goal of separate development for the Bantu over and over again here. It is independence. It is self-determination.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then we are not forcing it upon them. Then they stay just where they are. Then we will continue to do our duty towards them, but they then remain subject to us, if they choose to be that. [Interjection.] I am simply replying to the question put by the hon. member, i.e. that the ultimate goal of separate development is independence. That has always been our view, and it remains our view.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me other questions arising from the cricket question. There my policy remains the same as it is in regard to rugby. I am not going to prescribe to anybody, but the reservations which I added in that case apply in this respect as well, and I want to repeat them, i.e. that politicians must not intervene in the matter to impair relations between countries, that sport must not be dragged into politics in order to achieve some purpose or other, and that it must not create difficulties for me at home.</p>

<p>Those are the three conditions which I laid down. And if that should happen, I would have the courage of my convictions and would say to the country in question that I was sorry but that as a result of such and such an occurrence I would place my domestic relations, or I would place our international relations, above those of the sport, and that I would then rather sever the sport relations. But now the hon. member has come along and he has been so kind as to accuse me of following his policy. All that has happened is that here and <span class="col_3995-3996" refersTo="page_0613"/>there the means of this policy which I have stated may coincide with what may be the hon. member&#x2019;s conviction. I cannot be held responsible for the hon. member for Yeoville agreeing with me. But I do want to know from the hon. member whether he agrees with the preamble which I made, i.e. that at all times participation in sport amongst our own people will take place on a separate basis and that proficiency&#x2014;I am referring now to the Papwa case&#x2014;will not mean that a man who has reached that standard will compete with Whites here in South Africa, because that would be a violation of my policy.</p>

<p>Yes, and the hon. member knows as well as I do what the circumstances were that gave rise to that. But I am talking now about a policy based on principle, and that will be my policy in the future. I want to know from the hon. member whether he agrees with that. I do not expect him to reply across the floor of the House. I know that these are difficult questions which I am putting to him and that he needs a little time to consider them, but once he has considered them, will he then stand up and tell this House whether or not it is his policy&#x003F; In other words, I am putting it to him now in regard to the preamble, but I am also putting it in regard to the reservations which I made. Does the hon. member subscribe to them&#x003F; You see, Sir, here in the middle things draw a little closer together, but when it comes to the crux of the matter I do not get a reply.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He plays abroad, but if the hon. member would only take the trouble to ascertain what the composition of that competition is, he would not even ask the question. I have a whole book on the subject, and I shall give it to the hon. member. [Interjection.] My reply is no, he cannot play here, and I shall give the hon. member the book to prove that that is the case because it will mean that the other countries&#x2014;and I now want to explain again to the hon. member what an inter-state relationship is&#x2014;competing on that basis will come and play here. I should also like to remove any misunderstanding which may possibly arise from that, because it does not seem to me that the hon. member understands very well what is meant by inter-state relations, if the hon. member would read in that book &#x2026; and I want to tell him straight away that if the Transkei or Ovamboland were to become independent and the Prime Minister of the Transkei or of Ovamboland were to come here he would get the same reception from me as would the Prime Minister of Lesotho or Malawi, because it would then be an inter-state relationship. But that does not mean to say that when Coloured citizens of other countries come here they can disregard our conventions, customs and laws in respect of colour relations. We must understand each other very clearly on that point.</p>

The hon. member asks me: &#x201C;Would it therefore apply to the territories which become independent&#x003F;&#x201D; My reply is yes. The hon. member also quoted here the words, &#x201C;to cope with changing circumstances&#x201D;. But it has always been pre-eminently the National Party&#x2019;s policy to take changed circumstances into account. One such example of changed circumstances was the desire of the black people to become independent. Twenty years ago there was no such desire.</p>

<p>Who created that image&#x003F; That hon. member and his Press. The hon. member and his Press are the people who created that image. That was the image of my worthy predecessor which they sent out into the world. It was the image of him that they presented which has done South Africa so much damage. I do not want to elaborate on it, because I would then be forced to say things which I would rather not say. But what is the fact of the matter&#x003F; If the hon. member now thinks he is going to steal a march on me and make the world believe that I am differing with my predecessor or that I am adopting a new policy, then the hon. member is making a mistake. Who knew my predecessor better, the hon. member or I&#x003F; Who lived closer to him, the hon. member or I&#x003F; Let me tell the hon. member this. My predecessor had two tasks. The one was to make the Republic acceptable to the people of South Africa, and <span class="col_3997-3998" refersTo="page_0614"/>it was an enormous task to make the English-speaking people, who had been roused up by the hon. member and his people, accept the Republic. That was his one major task, and it took up years of his time. What was his other task&#x003F;</p>

<p>His other task was to have separate development accepted by the various colour groups in South Africa, and it was necessary because those hon. members were continually placing that policy under a cloud of suspicion. It became necessary because hon. members did not for one moment hesitate to do so. Do you remember when we were introducing the Bill on separate universities&#x003F; Do you remember how hon. members on the opposite side roused the Coloureds against that institution, to mention but one example&#x003F; Do you remember how they belittled it to the extreme so that no decent self-respecting Coloured would ever want to have anything to do with that institution&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, that was my predecessor&#x2019;s task and his difficulty. He devoted the entire eight years he was in office in South Africa to getting the Republic accepted, and praise be to God he succeeded in doing so, and in that lies the memory of his strength. He succeeded in doing so and his monument in South Africa will be that separate development did not only become the policy of the National Party, but became the accepted policy of South Africa. I want to point out to the hon. member for Yeoville that when my esteemed predecessor had done that, the time had come for him to go out into the world, but he was not to be granted that opportunity. He was lost to us before that time. What I am doing now is not to differ from my esteemed predecessor, but he made it possible for me to be able to do these things because he laid the foundations on which I can build. I can build on the foundations which he laid. I was able to make the breakthrough with Jonathan because my predecessor had already made it possible for me in his lifetime. I could negotiate with those African states on the basis on which I did because my predecessor, with his policy, made it possible for me to do so. I want to put that very clearly here, and I hope that this parrot cry will cease now. Hon. members will not steal a march on me. Hon. members will not succeed in making my people suspicious of me. If those are their tactics, they are doomed to utter failure. If hon. members on the opposite side are serious when they say that I am implementing their policy, then surely they no longer have the right to exist. Do you know, Sir, I am not the only person who thinks so. The public outside also think so. The public outside think so to a very large extent. I am waiting again for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to state his policy. I shall then tell him whether it is in agreement with my policy. I do not think that that will be the case. I should like to hear what the standpoint of the hon. member for Karoo was which the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> misinterpreted. I am waiting anxiously to hear that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I was a young member in this House, I heard the Prime Minister of the day, the late Dr. Malan, say to a member opposite: The trouble with this member is that he is suffering from an attack of Burgeritis. If I were to interpret the disease of the hon. the Prime Minister at the moment, I would say that he is suffering from an attack of Burgeritis. He has been reading <i>Die Burger</i> too much, and its leading articles, and he has made up his mind that since he cannot defend on the economic front, the best thing is to try to drag in race relations into his Vote to see if he can get something out of that. [Interjections.] Let me say to the hon. gentleman that I am prepared to meet him, as I met his predecessor, and his predecessor before that, and exchange policies with him in this House, but I shall do it in my own time and in the manner which will give this debate some continuity. Let me tell you, Sir, that this hon. gentleman is not going to escape. I am raising these matters with him all in good time, and I am raising one matter at a time. The hon. the Prime Minister has given us the statement on sport which I must say comes very close to the United Party policy statement made in this House in the appropriation debate. There may be a few minor differences in respect of internal policy, in that we are inclined to leave more to the discretion of the bodies that manage sport in South Africa, as it has been left to their discretion in the last 200 years. We see no reason for this anxious intervention by the State in the administration of sport in South Africa, which has been done so magnificently and so adequately and has brought such distinction upon South Africa in years gone by. Nevertheless we have seen an advance. I commend the Prime Minister on that. We have got away from the old principle: When we visit your country, we accept your social conventions; when you come to our country you accept our social conventions. There is another principle accepted, and I welcome it. That is that where there are inter-state relations with states with whom we want to remain on a sporting footing, we do not argue about who represents which state. I welcome that.</p>

I spoke to the hon. member about it and before I say another word let me say he is extremely disappointed that medically he is not permitted to speak to-day although he is extremely anxious to speak and <span class="col_3999-4000" refersTo="page_0615"/>defend himself on this matter. Sir, the whole problem with this particular memorandum is that it was under a covering letter and that unless you have the covering letter you do not understand the context. [Laughter.] Mr. Speaker. I quite fail to understand the amusement of hon. members opposite. If I send you a memorandum by means of a covering letter and in the covering letter I say that a memorandum is enclosed containing the policy of the Nationalist Party you would not proceed to contribute that policy to me&#x003F; [Interjections.] The letter under cover of which this memorandum was distributed reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is to advise you that the Government has decided to appoint a commission to inquire into the above subject. The purpose of this letter is to inform you that I have submitted a memorandum setting out what I believe to be the feeling of all Coloured people and Indians in the Republic.</block>

<p>Now laugh! The hon. member does, therefore, not accept that as his policy or as being the policy of the United Party. He believes that to be an interpretation of what the Coloureds and Indians in South Africa want at the present time. They may be crying for the moon, but that is what they want.</p>

<p>It is addressed to voters in his constituency and to a number of Coloureds and Indians, I understand, in other provinces. I&#x2019;ll give the letter to the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister challenged me in respect of a report in which I am alleged to have produced a blueprint for the future of South Africa. I did, Sir. And what is more, it was a first-class speech! In it I laid down the conditions for the future prosperity of South Africa, for the security of South Africa and for the happiness of all its peoples. I set out very carefully why the Nationalist Party policy would never produce that measure of prosperity, and I was right. I also set out why the Nationalist Party with its policy would always leave doubts about our security. And I was right. I showed why Nationalist Party policy could never give much happiness to all the peoples of South Africa, as the policy of the United Party would&#x2014;again I was right. Mr. Speaker, I am awfully tempted to read certain passages from the speech to the hon. the Prime Minister but the danger is that if I read it to-day he will be telling us next session that it is his policy. If ever I came across a Government that is very keen to take advice from the Opposition, it is this Government.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister also asked me if I believed that sport should be managed each group for itself internally. Yes, Sir, I do. I believe that is the most satisfactory method. Sport involves social intercourse of one kind or another. However, as I have said, I prefer to see non-Government interference in these matters and that it be left to the sporting bodies themselves to manage matters as they have done in the past.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>As the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote presents an opportunity for the greatest confrontation of the Session between the policies of the respective parties, I think this is the appropriate time to take stock of the political situation as it has developed since the National Party took over the reins of government in 1948. In this regard I want to make a statement on which certain hon. members will not agree with me, but on which 90 per cent of the people outside will agree with me. That is that if the National Party had not come into power in 1948, there would have been a black government in this House to-day. To demonstrate that we have to recall the measures which the National Party Government took from time to time, measures which were consistently opposed by the Opposition. These were measures which were primarily intended to effect separation of the white and non-white races of South Africa, firstly in the political field, here in this House. Here the National Party succeeded in effecting political separation. The first measure in this regard was to abolish the Bantu representation in this House and to give them a <i>quid pro quo</i> in terms of which they will be able <span class="col_4001-4002" refersTo="page_0616"/>to govern themselves in accordance with their own instincts and customs&#x2014;in other words, separate development. In this field there are two concepts, two conflicting concepts, which show the world and the people where the National Party stands on the one side and the United Party on the other side. On the one side there is the National Party policy of good neighbourship, a policy which is now unfolding quite clearly&#x2014;to such an extent that even the outside world is now forming a better conception of it. On the other side there is the concept of partnership as set out by the United Party from time to time.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the following question. He happens to be a practical man. Would he as a stud farmer like to enter into partnership with all his competitors and fellow-farmers in this country as far as his stud farming is concerned&#x003F; How long would he then be able to survive as a stud farmer&#x003F; He will appreciate immediately that as this kind of thing cannot be done with regard to animals, it is even less possible in respect of the population, a population which is as multi-racial as the local one. But the things to which I have referred are not the only ones which we may recall. Let us just take some of the major points of policy in respect of which we were opposed so constantly by the U.P. We have to bear in mind that the rising generation, which at present forms the major portion of the electorate, may not have such a clear conception of what the position would have been if the U.P. had still been in power. There is the question of our citizenship. If the N.P. had not won our own citizenship for us, we would still have been British subjects under the old laws. We would still have had two flags. We would still have had two National Anthems. We would not have had population registration to indicate who was white, who Coloured and who Bantu. All these things were achieved by the N.P. We would not have had a Republic, but would still have been a member of the Commonwealth, together with countries such as Sierra Leone and with people such as Nyerere, we would still have been in the Commonwealth along with that whole bunch. We would have had no political separation here&#x2014;the Coloureds would still have been with us on a common voters&#x2019; roll. The Coloureds would have had no representation in this Parliament, which they do have at present. The young people of South Africa would not have had the vote, because that was also opposed by the U.P. Apart from these political benefits, South Africa would not have had a Sasolburg, one of our greatest supporting pillars in the economic sphere, which was also established by the N.P. We would not have had a greater Iscor. We may continue along these lines. Not only do we have a state of national prosperity in South Africa now, not only an economic situation which inspires jealousy throughout the world, but we have a situation which enables the country to offer our neighbours and all the states in Africa the guidance, the knowledge and the advice which may make them prosperous, too. As a result of the N.P.&#x2019;s political policy, a policy which has been advocated and put into practical effect since 1948, we have the situation to-day that our non-white races are not only grasping the concepts of good neighbourliness for the first time, but are also trying to put these into practice and to transmit them to black states in Africa. For these reasons we cannot but congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister and lend him our solid support, particularly in view of what he announced this afternoon. Once South Africa has succeeded&#x2014;as it is now doing to some extent&#x2014;in getting across its real policy, as it is now unfolding, to the world abroad and to the states of Africa, South Africa will naturally become the leader on the entire Continent of Africa. From time to time we are the victims of sophistry at the U.N., on the part of the Opposition and of the hostile Press in South Africa. Yet despite all that resistance South Africa is the country which inspires jealousy in others. I want to add that if the N.P. had not been in power, we would quite probably have had a bunch of false prophets in charge of affairs here, apart from the fact that South Africa could have been a black state with a black government. Because not one of the U.P.&#x2019;s predictions of the time of what would happen under the National Party Government, has been validated&#x2014;they were all false. In spite of all those attempts at undermining, all those attempts to present us in a bad light in the outside world, the N.P. nevertheless succeeded in making the country develop, in making it grow and become stronger. As I said here seven years ago, the day will come when South Africa will convince the world that this is the best, the only concept by which justice can be done to all the various population groups.

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There is no Hansard in Windhoek. The position is perfectly simple. The United Party suggested that north of the police zone&#x2014;the Caprivi-Zipfel, Ovamboland, Okavango and a short portion of the Kaokoveld&#x2014;formed one unit where to a large extent there had been a measure of self-rule, indeed, for many years. They have maintained law and order themselves. The police hardly ever worried to visit them. We believe that they could slowly work up a measure of self-government which would enable them to form a unit which could have a direct association with the Republic of South Africa. It is the policy of that party that Coloureds should be represented by Europeans. So they can have no worry about the fact that we feel that that area could be represented by Europeans in this Parliament. As <span class="col_4005-4006" refersTo="page_0618"/>regards this southern portion, our difficulty was that there was a suggestion that a large number of small tribes or groups should be given the right of self-determination to the point of independence. We felt that they were not viable and we felt that the areas demarcated for their so-called homelands bore no relation to where they were living at the present time. In fact, we believe that it would require the moving of 166,000 people to be moved into those homelands where there are only some 25,000 of the original inhabitants living. We believe that this was a population movement unprecedented in modern times. We believe that to give groups which were not viable independence was asking for trouble. Therefore we believe that they, too, should come together under one legislature&#x2014;the legislature in the southern portion, which in its turn should have a federal relationship with the Republic. We believe that in the legislature which they have in South-West Africa there should be representation of the various groups from time to time that have developed up to that stage, so that they would have a say in the Government which finally controls their destinies.</p>

<p>I want to say that our policy is white, except in the case of Coloureds, but we subscribe so completely to the United Party philosophy outlined in this document that I am surprised that the hon. the Minister even worries to ask me. Nor is it necessary to embark on speculation as to what the ultimate future political pattern will be, that is whether and to what extent there may be amalgamation or union of some kind, a federation, a commonwealth &#x2026; [Interjections.] If one reads the portion on the Transkei one finds much the same sort of philosophy, as I have in mind, in respect of the reserves. I think there ought to be no doubt between us. What worries me is that the policy of the Government party is to lead these people up to the point of self-determination. Thereafter it has no policy for them; thereafter it says nothing as to what the future relationship will be. It is mere speculation as to how that territory is going to be governed, whether it is going to be completely balkanized, whether it is going to be a series of independent little groups fighting with each other, or what the relationship is going to be with the Government of the Republic of South Africa. We at least state ideals for which we are striving, namely that there should be two big units which should be reasonably self-contained, that each of those units should be in a federal relationship with the Republic. We may not achieve it. There may be international difficulties.</p>

<p>Separate from each other but not in the sense of having independence as independent states.

That is our ideal, and we believe that is in the best interests of South-West Africa and all its people. We believe it is in the best interests of South-West Africa that so far as possible it should retain one economy. We believe that those people should be assisted to develop by means of a policy of industrial partnership. We believe that as far as possible we should not have independent units, units competing with each other in the economic sphere and lowering wages against each other to the detriment of the people in the Territory.</p>

<p>I believe that if you compare the outline of policy that we have given with the outline of policy given even in this Survey by the Government, then I believe any &#x201C;Suidwester&#x201D; would want to support our policy and not the policy of the Government.

<p>I shall tell you now when it became independent. In 1964, during the discussion of the Odendaal Report here, the hon. the Leader said the following (Hansard, col. 5474) in a speech which was virtually a verbatim repetition of the speech he had previously made in Windhoek&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe each of those two regions, with the passage of years, has under the South African Government developed its own form of autonomy, not only in relationship with the other portion of the territory, but also in relationship with the Republican Government.</block>

<p>According to the Leader each region has developed its own form of autonomy. The Leader elaborated on that and referred to the Laokoveld, Ovamboland. the Caprivi Strip and Okavango, and further on he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While each group retains control, by means of communal councils, of matters of intimate concern to itself, there is nevertheless the possibility of the development of a northern legislative council which will slowly be developed to prepare the territory to form part of a race federation.</block>

<p>What I read out here to-day is what the hon. the Leader also said in Windhoek. He said in Windhoek that your policy would also satisfy the outside world. Therefore, it is not the Government that formulates a policy to satisfy the outside world, but it is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who has determined a policy for the approval of the outside world.</p>

<p>I am returning to this White Paper. I shall read what is said on page 49 of the <i>South-West Africa Survey</i> 1967&#x2014;</p>

<p>In his recent speech in Ovamboland the hon. the Minister told the Ovambos that they could have independence. He told them that we were not going to tell them what they had to do in the future&#x2014;in the future they themselves can decide whether they want to continue on their own or whether they want to co-operate with other aboriginal groups.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, now they are making quite a din, Mr. Chairman. They do not want to hear. They, the population groups, can decide whether they want to amalgamate or whether they want to remain on their own. They can decide whether they want to co-operate with one another in a union, whether they want to federate, or whatever they want to do. That is our point of view. Once those people have been granted their independence&#x2014;and that is our policy&#x2014; it does not make any difference to us whether they want to co-operate and in what form they want to co-operate with others; that is their affair because they are independent. As far as viability is concerned, it has been stated time and again that it is the policy of the Government that, as regards those small areas, we want to grant political independence but we want economic inter-dependence&#x2014;political independence and economic inter-dependence. That is the course of events all over the world. Europe is not the only place where countries co-operate mutually in the economic sphere. Why can those areas not co-operate mutually in the economic sphere so as to make it possible for them to exist&#x003F; Why can those areas not co-operate economically with the Whites so as to make it possible for them to exist&#x003F; Why can they not co-operate economically with South Africa, along with the Whites, so as to make it possible for them to exist&#x003F; That is the policy of this Government. There is no need for the total economic exclusion of these territories from the rest of the country, once they have become politically independent, politically separate, once they have become self-governing. They can be inter-dependent economically and make a good living in that way.</p>

<p>The question is: What about the future&#x003F; On one occasion the late Dr. Verwoerd said here that as far as the future was concerned, as far as the future relationship between non-whites and the white state was concerned&#x2014;as he envisaged it&#x2014;there would be a loose form of a commonwealth. It is not the policy of this Government that some or other non-white state in South Africa should co-operate with the white section of this country on either a union basis or a federal basis, because that will result in our having to grant them representation in this white Parliament, something we shall not do. That is the great difference between this side and that side. We foresee a white Parliament and separate non-white Parliaments in their own territories. We do not at all foresee a joint session of Whites and non-Whites in this House. I repeat that if the policy of that side were to be implemented, namely that of granting representation in this central Parliament to the various elements of the federation, it must result in those territories having to be represented here by their own people.

<p>Mr. Chairman, on a point of explanation: I said that Dr. Verwoerd had stated that as far as the ultimate future was concerned, the relationship between the various non-white states in Southern Africa&#x2014;which includes South-West Africa&#x2014; would be a loose form of co-operation in the common interest, a form of commonwealth, but not a commonwealth as we knew it when we were a member of the old British Commonwealth of Nations.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman quoted to me a certain passage of the debates on the 5th May, 1964. I see that I said (column 5474)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While each group retains control, by means of communal councils, of matters of intimate concern to itself there is nevertheless the possibility of the development of a northern legislative council which will slowly be developed to prepare the territory to form part of a race federation.</block>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister then interjected: &#x201C;A big Bantustan&#x003F;&#x201D; I replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4011-4012" refersTo="page_0621"/>I would say a big independent area in which a group of communal councils, because of their common interests, will come together and form one legislative authority which can slowly be developed to form part of a race federation.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] If they will ever be independent, they will be in an independent group in the sense of a separate group which comes together to form part of a race federation in the whole of the Republic of South Africa. That is the whole point. I do not think that there can be any doubt about it here. I think that when one reads on, it becomes clearer. I quote from Hansard (column 5475)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Southern Region is concerned I want to say that we do not believe that the powers of the Legislative Assembly based in Windhoek should be clipped or frittered away. We believe it is more in the spirit of the mandate that they should be developed. We believe that in that area also the various groups should have their communal councils but that there should be one legislative assembly in which white leadership will be maintained but in which there will be representation for the various groups developed far enough to enjoy it. I believe very firmly that Bushmen, as a backward group, should be maintained as wards of the state. I also believe that while we are responsible for their administration, both these portions of the territory should have a federal relationship with each other and a federal relationship with the Government of the Republic.</block>

<p>How can they be independent if they have a federal relationship with the Government of the Republic&#x003F; The hon. member will see that &#x201C;independence&#x201D; was used there in the English sense of &#x201C;separate&#x201D; and not &#x201C;sovereign&#x201D; independence.</p>
