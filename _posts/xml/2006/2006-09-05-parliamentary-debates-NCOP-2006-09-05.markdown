                     NO MOTIONS DURING QUESTIONS SESSION

                               (Announcement)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon members, I have been informed by
the Whippery that there will be no motions in this our ordinary session for
questions to the Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa and the
Ministers in our economic cluster of governance. We shall now proceed with
questions as printed on the Order Paper.

Before we start, I want to welcome you, hon Deputy President, hon Ministers
and Deputy Ministers who are here with us this afternoon. On that note, I
will proceed to the first question on the Question Paper in the name of the
Chief Whip, hon V V Z Windvoël, to the Deputy President.

QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT

          Steps to promote participation of women in formal economy

5.    Mr V V Z Windvoël asked the Deputy President:

     What (a) programmes has the Government put in place to address the low
     level of participation of women in the formal economy to ensure that
     women entrepreneurs become the core and a visible component in building
     a vibrant and sustainable small, medium and micro-enterprise (SMME)
     sector, (b) progress has been made since 2004 to ensure that there is a
     conducive climate for women entrepreneurs to enter the formal economy
     and establish viable business initiatives and ventures and (c)(i) areas
     of support does the Government provide for women entrepreneurs that
     have been identified as facing major challenges, particularly rural and
     previously marginalised women, and (ii) measures have been put in place
     to address these challenges?                  C198E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Chair, members, the question is on women’s
economic empowerment and SMMEs and the answer is as follows: The
government, through the Department of Trade and Industry’s gender and women
empowerment unit, has recently finalised the development of the strategic
framework on gender and women’s economic empowerment. Thank you very much
Deputy Minister Thabethe, who has worked very hard on this. This is done to
ensure that the low level of women’s participation in the formal economy is
addressed.

The strategy sets the following primary and secondary objectives: Firstly,
to increase access, control and ownership to economic resources. Secondly,
to increase the number of enterprises owned and managed by women. Thirdly,
to increase and facilitate women’s equal, easy and transparent access to
financial and productive resources. Fourthly, to promote and encourage
women’s access to both local and international markets, as well as other
trade and investment opportunities. Fifthly, to ensure that the life
experience and views of South African women contribute equally and inform
the reform of trade, investment and enterprise development. Just to name a
few.

To ensure that the above-mentioned objectives are achieved, interventions
were also proposed based on the extensive coherent research study. Those
interventions include entrepreneurial capacity-building and training, which
we have worked together on, especially in the Joint Initiative for Priority
Skills Acquisition, Jipsa, also boosting women’s involvement as
entrepreneurs, as well as women in special areas identified by Asgisa.

Entrepreneurial support, especially financially, trade and investment,
after studies confirmed that international trade affects both positively
and negatively employment, markets, production, distribution and
consumption, which are the core elements of business. This intervention is
aimed at ensuring that gender is mainstreamed in formulating, implementing
and evaluating trade agreements and initiatives, thus benefiting women-
owned businesses.

Progress has been made since 2004 to ensure that there is a conducive
climate for women entrepreneurs to enter the formal economy and establish
viable business initiatives and ventures. Thank you.

        Acquisition of foreign expertise to enhance service delivery

6.    Mr V V Z Windvoël asked the Deputy President:

      Whether the Government has outlined priority areas of foreign
      expertise for recruitment in order to enhance service delivery in line
      with the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa
      (Asgisa) and the Joint Initiative for Priority Skills Acquisition
      (Jipsa); if not, why not; if so, (a) how many foreign experts have
      been acquired since the launch of Asgisa, (b) from which countries are
      they and (c) what mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that
      there is a transfer of skills to local people?
      C199E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Chair, this question is also on  the  Accelerated  and
Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa, and the  answer  is  as  follows:
Following the growing national concern with and focus on  critically  scarce
skills, the Department of Labour has developed a  national  list  of  scarce
skills and a quota list of scarce and critical skills.

These will provide a more concrete and  less  anecdotal  picture  of  skills
shortages that have been identified as  contributing  to  blocking  economic
growth and development. As  proposed,  a  2006  immigration  quota  list  of
scarce skills has been prepared by  the  national  departments  involved  in
human resource development.

These are the departments that make up the core of the  skills  focus  group
that works under the auspices of the  economic  cluster.  They  include  the
Department of  Labour,  the  Department  of  Education,  the  Department  of
Science  and  Technology,  the  Department  of  Trade  and   Industry,   the
Department of Public Service and  Administration,  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs and the Presidency.

The proposed list  has  been  submitted  to  the  Director-General  of  Home
Affairs to be finalised by the Minister of Home Affairs and to be  published
as the immigration quota list for 2006 as required by the Immigration Act.

I must also emphasise that it does not mean that while all of this has  been
happening we have been at a standstill in terms  of  recruiting  the  scarce
skills.

The  scarce  skills  occupations  identified   include   manufacturing   and
construction  engineering  professionals,  natural  and   physical   science
professionals, biomedical engineers and technicians, call or contact  centre
service managers, information and organisation professionals, and others.

Government’s role in this regard is not to manage the importation of  skills
directly, but rather to simplify and  streamline  the  processes  of  skills
importation so that the necessary skills can be brought into the country  by
employers, as and when they are required.

Many companies have complained to government that when they need to employ
and appoint senior officials who may not be available in South Africa it
becomes very difficult for them and that in some cases they actually have
to close down projects or delay their implementation. So, with this
arrangement we make it easy for them to source the best skills and best
brains anywhere in the world. Thank you.

SOSISWEBHUWEMKHANDLU WEMAPROVINSI: Mgcinisihlalo, ngitsandza kubonga
imphendvulo yemhlon, liSekela laMengameli. Njengobe besibuta nje
singuleNdlu kutsi siyalusekela loluhlelo lwe-Asgisa. Ngitsandza
kulandzelisa umbuto lotsi, Lisekela laMengameli lingaba nako yini kutsi
selike litsi caphu-caphu, kusho nje kutsi ngubaphi labochwephesha lesike
sibatfole lababuya kulamanye emave? Singabonga kakhulu nangabe liSekela
laMengameli ... [Kuhlaba lulwimi.] (Translation of Siswati paragraph
follows.)

[The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I would like to thank the hon
Deputy President for the reply that she has given. In order for this House
to make the decision whether or not to support the Asgisa programme, I
would like to ask a follow-up question. Hon Deputy President, could you
please explain to this House, briefly, who these experts are, and from
which countries they come? We would be very grateful if the hon Deputy
President ... [Interjections.]]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon Chief Whip, could you take your
seat for a minute please? Could we have an interpreting service so that
other members are also privileged to know what the follow up question is
about? Could somebody attend to the interpretation?

SOSISWEBHUWEMKHANDLU WEMAPROVINSI: ... kutsi sive kutsi ingabe basuke
bavela kumaphi emave labochwephesha lakhuluma ngabo? Kubaluleke kakhulu
kutsi siwati lamave lasisekelako kulomklamo lesiwuphetse. Sizatfu kutsi
labanye bantfu bakulamanye emave bayaye bete lapha betele kutawudla nje

follows.)

[The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: ... so that we can understand, which
countries do these experts that you are referring to come from? It is very
important to understand this so that we know which countries support us in
this project. The reason I ask this question is that people from some
countries come here only for their own gains and not to support us in any
way.]

IPHINI LIKAMONGAMELI: Sihlalo ohloniphekile, ngithi kowekunene, maqondana
nalezi zingcweti esizitholayo eziningi, phakathi kwamazwe asesisekele
kakhulu iminyaka eminingi kukhona ilizwe lase-Cuba enilaziyo nani nonke. I-
Cuba isisekele kakhulu futhi isaqhubeka nokusisekela ngoba nawo amakhono
ezempilo siwafaka phansi kohla lwamakhono abalulekile.

Elinye lamazwe asisekele kakhulu futhi yizwe lase-India. Njengamanje
sikhuluma indaba yokuthi mabasisize kakhulu ngothisha bezibalo, hhayi ngoba
sithi yibo asebezofundisa izibalo kodwa bazosiza othisha bethu ukuthi
bakwazi ukuzifundisa kahle izibalo. Kodwa maqondana nezikole lezi
ezisemaphandleni, othisha balapha ekhaya abangathandi ukuya kuzo,
sizobacela laba base-India ukuthi baye khona njengoba senibonile ukuthi
nabase-Cuba nabo abesabi ukuya emaphandleni.

Ohlangothini lwamanye amazwe esisebenzisana nawo, asikawatholi amazwe
aletha abantu abaningi. Izinkampani zona ziyazitholela abasebenzi emhlabeni
wonke bese beyeza. Into esiyenzayo thina manje ukuthumela abantu bethu baye
kofunda. Akhona amazwe asethe azimisele ukuthatha kakhulu abantu abaningi
abasebasha - ngoba besilokhu singqongqoza emnyango yawo.

Njengoba ngikhuluma nawe nje sinawo amantombazanyana  ayiqeqebana  ase-India
futhi sinawo amanye azohamba kulezi  zinsuku  aye  e-United  Arab  Emirates.
Kukhona  namanye  asendleleni  ebuyayo   abekade   ese-Qatar   nase-Germany.
Siyabalanda abanye kanti futhi nathi siyathumela ukuthi baye kofunda  khona.
Into enhle ukuthi amanye amazwe ayabambisana nathi ngoba  nawo  azitshathela
kowawo umhlane izindleko  zokufundisa  laba  bantwana  –  njengalaba  abanye
abazokuya  e-China.  Sizocela  nakwi-Russia   njengoba   ivakashele   lapha.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Hon Chairperson, let me say to the  hon  member  that
with regard to many professionals that we get, as  you  all  know,  Cuba  is
among the countries that has helped us a  lot  for  many  years  and  it  is
continuing to offer us its support because even life skills  are  classified
as important skills.

The other country that has helped us a lot is  India.  Presently,  they  are
helping us with mathematics teachers. We are not  saying  that  they  should
teach mathematics, but they are going to help our teachers  to  be  able  to
teach mathematics. With regard to schools in rural areas, we  are  going  to
ask Indian teachers to go there since teachers here in South Africa  do  not
want to go to these schools. As you may have seen, Cuban  teachers  are  not
afraid to go there.

With regard to other countries that we are working with, they have  not  yet
sent staff here. Companies are  recruiting  employees  themselves  from  all
over the world and then they bring them here. What we  are  doing  from  our
side is that we  are  sending  our  people  to  study  overseas.  There  are
countries that have shown an interest in accepting a lot of  youth,  because
we have always been asking.

As I’m speaking to you, we have a group of girls who are in India and we
also have a group that is going to leave soon for the United Arab Emirates.
Others are on their way back from Qatar and Germany. We are recruiting
others back to South Africa and we are sending others overseas to study.
What is great about this is that the other countries that are working with
us are paying for the studies of these students, like those who are going
to China. We are also going to ask Russia, as they are visiting us.]

   Plans to increase awareness of Moral Regeneration Movement and to adopt
                         Charter of Positive Values
7.    Mr M A Mzizi asked the Deputy President:

      (1)   Whether, in light of the seemingly dwindling awareness and media
           attention given to the Moral Regeneration Movement (MRM) since
           its launch, the Government has any plans in place to increase
           and regenerate awareness amongst the general public of this
           important initiative; if not, why not; if so, what are the
           relevant details;


      (2)   whether the MRM has made any progress in addressing the moral
           decay of our society; if not, what is the position in this
           regard; if so, what are the relevant details;


      (3)   when will the Charter of Positive Values be adopted?    C185E


The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Chairperson, this question is about the Moral
Regeneration Movement. Since the launch of the Moral Regeneration Movement
on 18 April 2002, some progress has been made. I wish to remind you that
the MRM information document in November 2002 said: “Building a nation is
like building a house. It needs a good design and a good leadership. But it
can only be built brick-by-brick, room-by-room and floor-by-floor.”

To date, I can say that the MRM has created a demand for moral renewal. The
MRM is operating at grassroots level, in regional and provincial
structures. MRM local structures are strong in KwaZulu-Natal, Northern
Cape, Free State, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng provinces.
The Western Cape has infused its work within its strategic framework of
iKapa Elihlumayo.

The MRM office is currently planning to assist the North West province.
Individuals, organisations and constituency sectors have been engaged in a
number of activities that complement the work of the movement.

A partnership of Christian communities and civil society has produced the
Heartlines TV programme, which we see on our screens, and the nation is
currently discussing some of those moral values. That, in part, is part of
ensuring that the issues around values and morals are discussed across the
nation.

Different government departments, in partnership with civil society, are
campaigning. For instance, the SA Police Services with the Community
Policing Forum, Correctional Services Moral Regeneration Advocacy Week and
the Department of Social Development are mainstreaming MRM strategies and
focusing on families. At local level, faith-based leaders, traditional
leaders, traditional healers, community policing forums, councillors, youth
and women’s organisations attend these forums and workshops on moral
regeneration.

The movement has written to all mayors and municipality managers,
encouraging them to provide room for moral renewal activities. I would like
to say that maybe even here in the two Houses we could think of doing
something to support the movement.

Radio is also very supportive and exposes MRM on topical issues. The Big
Question theme on morality runs throughout the year. I do hope that hon
members will again and again take this call for moral regeneration to their
constituencies and uphold our sound values based on ubuntu.

During the founding conference of the MRM, all stakeholders were in
agreement that the South African society is based on sound moral values and
ubuntu. The overwhelming majority of our people, men and women of all
races, are law-abiding and decent citizens, and they were also convinced
that our efforts must be geared towards ensuring that we leave an indelible
mark, that we are a caring, friendly and moral nation.

I wish to remind members also about what former President Nelson Rolihlahla
Mandela said in 1991: “Morality is not individual goodness, but a co-
operative project of survival.”

To begin to address this challenge of moral decay, we should, as South
Africans from all walks of life and from all sectors of our society,
rededicate and commit ourselves to the strengthening of this noble movement
and ensure that it lives on. To succeed, we require a collective effort
from all sectors of society.

The MRM has a board, a secretariat and staff, and I regularly meet with
them to consider the activities that they are undertaking. As we speak now,
we have asked them to restructure the board so that it reflects a broader
constituency in society besides faith-based organisations. We have asked
them to recruit people from the sports arena, business, young people and
education. I’m looking forward to our next meeting where we will consider
how far they have been able to restructure the board and integrate and
infuse greater participation of society. Thank you, Chairperson.

Ms A N T MCHUNU: Chairperson, may I please know from our hon Deputy
President if she will lead members of this House to Umkhosi Womhlanga over
the weekend at Enyokeni? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: I’ve not been invited.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): In fact, I’m not very good in
languages, except my own mother tongue. I was, in any case going to rule
the question out of order as it is, in fact, a new question.

        Plans with regard to Moloto Rail Development Corridor Project

8.    Mr A Watson asked the Deputy President:
      Whether, in light of the fact that the Moloto Rail Development
      Corridor is a major government infrastructure investment for
      Mpumalanga and is the flagship project of the Accelerated and Shared
      Growth Initiative for South Africa (Asgisa) for the province, this
      project will go ahead despite the recent reports of shortages in
      rolling stock; if not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                         C186E

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: The question is about the Moloto Rail Development
Corridor, and the answer is as follows: the Moloto Rail Development
Corridor Project will go ahead, pending the detailed feasibility study that
government has requested to be undertaken on the viability of the corridor.

Aside from government’s Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South
Africa – Asgisa - the high daily travel demand of about 40 000 commuters
and associated road safety concerns on the Moloto Transport Corridor have
made it necessary to explore viable and sustainable transport that will
serve the Moloto Development Corridor. Of course, the study will tell us in
more concrete terms the options that we can pursue.

The Mpumalanga Provincial Government and Nkangala District Municipality, in
conjunction with the Department of Transport, have made a request for
proposals with a view to appoint a professional team to undertake the
detail feasibility study. The closing date for proposals was 25 August,
with the tender adjudication process under way as I speak.

It is anticipated that after the appointment of the professional team, the
detailed feasibility study would take approximately 12 months to complete.
It would therefore be premature for me to comment on whether or how the
project will go ahead as the detailed feasibility study will be addressing
the challenges and opportunities associated with the project, including
concerns raised by the hon member. What I can say is that we do not want to
leave the situation as it is. Some intervention is needed but that must be
based on sound information. I thank you, Chairperson.

Mr A WATSON: Thank you, hon Deputy President. Yes, I hear your reply in
regard to it being a bit premature but the report about the severe shortage
of rolling stock in South Africa in general is something that might impact
even more heavily on the Asgisa project as a whole and not just the Moloto
rail link. Are you concerned about it and is government doing something
about that particular problem ahead of waiting for the feasibility study
and maybe to find that we’re in a deadlock?

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Thank you. Yes, hon member I think I went half-way
with the answer. Actually, yes, the government has approved accelerating
the rolling stock investment strategy, which will initially focus on
stabilising and maintaining the current level of service without any
further deterioration. And then as a follow up, we’ll focus on recovery and
growing the service. So, these processes will be running parallel.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): That concludes the first session of
questions, which were questions to the Deputy President of the Republic. I
want to take this opportunity once more to thank you, Deputy President, on
behalf of this august House, for the effort and commitment you have shown
this House, which occupies a very unique place within our political system,
to enjoin the three spheres of government under one roof. Thank you very
much.

Hon members, for obvious reasons I would like to make a ruling that we
adjourn the House for 10 minutes and then come back, because there are only
two Deputy Ministers here in my reading of the Question Papers. In terms of
official notification, we have been advised that only the Minister of
Finance will not be available to be with us today, because of a budget
lekgotla.

Secondly, I have just received an apology from the Minister of Transport,
hon Mr Jeff Radebe, who indicated that he may join us later in the course
of the session as he has been summoned by the President. I will therefore
ask hon members for a break of 10 minutes, because otherwise I don’t think
it will make sense – it is going to be disruptive - to only have two Deputy
Ministers here: the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs and the
Minister of Trade and Industry. We will adjourn for 10 minutes and then
come back.

MINISTERS:

      Strategy for the management of South Africa’s elephant population

35.   Mr C J van Rooyen asked the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
      Tourism:

      What progress has been made in the development of a strategy for the
      management of the elephant population in South Africa?

                  C140E

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, the
department, in consultation with the SA National Parks and the provincial
authorities, has developed draft norms and standards relating to the
management of elephant populations in our country. These draft norms and
standards were developed in terms of section 9 of the National
Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act. These draft norms and standards
will be published for public comment as soon as they are ready, and we will
honour our commitment to publishing them for the full 60 days.

     Achievement of job creation targets, and setting up of lines of co-
                     operation and reporting structures

36.   Ms B N Dlulane asked the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
      Tourism:


     (1)    Whether the target of a 30% increase in the number of jobs
         created in and around protected areas is on track as planned for
         2006; if not, what is the position in this regard; if so, what are
         the relevant details;


     (2)    what lines of co-operation and reporting structures have been
         set up with the Department of Public Works as overall co-ordinator
         of the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP);

     (3)    whether his department achieved its job creation targets for the
         2005-06 financial year; if not, why not; if so, what are the
         relevant details?
         C141E


The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, it is the
question on job creation. The answer to the first part of the question is
yes, 472 permanent and 10 867 temporary jobs were created for 2005-06.
Two: the department is the lead department for the environment and culture
sector of the Expanded Public Works Programmes. The Department of Public
Works co-ordinates the sectors, namely environment and culture, economic,
infrastructure, as well as social, from a national perspective. This is
done through national and provincial sector co-ordinating structures as
well as quarterly reporting per sector in respect of the EPWP outputs.

Three: yes, the job creation target in respect of the social responsibility
programme for 2005-06 was 12 000, and 15 994 job opportunities were
achieved.

                Assessment of organisations promoting tourism

37.   Ms H F Matlanyane asked the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
      Tourism:

      (1)   Whether any evaluations have been carried out to assess
          organisations promoting tourism; if not, why not; if so, what are
          the results of such evaluations;

      (2)   whether any interventions have taken place; if so, what are the
          relevant details?
          C142E

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, this is the
question on tourism marketing. The answer to the first part of the question
is: SA Tourism is the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism’s
national tourism marketing organisation.

They provide the department with annual targets at the beginning of each
financial year, and provide us with quarterly finance and performance
reports. Our department then tracks performance and achievements based on
increased arrivals. The total arrivals for the first four months of 2006
have increased by 16%, with arrivals from Africa increasing by 22%, and
arrivals from overseas – that is, the general category – increasing by
4,2%.

The answer to the second part of the question is: the international tourism
growth strategy was adopted by Cabinet in 2003. The growth strategy was
revised for the period 2005 to 2007, based on the knowledge and experience
that was gained over the past three years. Furthermore, SA Tourism
undertakes a rigorous data-driven assessment process of all global markets
every three years, which sets the marketing portfolio for the following
three years.

 Engagement with hospitality industry on grading of accommodation services,
                 and establishment of communication systems
38.   Rev P Moatshe asked the Minister of Environmental Affairs and
      Tourism:

      (1)   In light of the 2010 World Cup event, to what extent is his
           department engaging with the hospitality industry on issues
           around the grading of accommodation services, including
           accommodation in the national parks;


      (2)   whether his department has established any systems of
           communication with the Department of Sport and Recreation in
           order to synchronise the actions needed to prepare for the 2010
           Soccer World Cup event; if not, what is the position in this
           regard; if so, what were/are the challenges?
                                                   C143E


The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chair, the answer to the
first part of the question is as follows: The Department of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism contributes to the funding of the grading council, and
therefore works very closely with the organisation in monitoring the levels
and status of grading in the country.

The grading of accommodation in national parks is currently part of the
national grading programme. Over the next four years the grading council
will undertake the following tasks: grade accommodation establishments:
golfing estates, restaurants, conference venues, transport - the tour
operator is part of that – and backpackers; have awareness campaigns on the
importance of grading; train assessors; and monitor service standards in
the tourism industry.

Two, the department is represented at the 2010 interministerial committee
and the technical co-ordinating committee at national level. The purpose of
these structures is to ensure the co-ordination and alignment of 2010
activities between all departments, including our own department, and the
Department of Sport and Recreation. The main challenge at this moment is
not knowing the match schedules, as they have a great impact on demand
management in the host cities and on the surrounding areas.

Mnr A WATSON: Agb Minister, dankie vir die antwoord aan  ons  kollega,  maar
kan ek net vra of hierdie ondersoeke wat aan die  gang  is  die  hoeveelheid
akkommodasie beskikbaar insluit? Kan ek  net  die  voorbeeld  noem  van  die
Kruger Nasionale Park. Een van die plekke waar daar groot sokker gaan  wees,
is Nelspruit, en dit is die ideale toegang na die Kruger-park  toe.  Met  ’n
onlangse besoek was daar  ’n  groot  probleem  met  die  kwaliteit  van  die
akkommodasie self, maar ek wonder of u departement ook kyk  na  die  getalle
van akkommodasie beskikbaar. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A WATSON: Hon Minister, thank you for replying to our colleague. But
may I just ask whether these investigations that are currently in progress
include how much accommodation is available? May I just mention the Kruger
National Park as an example. One of the areas where big soccer events will
be hosted is Nelspruit and it provides ideal access to the Kruger National
Park. On a recent visit there was a big problem with the quality of the
accommodation itself, but I am wondering whether your department is also
looking at how much accommodation is available.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, the answer
is yes.

Die vraag het twee dele, mnr Watson. Met betrekking tot die eerste deel oor
die hoeveelheid akkommodasie is die antwoord ja. SA Toerisme het so pas die
eerste oudit ooit in ons geskiedenis van alle akkommodasie in Suid-Afrika
voltooi. Dit is nou van bed-en-ontbytplekke af dwarsdeur al die kategorieë
tot by die luukse hotelle.

Op die 10de of die 12de Oktober van hierdie jaar het ons die eerste
werkswinkel met Fifa en die Match-maatskappy wat al die akkommodasie vir
hulle doen, en ons nooi al die rolspelers in Suid-Afrika uit om daardie dag
deel te wees van die werkswinkel sodat ons spesifiek vir 2010
ooreenstemming kan kry oor ons benadering. Presies hoe wil ons 2010
benader, met al die rolspelers, want daar is baie gerugte wat die rondte
doen in die land van hoeveel beddens ons kort.

Dit wissel van 100 000 af. Sommige mense maak daarop aanspraak dat ons tot
200 000 beddens in die land te min het. Ons dink dis ’n totale oorskatting,
maar vir die eerste keer is daar nou ’n oudit en ons gaan saam met al die
rolspelers ooreenkom oor ’n benadering daaromtrent, want baie van die
hotelgroepe wil nie in ’n posisie geplaas word om hotelle te bou wat ná
2010 gaan leegstaan nie.

Wat betref die kwaliteit van akkommodasie in nasionale  parke  en  spesifiek
in die Kruger-wildtuin, het ons in hierdie  MTEF-periode  meer  as  R300 000
aan die opgradering van infrastruktuur in die parke bestee; heinings,  paaie
en hekke, maar ook akkommodasie. Dit sluit goed in soos om by baie  van  die
ruskampe swembaddens te bou - in die ou dae was die filosofie daarteen –  en
selfs by van  die  parke  ook  televisiestelle  in  die  rondawels  te  sit.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The question has two parts, Mr Watson. With regard to the  first  part  the
amount of accommodation, the answer is yes. SA Tourism  has  just  completed
the first ever audit in our  history  of  all  the  accommodation  in  South
Africa. It ranges  from  bed  and  breakfast  places  to  luxurious  hotels,
including all the categories across the board.

On 10 or 12 October of this year, we will have the first workshop with  Fifa
and the company that arranges all their accommodation and  we  are  inviting
all the role-players in South Africa to participate in the workshop on  that
day so that we can reach an agreement on  our  approach,  specifically  with
regard to 2010. We must decide on exactly how  we  want  to  approach  2010,
with all the role-players, because there are many rumours  going  around  in
the country about how many beds we are lacking.

It varies from 100 000 upwards. Some people claim that we have a lack of  as
many as 200 000 beds in the country.  We  think  that  this  is  a  complete
overestimation, but for the first time now there is an audit and we  will  ,
together with all the role-players, agree on how to  approach  this  matter,
because many of the hotel groups do not want to be in a position where  they
build hotels that will not be occupied after 2010.

With regard to the quality of the accommodation in national parks, and
specifically in the Kruger National Park, we have spent more than R300 000
in this MTEF period on the upgrading of the infrastructure in parks;
including fences, roads and gates, and accommodation as well. This includes
the building of swimming pools at many of the rest camps – in the olden
days there was a philosophy against it – and even installing televisions in
the chalets at some of the parks.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. Arising from the Minister’s
reply to the initial question, are there mechanisms in place to make sure
that during the period of the 2010 Soccer World Cup the price of the
accommodation in question is not unnecessarily ballooned, simply because
there will be people coming from outside into our country? That might
indirectly tarnish our image, as if we want to ``milk the bull’’. Thanks,
Chair. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Yes, I absolutely agree
with the hon member Mokoena. We have certain commitments already from the
hospitality industry, because in some countries - not necessarily with
regard to the World Cup, but other international events - there is always
the temptation to do that kind of thing. We would like the hospitality
industry in our country to understand that over the long term it can be
very damaging indeed if they cannot resist that temptation. Part of that
workshop is to also get agreement on how to approach that.

We have been in discussion with the hospitality sector for quite some time
on that issue, but I don’t believe that it will be a problem. My impression
is that the important role-players there understand that there is a long-
term plan and a long-term vision to develop our hospitality industry.

Let me just say with regard to the kind of accommodation in question: in
Germany the experience was that they misjudged; that many of the soccer
supporters eventually did not end up in the four-star and five-star hotels,
but in the two-star and three-star hotels. People actually stayed down in
order to rather enjoy a lot of other activities. We believe the same will
happen in South Africa. We should be very careful about what kind of
accommodation we develop and put in place for 2010 additionally.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you, Chairperson. Talking from
experience, during the World Summit on Sustainable Development, emerging
entrepreneurs invested in guesthouses and bed and breakfasts, with the view
that they would also be part of the market that was coming into the
country, but some of them never benefited owing to the fact that travel
agencies still looked to making bookings with established enterprises, thus
making the rich richer and those who had invested there, who were rather
poor, poorer, because they lost in terms of their investment.

The follow-up question is: Has the department contemplated meeting, or has
it already met, with the travel agencies and other role-players in order to
ensure that when bookings are done, there is a balanced - and not a skewed
– focus on attending to the previously disadvantaged emerging
entrepreneurs?

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, as the hon
member correctly mentioned, this was a problem with some previous events
that we had in the country. The Rugby World Cup is a good example, in which
people miscalculated. This time our approach is to have all the facts on
the table so that people know exactly what the needs are and what we should
do in the country, so that people don’t build bed and breakfasts or add on
to their homes and miscalculate in doing so. That is why we want that audit
on the table so that all of us know what the accommodation needs are and
where those needs are.

With regard to the marketing channels, we have committed ourselves to
establishing, at least two years before 2010, one central booking platform
at which people can make bookings: bed and breakfasts, hotels - whatever
the case may be – and, in the roll-out of SA Tourism, marketing those areas
where, for the first time, we have new bed and breakfasts, new hotels.
That’s a cornerstone of our approach.

There were two or three members accompanying me a few months ago when we
visited the first hotel to be built in Soweto, the five-star hotel that
will open its doors there quite soon, as well as the first graded bed and
breakfast in Soweto. So, that is all part of our plan.

Ms M P THEMBA: Thank you, Chairperson. In response to the Minister’s reply
regarding the national technical committee that has been established, my
question is: Will there be any such provincial technical committees in the
provinces? If there will be: when; and, if not: why not?

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, to the hon
member, my impression is that most of the provinces, if not all of them,
already have the technical committees in place. I can testify that at the
political level we work very closely with the premiers and all the relevant
MECs. We just had a meeting last week at which we, again, did some joint
planning on some aspects of 2010, where the provinces and local government
will be absolutely crucial. My impression was that most of them, if not all
of them, were already supported by technical committees.

             Time limit for supply of electricity to a community

39.   Kgoshi M L Mokoena asked the Minister of Minerals and Energy:

      What is the time limit for the supply of electricity to a community
      after an application has been submitted?                 C157E


The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Thank you very much, Chairperson, and
thank you to the hon member. The response to the question is that there is,
strictly speaking, no time limit, but this matter depends on a number of
factors. However, the Department of Minerals and Energy tries to ensure
that all the projects that have been gazetted for a particular financial
year are executed within that year.

To illustrate this, an electrification project follows different processes
before it is implemented, including the following. The first aspect is the
assessment of the network by a licensed distributor for the identified
project. The second aspect that they look at is the inclusion of the
project in the municipal IDP. Thirdly, there is the submission of the plan
to the Department of Minerals and Energy by either Eskom, or that licensed
distributor, or the municipality, as is appropriate. The fourth point that
they look at is the allocation of the budget by the DME to the project, the
procurement of services for the implementation, including design and
construction.

The answer to the second part of the question would be that the
municipality receives applications for electrification from communities.
These projects are identified by local communities through the IDP process.
The department and Eskom representatives are continually involved in order
to provide technical support, and respective ward councillors ensure that
these projects form part of the municipal IDP for approval by the
municipality.

Once a final list of projects has been approved, the IDP is submitted to
the DME for inclusion in the integrated national electrification programme
for the identified financial year. The allocation of funding for the
project is subject to the availability of funding.


It is important to note that not all projects on the municipal priority
list can be funded within one year. Key considerations for project
prioritisation are the extent of funding allocation from the National
Treasury, the availability of bulk infrastructure and the network capacity
at that municipality.





It is vital that community leaders liaise with communities and their
municipalities to provide feedback on the reviewed IDP priority list and to
prioritise projects accordingly. Thank you, Chairperson.


Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. Let me thank the Minister for
the appetising response. [Laughter.] Arising from the Minister’s response,
is the Minister aware, for example, that, based on information given to the
department, it is possible for some of the detachments in her department to
not even be able to respond to some letters, because in one area a
community submitted the request or applications in November 2003. Until now
there has been no response to that particular community as to whether the
area is on the programme of the department for electrification. The
question is: Is the Minister aware that there is this red tape that results
in some of these projects not being implementable? Thanks, Chair.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: I am sure that the hon member will
appreciate that I have been in the department for three months, and it is
challenges of this kind that one will be trying to deal with. But I would
appreciate it if these matters were brought to my attention so that we can
respond appropriately. Also, the municipality has a responsibility when it
comes to follow-ups and pressure on the department. It appears as if this
particular one is an administrative problem, which he is bringing to my
attention.

I would be happy to get a letter from the hon member so that we can take up
the matter. And, indeed, we apologise for that delay. Three years is quite
a long time. We could at least have responded to you, if the project was
not going to be considered. We should have indicated that already.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Thank you, hon Minister. Are there
any further follow-up questions? No. In the absence of any, we will skip
Question 40, as I am informed that the Minister responsible for the
question is busy in the other House with other commitments. She has
indicated that she will join this august House later, and that permission
has been granted. We’ll therefore move to Question 41, which is printed in
the name of the hon N J Mack to the Minister for Agriculture and Land
Affairs. Deputy Minister?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, we have also been informed that
the Minister of Transport has been urgently requested by the President to
join his entourage in the meeting with the Russian president. He was
actually ready with responses for the House, if that may also be noted.
Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Chief Whip, I noted that before we
adjourned earlier, when I said that we only had two Deputy Ministers and
that the only written confirmation of delay was from the Minister of
Transport. So, regarding the point you are raising, we have already seen to
it.

          Steps regarding need to reopen land restitution deadline

41.   Mr N J Mack asked the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs:

      (1)   Whether she has taken note of the deliberations at various
          summits regarding the need to reopen the land restitution
          deadline; if so,


        2) whether she or her department will introduce a concept document
           or debate on the complex nature of this matter?

                       C166E


The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you, Chair. The
answer to the first part of the question is: yes. The answer to the second
part of the question is the following. The concept document and debate will
ensue from the activities of the national steering committee that has been
established to take forward the recommendations of the July 2005 land
summit. Thank you.

    Progress regarding assessment of use of funding provided for Atlantic
                         Economic Development Trust

44.   Ms D Robinson asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:

      Whether, with reference to the court papers served by a certain
      company (name furnished) alleging the misuse of funds provided by it
      for the Atlantis Economic Development Trust, he will make a statement
      on the progress made with the assessment of whether the funding for
      the AEDT was applied productively?                 C191E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thanks Chairperson. The response
to question 44 is that the matter is currently before the courts and until
it is finalised the Department of Trade and Industry cannot comment because
we do not want to prejudge what the outcome of the court case will be, so
we believe in that spirit. The statement will be made later by the Minister
after the judgement. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Any follow up question? But do not
ask follow up questions because the sub judice rule applies. You know if
the matter is before the courts of law, I don’t think it is fair to
continue following up on the issue.

I therefore take your statement hon Deputy Minister that the matter is
closed and when the Minister makes that statement at the appropriate time,
the hon member will have the opportunity to pursue his or her question on
the matter. We will, therefore, proceed to question 45, also to the hon
Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry.
 Progress with roll-out of Small Enterprise Development Agency in provinces

45.   Ms J F Terblanche asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:


      Whether he will make a statement on the progress made by his
      department with the roll-out of the Small Enterprise Development
      Agency in the provinces?                                      C192E


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you very much Chair. The
answer to the question regarding the progress of the Small Enterprise
Development Agency called SEDA’s roll-out within the provinces is as
follows: SEDA has been launching six provincial agreements which have been
finalised with the following provinces - North West, Mpumalanga, Eastern
Cape, KwaZulu Natal, Free State and Northern Cape - with the three
remaining provinces to be launched soon, but those offices are working
already. The launch does not mean that the offices are not working. A total
of 28 district branch offices have been established across all provinces,
consolidating the manufacturing advice centre and local economic
development agency infrastructure. Finally, 103 enterprise information
centres have been opened with the view to leveraging on partnerships with
the private sector. The financial year end targets for roll-out include
network expansion to a total of 44 branch offices and 184 enterprise
information centres. However, a certain roll-out challenge exists.
Foremost, while SEDA’s roll-out is based on partnerships with the
provincial and local spheres of government, the Act establishing SEDA does
not give guidelines with regard to funding protocols from these spheres of
government, thus the budgetary constraints. The support from the provincial
and local government levels remains voluntary, depending on the
negotiations we have with the different provinces and the local government.

This poses a challenge to the sustainability of the funding model of SEDA
with regard to the proportion of budget support from the provincial and
local government level. It is a challenge which has hampered infrastructure
roll-out and product development. To overcome this challenge the DTI has
engaged in consultations with provincial MEC’s in order that they assist
with recommendations on additional funding arrangements.

The possibility of a regulatory framework to provide clear guidelines in
support of the implementation of the provisions of the Act is also being
explored. Once these financial and institutional arrangements have been
finalised we anticipate a drastically accelerated small enterprise
development roll-out. Thank you.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Thank you, Deputy Minister. The Deputy Minister has
alluded to the fact that there are budgetary constraints. Is this also the
reason why many of these branches are not branded at all or have any
signage or, as in the case of the branch office in the Western Cape when
visited by the DA researcher recently, not even the receptionist of the
office complex in which it is situated knows there is a SEDA branch in the
complex and what SEDA is.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: As I indicated, we have launched
in six provinces. Western Cape is one of the provinces that are outstanding
in terms of the roll-out and maybe the signage issue is due to budgetary
constraints. We believe that not only the national DTI, through their
budget, should bear the cost, because SEDA is an agency. As I have said, we
have not launched Western Cape officially, but the services are provided
for and people are being sent to those offices.

We believe that if a person has an address, he will be able to reach an
area, because if you’ve got a street address and an office block, surely
even if there is no sign for SEDA people will be able to get the
information. So far people are accessing that particular centre and they
are getting information in most of the branches. So the question of signage
and all that, is not a major problem to us at the moment, because people
can access the information, until such time that as the question of the
budgetary constraints and the commitment from the different provinces can
be sorted out. I do not believe that we should blame DTI or SEDA in that
regard.

              Statement on assertion regarding local government

46.   Ms J F Terblanche asked the Minister for Public Enterprises:

      Whether he will make a statement on a recent assertion regarding local
      government, attributed to him, as reported in the media (details
      furnished)?                                        C193E

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Thank you Chairperson. Eish, I’ve had
lots of problems recently, but I think this needs to be taken in the
context of what was happening. This was a breakfast organised by Business
Unity South Africa. Because of this breakfast, a particular member of the
audience asked a long question around the national regional electricity
distributors. And in explaining the person’s question he really provided a
lot of inaccurate information, about which I am not going to go into
details. But what worried me was that the person was actually quite senior
in local government. So I then explained in some detail precisely what the
proposal was, but that it had been made by Eskom for the national regional
electricity distributors.

In the course of further discussion, more issues arose and I made it quite
clear that I felt that certain of those proposals were useless in relation
to the reality of electricity supply and I gave some examples of the sort
of negotiations we have to have with major electricity users. So if they
had reported the whole conversation, which went on for some 20 or 30
minutes, I think the context would have been fairly clear. And I certainly
did not make the statement that the whole of local government is useless.
The only thing I can say that about with confidence, is my golf, but I did
not make that statement and I certainly would not be making any further
statements on this matter, particularly since this was a very long
discussion in a closed breakfast, but my colleagues in local government can
feel secure that I will support them fully, and if they make statements
which are a bit off beam, I reserve my right to call them useless. Thank
you.

              Statement on growing shortage of skilled artisans

47.   Ms S H Chen asked the Minister of Labour:

      Whether he will make a statement on the growing  shortage  of  skilled
      artisans, particularly in the construction industry?C194E

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (for the Minister of Labour):
Chairperson this is a very easy response, and please don’t shoot the
messenger. On whether he will make a statement on the growing dearth of
skilled artisans, in particular in the construction industry, the Minister
will not respond at the moment. But I think there is a reason for that.
Clearly, this is a matter that is being looked at in some detail and I am
quite certain that the Minister would prefer to be able to give his own
reply in full, rather than allow the Minister for Public Enterprises to try
and do it.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Yes. I am not sure whether members
are really tempted to make substantive follow-up questions, particularly in
a situation where a Minister is responding on behalf of another Minister. I
am really tempted to encourage members not to be tempted to do that because
it is a bit unfair. The Minister who has delegated another Minister to
respond has all the details about the question.

On that note then we will proceed to Question 52. I have drawn the
attention of the House to the fact that the hon Minister of Finance and the
Deputy Minister are not going to be with us, because of their commitment
with a budget lekgotla or whatever its called. So we are not going to
entertain those questions. We will, therefore, move straight to question 52
to the Minister of Labour.

    Strategy with regard to compliance with health and safety regulations

52.   Mr J M Sibiya asked the Minister of Labour:

      (1)   Whether, in light of the September 2004 and June 2006 blast that
           took place at the Sasol plant, his department has devised any
           new strategy with regard to non-compliance with the health and
           safety regulations; if not, what is the position in this regard;
           if so, what strategy;

      (2)   whether his department will revisit the current health and
           safety regulations in order to ensure better compliance to
           safety regulations; if not, why not; if so, what are the
           relevant details?
           C209E

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (for the Minister of Labour):
Chairperson, the written reply reads as follows. Since the September 2004
explosion at Sasol, in Secunda, the Department of Labour has analysed the
incident statistics in the industries. Four sectors were identified as high-
risk sectors, namely iron and steel, construction, food and beverage and
the chemical sector.

The Department of Labour’s incident prevention strategy ensures that the
department’s resources are deployed at the right places. After the sectors
had been identified, advocacy campaigns and blitz inspections were carried
out to ensure compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

A new initiative is to train shop stewards in the four high-risk sectors on
occupational health and safety. This training will start very soon.
Already, in the previous financial year - 2005-06 - a reduction of 3,8% in
fatal incidents was recorded.

The Occupational Health and Safety Act and regulations are amended on a
regular basis as the need arises. Most of the changes are done as a result
of the challenges faced by our inspectors in enforcing and monitoring
legislation and also due to experiences in incident management.

There is no need at this stage to amend any regulations as a result of the
September 2004 incident.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Thank you, hon Minister. Before we
move to the next question, I’ve just been informed that the Minister of
Finance has responded in writing to the members who have asked questions
and that all copies of the answers are available for other members, as the
House is also privy to those questions, not only the members who have posed
the questions.

   Processes to enhance Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South
                                   Africa

53.   Mrs E S Mabe asked the Minister of Labour:

      Whether his department has begun any processes to enhance the
      Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (Asgisa)
      programme; if not, what constraints have been encountered in
      implementing Asgisa; if so, which processes? C210E

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (for the Minister of Labour):
Chairperson, as I understand it the Deputy President also dealt with this
matter. The Department of Labour is involved in the Asgisa initiatives. The
laws that we are responsible for are in the main aimed at providing skills
and ensuring stability in the labour market to enable the country to
realise Asgisa objectives.

My department is also playing a critical role in two of the six constraints
that we identified in the Asgisa framework as major constraints that will
impact on our ability to achieve 6% economic growth, namely the shortage of
suitably skilled labour and disjointed special settlement patterns, the
regulatory environment and the burden on small and medium enterprises.

With regard to the shortage of suitably skilled labour, I would like to
highlight the following: All our interventions under the national skills
development strategy, which is, by the way, a very small part of the
broader human resources development strategy, are aimed at contributing
towards the skills needs of this country and to improving the skills of
those in employment and the unemployed to gain formal or self-employment.

I serve with the Minister of Labour on the Joint Initiative for Priority
Skills Acquisition – Jipsa – and the task team that includes other
Ministers who are responsible for the other HRD intervention areas and
other stakeholders. Our officials also serve on the Jipsa technical working
group that is looking at a range of skills development delivery blockages.

My department has ensured that the biggest component of the projected R5
billion skills level income for the 2006-07 period and beyond will be used
to support the skills component of Asgisa.

The SETA service level agreement concluded with the Department of Labour
for the 2006-07 financial year has scheduled a clearly outlined kind of
special Asgisa project that they are involved in. There are also special
skills development-related Asgisa projects that we are funding under the
National Skills Fund as well.

On the regulatory environment and the burden on small business, my
department is working closely with other departments such as Trade and
Industry, Provincial and Local Government and the National Treasury, in
order to develop an integrated report for presentation to Cabinet. We have
also conducted a number of round tables and bilateral consultations with
labour and business constituencies on various aspects of our labour laws.
Thank you, Chair.

     Effect of black economic empowerment policies on foreign investment

54.   Ms M P Themba asked the Minister of Labour:


      (1)   How do foreign investors respond to black economic empowerment
           (BEE) policies;


      (2)   whether BEE affects investment negatively; if not, what is the
           position in this regard; if so, (a) what are the relevant
           details and (b) what corrective measures is his department
           taking in this regard?                             C211E


The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chairperson. The
reply is as follows: Black economic empowerment policies have recently
become the focus of much attention of foreign investors. Undoubtedly, most
foreign investors are supportive of the need for broad-based black economic
empowerment. For example, the US Bureau of Public Affairs explains that US
companies support the broad goals of South Africa’s black economic
empowerment policies. Also, the codes of good practice, in particular,
provide certainty around the implementation of broad-based black economic
empowerment.

The assumption that the South African broad-based economic empowerment
regulatory framework is a deterrent to FDI, or foreign direct investment,
is not correct. International evidence points out that strengthening
economic foundations, and more specifically stabilising the economy and
promoting competitive markets, contributes much more effectively towards
the attraction of foreign investment than the pure focus on offering tax
breaks, import duty exemptions, land and power subsidies and other
incentives.

Business confidence in the South African economy is confirmed by the South
African Chamber of Business – Sacob – business confidence index, which
shows that business confidence has escalated from a low of 79,4 in January
2000 to a record high of 103,1 in January 2006 and remains over 99,1 in all
months recorded in 2006.

If BEE were indeed an obstacle to business confidence, then it follows that
an increase in BEE-related regulations and documentation would result in a
decrease in confidence levels. The opposite, however, has been found to be
the case and the notion, therefore, that the South African black economic
empowerment regulatory framework negatively affects FDI appears unfounded.
Thank you, Chairperson.

 Plans regarding revision of 70-year lease period iro forest in Richards Bay
                                    area

55.   Nks N D Ntwanambi ubuza uMphathiswa waMashishini kaRhulumente:

      Ingaba, njengoko inkampani ethile inesivumelwano seminyaka engamashumi
      asixhenxe kumahlathi ommandla wase Richards Bay, nto leyo eyenza ukuba
      lo mhlaba ungafumaneki kubantu abawunqwenelayo, isebe lakhe lingakhe
      liqwalasele ixesha lesi sivumelwano; ukuba akunjalo, kungokuba
      kutheni; ukuba kunjalo, zithini iinkcukacha malunga nalo mba?
                  C212X
(Translation of isiXhosa question follows.)

[55.  Ms N D Ntwanambi asked the Minister for Public Enterprises:


      Whether, in light of the fact that a certain company (name furnished)
      has a 70-year lease on the forest in the area of Richards Bay,
      rendering that land unavailable for allocation to needy people, his
      department will revise the lease period; if not, why not; if so, what
      are the relevant details?         C212E]

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson, the forests referred to
were previously in the KwalaMnambi area and Port Dunford. These plantations
were declared in terms of the National Forests Act. Essentially, what
Safcol did was to dispose of these forests and, as a result, Safcol no
longer operates them. As members may be aware, these forests were disposed
of to Siyaqhubeka, a company or consortium which includes BEE components
and has various provisions for ESOPs.

The forests do not leave state hands, however. The land remains in state
hands. As members may be aware the growth time of a tree is about 35 years.
So, the lease needs to be for two cycles of trees in order to make it a
viable economic proposition, and this is why the lease period is 70 years.
However, the department that actually manages the leases, because the lands
remain on their books, is the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.

Whilst I understand the question, I think attempts were made to provide for
participation by communities in this. The logic of the 70-year lease is
fairly strong, but any decision as to whether there would be a change will
reside with the Ministry and Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, not
with Public Enterprises, which is no longer involved in those forests apart
from a warehouse and shareholdings that we have in the particular company,
Siyaqhubeka.

  Opportunities for previously disadvantaged people to participate in sand
                                   mining

56.   Nks N D Ntwanambi ubuza uMphathiswa weZimbiwa naMandla:

      Ingaba ukombiwa kwentlabathi eNtshona-Koloni kuwazisile na amathuba
      okoba nabo babengabandakanyeki kolushishino babandakanyeke; ukuba
      akunjalo, lizakuthini isebe lakhe ukuqwalasela oku; ukuba kunjalo,
      zithini inkcukacha malunga nalo mba?
                             C213X
(Translation of isiXhosa question follows.)


[56.  Ms N D Ntwanambi asked the Minister of Minerals and Energy:

      Whether opportunities were given to previously disadvantaged people to
      participate in sand mining in the Western Cape; if not, what is her
      department doing to rectify this matter; if so, what are the relevant
      details?         C213E]


The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Firstly, I think I need to apologise
to the House. The details, especially the statistics given in the response,
are really not something that I can present to the House. It is very
confusing. Unfortunately I couldn’t get an opportunity to look into this,
because I was participating in the programme of President Putin’s official
visit. So, I couldn’t really look at this.

But, looking at it now, I can’t present it to the House. So, I am
requesting that the hon member brings back the question. Then I will come
and respond to it.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon member, is that acceptable?
Thank you.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Well, I could also reply in writing.
Thank you.

    Position regarding legislation on beneficiation, and recruitment and
                   advancement of people with disabilities

57.   Mr D D Gamede asked the Minister of Minerals and Energy:

      (1)   Whether her department is anticipating any legislation on
           beneficiation; if not, what is the position in this regard; if
           so, when;
      (2)   how many people with disabilities (a) have been recruited in her
           department and (b) hold (i) senior and (ii) middle management
           positions;


      (3)   whether mines are meeting the national target of employing
           people with disabilities; if not, what is the position in this
           regard; if so,


      (4)   how is her department monitoring the mines in this regard?

                       C214E

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chair, currently the department is not
anticipating any new legislation on beneficiation as it is our opinion that
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and the two amendments
of both the Diamond Act and the Precious Metals Act are adequate to
encourage beneficiation of diamonds and precious metals in South Africa.
Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Any follow-up question? In the
absence of any follow-up questions, we then proceed to the next question,
which is printed in the name of hon Gamede.

Mr D D GAMEDE: Chair, I just wanted to say that there were four questions,
and the hon Minister has answered the first one.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: The reply to the second part of the
question is as follows: The Department of Minerals and Energy has recruited
12 employees with disabilities. One employee holds a senior management
position, six are in middle management positions and five are below that.
The total percentage of disabled people in the department is 1,4%. So,
indeed, hon member there is a lot that we still need to do.

In response to the third part of the question, issues related to employment
equity, like the employment of people with disabilities, are handled by the
Ministry of Labour and not necessarily that of Minerals and Energy. We are
required to comply with the Act as well, but the enforcement of the Act is
more the responsibility of the Minister of Labour.

   Measures to ensure 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament is not disturbed by
                                power outages

58.   Mr J M Sibiya asked the Minister of Minerals and Energy:


      Whether her department has put any measures in place to ensure that
      the 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament in our country is not disturbed
      by power outages; if not, why not; if so, (a) what measures and (b)
      what (i) successes have been achieved and (ii) challenges have been
      encountered to date?                         C215E

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Oh! I’m in trouble today. The reply to
the question is as follows: With regard to the World Cup, the Department of
Minerals and Energy has taken specific actions to ensure quality and
security of supply to all venues and host cities. There is a strategy in
place for that particular purpose.

Firstly, we also have a regulatory framework relating to electricity
distribution. Secondly, we will be looking at the refurbishment and
rehabilitation programme as part of the electrification programme. There is
also a proposal for additional funding submitted to the National Treasury.
We are also looking at interacting with other countries, especially Korea
and Germany that have had the World Cup before, so that we can get some
lessons from them. Thank you very much.

 Research into obstacles preventing an entrepreneur culture in South Africa

59.   Mrs E S Mabe asked the Minister of Trade and Industry:


      Whether his department has conducted any research into the obstacles
      and bottlenecks preventing South Africans from building an
      entrepreneur culture in our country; if not, why not; if so, what are
      the relevant details?                                         C222E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, this is my last
response today. The reply reads as follows: Between 2000-01, the Department
of Trade and Industry and the European Union commissioned a study on the
state of entrepreneurship in South Africa. The objective of the study was
to inform the design of our national strategy to foster entrepreneurship in
South Africa. The method employed was to conduct research on various
aspects of entrepreneurship and approaches to the promotion of
entrepreneurship with a view to formulating policy recommendations for a
national strategy. The research pointed to the general lack of awareness of
entrepreneurship as an alternative career choice.

As part of the strategy to raise the profile of entrepreneurship, on 26
June 2006 our Minister of Trade and Industry, Minister Mpahlwa, declared
July and August as national entrepreneurship months. We are conducting
workshops on entrepreneurship in all nine the provinces as well as running
campaigns through the media. The initiative will become an annual feature
in the DTI calendar of events. It will also be reinforced by other
enterprise support measures currently being carried out by the Department
of Trade and Industry institutions and other government departments.

Also, you will agree with me that during the apartheid era, people were
made to go to school, but afterwards they had to go and be job seekers. We
are trying to change that aspect, that people can start at an early age.
That’s why we also have the Techno Girls programme in the department to try
and make sure that they can start to think about entrepreneurship at an
early age so that when they finish studying, whether it is tertiary
education or not, they are geared-up to start businesses rather than
depending on government or the private sector to employ them.

That is what we have done even in July/August for DTI, practically going to
hold these particular workshops in the nine provinces. We were particularly
focusing on areas that are rural or peri-urban, because we believe that
that is where the need is crucial. Thank you very much.

 Strategy to utilise unused goods sheds within the context of black economic
                                 empowerment

60.   Mr A L J Moseki asked the Minister for Public Enterprises:

      (1)   Whether he has a comprehensive strategy to fully utilise the
          unutilised goods sheds within the context of black economic
          empowerment; if so, what are the relevant details;


      (2)   how are communities in the rural areas taken on board in order
          to be informed of and benefit from opportunities presented by the
          strategy to outsource goods sheds?       C223E

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chair and hon member, we have just
completed a very comprehensive survey of the properties of Transnet, Eskom
and Denel a few months back. But let me focus on Transnet properties.

In large measure, our first job was to identify whether this property would
be required for the core function of Transnet or the non-core. We could do
that to a large extent although there are still two processes that require
to be completed before we can finalise all of the possible non-core land.
The first process is the plans within Transnet on ports and rail, which we
still would consult with the Department of Transport on and also the study
by the Department of Transport dealing with branch lines and non-corridor
lines.

But, we have identified a significant amount of non-core property. Some of
these may be sheds and marshalling yards and goods sheds, but others are
various forms of land, housing, etc. The process that we have adopted with
the approval of Cabinet is, firstly, we have approached other government
departments and asked whether this land would be of use to them.

A significant amount of the land will be purchased for housing by the
Department of Housing. We have also had certain pieces of land that would
be transferred to and/or purchased by the Ministries of Education,
nationally and provincially, for certain projects that they would benefit
from. We are also currently in discussions with the Department of Trade and
Industry, because it is possible that certain pieces of that land could be
used within the Small Enterprise Development Agency, SEDA, context or other
contexts for infrastructure in small areas.

The balance of the land that we will dispose of is going to be done
according to the Department of Trade and Industry’s BEE charters. So,
people can analyse that. There will be a very strong emphasis on BEE.

The one addition that we have put in which I think makes a lot of sense is
that, for certain pockets of land, we give special preference to people in
the town where that land is.  That process will commence fairly soon and we
will have road shows around the provinces on that.

There are other pockets of land which are much larger and can be used in
conjunction with cities or towns to help with their development within the
city. We will handle that process slightly differently but again giving
priority to empowerment and working very closely with the local governments
that are concerned with that.

So, I believe it is an interesting opportunity indeed to utilise assets and
property not required by Transnet to benefit BEE and local communities. We
will mount provincial and local road shows because this land is spread
right across the country. Not all of it is goods sheds, but I have widened
it because I think there’s a lot of other property that we use fully as
well.

Thank you Chair.

Mr A L J MOSEKI: Thank you Chairperson for the detailed response from the
Minister. I just want to request the Minister, if possible, to give us that
written response. Thank you very much.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Thank you for that request. That is
not a follow-up question. I don’t think that there’s a problem with the
request. Any follow-up questions, hon members? In the absence of questions,
we will proceed to Question 61 printed in the name of the hon J Tau to the
Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs.

              Delay in handing over land to community of Pniel

61.   Mr R J Tau asked the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs:


      Whether she has been informed that, although the Pniel land
      restitution case was finalised in December 2005, a delay has occurred
      in handing over the land to the community; if so, what are the reasons
      for the delay?                               C225E
The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Thank you, sir. This
Pniel matter was very difficult. Let me just give the answer – I won’t
explain too much about this matter.

Yes, the commission is aware of the delays. I wish to point out that the
claim has not been finalised earlier due to the reluctance, for various
reasons, of the landowner to sign the offer to purchase to the settlement
agreement.

The good news is that yesterday my Minister signed the bloody thing.
[Laughter.] I’m sorry, sir. Just for your information, this is a very
important place because there are diamonds there. So, you have lots of
vultures hanging around and messing up everything. It is as simple as that!


Let me just tell you that the original asking price, just for your
information, was R76 million. We valued the land and what we got was R31
million. It has been settled now for R35 million - still not small money
after three years of negotiations.

Can I just tell you what in the end the problem was? It was this question
of interest on the price. The problem was if the Minister signed in terms
of section 42 (d) of the Restitution Act – a so-called settlement - that
settlement was not with the owner of the land.

In this case it was with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Southern
Africa. The settlement was with the claimants.

Actually, the whole section has nothing to do with the settlement or the
owner. Now, if the Minister agrees with the claimants that this is a valid
claim and they must get the land, the state must go and acquire the land.
What normally happens, as Minister Didiza will know very well, with a
section 42-application to the Minister, is that there is a settlement with
the owner. Then everything is quicker.

In this instance, the seller of the land wanted interest from the day that
the agreement of sale was signed until the date of registration in the
deeds office. And that can be up to a year. Now, we are using state money
to pay that interest, and it is a huge amount. We have a problem in
principle with that, and that’s why I have always said it is fairer to the
owner of the land to expropriate the land, because when the notice of
expropriation is given ownership passes immediately.

There aren’t those things like the farmer moaning ``Hey, I can’t plant
things. The banks are not giving me loans, I am sitting here for a year and
a half on the land and have no income and as such can’t plant anything’’ -
and then there is heavy pressure on the Ministry. Expropriation is far
fairer, which I would say in this case should have been done. It is a
quicker road. Thank you very much.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you, Deputy Minister, for the reply, we appreciate
that. But, hon Deputy Minister, are you aware that there is some infighting
taking place there and that that was one of the causes. Has that infighting
been sorted out from your office? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Well, I won’t go into
that very complicated infighting, because then it would look as if we are
saying these are right and those are wrong. All I can say is that the claim
has been settled with the claimants in terms of section 42(d) and we have a
settlement with the owner on the amount of money. The process will now
continue.

The Minister was there just this weekend handing over land and the people
are going to mine the diamonds down there. That matter went well. It also
took a long time but things are moving, one by one, and I hope we won’t
have further problems. We can’t do too much after the event. Thank you.

Ms B L MATLHOELA: Thank you, hon Chair. This is a courtesy follow-up
question to the Minister relating to the Pniel question. Last week, a
delegation of the legislature of the Northern Cape did oversight with
regard to this, together with Mr Tau. Seeing that we have received this
good message from the hon Minister, can this delegation have the honour to
go and give this message to those people personally again, please? Thank
you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): I am not sure hon Deputy Minister
whether we have powers to authorise that but you can do that. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: I will tell you why I
am going to say no, because if you go I can’t go to Kimberley to my
hometown of Boshoff next door. So well, okay, you can go. [Laughter.]

Mr A WATSON: Chair, mine is not a follow up question but a point of order.
Can I ask you to rule that the Deputy Minister restore the decorum of this
House by withdrawing the word he used earlier on. I didn’t want to disturb
the question but the word he said sorry for must be withdrawn officially.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Without really delaying the
question, I think the Deputy Minister has proactively apologised. I was
going to rule him to order. But, I’m not sure if you really want to insist.
I was going to rule him to order. I was not going to allow that but the
Deputy Minister has said sorry, proactively. Are you comfortable with that,
hon Watson?

Mr A WATSON: Yes.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Hon members I would like to welcome
the hon Minister of Transport and the hon Minister of Public Works. Hon
Ministers, we have been informed of your apologies to join us later due to
other commitments - the hon Minister of Public Works was in the National
Assembly and the hon Minister of Transport was part of a delegation that
welcomed the President of Russia. On that note, your apologies have been
accepted and conveyed to the House.

We will treat your questions as follows: I will start with the Minister of
Transport with two questions and then proceed to the Minister of Public
Works with three questions. I will start with the Minister of Transport
with Question 34 written in the name of hon Robertson to the Minister.

   Alternative mode of transport available to rural farm workers and their
                                  children

34.   Mr M O Robertson asked the Minister of Transport:


      Whether there is any alternative mode of transport available to rural
      farm workers and their children other than being transported by
      farmers to town and school using their bakkies; if not, why not; if
      so, what are the relevant details?           C71E
The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, the answer is yes. Other than
bakkie-based transport services supplied by farm owners, alternative modes
of transport, both motorised and non-motorised, are also utilised in rural
areas. The minibus taxi service constitutes the predominant mode of
transport, followed by bus services, cars and bakkies, which are all
commercial services provided on the basis of financial reward, as opposed
to farm owner services that are provided in kind.

In addition, non-motorised modes such as walking, cycling and animal-drawn
transport are also utilised in remote rural settings.  Specific local
circumstances obviously affect the range of alternatives available. Where
none are currently available, the Department of Transport and provincial
authorities have been tasked to identify these as a priority.

The amendments to the National Land Transport Transition Act - courtesy of
my colleague the Minister of Public Works last week – are in the process of
being passed by Parliament to provide for light delivery vehicles, LDVs,
used for public transport to be legalised.

The draft rural transport strategy for South Africa, which is being refined
by the Department of Transport for Cabinet approval, also looks at several
issues regarding transport in rural areas and proposes a set of actions on
rural transport services and infrastructure, which will also benefit farm-
workers. The use of nonmotorised transport is part of the balanced rural
transport system suggested in the strategy.

In addition, the Department of Transport is in the process of developing a
national scholar transportation strategy, which will assist school children
in rural areas as well. The Shova Kalula bicycle programme has been
implemented since 2001 and is currently entering its fourth phase. The aim
of the programme is to provide bicycles as a low-cost transport solution to
learners, women and farm-workers. So far, 17 000 bicycles have been
distributed. We hope that within 10 years we would have distributed 1
million bicycles.

The Department of Transport is working on sustainable alternative modes
with the SA Bureau of Standards – the SABS. A new nonmotorised transport
design concept, which covers modified bicycles and animal-drawn carts, is
being developed.

The department has also planned to promote a small, coherent set of modes
in selected localities with a view to building the critical mass of users
to overcome sociocultural and economic inhibitions. These targeted
interventions are included in the Rural Transport Development programme,
which this hon House will have as soon as Cabinet has approved it. I thank
you.

Mr M O ROBERTSON: Hon Minister, thank you very much for your reply. The
question went a bit haywire. The section that was left out was that the
people, farmers and taxi drivers who use their bakkies to convey people,
are being fined by the police for loading people on the back of their
bakkies. If you could help me with that please, Minister. The SAPS is
actually fining them if they put one person or more on the back of the van.


The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: I think I addressed that issue when I stated
that the current Act is being amended, which will take into account the
question that the hon member has asked. So if we can wait until Parliament
has adopted these amendments, then your question will also be relevant at
that time.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, could the Minister share with us as to
whether, when delivering on this Shova Kalula programme, there would be any
programmes on road safety as well as repairs and maintenance for these
bicycles? I thank you.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Part of the conditions that we lay down  when we
distribute these bicycles, especially to schools, is to make sure that the
schools budget for their maintenance and also, when kids leave the school
they have to leave the bicycles at school so that other children who come
in can use them.

Recently, I went to Sekhukhuneland Municipality where we delivered these
bicycles and I was pleasantly surprised to see joy on the faces of those
children when they received those bicycles because our children walk
kilometres and kilometres on end, some walk as far as 10 km to school and
back. So this Shova Kalula concept, I think, is a well-deserved
intervention to alleviate the plight of our children and also women,
especially in the rural areas.

Last week we had this international conference on gender, transport and
development in Port Elizabeth. It is actually horrifying to know the
reality of South Africa and this is based on the results of the research
that was done in the Eastern Cape. The burden of transport on rural African
women in our new democracy is something that we should not be proud of. So,
we need to make interventions such as this one, to alleviate the plight of
our people.

Mr M O ROBERTSON: Chair, in a lighter vein, will the hon Minister refund
the funds that have been paid in the meantime? [Laughter.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, arising out of the Minister’s initial
reply and based on the follow-up question by my colleague, hon Robertson,
while waiting for the Bill to be passed by Parliament to address what I can
call a “crisis” for now, are there interim measures to address this crisis?

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: I think that as members of the NCOP we should be
the first ones to advocate the observance of the laws that we do pass. So,
until the Act is amended, the law must take its course. [Laughter.]

 Upgrading of Mpumalanga national roads, and possible conversion thereof to
                                 toll roads

43.   Mr A Watson asked the Minister of Transport:

      (1)   In view of the fact that in the 2005-06 financial year a major
          portion of the national roads was transferred from Mpumalanga to
          the SA National Roads Agency Limited and that a further 916
          kilometers will be transferred this financial year, when will
          upgrades to these roads commence, especially in light of the
          expected increase in traffic on all Mpumalanga roads from now
          until after the 2010 Soccer World Cup tournament and the large
          influx of tourists to the Kruger National Park and the two
          countries bordering Mpumalanga;


      (2)   whether any of these upgraded roads will be converted to toll
          roads, if not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                                    C189E


The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, can I ask the indulgence of the hon
member and give a summary report, and I will hand over to him the details
in terms of kilometres.

The answer is: The SA National Roads Agency Limited, Sanral, has recently
incorporated another 41 km of provincial roads as part of Sanral’s primary
road network. In addition to this, a further 637 km will be incorporated
into the national road network over the next two financial years.

All these roads are part of routine road maintenance contracts and the
primary aim is to make them safe for our users. Work commenced on sections
of the N11 in November 2005 and is ongoing. Most other work on other roads
will commence during the first quarter of 2007 and will last approximately
two years, depending on each project. As I have indicated, I will provide
the specific details to the hon member.

Secondly, the section of the N17 between Springs and Ermelo, and between
Ermelo and Oshoek border post, has been declared a continuous toll road.
Sanral, under the current circumstances, does not envisage declaring any
other national road in the Mpumalanga province as a toll road.

            Programme of building offices for traditional leaders

40.   Kgoshi M L Mokoena asked the Minister of Public Works:

      Whether her department will continue with the programme to build
      offices for traditional leaders that was started by her predecessor;
      if not, why not; if so, (a) how many buildings are going to be built
      in this financial year and (b) in which provinces?
                                                   C158E

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, the answer to the question is
that the programme referred to by Kgoshi Mokoena, to provide traditional
leaders with an administrative base on which to initiate community
development projects or programmes, was introduced as a subcomponent of the
Community-Based Public Works Programme, CBPWP. This programme was a poverty
alleviation programme, as well as assisting communities with infrastructure
they deserve.

We are all aware that this programme was discontinued in 2003, following
the introduction of the Municipal Infrastructure Grant, which was
allocated, and which is still allocated, to municipalities. The
discontinuation of CBPWP has meant the discontinuation of all associated
programmes or initiatives.

Currently there are no funds in the Department of Public Works’ budget that
can be utilised to build offices for traditional leaders. I would want,
however, to indicate to Kgoshi Mokoena that a matter which relates to this
has been raised by the House of Traditional Leaders and we will be engaging
with the Department of Provincial and Local Government to see how best we
can address the need that has been expressed. Thank you.

        Quantification of success of Expanded Public Works Programme

42.   Mr G R Krumbock asked the Minister of Public Works:

      Whether the number of work opportunities the Expanded Public Works
      Programme created was an adequate measure with which to quantify its
      success in achieving its core objective of ensuring the improved
      future labour market performance of its participants; if not, what is
      the position in this regard; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                   C188E

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, the answer to the question is as
follows: The EPWP is one of a range of initiatives agreed to by business,
labour and government, if we recall, in 2003 at the Growth and Development
Summit. The Growth and Development Summit Agreement stated:


  Expanded Public Works Programmes can provide poverty and income relief
  through temporary work for the unemployed to carry out socially useful
  activities. These EPWPs will be designed to equip participants with a
  modicum of training and work experience. We should enhance their ability
  to earn a living in the future.

Following the Growth and Development Summit Agreement, the government
formulated the Expanded Public Works Programme in consultation with the
social partners and set a target of creating 1 million work opportunities,
coupled with training in the first five years of the programme. This is to
be achieved by delivering public goods and services in a more labour
intensive manner, particularly with regard to infrastructure. Today, the
EPWP is on track to exceed this initial five-year target.

With regard to the measurement of the number of work opportunities created,
I must indicate, one cannot say currently whether it is sufficient to
ascertain the impact of the programme on the ability of the unemployed to
earn a living in the future. There may be anecdotal experiences where some
of the people who have been through the programme have been able to find
work opportunities in the future, but on others we cannot say so with
certainty. I want therefore to assure this House that given the work that
we, ourselves, have commissioned to evaluate this programme, we will be
able to come back and report what the findings of our commission relate to.

         Steps to improve service delivery in Northern Cape Province

62.   Mr R J Tau asked the Minister of Public Works:

      Whether, in light of the highly publicised problems in her department
      in the Northen Cape, she has taken any steps to improve service
      delivery without compromising the Expanded Public Works Programme
      progress in the province; if not, why not; if so, what steps?
                                              C227E

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, hon Tau has raised a question,
which relates to the problem in the Northern Cape. I must apologise first,
that I did not ask hon Tau whether this relates to the regional office or
to the Department of Public Works in the province. However, the information
that one has in terms of the problems, which we assumed might have been
referred to, relates to the Northern Cape Department of Public Works and
Transport.

I would want to say to hon members, I am not sure that I would be a
competent authority to talk on the problems that may exist in the
Department of Public Works of the province, but rather to say that I have
been informed by the Premier of the province that Members of the Executive
Council responsible for transport and public works, as well as the head of
department in the same department, have actually been given leave in order
to find a way in which to deal with the problems that are there. She has
further indicated to me the request for assistance from my department to
assist the department on a range of issues, particularly infrastructure
expenditure to support the various departments of state.

It is important to me to indicate that with regard to the Expanded Public
Works Programme in the province, our own assessment is that it is intact
and fully operational. There is, even during this leave period of the
Members of the Executive Council, an MEC who is acting, as well as the head
of department who is acting in the department. Therefore, governance
continues.

A provincial co-ordinating committee, consisting of representatives from
various implementing departments, is in place. The lead department, which
is the provincial Department of Transport, Roads and Public Works, is
taking care of the submission of quarterly monitoring data. Draft data for
validation had been reported on more than 200 projects for the first
quarter of the financial year 2006-07. Sector fora for the infrastructure,
environment, culture of the social and economic sectors deal with all
sector-specific matters such as training.

The National Department of Public Works is confident that the
implementation of the EPWP will not be compromised by the challenges that
might be faced. As I’ve said earlier, there are structures that support the
lead department, which is the Department of Public Works and Transport, in
this regard. There is also an acting executive authority and I am sure the
executive council itself will have an interest to ensure that this
programme does not suffer. Thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr T S Setona): Any follow-up question, hon members?
In the absence of any, I will take this opportunity to thank hon Ministers
and Deputy Ministers, who have taken it as part of their commitment to be
part of this session this afternoon. I think the manner in which questions
have been responded to was not only to satisfy the Members of Parliament,
but, more broadly, to inform the public about what government is doing to
better their lives as a mandate of our democratic government after 2004. On
that note, thank you to everyone who has participated.
