  CONGRATULATIONS TO MINISTER FRASER-MOLEKETI ON BEING ELECTED PRESIDENT OF
    THE COMMONWEALTH ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I
move without notice:

   That the House –

     1) notes that on Sunday, 22 October 2006, the Hon Minister Geraldine
        Fraser-Moleketi, Minister for the Public Service and
        Administration, was elected as the President of the Commonwealth
        Association for Public Administration and Management, CAMAP, at its
        2006 Biennale Conference currently underway in Sydney, Australia;


     2) observes that the conference, which started on Saturday, 21 October
        2006, is being held under the theme: Rising to the Challenge:
        Enhancing Public Sector Capability;

     3) recognises that the organisation’s programmes are widely seen as
        strengthening the quality and effectiveness of public
        administration while advancing good governance in Commonwealth
        countries; and

     4) congratulates Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi on her election
        and wishes her and the organisation success in their work of
        promoting good governance and sound public management practices.

Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Motion agreed to.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Acting Speaker, I move without
notice:

   That the House –


     1) notes that the week of 24 October to 30 October has been declared
        by the United Nations as Disarmament Week and that it is meant to
        highlight the danger of the arms race, and the need to end it;

     2) further notes that much progress has been made towards abolishing
        nuclear weapons, as well as chemical weapons and land mines, the
        total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction has not yet
        been realised;

     3) recognises that the South African Government has led by example in
        voluntarily dismantling its nuclear weapons programme and since
        then has adopted a strict policy of disarmament and non-
        proliferation with regard to weapons of mass destruction and the
        capabilities to produce these weapons;

     4) further recognises the right of all states to develop research,
        production and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without
        discrimination; and
     5) calls on all countries to increase transparency and security of
        their weapons material holdings and to continue practical,
        systematic and progressive efforts to advance nuclear disarmament
        globally.

Motion agreed to.


                          AWARD TO DR VANGA SIWISA


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms R J MASHIGO (ANC): Thank you, Chairperson. This is a statement to honour
Dr Vanga Siwisa. We in the ANC wish to congratulate Dr Vanga Siwisa, who
has won the prestigious Pierre Jacques Rural Doctor of the Year Award from
the Rural Doctors Association of South Africa. Recognising the dire need
for health care for people in the rural areas of our country, Dr Vanga
Siwisa sacrificed a comfortable lifestyle and a busy practice in
Randfontein to help set up an outpost clinic at Taung. This has resulted in
thousands of people from all around Taung being able to access health
facilities. These efforts did not go unnoticed.

The ANC continues to work tirelessly for the provision of primary health
care in the rural areas by, amongst other things, eradicating the backlog
in health services and improving the reliability of doctors and nurses in
remote areas of our country. However, we recognise that this campaign to
encourage health care professionals to go to the rural areas of our country
will not succeed if we do not work with the sector itself. The ANC will
continuously work with our people in an effort to bring back a better life
for all and urges other health care professionals to emulate this shining
example of Dr Siwisa. I thank you. [Applause.]


                               RAPE STATISTICS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD (DA): Chair, reports in today’s press reveal that
almost one fifth of South African men have raped a woman and many have done
so by the age of 17. This revelation points to a cancer in our midst which
will continue to grow and spread, unless effective and urgent steps are
taken to root out the causes of the crisis.

According to police statistics for 2005-06, a total of 54 907 rapes were
reported to the police during the period of one year, that is 150 reported
each day. The reality is thus that over 1500 women are raped each day in
this country but most choose not to report that it had happened. Reports
that 82 children are charged every day for raping or indecently assaulting
other children is yet another indication that we have a serious societal
problem on our hands.

However, our criminal justice system is not playing its part and detection
rates are abysmal, our forensic science laboratories are in a shambles and
our courts are in crisis, with case backlogs growing every year. Almost 68%
of all reported adult rape cases and 59% of all child rape cases never go
to court, with only 7% of all reported rapes ending in conviction. Rapists
know that they can get away with their crimes. Why is it that nothing this
government has done during the past 12 years has turned this utterly
revolting tide? [Applause.]


                    VIOLENCE AGAINST INMATES AT POLLSMOOR


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs S A SEATON (IFP): Acting Speaker, the IFP notes that serious
allegations have been made against warders of Pollsmoor Prison, after two
inmates stabbed a colleague. It has been alleged that senior wardens forced
300 inmates to strip in front of female warders and then proceeded to beat
them with batons. In addition, dogs were also allegedly set on the inmates.
From reports it is thought that at least three convicts sustained broken
arms and legs, and others had to be treated for cuts and bruises.
The IFP, therefore, calls on the Minister, the department and the area
commissioner of Correctional Services to immediately launch an
investigation into these allegations and to report the findings to
Parliament as soon as possible. If these allegations are found to have a
basis in fact, the involved correctional services personnel must be charged
and brought before disciplinary hearings as soon as possible. If necessary,
criminal charges must also be brought against them.

It is completely unacceptable that collective punishment of this violent
nature can be meted out to inmates in the democratic South Africa. It
smacks of the old days when prisoners were regularly tortured and abused.
This has no place in our society, especially when it is considered that
rehabilitation of offenders is supposed to be one of the cornerstones of
our system of corrections. I thank you.


                         DEVELOPMENT FUND FOR WOMEN


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms N J NGELE (ANC): Thank you, Chairperson. This statement is on the
women’s fund. The ANC supports the resolution taken by the recently held
women’s conference to explore the establishment of a developmental women’s
fund and strengthen initiatives such as the Malibongwe project to assist
with creating an enabling environment for those women at the bottom end of
the economy. Women, particularly in the rural areas, still face serious
difficulties on issues such as access to credit.

South Africa, the continent and the whole world will not realise their full
potential, unless and until women are placed at the centre of developmental
efforts. As members of the ANC, we came clearly to define the emancipation
of women, as an inherent, inalienable and defining feature of our struggle
for national liberation. Thus we arrived at a firm determination that our
freedom could never be complete, unless it involved the emancipation of the
women of our country. We urge the government to explore the possibility of
financing the fund, along the lines of the Umsobomvu Youth Fund. Thank you.



                            DEATH OF LEBO MATHOSA


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr G T MADIKIZA (UDM): Chairperson, the UDM extends its sympathies to the
family, friends and colleagues of the late musician Lebo Mathosa. Her death
at the young age of 29 comes as a harsh reminder of the fragility of human
life. Our thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones during this time of
bereavement.

Lebo Mathosa shot to fame as a member of Boom Shaka and later launched a
highly successful solo career. In the process, she received numerous music
awards and accolades. She also appeared in numerous local television shows
and nobody will dispute that she had a long and distinguished career as an
artist ahead of her. As a person she was rightly acknowledged as a hard
worker, who respected those she worked and interacted with. Her outgoing
personality and easygoing, positive attitude, as well as her undeniable
lust for life, were the qualities that endeared her to many people.

It is sad that the country has lost so many of its leading young musicians
in the past year and doubly so that another of them has succumbed in a road
accident. Our roads claim the lives of more than 10 000 South Africans
every year. The cost to our society, our families, our industries and our
social fabric as a whole is simply too high. It is time we initiated a
concerted new campaign to end this carnage. It is abundantly clear that
current strategies are simply not delivering results. [Time expired.]


                           SHARE OFFER BY MEDIA24


                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr C P MULDER (VF PLUS): Agb Meneer die Waarnemende Speaker, Media24 sal
wys wees om kennis te neem van die oorweldigende verontwaardiging en
reaksie van die publiek oor sy huidige aandeelskema. Dit gaan nie hier oor
die 15%-aandeelhouding van Media24 wat hierna onder swart beheer gaan wees
nie. Ons moet ook onthou dat “swart” volgens die regering se breë definisie
van “swart” hanteer word. Dit gaan oor die manier waarop dit gedoen word.
In ooreenstemming met die ANC-regering se voorskrifte word op ’n
ongevoelige manier, suiwer op rassegrondslag, aan sekere mense die
geleentheid gegee om 80% van die gesubsideerde aandele in Media24 te bekom,
terwyl ander landsburgers op grond van hul ras die geleentheid ontsê word.
Om die ANC-regering klakkeloos na te volg deur te beweer dat alle swartes,
bruines en Indiërs voorheen benadeel is, of nog steeds is, is onsin.
Hiervolgens gaan Naspers nou onder andere skatryk swart- en
Indiërmiljoenêrs en ander se aandeelaankope subsidieer met 80%, terwyl arm
witmense, omdat hulle wit is, direk benadeel word. Dit is suiwer rassisme.

Die VF Plus het egter begrip vir Media24 se huidige dilemma  en  daarom  wil
die VF Plus aan Media24 ’n uitdaging rig, ’n uitdaging waardeur Media24  nie
net sy geloofwaardigheid kan herwin nie,  maar  ook  kan  doen  wat  reg  en
billik is. Kom dadelik met ’n verdere aandeleaansporingskema  van  5-10%  op
dieselfde gesubsideerde manier, maar dié keer  spesifiek  vir  jong,  huidig
benadeelde witmense van 25 jaar  en  jonger.  Hier  is  ’n  geleentheid  vir
Media24 om ’n verskil te maak en sodoende ’n nuwe  rigting  vir  Suid-Afrika
se jeug aan te dui. Die kans is daar. Doen dit. Ek dank u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER (FF PLUS): Hon Mr Acting Speaker, Media24  will  be  wise  to
take note of the overwhelming indignation and reaction of the  public  about
its current shares schemes. Here it is not about the 15% shares  in  Media24
that after this will be under black control. We must remember  that  “black”
is being dealt with in accordance with the government’s broad definition  of
“black”. It is about the manner in which it is done. In accordance with  the
ANC government regulations, in an  insensitive  manner  and  based  just  on
racial grounds, the opportunity is given to people to get 80% of  subsidised
shares in Media24, while other citizens are excluded on the basis  of  their
race. To follow the ANC without  rhyme  or  reason,  by  claiming  that  all
blacks,  coloureds  and  Indians  have  previously  been  disadvantaged,  is
nonsense. According to this Naspers will now, among others,  subsidise  very
wealthy black and Indian millionaires and others’  purchases  by  80%  while
poor white people are adversely affected directly because  they  are  white.
That is blatant racism.

The FF Plus, however, understands the current dilemma of Media24 and
therefore the FF Plus wants to challenge Media24, a challenge whereby
Media24 can not only gain back their credibility, but can also do what is
right and fair. Immediately come up with a further shares motivation scheme
of 5-10% in the same subsidised manner, but this time specifically for
young, currently disadvantaged white people of 25 years and younger. This
is an opportunity for Media24 to make a difference and by this indicate a
new direction to the youth of South Africa. There is an opportunity. Do it.
I thank you.]


                    SA’S MEASURES AGAINST POLIO COMMENDED


                            (Member’s Statement)
Mr B L MASHILE (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC welcomes the declaration by the
Global Certification Commission subcommittee in Africa, the African
Regional Certification Commission, that there is enough evidence showing
the nonexistence of the wild polio virus in South Africa. This
certification has been the result of a sustained campaign of vaccination of
children over the years.

The African Regional Certification Commission has expressed satisfaction
with the measures South Africa has in place against polio, including the
political commitment to eradicate this childhood disease.

Building on this success, the ANC will continue to work with our people to
ensure a better life for all. We, therefore, wish to congratulate the
Department of Health and its partners in the social cluster, and organs of
civil society, on their remarkable and far-reaching success in reducing the
burden of the disease and poverty in South Africa, the SADC region, as well
as the African continent. I thank you.


                     PUPIL VIOLENCE AND POOR DISCIPLINE


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr N T GODI (PAC): Chairperson, the PAC joins the growing chorus of
condemnation and concern at the pupil violence and poor discipline in
schools. The recent reported cases of stabbings and deaths must be of
concern to all patriots. We, however, need to acknowledge that the
department and the school authorities are dealing with the manifestation of
a bigger societal problem.

Putting our schools and pupils on the right footing requires a collective
effort from all societal formations, together with the education
authorities. Addressing key societal challenges such as the state of
families, morality, poverty, unemployment, violence and what society gets
fed by the media can go a long way towards creating the objective
conditions for turning all our schools into centres of learning, culture
and excellence.

The call for a summit for all stakeholders is not unreasonable. The
Minister of Education’s latest suggestion should be a basis for further
input or engagement. The PAC stands committed to making the fullest
positive contribution to this national endeavour. Thank you.


      SOUTH AFRICA’S PORT OPERATIONS SHOULD BE OPENED TO PRIVATE SECTOR


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J J M STEPHENS (DA): Chair, the US$50 congestion surcharge considered by
shipping lines docking at the Durban port could cost South African
importers more than R500 million per year and push up inflation. This
crisis resulted because the ANC government missed the ship with long-term
capital expenditure planning.

With the promise of Asgisa still having to be felt, congestion will remain
a problem at South Africa’s ports over the medium term. In the light of the
burgeoning demand for, and the lack of logistical efficiency at our
country’s ports, the state needs to reconsider opening up South Africa’s
ports operations for increased private sector participation.

There is no need for South Africa to reinvent the wheel. Singapore’s port
authority, for example, is the second most efficient port operated in the
world, and it is an example of an expert port operator that is
internationalising its business. The Singaporeans have an excellent track
record with knowledge transfer to locals and have already been contracted
to manage certain of the operations of the port of Rotterdam, which is the
most efficient port in the world.

They’ve also expressed interest in doing business in South Africa. The ANC
government needs to show that it is serious about driving down the cost of
business and of consumer goods by making our ports more efficient. Thank
you.


       ERADICATION OF BUCKET SYSTEM AT MSOBOMVU DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnu S E ASIYA (ANC): Mhlalingaphambili, urhulumente oxhuzulwa imikhala
okhokelwa ngumbutho wesizwe i-ANC, kwezinye zezithembiso zawo, watsho ukuba
siya kuba siyiphelisile inkqubo yokuthuthwa kwelindle ngamabhakethi. Abantu
baseMsobomvu, oquka i-Noupoort, i-Colesberg kunye ne-Norvalspont,
ngokwezithembiso zethu, urhulumente waseMsobomvu uqalisile ukuguzula
amabhakethi kwilokishi yabebala ekuthiwa yi-Louwryville kunye nekuthiwa
yiKuyasa, lokishi ezo ebezisebenzisa amabhakethi okoko zakhiwayo, efaka
endaweni yawo imibhobho yogutyulo-lindle yala maxesha.

Thina singamalungu ombutho wesizwe i-ANC siya kuthi gqolo sisebenzisana
nabantu bakuthi ukudala ubomi obungcono kumntu wonke. Camagu!
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa member’s statement follows.)

[Mr S E ASIYA (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC- led government stated very
clearly, amongst its promises, that the bucket system would be eradicated.
The government has already embarked on its programme of the eradication of
the bucket system in the following communities: Msobomvu, Nouport and
Colesberg, as well as Norvalspont.

In terms of our promises, the government has begun eradicating the bucket
system at the coloured township called Louwryville as well as at Kuyasa,
which have been utilising the bucket system since their inception. The
bucket system has been replaced with the modern waterborne system.

We, as members of the ANC, will continuously co-operate with our people in
ensuring that there is better life for all our people. Thank you.
[Applause.]]


                      MUNICIPALITIES TO RAISE OWN FUNDS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M B SKOSANA (IFP): Chairman, National Treasury’s recent initiative to
encourage municipalities to raise their own funds, or revenue if you like,
presents the legislature and government with an interesting concept, which,
if pursued, carries with it substantial economic implications for local
government.

Likewise the President, during izimbizo in the south of KwaZulu-Natal last
weekend, alluded to the need for economic solidarity at the local village
and community levels. Both views, beyond being complementary, acknowledge
the need for critical appraisal of particular aspects of the current South
African economic practices.

Despite promising economic growth, the economics of unfair competition and
greed still persist throughout the entire strata of our society,
accumulating the wealth and resources of the nation in the hands and
control of a few.

On the other hand, in order for libertarian municipalism, as seen by the
National Treasury, to succeed, it must be underpinned by participatory
economic planning and activities that are geared at effecting a just
distribution of the nation’s resources. This potentially means that the
workers and consumer movements, the unemployed and the poor people’s
movements, co-operative movements, environmental movements at local and
municipal levels should agree to take part and contribute towards the
development of the economic plan.

Nevertheless, the critical questions of co-ordination, co-operation,
equity, racism and patronage powers between and within the various
municipalities will still persist. I thank you.

                  EDUCATE CONSUMERS ON RESPONSIBLE SPENDING

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr B A MNGUNI (ANC): Chair, even though our economic growth is driven by
household consumption, it is rather a cause for concern that domestic
consumers finance their consumption through debt. This has resulted in
consumers being trapped in unsustainable debt, which has put pressure on
our inflation rate.

The recent interest rate hikes are an attempt by the Reserve Bank to curb
inflation resulting from reckless borrowing and expenditure. We urge the
financial services sector to educate consumers on personal debt management
and responsible spending.

The ANC urges all South Africans to limit their appetite for debt and try
to live within their means. If the household debt doesn’t decline, we are
bound to have another interest rate hike very soon. Thank you. [Applause.]


                       UN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME REPORT


                            (Member’s Statement)

Dr P J RABIE (DA): Chairperson, the United Nations Development Programme
Report released yesterday made a number of economic policy recommendations
for South Africa, echoing what the DA has been saying all along.

The UNDP report advocates the use of government subsidies to create jobs.
In this regard the DA has called for tax offsets for business for job
opportunities created, and the use of annual opportunity vouchers to assist
the integration of school-leavers into the formal economy.

Secondly, the report backs the use of customer sector programme for the
development of priority sectors. Government, while paying the necessary lip
service, has yet to produce on its promises on the development of a CSP for
clothing and textile manufacturing, one such priority sector.

Thirdly, the UNDP report questions the Expanded Public Works Programme’s
job-creating capacity as punted by government. As the DA has said before,
given the scale of the programme, the EPWP will only make sense if it has
the improvement of the future labour market performance of EPWP
participants as its main goal, not job creation itself.

Judging by the UNDP report, the DA clearly has its ear much closer to the
ground when it comes to the economic policy that South Africa needs to
create jobs and opportunities for all. Thank you, Chair.

                        THE 1987 MINEWORKERS’ STRIKE

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr T G ANTHONY (ANC): The dispute between the Chamber of Mines and the
National Union of Mineworkers’ led to the 1987 national strike. The massive
1987 mineworkers strike was the biggest and the costliest wage dispute in
the history of South Africa. This is the strike that was also called “the
seven days that rocked the chamber”.

The Chamber of Mines, the true bastion of South African capitalism, became
one of the crucial arenas in which the strength of organised workers’
ability to contribute to the struggle to redistribute the wealth of the
country was put to the test. The strike lasted more than seven days and was
followed by mass dismissals by employers. Black Rock Mine was one of those
mines that dismissed its employees.

The National Union of Mineworkers mobilised between 250 000 and 340 000
mineworkers, through a successful ballot, to go on strike for improvement
in wages and conditions of employment.

The dismissals at Black Rock Mine and in other parts of the country remain
vivid in our memory even today. The Kuruman Labour Centre sit-in reminds us
about the brutality of apartheid, a capitalist system and a system that was
driven by greed and profit maximisation, by confinement to the hostel
system, by meagre wages and by being kept away from one’s family and
children.

The action by those ex-mineworkers sitting in at this labour centre
required the intervention of the constituency office, so that they could
claim back the benefits lost from their dismissal by the Chamber of Mines
from their Black Rock unit. [Time expired.]


                   UPSURGE OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOLS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr S J NJIKELANA (ANC): The recent upsurge of violence in our schools
should not come as a surprise, but ought to be cause for great concern to
our country. The recent acts of violence by teenagers in schools do
definitely not make us proud, both as parents and parliamentarians. As a
society we have not yet fully outgrown the culture of violent behaviour in
general.

The culture of solving disputes through any means other than violence still
has to permeate through the enormous recesses of our communities. Just
recently, we had a national project of electing school governing bodies.
Should we not ask ourselves, as parliamentarians, what role we play in
ensuring the quality and successful election of those SGBs? Therefore, what
efforts have we made to ensure that SGBs provide good leadership to their
schools, such that violence in all its forms begins, at least, to subside
in schools?

I very strongly maintain that in spite of the constitutional obligation
that the government, through the Department of Education, has of providing
security for our children in schools, we too as parliamentarians have a
role to play in this daunting task.

Let me draw your attention to two core objectives of Parliament:
facilitating public participation and involvement, as well as facilitating
co-operative government. The ANC will continue to work with all the
stakeholders, including our SGBs, in our efforts to solve the security
challenges facing our learners and educators. I thank you. [Applause.]


                                 RAPE CASES

                              POLLSMOOR PRISON
                             MINISTRY OF HEALTH
                   UPSURGE OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOLS

                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I
will quickly give three responses. One is on the issue of rape cases. The
Department of Safety and Security, together with the cluster, is working
very hard to make sure that these cases decline, and also to meet the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in dealing with these
cases as they are reported. We should definitely be commending the police
for the work they are doing and always encourage them to do more, because
there is so much for them to do.

The second response is on Pollsmoor. I do not take reports only from
newspapers, hon Seaton. You were in our portfolio committee, you stayed for
only three minutes and then you left. You could have raised that. You could
have raised some of these issues. [Interjections.] Was it an hour? It
seemed like three minutes to me. Your watch doesn’t work.

We would also never ever ... [Interjections.] And I know what happens. I
don’t even have a watch.

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Mr Ellis, I am not talking to you.
The Minister has seen the reports that were in the papers, and the Minister
will deal with that case, not through the newspapers but through the right
channels. I will go to Pollsmoor and deal with that.

I don’t believe that any offenders would be stripped naked in front of
female offenders, because they are two separate entities. So, whatever you
read, please don’t take it as if it is the Gospel. We will conduct
investigations, and we will make sure that we charge those who are doing
wrong things, hon Seaton.

The last response is on the Ministry of Health, which was brought by the
ANC. The only thing I can say about that is, “Halala, Department of Health,
halala!” Well done!
The last thing, on education, because it is one cluster ... Well, it is
also nice to be one of a few in Parliament and answer all these statements.
The Minister of Education, the hon Godi, the hon uSisa and all formations
in our country should help. Parliamentarians also have a role to play in
this. We must do something about the violence in our schools. It is just
not acceptable.

Therefore any help to try to rid our schools of this violence will be
welcome. I know that the Minister of Education is looking at that situation
and is trying to address it. As parents, we also ought to play a role.
Families ought to help in this situation. Thank you very much.




                               PORT OPERATIONS


                                 UNDP REPORT


                            (Minister’s Response)

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chair, may I address, firstly, the
matter of the ports and, secondly, the matter of a UNDP report. Let me say
that I think this matter has been dealt with in the responses from Transnet
and Public Enterprises, in that there have been specific conditions in
recent periods in Durban around servicing the container terminal, mainly
wind conditions.
The question of whether there would or would not be a surcharge is a matter
that will be dealt with amongst the shippers and our liaison with them as
Portnet and port operations. Let me say that the Durban container terminal
is now moving record volumes of containers. We are very cognisant of the
need to increase our container capacity. I think you sit on the portfolio
committee, and you would have also been aware that we are going to expand
pier one and have a range of other plans.

As we have indicated all along, we are very open to partnerships, and the
final port master plan has been before the Transnet board. We have also
looked at it as the Department of Public Enterprises, and we are quite open
to forming partnerships. But, certainly, it is not as simple as you try to
make out: that we should just bring in port authority. To promote any one
organisation against all others is not correct. This would have to be a
negotiating process. We will have to decide on what basis, how, where and
who we would bring in as partners.

I think we are definitely making progress. The efficiency levels are
improving and, of course, it is very good to be dealing with the problem of
economic success as opposed to economic failure.

That brings me to the second issue. Fortunately, this government has access
to many advisers. I think many of you are familiar with the group of
economists we loosely call the Harvard group, which is a very systematic
research project that has access to government information, where we
exchange views with them. We have no shortage of access to advice or
advisers.

Of course, we would welcome any study if it were done under the auspices of
the UNDP. We would look at these matters. But, at the end of the day,
governments must govern; they can’t change policies every five minutes when
they get some new research group giving them advice. These may have
mirrored, or they may not.

But I think you would already know that there is a very firm view in South
Africa - and it has been part of the tremendous success of our fiscal and
economic policy - which is that, generally speaking, we are not in support
of subsidies. These can be exceptionally dangerous economic interventions.
If your economy starts spiralling in various ways and your subsidies get
bigger and bigger, you place yourself in an exceptionally dangerous
position.

Now, we do have certain support measures for learnerships. We do have
certain support measures for employment conditions, which the Minister of
Finance has announced on a number of occasions in recent budgets. But the
general approach of the South African government is to make sure that you
have an exceptionally robust and defensible fiscal system. That means we
don’t like lots of tax incentives, we don’t like lots of subsidies, and we
can be pretty confident that this is a formula for success, because the
economy is performing better than it has ever performed before.

So, we welcome advice, we listen to it, but we can’t govern on the advice
of every adviser. We would have chaos. We govern through a proper policy-
making process within the majority party. We govern through a process of
consultation and with a wide range of experts and, of course, we come to
Parliament. Economic policy cannot chop and change.

Everyone is an expert on economic policy. The opposition claims every
success, but never admits any failure. Of course, you all would never have
a failure, because you have no responsibility for government. So, you’ve
got no failures. [Interjections.] We will see where you do govern, how you
will go. I am sure you will do exactly what we did - you will have a few
failures.

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): Thank you, hon Minister. Your time
has expired.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Could I just thank them for their
advice? We have listened but, of course, we take it with a pinch of salt.
Thank you.

                                WOMEN’S FUND
                    SERVICE DELIVERY AT A MUNICIPAL LEVEL

                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Thank you, hon
Chairperson. I’m going to respond to two statements. The first will be the
Women’s Fund; and the second one will be service delivery at a municipal
level.

Hon member, through you, Chairperson, I wish to share with you that this
government is highly committed to any initiatives that attempt to enhance
women’s development, be it political or economic, hence our support for the
possibility of exploring the establishment of a women’s fund. That is the
first one.

The second one from the ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order again. We’ve had six
ministerial responses already. The Minister of Correctional Services did
three, Minister Erwin did two, and now the hon Deputy Minister has done
one. So that is six responses, and I think that is it.

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): Well ... [Interjections.] Order!
Order! Hon Ellis, they have been very economical with time. For instance,
Minister Balfour gave four very brief responses in two minutes. So I’m not
sure whether you would like to benefit from the responses. I would appeal
for some flexibility. I think whilst the responses are available for
members of your party that made the statements, that maybe you’d like to
benefit from the responses.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, in view of the fact that Minister Balfour only
spoke for two minutes, it was a great relief. We’d rather hear some sense
now, so let’s continue.

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): Thank you for your understanding, Mr
Ellis. We proceed, hon Deputy Minister for Provincial and Local Government.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Thank you,
Chairperson.

The second statement deals with service delivery at a municipal level. We
want to assure the hon member that we congratulate the Municipality of
Msobomvu on the service delivery programmes that they have actually
embarked upon. Also, in February the President addressed the nation and
gave a commitment to the eradication of the bucket system by 2007, and
those programmes taking place at municipal level are, in fact, in line with
that programme and the commitment given by this government. We’d like to
say “Congratulations on the service delivery”. Thank you. [Applause.]


                   CONCERN ABOUT ESCALATING PERSONAL DEBT


                          THE DA’S ECONOMIC POLICY


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H DAVIES): Chair, I want to
respond, firstly, to the statement by the hon Mnguni. I think the hon
member is quite right to be concerned by the escalating personal debt,
although of course we know that consumption expenditure is driving growth.

The hon member refers to reckless borrowing. I think we need to recognise
that it takes two to tango – that for every borrower there is also a
lender. And, I think, that what we are seeing is perhaps not just
households being reckless in their decisions, but also a proliferation of
opportunities and all sorts of inducements to take credit from all kinds of
levels of the financial sector.

We need to be clear that what we have in place is the National Credit Act,
which deals with the issue of reckless lending. What we will be vigilant
about from government’s side is to avoid a situation in which people are
induced to take on debt, and then they find their names in the credit
bureau and they don’t have access to credit in the future. The National
Credit Regulator is hardly in place, but we will be looking to it to be
vigilant in instances of reckless lending and to act appropriately in that
case.

I’d also like to say a little bit on one aspect of the statement by Dr
Rabie. I must say that I need to have my annual look at the DA’s economic
policy. I’m surprised to hear that the DA’s economic policy is about
subsidies for employment and sector policy. I always thought it was about
tax cuts for the rich and market fundamentalism. Nevertheless, I need to
have another look.

I want to say to him regarding the one thing he did say about a customised
sector programme for the clothing and textile sector, that, in fact, I
think he is completely mistaken on that. Considerable work has been done on
a clothing and textile CSP. It has been approved largely in its overall
shape by most of the stakeholders, which, I think, is no mean achievement.
There are 50-odd key action plans. This CSP needs only minor tweaking, and
then an implementation strategy. So considerable work has actually been
done on a clothing and textile CSP. I just wanted to inform the hon member
about that. Thank you.

    DEBATE ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY – WORKING
                           TOGETHER OUT OF POVERTY

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Chairperson, hon members, it is an honour for me to
represent the ANC in this debate on this day. This debate takes place in
the very same year when we celebrated 50 years of the Freedom Charter, 50
years of the march by the women of this country against oppressive
apartheid laws and 30 years of a revolt by our youth against forced
Afrikaans as a medium of education in 1976.

My approach to this debate will focus on the role of local government in
the fight against poverty. This will entail my understanding of poverty as
it relates to South Africa and the continent. I will briefly unpack how
poverty is measured for us to strategise on solutions to the problem,
including its manifestations. I will also structure my discussion to
reflect three pillars on which local government deals with the eradication
of poverty: the developmental role of local government in poverty
alleviation, governance and local government and the role of women in local
government.

According to an article in a journal on public administration, Renosi
Mokgati from the HSRC writes:

  Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon. It is understood as a condition
  that manifests itself in a number of ways, including the lack of income,
  insufficient resources and vulnerability to social, political and
  environmental shocks. Individuals and households become vulnerable
  because they lack the assets or combination of assets that can enable
  them to cope or manage the negative effects of the external shocks.

Poverty is a result of a number of interrelated factors. According to the
World Bank, South Africa as a developing country has the character of other
developing countries in terms of high population growth, low per capita
real income, high unemployment, disguised employment rate, and low
productivity, and high levels of poverty.

Chairperson, because of bad planning under apartheid and a lack of a
developmental agenda, South Africa remains with the following challenges
that are directly linked to poverty: the eradication of poverty and extreme
income and wealth disparities and inequalities, the provision of access to
quality and affordable basic services to all South Africans, a sustained
reduction in the unemployment rate and the attainment of a sustainable high
economic growth rate.

It cannot be denied and it is an undisputable fact that the historical
background to this subject in South Africa has left an indelible problem.
Apartheid’s separate development has promoted the deprivation of services
with regard to the majority of the population. How has it promoted
environmental degradation? Against this backdrop provincial and local
government is at the coalface of everything. It becomes relevant to us
addressing these challenges through its mandate and interventions. Let me
quote President Thabo Mbeki on the occasion of his inauguration, as well as
the tenth anniversary of our freedom in Pretoria:

  South Africa was a place that decreed that some were born into poverty
  and would die poor.

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order, hon member. Just take your
seat for a minute. Can we lower the noise levels. Please proceed.

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Let me quote the President:


  South Africa was a place that decreed that some were born into poverty
  and would die poor; their lives in the land of gold and diamonds cut
  short by the viral ravages of deprivation. It was a place where others
  always knew that the accident of their birth entitled them to wealth.
  Accordingly this put aside all human values, worshipping a world whose
  worth was the accumulation of wealth. It was a place where to be born a
  woman was to acquire the certainty that you would, forever, be a minor
  and an object owned by another. Whereas to be a man was to know that
  there would be another over whom you would exercise the power of a
  master.

Chairperson, this sad state of affairs led to the corrective measure put to
government by the President in the very same year in his state of the
nation address, and as a directive to this Parliament. It was on
government’s commitment as it relates to local government, to move our
country forward decisively towards the eradication of poverty and
underdevelopment in our country, taking care to enhance the process of
social cohesion, to strengthen the system of local government as it has
been done.

Furthermore, it was to integrate our system of governance responding
effectively to the requirement of co-operative governance. As you would
know, Chairperson, we have passed an Act on intergovernmental relations to
mobilise all our people voluntarily to work together to achieve the task of
reconstruction and development, to help reconstruct a new world order that
is more equitable and responsive to the needs of the poor of the world, who
constitute the overwhelming majority of our humanity. Hence it is through
its constitutional mandate that local government deals with poverty
eradication directly, as in section 152 that relates to our developmental
state.

Also, through the demarcation process we are aware that wards were aligned
to a wall-to-wall situation that addresses the imbalances of the past
through the Municipal Systems Act. On its definition of a municipality,
communities have been included. The issue of community participation is
legislated, and that also includes a commitment by local government to make
sure that there is a consultative process through their integrated
development plans. We also passed an Act that provincial and local
government is responsible for property rates and it has a provision that
allows for government not to charge those who are poor in terms of a
threshold. Also, there is a provision in terms of the Disaster Management
Act that allows for the participation of communities.

Let me also reflect on the role of women in local government. It is also
undisputable that local government led by the ANC is leading in this area,
through a 50-50 representation of women. Also, in terms of community
participation, we have made legislative provision that would allow for ward
committees to be in place and it is in this context where the role of women
is clearly defined. We just have to appeal to our people, more so at this
time when municipalities are busy with IDPs, to make sure that when
planning is done, it reflects the needs of our women. We also have
community development workers, most of whom, I am quite certain, are women.

Ndiza kuthi gqaba gqaba ngesiXhosa. USalga, njengokuba emele oomasipala,
uthe emveni kokuba oomama benyuliwe wabeka inkqubo yokuba baqeqeshwe ukuze
bakwazi ukuphatha. Ndiza kwenza isicelo kubantu bakuthi, phaya emakhaya,
ngokubhekisele ekumiselweni kwee-IDPs.

Njengoko iinkosi bezikhala ekuseni zisithi azibizwa ngoomasipala, siye
sazixelela ukuba isemthemthweni into yokuba zithathe inxaxheba kule nkqubo.
Kwakhona, simema abantu bakuthi ukuba xa kukho iimbizo mabazizimase, ukuze
bakwazi ukuzithethelela besebenzisa iilwiimi zabo.

Liphindile kwakhona iSebe looRhulumente bamaPhondo nabaseKhaya, waba
nelinge lokudibanisa okanye i-Project Consolidate kwabo masipala
bangenamandla, apho lithe laathumela ezona ziqeqeshiweyo iinjineli ukuba
zincedisane noomasipala ukuphucula inkqubo yokuziswa kweenkonzo ebantwini.

Sineendawo ke, njengokuba ndivela eRhawutini, ezifana ne-Alexander, i-
Bekkersdal ne-Everton, apho kukho amaphulo ovuselelo ngokutsha lwemimandla
yeedolophu. Siyazazi iingxaki ezilapho. Ezinye zazo zezokuba ngandlela
ithile oomama abavunyelwanga ukuthatha inxaxheba. Masibakhuthaze ke ukuba
benze, bangeva ngakuxelelwa. Banalo ilungelo, ngoba lo rhulumente uvotelwe
ngabo.

Kwakhona masamkele into yokuba iNkqubo yeMisebenzi yoLuntu eNatyisiweyo
inayo indlela enyanzelisa ukuba amashishini asakhasayo abandakanye abantu
basetyhini. Masikhumbule, kwakhona, ukuba njengokuba sasingabasebenzi
ngaphambili, phaya emboneni bekusenzeka ukuba oomama ibe ngabo abamkela
imali encinci, kwaye bangaqeqeshwa. Kodwa ngenxa yalo mbutho kaKhongolozi
namhlanje banelungelo lokuba balinganiswe nabanye abantu.

Okokugqibela, ndiza kuthetha njengelungu le-ANC, nditsho ukuba kukho
iingqungquthela zophuhliso loqoqosho lweengingqi kwizithili zethu. Siza
kuphinda futhi sicele abantu bakuthi ukuba njengokuba beza kuthetha
ngeendlela zokulwa indlala nje, maze benze ukuba noomama babe khona, ukuze
livakale nelabo ilizwi.

Masiphinde kwakhona siqinisekise ukuba kuzo zonke izinto esizenzayo,
ingakumbi ekuphuculeni ubomi boomama, nanjengokuba sisazi ukuba ngabo
abenza ukuba kube kho into etafileni, oomama mabathathe inxaxheba.

Ndiza kuthi ke ngoku kule ngxoxo-mpikiswano, kula malungu ahlala ephikisana
ne-ANC, ukuba nanku umkhomba-ndlela. Mawakwazi ke nawo ukuba bancedakale
kweli linge lohlenga-hlengiso lweli lizwe ukuze akwazi ukuthatha inxaxheba.
Siya kuphikisana sele siphucule iimpilo zabantu bakuthi. Ndiyabulela.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I will briefly speak in isiXhosa. Salga, as an association of local
government, made it feasible that after women were elected, a programme on
developing their managerial skills was implemented. The communities must
lend a hand with regard to the implementation of the IDP.

The traditional leaders complained in the morning that they were not
invited by municipalities to participate in this programme, but we
explained to them that their involvement is legal. Furthermore, we ask the
communities to attend the izimbizo, so that they can express themselves,
using their mother tongues.

Once more the Department of Provincial and Local Government initiated
Project Consolidate for the municipalities that cannot work on their own.
Trained engineers were dispatched to assist in the improvement of service
delivery programmes.

There are areas in Johannesburg, where I come from, such as Alexander,
Bekkerdal and Everton, where the programme of urban renewal is implemented.
We understand that there are challenges, though. One of these is that women
are not allowed to participate in these programmes. Let us inspire them, so
that they can refuse to be told what to do. They have rights, because they
voted for this government.

Let us accept that the Expanded Public Works Programme has a clause that
mandates small businesses to include women. It must be remembered that
during the times when we used to harvest maize in the field, women were
earning little and they were not given skills. The ANC-led government made
it possible for them to enjoy equal rights.

In conclusion, I will speak as a member of the ANC; there are regional
conferences on economic development in our constituencies. We plead yet
again with people that when discussing issues relating to poverty
alleviation women must be included, so that their voices can be heard.

Let us ensure that in all we do, particularly the fact of improving women’s
lives, we involve women, because they are the ones who place food on the
table.

In this debate I am saying to those who always oppose the ANC that they
must accept these guidelines. They must benefit in some way from the
transformation outcomes taking place in this country in order to
participate in it. We will engage in argument after we have improved the
lives of people. Thank you. [Applause.]]
Mr S J MASANGO: Chairperson and hon members, there is a simple solution to
poverty in South Africa, and it goes like this: In order to fight poverty,
people need jobs; in order to create jobs, we need an economy that is
growing and a friendly business environment, which encourages
entrepreneurship and investment. In order to create that environment, we
need simple and effective legislation, and in order to create that
legislation, we need strong and innovative leadership.

The reason unemployment is stuck at 40% and we have a problem with poverty
in this country, is not because of a lack of resources, but because our
leaders lack the political will to make the necessary changes.

Ukuzalisa kilokhu, abasebenzako baneenyonyana ezithi nazibakhulumelako
nofana ezithi nazibalwelako, bese zikhohlwa ngalabo abangasebenziko abajama
eentradeni njalo, bafuna umsebenzi. (Translation of isiNdebele paragraph
follows.)

[To add to this, those who are employed have trade unions that represent
them. These trade unions tend to forget about those who are unemployed, who
always stand on street corners looking for jobs.]

The DA does not believe, however, that the state is there to simply nurture
a person through life. A responsible state must be complemented by
responsible citizens. The force behind growing prosperity is a socially and
environmentally responsible enterprise economy, driven by the choices, risk
and hard work of free individuals.

Without growth in prosperity created through the exercise of a market
economy, there can be no opportunities, and choices become increasingly
limited. That is why the DA promotes an economic policy that puts growth at
its centre. While we promote such policies as low inflation, a minimal
budget deficit, lower taxation, a deregulated labour market, privatisation,
enterprise zones, opportunity vouchers and the like, there are those who
object to some of these policies. But experience across the world has shown
that they generate growth, and with growth come job opportunities.

In addition to the policies that promote growth, the DA promotes policies
designed to provide the poorest of the poor and the least empowered with a
safety net to ensure their survival and welfare. For this reason we support
the provision of free essential services at a municipal level, such as a
basic amount of water and electricity, and a basic income grant of R110 per
month for those living below the poverty line. These are some of the tenets
of an open-opportunity society, a society in which each person has the
opportunity to make the most of his or her life.

The government needs to learn that it cannot shape people in its own mould.
Its job is not to dictate to people their identities, but to actively seek
to provide them with opportunities to make the right choices for
themselves. Until this government learns that, we will not break the cycle
of poverty and unemployment that currently grips our country. I thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Hon Chairperson and hon members, today in South Africa a
child will be born. Her mother will hold her, feed her, comfort her and
care for her as any mother would anywhere in the world. In these most basic
acts of human nature, humanity knows no divisions. But to be born a child
in today’s Africa is to begin a life centuries away from prosperity. It is
to live under conditions that many of us in this House would consider
inhuman.

No one today is unaware of this divide between the rich and the poor of the
world. No one today can claim ignorance of the cost that this divide
imposes on the poor and dispossessed, who are no less deserving of human
dignity, fundamental freedom, security, food and education than any of us.

The cost, however, is not borne by them alone. The cost is borne by all of
us, rich and poor, men and women of all races and religions. Today’s real
borders are not between nations, but between the powerful and the
powerless, the free and the fettered, the privileged and the humiliated.

Scientists tell us that the world of nature is so small and interdependent
that a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon rainforest can generate a
violent storm on the other side of the earth. The principle is known as the
butterfly effect. Today we realise perhaps more than ever that the world of
human activity has its own butterfly effect for better or worse, hence the
need to work together.

The IFP, as the champion of the poor, supports this debate. You would
recall that I began my address with reference to the girl. Even though her
mom will do all in her power to protect and sustain her, there is a one-in-
four risk that she will never go to school, and that she will have to head
her own household and take care of her siblings.

A few years ago at the United Nations Millennium Summit, world leaders
recognised that global progress had been achieved in the struggle for human
development, but they also identified impediments. These included HIV/Aids,
and the conflict and poverty that still stand between humanity and the
realisation of its freedom from want and fear.

Among those priorities, none was more important than the pledge they made
to spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from abject
and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty. More especially, they
resolved that by 2015 they would halve the proportion of the world’s people
living in extreme poverty and hunger, achieve universal access to primary
schooling and gender equality at all levels of education, reduce child
mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three quarters, halt the
spread of HIV/Aids, and reduce the incidence of other major diseases.

Currently, sub-Saharan Africa is home to just a quarter of the world’s very
poor, but the ratio is rising steadily, aggravated by the scourge of
HIV/Aids. Another challenge to meeting the target is how to measure
poverty, which has dimensions other than simply average income. Growth is
not a gain if it destroys the environment, fails to engage women, or drums
families from secure but poor rural lives to a frightening, crime-ridden,
marginal and city-slum existence.

To briefly take another look: there is also reversing Aids, malaria and
tuberculosis, which together have accounted for 150 million deaths since
1945. Child poverty is the principal determinant of life chances. Children
born into poverty are more likely to die prematurely. They are less likely
to attend school or get any qualifications.
The time to act is now, and we need to make sure that the Millennium
Development Goals are attainable. But poverty is an old enemy with many
faces. Defeating it will require the many actors to work together. It was
the great Mahatma Gandhi who once said that poverty was the worst form of
violence. Let us recognise that extreme poverty anywhere is a threat to
human security everywhere. Let us recall that poverty is a denial of human
rights, and let us summon the will to deal with it.

Let me end with the words of Mother Teresa, who said the following:

   We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless.
   The poverty of being unwanted, unloved and uncared for is the greatest
   poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty.

I believe the title of the debate is so apt in that we need to work
together, and the time to start is now. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chair and hon members, the prevalence of poverty in our
society continues to cast a shadow across the achievements made under
democracy. It is not poverty alone that threatens societies, but rather the
extreme inequalities and disparities between the poorest of the poor and
the super rich. Deep mutual resentment and contempt are bred in societies
by these extremes living within viewing distance of each other

Sadly, the growth of a new middle class and elite, even though it has given
some black individuals wealth, has only exacerbated the vast gulf between
the haves and the have-nots. It is unfortunately so that a certain culture
of conspicuous consumption has become fashionable among the new elite.

The fact that an MEC can spend R100 000 on a government credit card for a
single dinner with a small group of guests is just one example of that
extravagant flaunting of new-found wealth and power. Is it any wonder that
this culture of get rich quick and spend recklessly has created the
conditions in society in which violent robbery is endemic, in which people
are killed for as little as a cellphone, in which a schoolchild can stab to
death a peer over borrowed money? Poverty presents less of a challenge than
the arrogant disregard of the rich for the concerns and aspirations of the
poor. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L W GREYLING: Chair, the ID agrees wholeheartedly with the sentiments
expressed in the title of today’s debate: “Working together out of
poverty”. As Patricia de Lille said in her response to the state of the
nation speech earlier this year, the problems of the poor are the problems
of the rich. What this country needs most is a shared sense of solidarity
and compassion that cuts across the different divides in our country.

We need to institute a mass mobilisation campaign whose primary target is
the eradication of poverty. Everyone in South Africa should have this as
their goal, and the government must create the necessary mechanisms to
enable people to get involved in this effort.

Much is often said about the lack of capacity within government, but the ID
believes that this is more than made up for by the immense capacity
communities and inspired individuals have to change their circumstances.

If government can’t spend its money, then give it to people who can. Civil
society and community-based organisations that perform many of the state’s
statutory obligations are crying out for more funds to reach more people.
We need to give it to them.

We also need to remove obstacles to poverty alleviation like the means test
on child support grants, and we need to extend the child support grant to
all children under 18. Nine million children in South Africa live in
poverty. We must do more to tackle child poverty and change the tragic fact
that one in 10 children born in South Africa today will not live to see the
World Cup. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairperson, according to the World Health Organisation, even
though there is enough food in the world to feed everyone, one person dies
from starvation every 3,6 seconds.

The 2005 UN Human Development Report records that 5 million people in South
Africa survive on less than R6 per day and that South Africa ranks 56th out
of 103 in the world poverty rankings, with a human poverty index of 30,9%
or 14,5 million people.

These are very real people and not just statistics, like the granny from
Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape, where her meagre grant goes to community
education needs while government fails to provide even the most basic
services in that community. Provision of basic services should be a given.

Acknowledging the chronic poverty problem in South Africa is, however, a
start, and recognising that working is key to changing the situation has us
at least facing in the right direction together. Government’s five-year
R400 billion public works programme follows through on this thought and is
likely to succeed to some degree.

An amount of R400 billion could, for example, pay 7,8 million unemployed
South Africans R855 per month for five years. But, of course, wages are not
all that is budgeted for and a large percentage will be spent on capital
assets.

Labour unions which represent the employed and not the unemployed are,
unfortunately, not helping as they naturally continue to maximise benefits
for their members, diminishing employment opportunities for the unemployed
in the process. At the same time strained employer-employee labour
relations further exacerbate the situation and escalate the move to a
greater degree of automation in modern production methods, resulting in
fewer jobs. Yes, we must work together.

Unless we are able to turn our employment problem around, the poverty trap
will become more and more difficult to get out of, with the gap between the
rich and the poor widening, the poor becoming isolated and demoralised,
moral values changing daily and ethnic divisions increasing.

According to the UN Bulgarian Human Development Report, suicide, child
abuse, domestic violence, broken homes and homelessness are typical of the
more complicated and consequent social and economic problems in society.
The bigger the unemployment problem is, and the longer it remains, the
worse it is. We must work together. [Time expired.]

Ms M N S MANANA: Chairperson, hon members, the UN has declared 17 October
to be the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.

In 1995, at the World Summit in Copenhagen, South Africa joined the nations
of the world and pledged to eradicate poverty. Since the dawn of our
democracy, South Africa has emerged from hatred and bitter separation to a
new democracy of reconstruction, reconciliation and development.

Poverty is the denial of opportunities and choices most basic to human
development to lead a long, healthy, creative life and enjoy a decent
standard of living, freedom, dignity, self-esteem and respect from other
people.

Poverty is one of the greatest political, social and economic challenges of
the 21st century that is facing the world at large. The most affected are
the millions of women and children living in rural areas.

The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty focuses on poverty and
the monitoring of the policies and programmes to tackle it. The government,
led by the ANC, has implemented policies and programmes, such as the
municipal infrastructure grant, the Working for Water programme, the free
basic services, etc, to address the problems facing South Africa.

Whilst the 2005 state of the nation address highlighted targets to attain
water and sanitation provision, the President, in his 2006 state of the
nation address, located the issues within the intentions of Asgisa. The
Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa identifies and
implements a set of policy initiatives that will improve South African
growth prospects. The President highlighted the following strategic
objectives in his address that are relevant to Water Affairs: the public-
private partnership capacity of local government and the eradication of the
bucket system.

As regards the impact on Water Affairs, we all know that as from the 2005-
06 financial year, the capacity funds for the basic service have been
allocated directly to municipalities under the municipal infrastructure
grant. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry will be responsible for
ensuring compliance and ensuring that municipalities maintain their focus
on ending sanitation backlogs.

As regards access to clean water, in 1994, 15,9 million people out of a
population of 39,8 million did not have access to basic water supply.
Currently, 3,3 million people out of a population of 48,6 million have no
access to a basic level of water supply.

The free basic water programme is making a huge difference to the poor, who
are defined as households with an income of less than R800 per month.
Currently, 1 million people are receiving the free basic service via normal
infrastructure, while 80% of the population with access to water
infrastructure enjoy access to free basic water, which relates to 75% of
the South African population and represents a 5% increase.

Mangikusho ukuthi amanzi abaluleke kakhulu. Yingakho kufanele ukuthi wonke
umuntu abe namanzi ukuze akwazi ukuphila, futhi yingakho-ke siye sithi:
Water is life. Nabahlala emaphandleni kufanele ukuthi bagcine bewatholile
amanzi ukuze babone izimpilo ziba ngcono. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph
follows.)
[Let me also say that water is very important. It is for this very reason
that all people should have water to live. That is why we say water is
life. Even those who live in rural areas should get water, too, so that
their lives can be better.]

The core business of the Working for Water programme is to contribute to
the sustainable prevention and control of invasive alien plants. In doing
so, it addresses poverty relief, and promotes economic empowerment and
transformation within the public works framework.

Since the inception of the Working for Water programme in 1999, it has
cleared more than 1 million hectares of invasive alien plants, providing
jobs and training to approximately 25 016 people per annum from the
marginalised sector of society, of which 52% are women.

Working for Water is currently running 303 projects in all nine provinces
of South Africa. Short-term contract jobs were created through clearing
activities and with an emphasis on recruiting 60% women, 20% youth, and 5%
people with disabilities.

Regarding the eradication of the bucket system, out of a population of 48,6
million people, there are currently 15,3 million people with no access to
sanitation. Since 1994, access to sanitation infrastructure in the sector
has improved from 49% to 69% of the population. By 2007, the bucket system
will be eliminated in all formal settlements in the country. There are 230
000 bucket toilets that need to be replaced with adequate sanitation.

I am happy to announce once more that the Mpumalanga Department of Local
Government and Housing has completed the eradication of the bucket system
in all its formal areas throughout the province.

The programme has also created more than 5 000 part-time jobs for the poor.
The government is continuing to promote the eradication of the bucket
system to replace it with dignified and appropriate types of sanitation
services.

In conclusion, as people are stripped of their material and other
possessions, part of their soul is lost in the process, leading many poor
communities to sink further into poverty, characterised by crime,
illiteracy, unemployment, diseases and often violence. That is why it is
important for the ANC government to ensure that the masses of the people
are well taken care of, in order to create a better life for all. Water is
life and sanitation is dignity. Let us work together in order to eradicate
poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

[Mr B E PULE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today is International Children’s
Day, we must focus on working together towards the future of our children.
There is a Setswana proverb that says two hands are better than one.

The main challenge we are facing is to eradicate poverty in our country and
on the African continent. However, we have to work together with the whole
world. The fighting for positions affects the growing of the economy. Just
take a look at Zimbabwe; there is a lot of poverty because of the ongoing
wars. Or shall we say: Look at South Africa, they are about to fight for
the position of who will be the next President.

Yes, we must be worried, though this is not supposed to be the only thing
that worries us. We have to take a look at the problems of the whole nation
in general in order for us to eradicate poverty. Poverty can only be
eradicated by creating jobs, encouraging children to study today’s
technologies in order for them to be able to fend for themselves.

The First World countries also work together with us in this fight as they
are investing in our country. The Third World countries are examining the
labour laws so that they can lure the interests from the First World
countries so as to enable them to create jobs.

Our children are important gifts from God. Let us create a better future
for them by ending this war. We can only do that by working together.]

Mr N T GODI: Chairperson, comrades and hon members, poverty in our country
carries, by and large, the face of an African woman, is rural based and a
reality to the African majority. It is a product of inequality created by
years of settler colonial rule with its attendant criminal oppression and
ruthless exploitation. We reject the trickle-down theory and we advocate,
as a measure of ideological conviction, an active role for the state in the
socioeconomic life of the people. Absolute poverty can be wiped out by
ensuring that our social security net covers all vulnerable groups, which
have up to now excluded the long-term retrenchees.

The state’s active role in the economy helps to ensure a fairer
distribution of wealth, thus reducing relative poverty. Whilst the state
has its role to play, so does private capital. We are not convinced that
private capital is playing its role actively and satisfactorily, in terms
of creating quality and sustainable jobs. Instead, poverty amongst the
workers is rife due to starvation wages and permanent casualisation. The
message must be sent that there is a growing realisation or appreciation
that beyond the 1994 political settlement, white capital’s resistance to
share the economic cake has not waned much. The continued African poverty
is a blot on our democracy. Indeed, the miracle of 1994 in material terms
happened for the rich. Making poverty history is a campaign; let us make it
a reality. Thank you.

Mr G LEKGETHO: Chairperson, hon Members of Parliament, comrades and friends
in our country, Africa and elsewhere, beloved members of Cosatu, SACP,
Sanco and ANC, it gives me a great pleasure to address you on the theme
Working Together out of Poverty. This is a deeply sad and emotional topic
that continues to set many nations against one another, brothers against
sisters and husband against wife. Poverty is the single greatest burden of
South Africans and is the direct result of the apartheid system and the
grossly skewed nature of business and industrial development that
accompanies it.

Poverty affects millions of people, the majority of whom live in rural
areas and are women. It is against this background that Cosatu, SACP,
Sanco, ANC and other progressive liberation movements were formed to better
the lives of others. Many of our comrades in our country and elsewhere had
to die because of destitution and hunger. Many in our midst are still
unemployed without bread to eat. Many of our sisters are on street corners
to sell their bodies because of poverty. This poverty is man-made and can
be undone in the same way through persuasion to release the land. This will
lessen crime in our country. Peace and comfort will prevail and we shall
all be happy.

In celebrating October, Month of Heritage and dealing with the apartheid
past without pointing fingers, let those who immensely benefited from the
skewed distribution of wealth in the past, transfer the land for free to
the poor so that they can be acknowledged and recorded for their noble
contribution to transformation and the eradication of poverty.

The Department of Arts and Culture plays an important role in alleviating
poverty in our country. The department has the Investing in Culture
Programme aimed at ensuring realisation of sustainable empowerment
opportunities through training and job creation in the arts, culture and
heritage sectors.

The department is striving for the development of capital by allocating
resources to ensure a return on investment that will fulfil its key
objectives and broader government imperatives. Between April 2005 and March
2006, 1 612 job opportunities were afforded to beneficiaries, of whom 68%
are women, 43% are youths and 8,2% are disabled people.

In the North West province, the department, in conjunction with Barolong
boo rraTshidi, the Department of Economic Development and Tourism, the
North West Parks and Tourism Board and the two municipalities of Mafikeng,
is busy building the cultural heritage recreation facility at Letlamoreng
dam. There will be temporary jobs that will be created until the facility
is completed and more than 20 people will get permanent employment. There
is additional funding needed to build the chalets and the department has
requested us to assist in this regard.

A resource for the promotion and production of arts and culture is being
made available and accessible to all. The democratic arts councils are
being established in each region. Arts and culture form part of school and
all other educational curricula. We need to develop the skills and talents
of our people. We need more libraries. We need more museums, galleries,
monuments and historical sites, which will reflect our different cultures
and be accessible to communities to generate funds for our poor.
We also need to mobilise our people to take charge of their own destinies.

Motswana a re mokoduo go tsoswa o o itsosang. [There is a Setswana saying
that God helps those who help themselves.]

The Freedom Charter and the RDP documents are focused on our people’s most
immediate needs and rely, in turn, on their energies to drive the process
of meeting their needs; regardless of race or sex, rural or urban, rich or
poor, the people of South Africa must together shape their own future.

Development is not about delivery of goods to a passive citizenry, but
about involvement and growing empowerment. In taking this approach we will
be building on many structures and negotiation to ensure that our people
are involved throughout the land. This programme is people-driven and is
critical to alleviating poverty in our midst. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Chairperson, I was asked what do we do on International
Poverty Day, and I replied:


  We unite. We unite against all the elements that house poverty, against
  all the elements that retard our progress, and we unite to set our people
  free from the shackles of poverty.


Last week we debated the spirit of ubuntu and this week the MF reaffirms
our belief in the Zulu proverb, “umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu”, meaning,
“people are people through other people.” The MF strongly believes that
unity and the principles of ubuntu are the key to poverty alleviation,
social development and an effective democracy.

A duty is incumbent upon government, all citizens and the public and
private sectors to induce efforts that will create opportunity for the
destitute and deliver us from poverty. But to work together we need to have
a common vision, and that vision is for a strong, healthy and wealthy South
Africa, where its entire people share in its fruits and all strive for its
good.

The MF supports the principle that the road to poverty alleviation is
through working together. I thank you.

Ms H WEBER: Chairperson and hon members, when I heard there was a debate on
poverty alleviation I went out of my way to see poverty-stricken areas to
find out what was being done. On speaking to the people, I found that they
were not impressed and said the better life for all was a dream and poverty
was just getting worse.

Every Ministry must take responsibility for the lack of alleviation of
poverty – the Department of Home Affairs for not supplying ID books
timeously so people can apply for jobs and grants, and the Department of
Labour for not levelling the playing fields and encouraging job creation.
The Minister would do well not to make job creators his enemies, but his
attention should rather be focused on the ineffective Setas, which cost a
lot and are not up to expectation.

Winning the bid for the 2010 World Soccer Tournament was welcomed by all as
a means to poverty alleviation, but the statement by the chairperson of the
organising committee, Franz Beckenbauer, that organisers are working
against one another rather than with one another should be taken note of.
It is time the relevant role-players changed their mindset of, “What is in
it for me?” to rather, “What is in it for South Africa?”

The Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs must start reviewing her
strategy. I was personally involved in two projects in the Groblersdal
area.

The Hereford irrigation farmers, who successfully restored an irrigation
scheme about eight years ago, are keen farmers. The promises by the then
hon Minister Hanekom on a visit some six years ago never led to them
getting security of tenure, as he had promised. They are about to lose a
R7 million project because they have no collateral.

The Sedi Trust, on the other hand, was given a very successful farming
project five years ago. This farm is now fallow and has not produced
anything for two and a half years. They have security of tenure, but no
knowledge of farming, and seemingly no interest. They prefer to let the
buildings as an easy, but minimal source of income.

The Minister for Provincial and Local Government should look at ineffective
municipalities. There are many jobs to be done, but without capable people
to organise and plan there will be no delivery and no jobs. We do a lot of
talking about equal rights. There are no equal rights when everything
depends on who you know and not what you know.

We can only hope that with the Deputy President behind Asgisa, there will
be some alleviation of poverty. South Africa cannot afford any more
experiments and we cannot afford to let projects such as 2010 slip through
our fingers. Social engineering has not worked anywhere in the world and I
don’t think it has a chance of working here. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L J MODISENYANE: Chairperson, I thank the ANC for giving me this
opportunity to participate in this debate on poverty, which has
particularly been my experience as a youth in South Africa.
[Interjections.] I lived in poverty in my youth and I’m very thankful,
despite this lot sounding off on my left.

I want to believe that poverty is a worldwide problem. Indeed, there is
therefore no need to moan about it. Instead, we have to combat it. The
purpose is not to alleviate it, but to eradicate it. By the look of things
it is a dream that cannot come true in light of the status quo. It is a
daily experience to see people who have built shelters under bridges and
others who have built fragile shelters on pavements, especially here when
you walk around the urban areas of Cape Town.

We seem to stand by and look on helplessly, but this is because of the
magnitude of the problem. We must therefore answer the following question:
What is the world doing about it and what is South Africa doing about it?

The world, through the United Nations’ Habitat programme, has pledged that
nobody should be without a roof over his or her head. Housing as a shelter
is not meant for the rich only, but for the poor as well. The Global Forum
of Parliamentarians on Habitat is meeting on a yearly basis to resolve this
worldwide problem of housing. According to the World Bank study on poverty,
people flock to cities and cause congestion that aggravates poverty. The
answer is to develop rural areas to diminish the flocking to the cities.

Leano la tsa Matlo le supa hore, matlo a bafutsana le a basebetsi a
tshwanela ho ba haufi le dibaka tsa mosebetsi. Ho na le bo-Mmasepala ba

Moralo ona o supa maikemisetso a ho bontsha hore Afrika Borwa ke naha ya
bohle ba dulang ho yona, ba batsho le ba basweu, ho ya ka lengolo la
tokoloho. (Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)
[The strategy on housing shows that the poor and the working masses should
be housed near their places of employment. Already there are municipalities
who are implementing this plan.  In the Free State, in small towns such as
Ngoathe, Matlwangtlwang and Mmamahabane, housing has been developed near
places of employment, even though industrialisation has not yet started.

This strategy indicates the intention to show that South Africa is a place
for all who live in it, both black and white, as outlined in the Freedom
Charter.]

As ons oor die hele wêreld kyk, dan sien ons dat armoede geen kleur ken
nie. Baie mense is maar brandarm, ongeag hulle kleur. Ons moet dus saamwerk
om armoede te bekamp. Die ANC het genoeg programme om armoede te bekamp,
maar ons moet saamstem dat onbekwaamheid ’n groot rol speel om
dienslewering te vertraag. Dis waarom Asgisa die antwoord is.

Die President het onderneem om sommige bekwame amptenare weer aan te stel,
soos die VF Plus versoek het. Ons weet dit sal nooit genoeg wees nie. Almal
sal saamstem dat swartmense ook opgelei moet word om regstellende optrede
te bewerkstellig. Dit moenie beskou word as diskriminasie, soos sommiges
dink nie. Ons kan nie die onregverdigheid van die vorige bedeling teenoor
swartmense verontagsaam nie. Dit is die waarheid en dit moet definitief
seëvier. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If we look all over the world, we see that poverty knows no colour. Many
people are indeed very poor, irrespective of colour. We therefore have to
work together to combat poverty. The ANC has ample programmes in place to
combat poverty, but we should agree that incompetence plays a major role in
retarding service delivery. That is why Asgisa is the answer.

The President has undertaken to reappoint some competent officials, as
requested by the FF Plus. We know that it will never be sufficient. We will
all agree that Blacks should also be trained to effect affirmative action.
It should not be regarded as discrimination, as some people think. We
cannot ignore the injustices of the previous regime towards black people.
That is the truth and it must definitely reign supreme.]

(Translation of Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[Therefore when I look at the hon members on my left, I see that they are
in a grievous mood, and yet Mrs Weber is the one who chooses to speak
because she sounds like a typical member of her party.
I was really surprised when Mr Masango stood up here, saying something that
nearly made sense, and yet they belong to the same party. Therefore, Mrs
Weber has shown us that what she sees in South Africa is darkness only, she
does not see anything good or positive that has been done. She does not see
the houses which have been built for the poor, nor the fact that things
have changed in this country, because she goes to some places which she
believes to be poverty-stricken areas.

However, we, the poor, know that Mrs Weber has never run around with a
bucket of water when her house is leaking during the rain. She has never
run around with a small basin when her house takes in water. She has always
slept under expensive blankets which she doesn’t even know how to wash,
which are washed for her by someone else. And yet she comes here and talks
about poverty which she knows nothing about and has never experienced at
all.

What it shows is that she is attempting the impossible if she thinks that
the poor will buy her story. They know very well that she does not have
their interests at heart. Even now she is busy railing, putting the blame
on Mr Hanekom for the strategy which she was supposed to implement as a
result of the support that she enjoys from the rich.]

Ja, die mense wat haar steun, is die ryk mense. Nou begin sy haar party
ontwrig deur na die mense te hardloop wat niks van haar dink nie. Dit is
die probleem. Aan die “Minister van Travelgate” wil ek sê: Dit is jou
storie oor Travelgate, en jy sal dit ook een van die warm dae eet en sluk!
Baie dankie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Yes, those supporting her are the rich. Now she is starting to disrupt her
party by running to the people who have no regard for her. That is the
problem!  To the “Minister of Travelgate”, I wish to state that it is your
version of Travelgate and that one of these hot days you will also have to
eat and swallow it! Thank you. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.




                    TRANSNET PENSION FUND AMENDMENT BILL


                           (First Reading debate)

The ACTING SPEAKER (Mr G Q M Doidge): I wish to remind members that in
terms of the guidelines adopted by this House on 12 September 2006, the
member in charge of a Bill will be allocated 15 minutes to make an
introductory speech and to reply to the debate, while other members may
speak for no longer than three minutes each.
There is no speakers’ list for First Reading debates. After the
introductory speech, members who wish to participate in the debate must
press the “To Talk” Button from their allocated seats and, when recognised
by the presiding officer, may speak from the floor microphones.

I now call upon the Minister of Public Enterprises to make an introductory
speech on the Bill.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson, it’s a pleasure to be
breaking new ground on two fronts: this is my first Bill as Minister of
Public Enterprises and in this exciting new format.

Let me give you some background quickly. Prior to 1990, Transnet had the
Railways and Harbours Pension Fund for black employees, and the Railways
and Harbours Superannuation Fund for white employees.

In 1990, these two funds were merged into the Transnet Pension Fund which
was established under the Transnet Pension Fund Act of 1990. All Transnet
employees were then obliged to become members of the Transnet Pension Fund.


The Transnet Pension Fund is a defined benefit fund which means that
Transnet guarantees upfront the amount of the pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement.

In 2002, new funds were established and the Act was amended to accommodate
these new funds. The new funds were the Transnet Second Defined Benefit
Fund, a fund for Transnet pensioners, and also a Defined Benefit Fund. No
new pensioners were allowed to join this fund after 2000. Only those
pensioners who were existing members at the time of the fund’s
establishment were allowed to remain members. Thus this fund is also known
as a closed fund, precisely because it is closed to new members.

The second new fund, the Transnet Retirement Fund, was an innovation in the
sense that it was a defined contribution fund that was opened to all new
Transnet employees to join at that time. A defined contribution Fund means
that the amount of the pension benefit that the employee receives on
retirement will depend on the contributions made by the employee, the
employer and the income of investments made from these contributions.

Upon the establishment of these two new funds in 2000, we now had three
funds, the Transnet Pension Fund and the two new ones. Most employees
voluntarily transferred from the Transnet Pension Fund to the Transnet
Retirement Fund. Presently, the Transnet Pension Fund has approximately 10
000 members, and its members consist of all pensioners who did not transfer
to the Transnet Retirement Fund.

No new members have been allowed to join the Transnet Pension Fund since
2000. Members may also be aware that Transnet is in the process of
restructuring from a transport conglomerate to a more focused freight
company. Its core business is ports, rail freight and pipelines.

As part of this restructuring, we have been disposing of certain businesses
that are not core to the freight business. Such disposals include, for
example, the transfer of Transnet shares and SAA to government, and the
transfer of Metrorail to the SA Rail Commuter Corporation, the SARCC.

It will be appreciated that as part of the transfer of businesses
specifically, employees working in the transferring businesses would be
transferred along with the business. Essentially, the transferred workers
would no longer be employed by Transnet, but in various cases, by the SARCC
as in the case of Metrorail.

As the new employer, the SARCC would provide the new workers with new
employment conditions and benefits including membership of new pension
funds. Thus the membership in the Transnet Funds will terminate along with
the transfer.
However, the peculiarity of the Transnet Fund is that all three were
established by statute. In terms of the Income Tax Act, certain pension
funds are established by statute and these are known as paragraph A funds.
They have some benefits that allow the lump sum benefits of those members
not to be taxed when the member leaves employment.

This protection however applies only to benefits attributable to membership
prior to 1 March 1998. Thus the portion of a member‘s benefit relating to
the employment before that date may not be taxable.

Thus, if a new employers pension fund is not a paragraph A fund as defined
in the Income Tax Act, then the employees tax benefit for membership
obtained prior to March 1998 vests when they leave the employment.

The Income Tax Act contains a formula for calculating such lump sum
benefits and the vesting of such benefits. Now the effect of Transnet
restructuring therefore meant that the employees transferring to entities
such as the SARCC, which does not have a pension fund established by
statute and may not be defined as a paragraph A fund, could lose the income
tax protection afforded to them under the Transnet funds.

Therefore, in April 2006, Transnet, the trade unions and I agreed that the
pension benefits of existing members of the Transnet funds would remain the
same notwithstanding the disposal of certain Transnet businesses. Under the
agreement, employees transferring to state-owned enterprises buying
Transnet businesses and shares would continue to be members of the Transnet
Retirement Fund.

The Transnet Pension Fund will be restructured into a multiemployer fund to
allow continued membership of those defined employees. Thus the membership
of those employees transferring to other employers such as the SARCC would
retain their membership of the Transnet funds in order to receive continued
income tax protection of their pension benefits.

The reason for introducing this Bill before Parliament is to effect the
agreement reached between Transnet, the trade unions and myself. The draft
amendments of the Bill have been approved by Transnet, the trustees of the
three Transnet funds and Cabinet, and are published in the Government
Gazette, 29303 of 12 October 2006.

The agreement essentially says the following:


  That the Transnet Pension Fund remains a closed defined benefit fund, and
  is restructured into a multiemployer fund.
The Transnet Retirement Fund remains a defined contribution fund and allows
existing members to retain their fund membership even after the transfer of
the business to a new SOE employer. I should stress that this is if it is
to another state enterprise, not if the transfer is into the private
sector.

The Transnet Second Defined Benefit Fund remains a closed defined benefit
fund and is largely unchanged. There are some technical amendments. The
Transnet Pension Fund is renamed the Transport Pension Fund, and although
it is an independent multiemployer fund, it remains one legal entity.

The SOE of whom Transnet businesses have disposed may join as principal
employers, and that’s essentially the SARCC, SAA and, under the structure,
there is one subfund per principal, and some funds automatically consist of
active members.

The allocation of pensioners and dependants of pensioners as fund members
is determined in the sale agreements relating to the Transnet businesses.
The relevant liabilities, assets, rights and obligations allocated to the
subfund are determined by the trustees and the fund evaluators and
actuaries. Subfunds have clearly defined ring-fenced liabilities and assets
and each principal employer alone guarantees his own subfund.

This new Transport Pension Fund will have two sets of rules - the general
rules and the specific rules for the subfunds. There will also be two
levels of trustees, one for the Transport Pension Fund and sub-boards for
the subfunds. The retirement fund will not be a multiemployer fund. This
had been a bit of an issue but we feel that it will be essential to
maintain clarity and raise no false expectations so the fund remains a
Transnet fund.

The Bill proposes provisions that will allow existing members who are
employees of businesses sold to certain SOE and entities transferred to
government to remain members even after transfer. No new employees of these
SOEs or other entities may join the Transnet Retirement Fund.

The result the Bill seeks to achieve is to maintain the benefits and tax
treatment available to existing fund members and, on disposal, to allow the
new employer to guarantee the defined exposure of employees opting to
remain in the Transnet Pension Fund.

The amendments in the Bill seek to limit the impact of Transnet’s
restructuring of worker benefits and legitimise the continued membership of
the Transnet Pension Fund and the Transnet Retirement Fund via SOE
employees.

I would like to thank the portfolio committee for the hard work it has done
under the chairpersonship of Peter Hendrickse, for this and for the inputs
made by the trade union movement. I sincerely hope we will receive support
for this Bill as it goes forward. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chairperson, it’s obvious from the enthusiasm with
which members have been following the explanation of the Minister that he
has given us a very clear picture of this amendment.

All that remains for me is to emphasise that this product is an agreement
between the unions, management and government. Its primary purpose is to
protect the benefits of workers particularly that of the tax-free amounts
accrued before 1990.

Having said that, this doesn’t make Parliament a rubber stamp for the
agreement, and we are applying our minds and examining each part of this
agreement.

The committee has held a public hearing at which the following unions were
present: the SA Transport and Allied Workers Union, the United Transport
and Allied Trade Union, Aviation Union of South Africa, SA Pilots
Association and the SA Railways and Harbours Union.

The Transnet Pension Fund as well as the Transnet management also
participated in these hearings. All of these unions supported the
legislation although some had reservations about the prohibition of new
employees who were not working for Transnet to join the Transnet Retirement
Fund, and that this prohibition has been placed in an Act rather than in
the Rules. The committee has been engaging the stakeholders regarding this
issue.

Another issue of concern to the committee was also whether, when an
employee commits fraud, that money should be retrieved from that employee’s
pension fund. We are not convinced that this is a correct measure or way of
going about it.

Over and above this, we have also received a number of written submissions
from individual pensioners as well as from organisations with regard to the
Second Defined Transnet Pension Benefit Fund. Now, although this Bill does
not deal with that particular fund, the committee has decided that we are
going to respond to the issues raised in those submissions.

We heard from the SA Organisation of Retired Persons, the Silver Springbok
Association, Club 60 and the Venda Party. The Act at the moment provides
that these pensioners can receive an annual increase of 2%. They have been
pleading poverty. As you know, inflation has been above 2% for the last few
years.
It has also been shown that some of these pensioners are receiving a
pension of below SOP, that is, the State Old-Age Pension. There are
approximately 80 000 pensioners altogether in the Transnet Second Defined
Pension Fund.

In conclusion, I would also like to make use of this opportunity to
congratulate the Pension Funds Adjudicator, Mr Vuyani Ngalwana, for his
activist approach to his task. He has been like a breath of fresh air in a
very staid and conservative environment. His decisions always seem to come
down on the side of the underdog when they take on the all-powerful and
mammoth life assurance industry.

I hope that newspaper reports that he is considering stepping down at the
end of his contract are not true. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J J M STEPHENS: Chairperson, this Bill is an important one because it
affects the lives of thousands of Transnet workers and pensioners, whose
membership of the Transnet Pension Fund is their sole lifeline in their old
age and in times of disability. It is thus no wonder that when the selling
off of noncore assets out of Transnet was announced, employees were
extremely concerned about their vested pension fund rights and hence an
extended strike until those concerns were addressed in an agreement with
management. The Bill then results from and gives effect to that agreement.

However, it is not only current employees of Transnet and its subsidiaries
that are concerned about their vested pension fund rights. The thousands of
existing pensioners are equally concerned and thus the evidence before the
committee. Perhaps they are even more concerned because they already rely
on their vested rights in the fund for their survival. Thus it is not
surprising that they find any structural change threatening. Consequently,
it is only right that in this debate we dispel also the misgivings and
fears of existing pensioners regarding the possible effect of the fund’s
restructuring.

Upon analysis of the Bill, pensioners can rest assured that their rights,
benefits and risks are not affected either for bad or, regrettably, for
better. Indeed, the guiding principle of the Bill is to allow the selling
off of Transnet’s noncore assets without affecting members’ vested rights
or future benefits.

We fully realise that this does not address the present issue many
pensioners have regarding the paucity of their annual pension increases,
but that is not the subject matter of, nor is it influenced by, this Bill.
Those issues will be dealt with separately and substantively in this House
in the near future.
Although there are some wording changes to be discussed and probably made
and some details to be clarified, the outcome will not be materially
altered. On those premises, the DA supports the first reading of the Bill.
I thank you.

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, this Transnet Pension Fund Amendment Bill is
obviously part of the broader restructuring of Transnet. I am pleased to
say that the word “restructuring” is no longer, if it ever was, a fig-leaf
word to cover up the p-word: privatisation. We are talking here about
restructuring Transnet essentially to develop well-focused state-owned
enterprises and public utilities and, in particular, to separate out the
key freight logistics function from the airline - the national carrier: SA
Airways - and the commuter-rail functions.

In parenthesis, Minister Erwin, while we have you here on this topic, I
think we must be careful in this restructuring that we don’t allow the
critical areas in which there is an interface between commuting or
passenger-rail services and freight logistics to slip between the cracks. I
am thinking in particular of rural branch lines or Southern African trade
routes, which often involve rail passengers and also people carrying goods.
I think we must make sure that we don’t allow that critical dimension to
slip.

On the issue in front of us: the merger in December last year of the SA
Rail Commuter Corporation and Metrorail put an end to what, I think, was an
anomalous institutional arrangement. We had the Rail Commuter Corporation
falling under the Department of Transport, acting essentially as a money
conduit for the operating subsidy - some R2 billion to R3 billion a year -
which went to Metrorail. Metrorail was then answerable not to the
Department of Transport but to the Transnet board and, in turn, to the
Department of Public Enterprises.

This institutional arrangement was a legacy, I think, of the late 1990s
when we were getting ready to concession out chunks of the commuter-rail
system. Unfortunately, in doing that we lost time. Fortunately for us
others went ahead of us - in New Zealand, in Argentina and in the United
Kingdom they went ahead with concessioning out passenger-rail services.
That has been an unmitigated disaster in those countries; they are trying
to reverse some of the problems. Luckily, we didn’t go that far.

Obviously, a key complication with this merger, which went ahead in
December, has been the vested pension rights of Metrorail employees as
they’ve come over to the Rail Commuter Corporation. We would really like to
welcome the innovative and consultative way in which this was done and the
equitable, I think, proposals in front of us in terms of the amendment to
the Transnet Pension Fund. As we proceed, we also need to bear in mind that
Shosholoza Meyl employees, currently under Transnet, will be also coming
across to the Rail Commuter Corporation in due course. We need to make sure
that they are adequately consulted and that their concerns are provided
for. Thank you, Chair.

Prof E S CHANG: Chairperson, Minister and hon members, the Transnet Pension
Fund Amendment Bill is a direct result of the restructuring process at
Transnet, in particular the strategic disposal of noncore assets to refocus
Transnet into a rail transport and infrastructure company that can deliver
in terms of South Africa’s growing transport needs in an expanding economy.

After the announcement that SA Airways, Metrorail and the Shosholoza Meyl
would be removed from the Transnet stable, it understandably led to
concerns among affected employees about their conditions of employment and
benefits after the disposal process.

Although conditions of employment in the case of sale or transfer of a
business are covered by the Labour Relations Act, the labour unions,
Transnet management and the Minister for Public Enterprises agreed after
negotiations that a special amendment to the principal Act was necessary to
ensure that the disposal process had as little effect on the retirement
savings of employees as possible without compromising the overall Transnet
restructuring process. The Bill therefore provides that transferring
employees and pensioners can retain membership in existing Transnet pension
and retirement funds.

Very importantly, the Bill retains the status of the Transnet pension funds
as paragraph A funds in terms of the 1956 Pension Funds Act, meaning that
when a member leaves employment he or she is entitled to have his or her
lump sum benefits taxed on the basis that that portion attributable to
membership prior to 1 March 1998 will not be subject to tax. We welcome
this protection given to the retirement savings of qualifying members.

Two other provisions deserve mention. First, the Bill provides that
pensions may in future be attached not just in terms of the Divorce Act,
but also the Maintenance Act of 1998. The IFP supports this as it is yet
another victory for women and children. Second, the Bill will come into
effect retrospectively on 11 November 2005, the date of Transnet’s
restructuring. The IFP has been assured that all stakeholders agreed to
this unusual step, and we therefore support it.

The IFP is satisfied that the Bill is the result of inclusive negotiations
between the relevant stakeholders and that it is in the best interests of
Transnet employees and pensioners. We will therefore support the Bill.
Thank you.
Ms O R KASIENYANE: Thank you, Madam Chair. This Bill represents the spirit
through which our labour policies take into consideration the role that the
trade unions, employers and the state play in shaping our legislation. It
gives workers a key say in industry decision-making and ensuring that
unions are fully involved in designing and overseeing changes in the
workplace and at industry levels. Even when drafting the Reconstruction and
Development Programme, this fact was clear already - that the agreement
negotiated through collective bargaining should be extended through
legislation to all workplaces in the industry.

In order to pursue our goal of eradicating poverty, our people should have
savings and pensions to provide for their old age and retirement. This Bill
represents another occasion where workers were instrumental in shaping
their own future. Considering all these facts, this Bill will secure
transferred employees’ retirement savings and, as is the case with any form
of restructuring, the human element should always come first, in order to
make sure that all have a share in the country’s wealth.

Looking at pension funds in general, during the apartheid regime, our
people never had access to or enjoyed this opportunity. You look at white
people and nonwhite people and notice that the pension dispensation was
really not in favour of our people. When talking about this, it is really
clear that the ANC-led government has done a lot in alleviating poverty by
having this Bill. The ANC supports the Bill. Thank you.
Mnr W D SPIES: Voorsitter, hierdie wet maak voorsiening vir die behoud van
lidmaatskap van pensioenfondse, veral wanneer werknemers as gevolg van
herstrukturerings oorgeplaas word. Dit handel, met wysigings, oor die
Transnet-pensioenbedeling en is die gevolg van ’n proses van oorlegpleging
tussen Transnet, sy pensioenfondse en die vakbonde. Maar ek wil nie praat
namens die pensioenfondse of die vakbonde wat goed verteenwoordig was in
die proses om die wysigingswet tot in sy huidige vorm te kry nie.

Ek wil praat namens een van die mees kwesbare belangegroepe in die Transnet-
pensioensage en dit is die bejaardes wat lid is van die tweede
vastevoordeelpensioenfonds. Hulle het geen bedingingsmag nie. Hulle kan nie
staak nie, want hulle is nie veronderstel om te werk nie. Hulle behoort met
waardigheid hul oudag te geniet en te rus van die dekadelange onbaatsugtige
diens aan Suid-Afrika. Hierdie mense het meestal voor 1990 afgetree en is
nou almal reeds diep in die sewentig of ouer. Meeste is verswak.

Gister het ek ’n oproep van ’n mev Esterhuizen ontvang. Sy het my meegedeel
dat sy namens haar vader skakel. Hy het ’n beroerte gehad en kan nie meer
sien nie, maar hy wil weet of ons kan help om sy karige Transnetpensioen te
laat aanpas. Weens swak bestuur het hierdie pensioentrekkers nie gedeel in
die ongekende groei van die markte die afgelope drie jaar nie. Hulle
pensioen het nou reeds drie jaar na mekaar met slegs die statutêre minimum
van 2% verhoog. Baie van hulle kry ’n maandelikse pensioen wat laer is as
die standaard staatspensioen vir bejaardes.

Hierdie Huis het ’n verantwoordelikheid teenoor die mees  kwesbares  in  die
gemeenskap. Sekere sake kan nie net aan die markte oorgelaat word om  op  te
los nie. Ons word hier gekonfronteer met ’n konsepwet wat die  resultaat  is
van onderhandelinge tussen amptenare en vakbonde.  Die  Parlement  hoef  nie
maar net ’n rubberstempel te wees van ’n konsepwet wat swyg oor die lot  van
weerloses  in  die  samelewing  nie.  Die  VF  Plus  wil  vra  dat   hierdie
wysigingswet aangepas word, om ook voorsiening te maak vir ’n verhoging  van
die  statutêre  minimumaanpassing  van  2%.  Die  verkoop  van  die   Kaapse
Waterfront sal hopelik die  finansiële  krisis  van  die  vastevoordeelfonds
verlig. Ons kan hier seker maak dat Transnet wel doen wat nodig  is  om  ook
die swaarkry van sy afgetredenes te verlig.  Baie  dankie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr W D SPIES: Chairperson, this Act makes provision  for  the  preservation
of membership of pension funds, especially when  employees  are  transferred
as a result of restructuring. It deals,  along  with  amendments,  with  the
Transnet pension allocation and is the  result  of  a  consultation  process
between Transnet, its pension funds and the unions. But I  do  not  want  to
speak on behalf of pension funds or the unions that  were  well  represented
in the process to get the draft Bill in its current form.

I want to speak on behalf of the  most  vulnerable  interest  group  in  the
Transnet pension saga, and that is the  elderly  that  are  members  of  the
second defined benefit  pension  fund.  They  do  not  have  any  bargaining
powers. They cannot strike, because they are not supposed to work. They  are
supposed to enjoy their retirement with dignity and rest  after  decades  of
selfless service to South Africa. Most of them retired before 1990  and  all
of them are in their mid-seventies and older. Most are frail.

Yesterday I received a call from a Mrs Esterhuizen.  She  informed  me  that
she was calling on behalf of her father. He had a stroke and cannot see  any
more, but he wants to know if we can’t  help  to  get  his  meagre  Transnet
pension adjusted. Due to poor management these pensioners did not  share  in
the record growth of the markets over the past three  years.  Their  pension
only increased with the statutory minimum of 2%.  Many  of  them  receive  a
monthly pension that is lower than the standard government pension  for  the
elderly.

This House has a responsibility towards the most vulnerable in the
community. Certain cases cannot be left to the markets to resolve. We are
confronted here with a draft Bill that is the result of negotiations
between officials and unions. Parliament does not only have to be a rubber
stamp for a draft Bill that is silent about the fate of the vulnerable in
society. The FF Plus asks that this amendment Bill should be adjusted, to
make provision for an increase of the statutory minimum adjustment of 2%.
The selling of the Cape Waterfront will hopefully relieve the financial
crisis of the defined benefit fund. We can ensure that Transnet does what
it takes to relieve the suffering of its retired workers. Thank you very
much.]

Mr N M NENE: Thank you, Chairperson. This Bill is one of the very important
milestones on the developmental agenda of the ANC-led government, that
seeks to normalise society and bring about equality at all levels,
including in the workplace. The Minister and other members have already
outlined the salient features of this Bill. It is our belief that this
Transnet Pension Fund is fully in compliance and in line with the Pension
Funds Act in general. The trustees would also be given adequate training in
order to discharge their fiduciary duties for the benefit of the members
and the fund in general. The migration from the defined benefit schemes to
the defined contribution schemes in the past resulted in surpluses that
were in dispute until this House passed legislation that resolved the
impasse.
We trust that the lessons learnt from that process will be of value to this
process and would be utilised to ensure that such anomalies don’t arise. We
look forward to having this Bill before this House in order to pass it
before the end of the session. The ANC supports this Bill.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Chair. In light of the fact that many
employees submit a portion of their salaries into a pension fund that will
hopefully in their old age and retirement assist in maintaining their basic
needs, it is incumbent upon us to ensure the security of such funds.

The Transnet Pension Fund, which has been functional since 1990, and which
in its 16 years has accumulated the pensions of so many employees, is an
example of a fund that we have a duty to secure.

The MF is pleased about the provisions and amendments contained in the
Bill, which clearly provides for an instrument that will secure the
efficient management of the fund and will provide security for its
beneficiaries.

The MF supports the Transnet Pension Fund Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr S L TSENOLI: Thank you, Chairperson. I would like to add my appreciation
for the shift in the manner in which we deal with Bills. The transformation
of Parliament is an ongoing process for us. Every step that we are taking
to achieve that is an important one, and the politics of this Bill and the
reasons why the issue requires legislation are crucial for us.

In a sense this step is a very important one; indeed we are taking a giant
step to transform our institution, which is supposed to be the people’s
tribune and is in fact the people’s Parliament. For that reason this is a
very welcome move.

The reorganisation of the state, which we undertook to do when we took
office in 1994, is a challenging task. Some of this work can have negative
consequences. But evidence increasingly emerges that where we have done so
in an inclusive and participatory manner, involving those affected, the
results are almost always very productive and useful. This is one instance
where, from indications so far, we are having such results.

Effective representation of the interests of those affected by these
measures is crucial, not only in this sector but everywhere else. However,
I do want to add my words to hon Hendrickse’s view about the Pension Funds
Adjudicator, because we may not have an early opportunity to indicate our
displeasure that he is not getting support where he should be getting it. I
may be saying it before we get full briefings, but the work in this area is
very important. It represents the interests of many people whose pensions
and savings over the years must be protected, and those who are predators
must be prevented from preying on them. We have to protect those who are
unable to protect themselves.

This reorganisation is a crucial one. It shows that it is possible to
intervene in a manner that satisfies the interests of the economy and those
who are affected by the organisations that we are running, and for that
reason this is a very significant move and we appreciate it. Thank you.

The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms C-S Botha): Thank you. We have now
accommodated everybody who indicated they wanted to participate in the
debate. Is there perhaps anybody else?

Prof A K ASMAL: Chairperson, I am delighted at this opportunity to
participate in a new approach to legislation. I made a suggestion 18 months
ago to my Chief Whip, and the consummation of that is reflected here. I
think it gives us an opportunity to look at the policy implications rather
than going in hugger-mugger fashion to a portfolio committee. Or in fact,
nobody realises the policy. It comes back to a Second Reading, and what we
have is a Minister and others just telling us what the Bill states, rather
than the policy behind it. I think it is important that we look at the
technical measure and look at the enormous policy implications.

First of all, there has been agreement with the unions, government and
Transnet, which itself is a victory, because pension issues are enormously
sensitive throughout the world. It is a deferred salary. In the United
States they want to privatise pensions. In Europe, because of extensive
birth control and fewer births, they have problems with bringing back older
people into service. The British are changing their pension laws to make it
compulsory for people to work beyond 65.

Here we have, in a situation where the cost of pensions is a burden on the
state, a rational, open, transparent, agreed-upon arrangement. I think this
is a triumph for the kind of democracy we want to build, because I think
the state could have used its power, particularly because of the background
of the pension system in South Africa, to impose a solution. Because the
background is – and I speak as a former school teacher, many, many years
ago – that there was no pension for blacks, or there was a discriminatory
pension for blacks.

It is a great tribute to the ANC that, very quietly, and in an orderly
fashion, they have brought back the benefits of those who were excluded
from the pension scheme. People who work for Transnet are, apart from
mining, in one of the most dangerous areas in the world, the most unsafe
areas in the world, and recognising the right and entitlement to pensions
is recognition by all of us of this fact. We are saluting the older people
who have contributed to the building of South Africa.

It is a pleasure therefore to take part in this opening approach to a new
style of legislation. We shall allow people who are not in the portfolio
committees to do this – I apologise to people who have been in the
portfolio committees for usurping their right, but I think this is
Parliament asserting its authority to say that policy issues must always be
discussed before the Bill goes in a quiet, leisurely way to the portfolio
committees. I thank you.

The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms C-S Botha): Thank you very much, hon Asmal.
Is there anybody else? If not, hon Minister Erwin, you may respond.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chairperson, I must say that probably
the hon Kader Asmal is the only person I’d contemplate a coup in Parliament
with. From his last remarks, he is certainly aware of the powers of
committees, and I think he is probably correct.

I thank the speakers, and I also think that what we have done has been a
very interesting experiment. I hope we will settle down to a continued
process.

In the same spirit, let me just add a few more issues, because I think
members have raised some very important and interesting points. Firstly,
the origin of the Bill, as you know, was from a strike action. The strike
action raised a number of issues around the restructuring and I think, at
the end, it is a testimony to the trade union movement and what it can
achieve, that we were able to sit down at the end of a protracted strike
and identify what would be sensible, equitable and feasible solutions,
which would have a real and important impact on many, many members.

I think it is once again testimony to the importance of trade unions that
they were able to highlight, particularly in this area of pensions, that
there would be real uncertainty and real possible prejudice for members. I
am very pleased that we have been able to settle this in the manner we have
indicated.

There has been an issue as to whether we should put the exclusion of new
members into the Transnet retirement fund from other companies into the
rules or into the Act. We have insisted that we believe it should be in the
Act, and the reasoning behind that is that, in the main, what we have to do
now is already the consequence of some unusual steps that were taken in
2000, and even more problematic steps that were taken in 1990 when funds
were set up with pensions which left us with some very difficult legacies.
I will comment in a moment on the Second Defined Benefit Fund.

I think we should not create a situation, going forward, where there may be
an expectation or a pressure arising that could further complicate this
situation. We don’t need that. This is already an adjustment to meet the
needs of pensioners. I have heard the arguments of some of the unions that
maybe there would be benefit in it, but I am not at all persuaded. I think
we should have clarity. We should be very clear that there will be this
change, and that will be the end of it. We can’t have further changes. It
is, I believe, in the interest of everybody, pensioners and all.

Let me very briefly comment on some of the speakers’ comments. In
particular, I welcome the cross-party clarification to pensioners that this
will not affect their rights. I think that is very important. It is the
thrust and intention of it. It is in the spirit of the settlement we
reached with the unions.

I really would urge all members that we should keep telling pensioners
that. There is nothing worse than being a pensioner and being somewhat
insecure about what is going to happen. Nothing will change. We will make
certain that that is the case.

We could not deal with the Second Defined Benefit Fund in this Bill. It,
unfortunately, is in an exceptionally complicated position, affected very
much by the situation of the revenue coming into the fund, but I think, as
has been intimated by Transnet, I am at least pleased that we will probably
do something positive in the very near future. We are looking at that, but
we could not change this Act, and create unnecessary exposure which could
be massively to the detriment of Transnet. Transnet’s prime function is to
ensure that we build ports – it came up earlier today – the railway lines,
and that we get the new pipeline built. That is its prime function.

You must not underestimate what an impact a massive deficit on your pension
fund can have on your balance sheet. We are trying to address that. We are
seeking many, many ways of doing it, but at least I am confident that we
will make some positive announcements in the near future.

Very briefly, on some of the comments made by the hon Cronin, we remember
that there are other entities within Transnet that will go into a similar
position. We are, as you know, looking at the issue of the South African
express. We, in terms of the previous settlement, agreed to undertake an
investigation on Autopax. We have now reported back to the unions, and I
think fairly soon we will be able to indicate where that entity will go. I
think it is important that we solve those issues.

Very briefly, on the implications ...

The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms C-S Botha): Very briefly.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Very briefly, on the implications of
whether you can or cannot attach pension funds, this is a much wider issue.
It can’t be dealt with here, and I think you are aware of that. It has got
its pros and it has got its cons. I think that if we highlight it here, it
might be something that spins out, and can be looked at again.

Thank you, Madam Chairperson, for the indulgence. I just hope that at the
Second Reading, we will get support.

Debate concluded.


      CONTENTION THAT MR M J ELLIS HAD CONTRAVENED THE SUB JUDICE RULE


                                  (Ruling)

The ACTING DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms C-S Botha): Thank you very much, hon
Minister.
Before I take Orders number 3 and 4, I wish to give a ruling on a point of
order raised in the House on 20 September.
Hon members, during a debate on a motion regarding the conduct of the hon
Mr Gibson in the House on Wednesday, 20 September, the hon Chief Whip of
the Majority Party raised a point of order contending that the hon Ellis
was contravening the sub judice rule by making certain remarks.

I undertook before giving a ruling to study Hansard. I have now had the
opportunity to study the unrevised Hansard, and wish to give my ruling. The
remark of the hon Mr Ellis that was challenged in terms of the sub judice
rule was, and I quote:


  Did he ...

The hon Gibson -

  ... defraud Parliament as some former and some present members did in the
  Travelgate scandal?

I have established the cases against sitting members of this House had not
yet been concluded in the courts when the hon Mr Ellis made reference to
them. The hon Chief Whip’s assertion that the sub judice rule could apply
in these circumstances was therefore correct.

However, the hon Ellis merely referred to those cases in passing, and did
not go into their merits. A member would only contravene the sub judice
rule if the member discussed the merits of a case. I am therefore satisfied
that the hon Mr Ellis was not in breach of the sub judice rule. Thank you.

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson,
it’s a pleasure to introduce the Second Reading debate on these two Bills.
The Bills before us here deal with two of the three pillars of the national
technical infrastructure that is normally the responsibility of government.
A sound technical infrastructure plays a significant role in the economy in
several ways, including by assisting firms to adopt and meet the quality
standards necessary to compete in the global environment, and also by
ensuring that low-quality, substandard imported goods do not undercut the
productive base of our manufacturing sector.
The purpose of the Measurement Units and Measurement Standards Bill is to
provide for the establishment, powers and functions of a National Metrology
Institute of South Africa, the NMISA, as a juristic person. The South
African metrology system has been in existence for more than 60 years but,
currently, metrology work is catered for through a metrology centre that
reports to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the CSIR
campus.

The mandate of the National Metrology Institute, like the current National
Metrology Laboratory, will be to provide for the use of measurement units
of the international system of units and certain other measurement units
for the designation of national measurement standards and for keeping and
maintaining national measurement standards and units.

Metrology, which is the science of accurate measurement, forms a pivotal
part of the technical infrastructure. To be credible internationally, the
national measurement units and standards must be compatible with
international measurement units and standards. There is an ever-increasing
demand to demonstrate equivalence of national measurement systems in
international trade transactions.

At home, accurate measurements are essential for health and safety as well
as for the development of industrial capabilities. For instance, medical
diagnostic tools such as X-ray machines, lasers and other instruments need
to be accurately calibrated to ensure safe operation and reliable
diagnosis. In addition, measurement accuracy plays a critical role in
enabling firms to participate in value chains of advanced sectors such as
the aerospace or nuclear industries.

The repositioning of the NMISA as an independent public entity will align
its status with that of similar technical infrastructure institutions in
other jurisdictions. The Bill provides for the NMISA to be governed through
its own board of directors and for a consultative forum and relevant
stakeholders that can advise the board on matters pertaining to metrology,
and for formal co- operation agreements with the CSIR on matters that may
be of mutual benefit and interest, especially with regard to new research
fields that may require the development of new standards.

An independent status for the institute is necessary as metrology is the
foundation of the technical infrastructure, and we need to demonstrate
organisational independence equivalent to that of international peers.

The NMISA is also the most advanced metrology institute on the African
continent and therefore has a critical role to play in uplifting regional
and continental peer institutes. The international standing of our national
institute is demonstrated through its membership of all but one of the
technical consultative committees of the International Committee for
Weights and Measures.

The NMISA is also a signatory of the Applicable Global Mutual Recognition
Arrangement and this facilitates the international acceptance of South
African measurements and certificates.

The purpose of the second Bill, the accreditation Bill, is to provide an
internationally recognised and effective accreditation and good laboratory
practice compliance monitoring system for South Africa by establishing the
South African National Accreditation System, Sanas, as a public entity.
Sanas will be recognised as the only accreditation body in South Africa for
conformity assessment and calibration.

Accreditation forms a vital second pillar of our domestic technical
infrastructure. Accreditation is the process by which an authoritative
third party, in our case Sanas, formally recognises the technical
competence of conformity assessment service providers such as laboratories,
inspection bodies and certification institutions. Such conformity
assessment service providers normally operate in a fiercely competitive
environment. Accreditation therefore assists local customers of such
services by setting norms for conformity assessment service providers based
on demonstrated competence. It also allows for the acceptability of local
conformity assessment service providers by confirming their ability to
perform specific types of testing, measurement, certification and
inspection against a published and specific schedule of accreditation. The
credibility of Sanas as an accreditation body is thus of immense value to
our economy in this regard.

Increasingly, accreditation is used by South African regulators to ensure
both the competence and consistency of the outcome of service providers
used in the local regulatory domain. The Department of Labour is a case in
point. It has outsourced inspection services in relation to fire
extinguishers and vessels under pressure and now uses Sanas accreditation
to monitor the activity of its approved inspection service providers as
part of managing the local regulatory risk.

The increasing demand by large European-based food retailers for compliance
with their own food production and safety standards is another case in
point. Sana’s competence in the area of food standards has been recognised
by several international food retailers. This means that in certain cases
local suppliers can use Sanas accredited certification bodies to prove
compliance with these standards. This ensures that local produce is shown
to comply with these standards prior to exports, and prevents the costs and
unnecessary waste that would be incurred if such activity could only be
verified at the point of entry.

As is the case with the measurement Bill, one of the main purposes of the
accreditation Bill is to change the corporate form of the current
institution by establishing it as a public entity. Sanas was established by
Cabinet decision in 1994 and currently operates as a non-profit
organisation in terms of section 21 of the Companies Act.

The new identity for Sanas is provided for in the Bill, and it is required
first to meet the requirements of the National Treasury to phase out
section 21 companies as government agencies; second, to facilitate the use
of accreditation by government departments, especially in support of
conformity assessments in regulation, and third, to recognise Sanas as the
only accreditation body in South Africa for conformity assessment and
calibration.

The Bill will also support the prescription of impartiality by the
International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation and the International
Accreditation Forum in order to maintain international recognition of the
activities of Sanas. In terms of the Bill, Sanas will have its own board
appointed by the Minister of Trade and Industry as well as an advisory
forum that will ensure that stakeholder interests are communicated to and
considered by the board.

The two Bills before us are therefore aimed at strengthening the South
African technical infrastructure, and I have pleasure in calling for their
support from the House. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B A D MARTINS: Hon Chairperson, hon members, the Bill before us is the
result of the Department of Trade and Industry’s endeavour to restructure
South Africa’s technical regulatory infrastructure and to optimise its
standards, quality assurance, accreditation and metrology system.

Quality assurance, as members know from their constituency work, is
important in a number of areas, from bread and butter, to bricks and
cement. For instance, in the construction industry some unscrupulous
building contractors continue to use substandard bricks and cement when
building houses for the poor, with the result that these dwellings often
collapse and cause deaths, serious injury and damage to property. With
clear standards, quality assurance and stringent enforcement procedures,
the days of the unscrupulous operator will be numbered.

The Bill further provides a framework to establish the SA National
Accreditation System as a national accreditation body that is
internationally recognised for calibration, conformity assessment and good
laboratory practice.

It is envisaged that as the economic integration of the Southern African
Development Community takes place and leads to greater growth and
development, Sanas will have a crucial role to play in the region, and also
in the context of the New Economic Partnership for Africa’s Development.

The ANC supports the passage of this Bill through Parliament. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Chair, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, the object of
the Measurement Units and Measurement Standards Bill, 2006, and the
Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory
Practice Bill is to align and restructure South African technical
infrastructure with international best practice. Part of the restructuring
is the reconstitution of the SA National Accreditation System, Sanas, which
currently operates as a section 21 company.

These two Bills are responsible for a wide range of functions, for example
the accreditation, calibration, testing and verification of laboratories,
scientific inspection bodies that comply with the International
Organisation for Economic Co-operation, and the Development Unit.

The DA supports both these two Bills, which are highly technical. They both
provide for a board with executive and nonexecutive members. I appeal to
the hon Minister to appoint members to these boards with specific
competence and with knowledge that will add value to these particular
bodies.

Die internasionale meting van metrologiese eenhede word dikwels deur
ontwikkelde ekonomieë gebruik om hul markte te sluit vir produkte wat van
ontwikkelende lande afkomstig sou wees, as gevolg van die feit dat die
produkte nie aan internasionale metingsvereistes sou voldoen nie, of
onredelik hoë tariewe word op hierdie goedere gehef. Hierdie wetsontwerpe
stel Suid-Afrika en die SAOG-lande in staat om, sal ons sê, onregverdige
handelspraktyke te verminder.

Die belangrikheid van die twee wetsontwerpe is dat die wetenskaplike
infrastruktuur onderhou en vergroot word, wat Suid-Afrika as die grootste
ekonomie in Afrika maar ook in die SAOG-lande in staat sal stel om in ’n
toenemende mate aan metingsvereistes rakende uitvoere in ’n kompeterende,
globale mark te kan voldoen.

Vergun my ook die geleentheid om die Departement van Handel en Nywerheid,
die Portefeuljekomitee oor Handel en Nywerheid se amptenare, en veral die
persone wat gemoeid was met die finalisering van hierdie wetsontwerpe te
bedank. Ek dink dit is ’n sprekende voorbeeld van waar die belange van Suid-
Afrika eerste gestel is.

Werklike langtermyn ekonomiese vooruitgang kan slegs plaasvind indien dit
op ’n wetenskaplik gefundeerde, internasionaal geakkrediteerde
metingsinfrastruktuur geskoei is, en in wese beteken dit dat hierdie
wetsontwerpe die kwaliteitstruktuur en –kultuur van die Suid-Afrikaanse
metingbedryf sal verbeter. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The international measurement of metrological units is often used by
developed economies to shut their markets to products suspected of coming
from developing countries, due to the fact that these products apparently
do not comply with international measurement standards, or these products
are subjected to unreasonably high tariffs. This Bill enables South Africa
and the SADC countries to, shall we say, limit unfair trade practices.

The importance of these two Bills is that the scientific infrastructure is
maintained and expanded, which in turn enables South Africa, as the largest
economy in Africa but also in the SADC countries, to comply increasingly
with the measurement standards required for exports in a competitive and
global market.

Furthermore, allow me the opportunity to thank the Department of Trade and
Industry, the officials of the Portfolio Committee of Trade and Industry
and especially those who were involved with the finalising of this Bill. I
think it is telling proof of where the interests of South Africa were
placed first.

Real long-term economic advancement can only be realised if based on
scientific, internationally accredited measurement infrastructure and in
essence it means that these Bills will improve the quality structure and
culture of the South African measurement industry. I thank you.]

Prof E S CHANG: Hon Chairperson, Deputy Minister, members, up to now I have
been listening to the debate, and we are all saying the same things. When
our colleagues from the left-hand side are not speaking English, I don’t
understand them, but I presume we are still speaking about the same thing.
However, I’m given two minutes, so I still want to use my two minutes, just
to emphasise our support of this Bill.

The use of well-written standards in the conformity assessment process adds
credibility and validity to the process. Standards should also specify all
essential characteristics of our products. We are now part of our new
global economy. I think everyone in this House would agree: We need a
vision of how we can make South African product inspections and tests
acceptable everywhere, not just in South Africa. We must strive to maintain
the highest level of protection of safety and environment.

So, I challenge the government and the South African National Accreditation
System, or Sanas, to work as partners to act aggressively, persistently and
intelligently to advance our concepts as the basis for international
standards. We cannot risk the prospect that our products and companies will
be locked out of future markets.

It is well known that South Africa has a very good technical infrastructure
and needs to keep up with international standards, especially in terms of
measurement standards. Let us not forget that measurements are a key to
competitiveness. There has never been a time in which measuring accurately
has been more important to the nation’s economic health.

Laboratory accreditation, product certification and management systems are
too often used as nontariff trade barriers. Where one or more of these
processes are needed to improve confidence between buyers and sellers or by
regulators, this is where the National Measurement Institute can work to
assure that the systems are open and add value rather than costs. Thank you
very much.

Mr H B CUPIDO: Chairperson, the ACDP is pleased to speak in favour of the
Measurement Units and Measurement Standards Bill and the Accreditation for
Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Bill. South
Africa has become an important role-player in the global village and
therefore needs to conform to international best practices.

These Bills, inter alia, seek to restructure the South African technical
regulatory infrastructure and to optimise South African standards, quality
assurance, accreditation and our metrology system. Bringing to life an
independent national metrology institute will not only enhance the
technical infrastructure of the Republic of South Africa but will continue
to be a direct link to the Meter Convention for SADC, through the SADC co-
operation in metrology, and will provide appropriate measurements,
traceable not only to South Africa but to the whole of the SADC region.

South Africa needs a body like the South African National Accreditation
System that would be internationally recognised for calibration,
conformity, assessment and good laboratory practices. The ACDP is convinced
that the role that Sanas will play as an effective accreditation and
monitoring body in South Africa will have a positive impact on technical
services rendered by other SADC countries soon. The ACDP supports the
Bills. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF acknowledges the efforts of the
Department of Trade and Industry in these two Bills. In the fast developing
world, it is crucial that we equip ourselves with tools that shall allow us
to manage change and compete globally. This department plays a vital role
in the economic structure and development of South Africa domestically and
internationally.

It is clearly indicated that with the Accreditation for Conformity
Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Bill, the department
aims to modernise our technical infrastructure. As with the Measurement
Units and Measurement Standards Bill, the MF supports the establishment of
the National Metrology Institute. The MF supports the Measurement Units and
Measurement Standards Bill and the Accreditation for Conformity Assessment,
Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Bill. Thank you, Madam Chair.

Mr J J MAAKE: Madam Chair, hon members of the House and the Ministers
present today, the Measurement Units and Measurement Standards Bill sounds
like a very technical Bill, but, in actual fact, the Bill only seeks to
establish the National Metrology Institute, which was previously part of
the CSIR and the National Metrology Laboratory, as a juristic person that
is independent from the CSIR.

The sector of metrology is usually very technical in such a way that we, as
laymen, sometimes do not even know of its existence. It is, however, very
important because in terms of international trade, standards, quality
assurance and accreditation, it is the correct functioning of such an
institute that keeps our products in the international markets. It is
therefore very crucial for South Africa to have a very sophisticated and
highly competent metrology system, in order to keep abreast of
technological advancement in line with the globalised markets.

Western countries usually put very high standards on the products they
import, especially products from Third World countries. This they do,
knowing very well that most developing countries do not even have metrology
institutes to be in a position to measure the standards of their goods.
South Africa is doing a lot of good work for our fellow African countries
in this regard. An example will be that of the Tanzanian fish that was
banned in the European markets under the pretext of low quality and
standards. South Africa came in and helped, and normalised the situation in
the Tanzanian export market.

I wish the following Bills, the Measurement Units and Measurement Standards
Bill and the Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good
Laboratory Practice Bill, would also be applied to political parties. We
could then have standards of behaviour compatible with what our people
expect from a South African Parliament. Standards of procedures for
evaluating performance and intervals for evaluation would be set for these
parties. We could then explain the consequences of substandard performance,
because right now, substandard performance is the norm in these parties.

As of now, Madam Chair, you can imagine what might happen if you left the
opposition parties alone in this House without the ANC. Chaos of
frightening proportions! The beautiful textile and embroidery that makes
our Parliament walls very beautiful might be replaced with female
underwear. Neighbouring countries like Lesotho might be invaded and
colonised. All the efforts to build stadiums for 2010 would be halted.
There would be no Gautrain. Settlers might be sent back to Europe and the
country might be called Azania.

The only reliable person who can be left alone without the ANC in the House
might be hon Van der Merwe. At least, when we came back, our salaries would
have been tripled. [Laughter.] I would not mind leaving him alone; in fact,
I would advise that you leave him alone. The ANC supports the Bill. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Perhaps you want to move a private
member’s motion on that.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY (Dr R H Davies): Chairperson, I
want to thank all the speakers for their support, and in particular I want
to welcome the recognition by a number of speakers that having in place
competent, credible metrology accreditation and standardisation
institutions is of very great value.

Issues of measurements, standards and accreditation are increasingly
important, and so are issues of competitiveness. If you cannot meet basic
standards, you cannot compete. They are also important matters of consumer
protection and increasingly issues in international trade. As tariffs have
come down and subsidies are under challenge, technical barriers to trade
are becoming of increasing importance. And, if we are going to be a
competent player in these areas, it is important that we have technical
infrastructure in place that is up to the job.

I am also pleased that there was recognition that the Bills before us will
contribute to the improvement and modernisation of our technical
infrastructure and that there is broad support for the general direction.

I just want to comment on one point, which was raised by Dr Rabie, when he
pleaded with the Minister to make sure that competent people were
appointed. I should point out to him that both Bills require that the
people who are appointed to the boards of these institutions have
sufficient knowledge, experience and qualifications relating to the
functions of these institutions. Of course, we want to maintain the
standards. We want to ensure that the boards reflect our demographics and
are in tune with the transformatory agenda. But, rest assured, maintaining
the competence of these institutions will be our top priority. Thank you.
[Applause.]

COMMITTEE REPORTS

National Assembly

1.    Seventy-Seventh Report of Standing Committee on Public Accounts on
     South African Weather Services, dated 6 September 2006:

     Resolution

     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), having heard and
     considered evidence on the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-
     General on the financial statements of South African Weather Services
     (SAWS) for the year ended 31 March 2005, reports as follows:


     1.     Donor Funding (page 31, par 4.1)


        The Committee was informed that there were inadequate controls in
        place to monitor the progress of donor-funded projects against
        funds donated for specific projects.
        The Committee noted this with dissappointment and regards this as
             the management failure. The Committee wishes to recommend that
             the Accounting Authority—
        (a)      Determines whether any senior manager can be held
             responsible for the management failure;
        (b)      Assures Parliament that instances like this will not
             reoccur in the future;
        (c)      Ensures that regular progress reports are compiled and
             reviewed by management in order to monitor amounts spent on
             projects in relation to the percentage completion of the
             specific project; and
        (d)      Ensures that there are proper controls over expenses
             incurred per project in relation to funds received.


     2.     Non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations (page 31, par
         4.2)


         The report of the Auditor-General highlighted that the following
         instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations occurred:
         (a)     Non-maintenance of a register of members’ interests in
              relation to contracts;
         (b)     The investment policy of SAWS was inadequate and in
              particular did not comply with specific requirements of
              Treasury Regulations.
         (c)     Lack of controls to ensure that quarterly reports are
              submitted on time.


         The Committee is disappointed that this entity is still not
         complying with simple issues of Treasury Regulations and that
         management is not fulfilling its fundamental responsibility of
         enforcing controls, in order to ensure that interests in contracts
         are declared and regularly reviewed and revised where necessary.

     2.1    Recommendation
         The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority urgently
         ensure that:
         (a)     Interest in contracts by management is declared, thereby
              reducing the risk of certain suppliers of goods and services
              receiving preferential treatment;
         (b)     Management only invest funds as per the approved policy,
              thus reducing the risk of losses to the SAWS; and
         (c)     Management implements proper controls to ensure that the
              requirements of the PFMAand the DEAT are strictly adhered to.

     3.     Internal control weaknesses (page 31, par 4.3)
         The audit of the SAWS revealed shortcomings in the system of
         internal control, which includes the following:
         (a)     SAWS has been Operating without an approved internal
              control policy for a number of years;
         (b)     The Lack of a proper debt control policy and poor
              enforcement of internal controls;
         (c)     Failure to monitor unallocated amounts are not followed on
              a regular basis in order to clear suspense accounts; and
         (d)     Failure to perform leave reconciliations. In light of the
              above, the Committee is of the view that the management of
              SAWS underestimates the importance of internal control within
              an organisation.


     3.1    Recommendations
         The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensure
              that:
         (a)     Policies are enforced and disciplinary steps are taken
              against employees failing to comply with these policies;
         (b)     Management implements and enforce proper credit control
              and debt collection policies and obtain legal assistance in
              the collection of long overdue debts;
         (c)     Debts are recovered timeously;
         (d)     The risk of duplicate payments to creditors is reduced;
              and
         (e)     Leave reconciliations are performed at year end to ensure
              that the provision for leave pay is accurately calculated.


     4.     Land (page 32, par 4.4 )

         According to the SAWSAct, 2001 (Act No 8 of 2001) a portion of the
         Department of PublicWorks land was allocated to SAWS. The SAWS did
         not register this land in its name and this land, therefore,
         remains in the name of the Department of Public Works.


         The Committee noted this with concern as it seems to be because of
         a lack of proper follow-up procedures on the registration process
         of the land.

     4.1    Recommendation
         The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority ensures
         that SAWS monitors the registration process closely to ensure that
         the title deed is registered as soon as possible in the name of
         SAWS.


         The SAWS must furnish Parliament with a full report detailing the
         whole progress to date within 60 days after the tabling and
         adoption of the Committee’s Report.




    Report to be considered.
2.    Seventy-Eighth Report of Standing Committee on Public Accounts on
     Compensation Commissioner for Occupational Health Diseases (CCOD),
     dated 6 September 2006:

     RESOLUTION


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), having heard and
     considered evidence on the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-
     General on the financial statements of the Compensation Commissioner
     for Occupational Health Diseases (CCOD) for the year ended 31 March
     2005 RP136/2005, reports as follows:

     1.     Policy Framework
        The Committee noted that the CCOD had the following problems with
        regard to policy framework:
          • Lack of a policies and procedures manual that is specific to
            the
          • operating activities of the CCOD;
          • Lack of an updated data base of mines and works that enables
            the CCOD to monitor actual levies received against levies
            expected;
          • No functional audit committee exists at the Department of
            Health to ensure that the CCOD is operating in line with
            policies and procedures; and
          • Lack of an accounting system to manage debtors and creditors.

        The Committee was informed by the Department of Health and
        theCompensation Commissioner during the hearing that the above
        problems are in the process of being resolved.

        The Committee therefore recommends that:

        (a)      lear policies and procedures that are specific to the
             operations of the CCOD be developed as matter of urgency;
        (b)      esearch should be commissioned to determine the actual
             number of qualifying mines and works in the country;
        (c)      econciliation for debtors should be prepared in terms of
             Treasury Regulation 31.1.2(j); and a proper accounting system
             to manage debtors and creditors be developed;—a proper accrual
             accounting system should be implemented.

        The Committee further noted that the Medical Bureau for
        Occupational Diseases (MBOD) in the provinces is in the process of
        developing policies. The Committee recommends that the accounting
        officer inform SCOPA of the progress made in this regard.

     2.     Oversight and Governance
        The Committee is aware that the Director General of the National
        Department of Health is the accounting officer of the CCOD. The
        Audit Committee, Internal Audit and the Management of the National
        Department of Health are responsible for providing oversight over
        the CCOD.
        However, the following deviations and non compliance with PFMA and
        Treasury Regulation are noted and need to be addressed:
          • The National Department of Health has not been providing
            oversight over the MBOD and the CCOD operations;


          • The Audit Committee for the National Department of Health has
            been dysfunctional for the 2004/05 financial year; and
          • Internal audit reviews were not performed at the MBOD and the
            CCOD for 2004/05 financial year.
        The Committee recommends that the Accounting Authority should
        ensure that:
        (a)      The National Department of Health must implement proper
            monitoring and oversight mechanisms to ensure that the MBOD and
            the CCOD fulfill their mandate;
        (b)      The National Department of Health must establish an Audit
            Committee with clear terms of reference to ensure that the
            activities of the MBOD and the CCOD are reviewed as required by
            the law; and that progress made with regard to the
            establishment of the Audit Committee at the Department of
            Health is provided to the Committee;
        (c)      That internal audit reviews are performed as required.


     3.     Resources
        The Committee is very concerned and request the Accounting Officer
        to ensure that the following highlighted weaknesses are addressed
        as a matter of urgency:
          • Inadequate staff numbers to verify the number of mines, to do
            inspections of declared risk shifts and verify the accuracy of
            assessments.
          • Inadequate technical accounting skills, information technology
            knowledge and internal control awareness at the MBOD and the
            CCOD
          • Lack of supervision and review of processes and other internal
            control issues.
        The Committee strongly urges the Accounting Officer to ensure that;
        (a)      A review of the staff compliment for sufficiency and
            skills is carried out to address the skills and capacity
            challenges at the MBOD and the CCOD;
        (b)      The CCOD must recruit properly qualified people to take
            care of financial and accounting responsibilities of the
            entity;
        (c)      A dedicated compliance section within the CCOD should be
            established to monitor the number of mines and works in
            existence and to monitor their compliance with the Occupational
            Diseases in Mines and Works Act. Returns of levies should be
            checked to ensure that revenue is collected; and
        (d)      Department, the MBOD and the CCOD must look at getting an
            electronic system for finger printing verification, and reduce
            dependence on the Department of Home Affairs to ensure
            efficiency.
     4.     General


        The Committee is very concerned with the financial transaction of
        nvestment the CCOD embarked upon that caused the entity to incur
        fruitless expenditure in excess of R45 million.


        The Committee therefore recommends that, the National Treasury and
        the CCOD must provide a detailed report to SCOPA on transactions
        related to its investments and surplus funds within 60 days of the
        tabling of this report.


     Report to be considered.


3.    Seventy-Ninth Report of Standing Committee on Public Accounts on
     Department of Labour, dated 18 October 2006:
     Resolution


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), having heard and
     considered evidence on the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-
     General on the financial statements of the Department of Labour for the
     year ended 31 March 2005, reports as follows:


     1.     Reconciliation between PERSAL and BAS (page 78 of the Annual
        Report)


        A reconciliation between PERSAL and BAS in respect of personnel
        expenditure for the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 had not
        been performed by the Department. As a result, the Auditor-General
        was unable to verify the accuracy of the amounts transferred from
        Persal to BAS by way of the interface between the two systems.
        The Committee therefore recommends that the Accounting Officer
        correct the matter immediately, inter alia by ensuring that—


        1.1      Monthly reconciliations are carried out timeously and
            properly, and
        1.2      All unreconciled items are followed-up immediately and
            resolved.


     2.     Lack of supporting documentation (page, 79 AR)
        During the audit, the Department could not provide sufficient
        supporting documentation in respect of journals processed, for
        claims recoverable amounting to R90, 185 million.
        The Committee is very concerned that such an elementary aspect of
        proper financial administration is lacking.
        The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer ensure that
        the matter is corrected immediately, inter alia by ensuring that:
        2.1      Only valid journals are processed;
        2.2      A proper file management process is in place, and
        2.3      Proper reviews of journals are carried out before any
             processing commences.


     3.     Non-compliance with laws and regulations (page 79 AR)


        The Committee noted various instances of non-compliance with the
        PFMA and Treasury Regulations.
        In light of the Accounting Officer’s legal duties as contained in
        sections 38 to 43 of the PFMA, the Committee recommends that the
        Accounting Officer report to the Minister all current instances
        where his Department does not comply with the provisions of the
        PFMA or Treasury Regulations.
        The Committee recommends that a progress report be sent to
        Parliament, within 30 days after the tabling and acceptance of the
        Committee’s Report

     4.     Reconciliation between the asset register and the general ledger
        (page 80, AR)
        Due to non-compliance with asset management policies and
        procedures, the fixed asset register of the Department is split and
        incomplete. No reconciliations are carried out to ensure a proper
        audit trail.
        The Committee is once more perturbed by the inadequate standard of
        financial administration within the Department of Labour and
        recommends that the Accounting Officer correct the matter
        immediately, inter alia by:
        4.1      Reporting to the Minister the target date for the
             finalisation of a complete asset register for the Department,
             and where necessary for public entities for whom the
             Accounting Officer and the Minister are responsible; and
        4.2      Ensuring that regular reconciliations are done between
             asset registers and the general ledger.


     5.     Unallocated funds (page 80, AR)
        As at 31 March 2005, the amount accumulated in the SETA Zero
        account at the National Revenue Fund amounted to R45 513 376. The
        Department has not taken adequate action to withdraw this amount
        from the National Revenue Fund (NRF) and to investigate the nature
        of these monies ensuring that it is only Skills Development Levy
        (SDL) income.
        As at year-end the nature or purpose of the monies in the SETA Zero
        account could not be verified for audit purposes.
        The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer correct the
        matter within 60 days after the tabling and acceptance of the
        Committee’s Report, inter alia by ensuring that—
        5.1      There is proper allocation of Skills Development Levies;
        5.2      All unallocated levies are allocated to the NSF; and
        5.3      The Department of Labour, in consultation with the South
             African Revenue Services, implement measures to resolve the
             uncertainty and accountability relating to the content of the
             SETA Zero account.
     6.     Perfomance Bonus
        The Committee noted that the Department paid the percentage of
        performance bonuses (to total personnel expenditure) amounting to
        5,06% (or R39,556,784.20)—this is above the DPSA directive of 1,5%.
        The Committee recommends that the Department furnish it with a
        detailed report within 30 days after the tabling and acceptance of
        the Committee Report.

     Report to be considered.

4.    Eightieth Report of Standing Committee on Public Accounts on
     Compensation Fund, dated 18 October 2006:
     Resolution


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), having heard and
     considered evidence on the Annual Report and the Report of the Auditor-
     General on the financial statements of the Compensation Fund (the Fund)
     for the year ended 31 March 2005, reports as follows:


     1.     Exception reports to verify assessments not followed up [par 3.1
        and 3.2 on page 60 of the Annual Report (AR)]


        The Fund had not generated and followed up exception reports
        showing assessment variations in excess of 20%. In addition, the
        relevant computer system (theAXS One system) used incorrect tariffs
        to raise assessments and income and in too many instances
        assessment debtors were incorrect. The Fund had overstated the
        assessments raised and the resulting debtor balances, and penalties
        were not charged on overdue account balances.


        The Committee therefore recommends that:


        1.1      Improved policies and procedures are implemented to
             enhance the accurate capturing of data in respect of all
             assessments;
        1.2      Procedures be implemented to reconcile, review, approve
             and monitor outstanding employer amounts; and
        1.3      The validity, accuracy, and completeness of revenue from
             employer contribution and associated debtors are improved.
     2.     General computer controls (par 5.2, page 61)

        A follow-up review of the Fund’s general computer controls
        indicated a lack of documented procedures for security
        administration and monitoring, logical access security and
        monitoring of user and administrator activity.
        The Committee recommends that in view of the critical reliance of
        the Fund on its computerised information systems, immediate steps
        be taken to—
        2.1      Improve the integrity of data processing and data files on
             the financial systems; and
        2.2      To develop and implement, documented and improved policies
             and procedures governing general controls.


     3.     Compliance with Treasury Regulations (par 5.3, page 62)


        The Committee noted that the investment policy required by Treasury
        regulation 31.3 was approved after year-end. During the year under
        review the investments were not monitored in terms of an approved
        policy.
        The Committee recommends that a proper policy framework covering
        approvals of important regulatory documentation is developed, and
        that the Minister be provided with confirmation once this has been
        done.


     4.     Processing of backlogs of claims (par 5.4, pg 62)

        The fund was still experiencing a backlog in the processing of
        claims. It was not possible to determine the impact of this backlog
        on the completeness of claims due to the volume of transactions.
        Third party claims were not timeously lodged with the parties
        concerned.

        The Committee therefore recommends that:
        4.1      Backlogs and turnaround time for the processing of claims
             be reduced in terms of specific targets, and performance in
             respect of these targets must be reported to the Minister on a
             regular basis;
        4.2      A proper policy framework in respect of third party claims
             be developed immediately; and
        4.3      The processing function must be resourced with staff with
             adequate skills and qualifications.


     5.     Internal control deficiency (2004 AR, pg 51, par 4.1)
        The Committee took note of an increase of disallowed claims
        consisting of overpayments and duplicate payments in respect of
        medical, compensation and pension payments. The Committee noted
        with concern that the Fund seem unable to remedy this matter. The
        Committee recommends that:
        5.1      Apreventative control framework should be developed to
             detect and prevent overpayments or duplicate payments; and
        5.2      A report to be tabled in Parliament within 60 days after
             tabling and acceptance of the Committee Report.


     6.     Inadequate file management

        The Fund has an inadequate file management system to keep track of
        files, resulting in files getting lost, duplicated or being
        incomplete.
        Although the Fund has begun to scan and index file content, there
        is still a lack of quality reviews resulting in errors that are not
        detected and corrected in time.
        The Committee recommends that an effective electronic filing
        system, incorporating quality reviews to timeously detect and
        correct errors, be implemented.


     7.     Special investigation
        Aforensic investigation requested by management on medical claims
        paid to certain service providers between 1 April 1998 and 31 March
        2003 was performed and a report was issued on 23 September 2003.
        The Fund is acting on the findings and the recommendations.
        The Committee commends the Fund for taking action upon discovery of
        possible fraud. However, the Committee recommends that the Fund
        implement more effective preventative measures and more effective
        controls. The effectiveness of such measures must be reviewed on a
        regular basis.

     Report to be considered.

1.    REPORT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON TRADE AND  INDUSTRY  ON  A  STUDY
   TOUR TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

   1. TERMS OF REFERENCE

      The Committee had agreed to undertake a study tour of the World  Trade
      Organisation  within  the  context  of  its  oversight  role  of   the
      Department of Trade and Industry and  its  multilateral  negotiations.
      The Training for members in this regard is crucial in gaining a better
      understanding of the functioning of the World Trade Organisation.

   2. LOGISTICAL ARRANGEMENTS

      A delegation from  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and  Industry
      undertook a training  session  at  the  World  Trade  Organization  in
      Geneva,  Switzerland,  from  26  –  30  June  2006.  The   multi-party
      delegation was led by the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee,  Mr.
      B D Martins (ANC) accompanied by Mr. S Rasmeni  (ANC),  Mrs.  B  Ntuli
      (ANC), Dr. P Rabie (DA) and Ms. M Williams (Committee Secretary).

   3. BACKGROUND

      The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is the  only  global  international
      organisation dealing with the rules of trade between nations.  At  its
      heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the
      world’s trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is
      to help producers of goods  and  services,  exporters,  and  importers
      conduct their business. South Africa is an actively involved member of
      the WTO.


   4. OBJECTIVES

      The responsibilities of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry
      include(s) oversight of the Department of Trade and Industry and  it’s
      multilateral negotiations. Thus the WTO training for National Assembly
      members  is  imperative  in  this  regard.  Also,  to  gain  a  better
      understanding of the functioning of the  WTO,  meeting  with  the  WTO
      directors and country representatives  on  issues  relating  to  trade
      negotiations, disputes and monitoring national trade policies as  well
      as  providing  technical  assistance  and  training   for   developing
      countries.

   5. FINDINGS

      The delegation from the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry  met
      with the officials from the South African Mission in Geneva on  Sunday
      26 June 2006 at 16:00 for a briefing session regarding  the  training.
      In attendance were the following officials: Mr. Faizel  Ismail  (South
      Africa’s representative to the World Trade Organisation),  Mr.  Xavier
      Carim (Department of Trade and Industry),  Dr.  Phil  Mohlahlane,  Mr.
      Gunther Muller, Mr. Attie Swart, Ms  Gerda  van  Dijk  (Department  of
      Agriculture).

      Mr. Ismail introduced members to the various officials and added  that
      Agriculture and Trade and Industry are important issues in  the  trade
      negotiations. A WTO modalities meeting scheduled for 28 June – 01 July
      2006  was  underway  whereby  Ministers  and  Heads   of   delegations
      (are/were) to meet in Geneva for intensive  negotiations  on  template
      agreements known as modalities for trade in Agriculture and Industrial
      products.  So  too  (are/were)  3   South   African   Ministers.   Non
      Governmental Organisations (are/were) also expected to be observers in
      the negotiating process. He added that this kind of exposure in  terms
      of members training is imperative to the understanding of and decision-
       making process regarding trade negotiations within  the  World  Trade
      Organisation.

      SOUTH AFRICA’S AGRICULTURAL AGENDA  SEEKS  TO  ADDRESS  THE  FOLLOWING
      ISSUES
      • High levels of domestic support (subsidies), which relates to  real
        support given by  governments  to  their  farmers  and  other  role
        players that tend to distort trade.
      • Unfair export competition –  mainly  export  subsidies  and  export
        credit schemes.
      • Improving access to markets for  SA  agricultural  goods  in  other
        countries by reducing levels of tariff and other  forms  of  market
        protection.
      • Ensuring that the trade  policy  space  addresses  the  development
        needs of developing countries.

      Mr. Carim explained that not all tariff reductions were good for South
      Africa, because of SA’s membership in  the  Southern  African  Customs
      Union. South Africa  is  classified  as  a  developing  country  which
      changes the tariff structure for South Africa. Agriculture is seen  to
      be the key to progress in the negotiations and  the  establishment  of
      the NAMA 10 is critical to the negotiations.


      Mr. Swart  added  that  modalities  regarding  commitments  (are/were)
      imperative at this/that) stage and  that  certain  outstanding  issues
      relating to subsidies should be agreed to.

      Presenter: Mrs. Maria Perez Esteve, Counsellor, WTO External Relations
      Division.
      Subject: Agriculture


      The agriculture  issue  dates  back  to  the  formation  of  the  WTO,
      successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT)  which
      did not feature agriculture as an issue. With the establishment of the
      WTO, agriculture was for the  first  time  subjected  to  multilateral
      trade  rules.  Distortions  regarding  agriculture  have  come   about
      especially  where  the  United  States  and  the  European  Union  are
      concerned. These distortions created in international trade are caused
      by domestic protection and government subsidies in favour of US and EU
      producers. This is to the detriment of  efficient  developing  country
      producers. The US and EU subsidises to approximately $300 billion  per
      year and developing countries are unable to do this.

      A solution to these inequalities would be  to  revisit  the  following
      pillars:
      • Market access: tariffs/ quota’s/ safeguards.
      • Export subsidies: reduction thereof.
      • Domestic support: rectifying trade distortions.
    • Amber box - distorts, causing oversupply.
    • Blue box distorts - but less because production is limited.
    • Green box – no/ minimal distortion.

      Monday, 26 June 2006
      Presenter: Mrs. Vivienne Liu, Counsellor, WTO Environment Division.
      Subject: Environment


      Mrs. Lui informed the members that the GATT (had made) provisions  for
      the protection of the environment. During the  1970’s,  momentum.  was
      gained in terms of environmental issues; however a concern was  raised
      with members using the protection of the environment to  impose  trade
      barriers and trade laws.


      At the Uruguay  Round  of  the  WTO  a  preamble  was  established  in
      reference to WTO Agreements for the protection of the environment.  At
      this same round members agreed to the establishment of a Committee  on
      Trade and Environment. However it is important to note  that  the  WTO
      does not set rules relating to environmental issues. It  only  relates
      to trade affiliated to environmental issues. Also,  the  WTO  supports
      organisations protecting the environment and tries to co-operate  with
      member  organisations   in   terms   of   trade   liberalisation   and
      environmental issues. Thus the WTO addresses trade issues impacting on
      the environment.


      Monday, 26 June 2006
      Presenter: Mr. Markus Jelitto, Counsellor, WTO Services Division.
      Subject: Services


      A Services Agreement has a lifespan of 10  years.  Trade  in  services
      particularly came about in 1995 with the establishment and  growth  of
      the WTO. All trade in services fall under  the  General  Agreement  on
      Trade in Services (GATS) Agreement. The legal  structure  of  services
      comprises 4 tiers, namely:
      • Mode 1: Cross border supply
        Services delivered via telecommunications
      • Mode 2: Consumption abroad
        From one jurisdiction to another
      • Mode 3: Commercial Presence
        A state establishing a business in another
      • Mode 4: Movement of natural persons
        Contracting in a state for a limited period in order to  deliver  a
        service

      There are 2 exceptions contained in the GATT, namely:
      • Government Services: Service not supplied on a commercial basis and
        not in competition with other services
      • Air transport: Traffic rights of airplanes/ company

      All sectors are open to be Most Favoured Nations  (MFN).  During  1991
      the WTO Secretariat developed in terms of Service Sectors. Nations are
      entrusted to determine which service sectors  they  would  liberalise,
      from a schedule they develop.

      Tuesday, 27 June 2006
      Presenter: Mr. Guy Evans, Counsellor, WTO Rules Division.
      Subject: Rules


      Rules address what is wrong  in  the  market  known  as   “non  market
      behaviour”. These may include dumping, subsidies and  safeguards.  The
      WTO has to be notified about an action  taken  by  a  country  against
      another company.


      • Dumping: An Agreement is established regulating what the government
        should do regarding this, namely an, Anti Dumping  Agreement.  Even
        though dumping is not illegal, the importing country has the  right
        not to accept the goods. Thus if there is an injury to the domestic
        market or cause, anti dumping measures may be taken. Dumping occurs
        when the export price is less than the home value  price.  Thus  if
        dumping is identified, the  investigating  authority  has  to  show
        cause and injury to the domestic  industry  of  the  same  product.
        These constitute three elements, namely:


           1. volume
           2. price effects of dumped imports
           3. consequences/ impact

      • Subsidies: When they cause trade distortions


      • Safeguards: Must  show  significant  increase  in  imports  causing
        serious injury to the domestic industry instead of  proving  unfair
        trade practices. It is  non  discriminatory  and  action  is  taken
        against all trade partners.  Thus  there  is  no  favourite  nation
        approach. Compensation is allowed.


      Measures to redress dumping:
   1. increasing the customs duty
   2. imposing a variable duty
   3. imposing a fixed duty
      Final measures may run for years up to 5 years.
      Measures to redress safeguards
     1. duties
     2. quotas
     3. tariff quota

      Tuesday, 27 June 2006
      Presenter: Mr. Jorge Castro, Counsellor, WTO Legal Division.
      Subject: Dispute Settlement


      The role of this Division is to provide advice, support, training  and
      technical assistance to member states. Dispute  settlement  under  the
      GATT needed transformation because during the GATT period panels would
      comprise the disputing parties and a  third  party  investigating  the
      dispute. The Dispute Investigation report concluded after findings had
      to be agreed upon by means of consensus. However this was  problematic
      as a respondent may not adopt the  report  (veto  it).  Thus  stronger
      players were able to block the adoption of the report. It was  at  the
      Uruguay Round that a decision  was  taken  regarding  the  process  of
      dispute settlement, in a sense to correct the system. The  process  of
      Dispute Settlement would be as follows:


      • Consultations (bilateral negotiations with disputing parties  /  60
        day period)
      • Panel and Appellate body established
      • Adoption of the panels report
      • Implementation of the decision (bilateral/multilateral)

      The objectives and basic principles underlying dispute settlement:
       1. The efficient and effective resolution of trade disputes.
       2. Securing compliance with WTO Covered Agreements.
       3. Preserving the  rights  and  obligations  of  members  under  WTO
          Covered Agreements.

      Panels and the Appellate Body are not tribunals. They produce reports,
      not judgments. Their  reports  have  to  be  adopted  by  the  Dispute
      Settlement Body to have any legal value,  as  the  Dispute  Settlement
      Board formally controls Dispute Settlements. However, reports  do  not
      create binding precedents. Members are the only  ones  who  may  adopt
      interpretations.
      Facts and Figures until June 2006 relating to dispute settlements  are
      as follows:


      • 346 disputes (requests for consultations).
      • 140 panels established (currently 8 are active).
      • 102 adopted panel reports.
      • 71 appeals notified.
      • 66 adopted Appellate Body reports.
      • 17 reports on implementation (12 appeals).
      • 24 arbitrations on reasonable period of time.
      • 7 authorisations on suspension of concessions.


      Tuesday, 27 June 2006
      Presenter: Mr. Jean – Pierre Lapalme, Counsellor,  WTO  Market  Access
      Division.
      Subject: Non- Agricultural Market Access (Nama)


      Nama 10  constitutes:  Argentina,  Venezuela,  Brazil,  Egypt,  India,
      Indonesia, Namibia, Philippines, South Africa and Tunisia
      Existing provisions of market access is that it is  regulated  through
      border measures most of the time.  Market access refers to  government
      imposed regulations or measures at the border. Market access should be
      predictable, making it binding, as well as non discriminatory in terms
      of national treatment and  no  less  favourable  in  respect  of  most
      favoured nation. Of importance is the fact that market  access  should
      grow, which is the reason for the round of negotiations.
      Generally quantitative restrictions are prohibited but can be  allowed
      under certain circumstances, for example  tariffs  and  non  –  tariff
      barriers.

      • Tariffs: these essentially refer to import tariffs (no taxes,  fees
        or charges). They comprise different  types  of  duties  namely  ad
        valorem  /specific/  compound  (+)  /mixed.   Tariffs   should   be
        transparent by means of schedules  where  duties  are  bound,  even
        though applied rates are often lower than bound rates. Bindings can
        be modified, that is concessions can be withdrawn. However this  is
        difficult  in  terms  of  procedure  and   costly   in   terms   of
        compensation.
      • Non –  tariff  barriers:  No  agreed  definition  and  includes  in
        principle all  measures  other  than  tariffs  used  to  protect  a
        domestic industry. It usually refers to the regulations imposed  by
        government and many of the non-tariff barrier measures imposed  are
        based on a legitimate goal, and protection of  the  environment  or
        national security.
      The current status of market access in  terms  of  Nama  is  that  the
      textiles and clothing sectors have returned to normal WTO rules  after
      ten years (guided under separate rules) of  agriculture  textiles  and
      clothing (ATC). This  transpired  after  the  Uruguay  Round.  Special
      provisions in terms of safeguards  have  been  made  with  respect  to
      China. Higher tariffs have been set in the following  sectors  namely,
      textiles  and  clothing,  leather,  rubber,  footwear,  travel  goods,
      transport equipment, fish and fish products.  There  is  currently  an
      increase of Free Trade Areas and Customs Union Agreements. So  too  in
      terms of duty free trade.

      As far as the Doha Negotiation goes, negotiations will aim  to  reduce
      or (as appropriate) eliminate  tariffs,  including  the  reduction  or
      elimination of tariff peaks, high tariffs  and  tariff  escalation  as
      well as  non-tariff  barriers.  Particularly  on  products  of  export
      interest  to  developing  countries.  Product   coverage   should   be
      comprehensive and without prior exclusions. Negotiations are to  fully
      take into  account  the  special  needs  and  interest  of  developing
      countries as well as the least developed countries, including the less
      than full reciprocity in reduction commitments.  Thus  the  modalities
      agreed to will  include  appropriate  studies  and  capacity  building
      measures  to  assist  least   developed   countries   to   effectively
      participate in the negotiations.


      Wednesday, 28 June 2006
      Presenter: Mr. Paulo Estivallet  de  Mesquita,  Counsellor,  Permanent
      Mission of Brazil


      South Africa has taken the lead amongst  the  Nama  10.  South  Africa
      faces some challenges as the leader as:
     1. Members have common interests.
     2. Members have to decide to  what  extent  each  one  goes  regarding
        negotiations.
     3. Some members are defensive, others offensive regarding Agriculture.
      So far no decision has been taken and  South  Africa  should  actually
      define the limits of what is acceptable. Negotiations  will  be  of  a
      high level nature as Ministers and Deputy Ministers will  be  present.
      The Nama 10 should stick together and the stepping up by  the  DTI  is
      commendable. It will be unfortunate if this round  fails  as  it  will
      leave developing nations in difficulty.
      Wednesday, 28 June 2006
      Presenter: Ambassador Ujal Singh Bhatia, Ambassador, Permanent Mission
      of India


      The Ambassador informed the members that India and  South  Africa  are
      good partners, especially with the inception of the India, Brazil, and
      South  African  (IBSA)  partnership.  This  group  has   given   these
      developing countries a strong voice. It is also a  regular  forum  for
      exchange. The Ambassador complemented the  South  African  Mission  in
      Geneva as well as South African Ministers  in  their  articulation  of
      issues and progress made. He added that it was 5 years since Doha  and
      it now was the crunch time as it is  the  final  year  for  finalising
      negotiations, and an understanding should be reached by end  July  for
      negotiations to  proceed.  The  negotiations  will  thus  feature  the
      developing round addressing the needs of the developing nations as the
      status of negotiations.


      Agriculture, which is a hot topic, will be featured as it  is  grossly
      distorted in terms of  the  support  farmers  from  developed  nations
      receive regarding their domestic products and the  subsidies  received
      for the exports. For example, sugar and cotton are subsidised up to  a
      third in the US and 68% in Switzerland  itself.  The  G20  negotiating
      team will  feature  as  a  main  priority.  It  is  important  because
      developed countries are reluctant to provide flexibilities. The second
      hot topic is industrial tariffs in terms of how much and what type  of
      flexibilities are offered to developing nations. Finality on  this  is
      still outstanding. Services will  also  be  discussed.  However  South
      Africa has not been very aggressive in this regard.

      The needs  of  developing  countries  have  to  be  addressed  because
      developing countries constitute  three  quarters  of  the  WTO,  which
      attests to the fact that they should be heard.


      Thursday, 29 June 2006
      WIPO Headquarters
      WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION (WIPO)


      Mr. Onyeama was grateful for the opportunity to host  the  delegation.
      He added that it was a pleasure to engage  policy  makers  instead  of
      technical experts continually. South Africa was very much involved  in
      WIPO and in terms of the African  Region  comprises  2  organisations,
      namely:


     1. African Regional Property Organisation  (English  speaking  African
        countries based in Harare)
     2. African Intellectual Property Organisation (based in Cameroon)


      These regional organisations were established, as there was a need  to
      harmonize the law of  creative  work.  The  following  are  challenges
      Africa faces:
      Granting patents in Africa are low, thus an incentive in the region is
      required.
      Underdevelopment is a real crisis, thus assisting and promoting Africa
      is an objective.
      It is therefore imperative that appropriate laws lead to  an  enabling
      environment and laws needed to assist  inventors  and  businesses  are
      required. African countries are therefore engaged to develop strategic
      plans regarding intellectual property. This was done by  developing  a
      profile of intellectual property by  means  of  surveys  submitted  to
      businesses,  government  institutions  universities  and  SMMEs.   The
      objective of data revealed why intellectual  property  was  not  being
      utilised. This information led to the creation up of approximately  40
      Committees to bring about training programmes and their aim was to use
      the data in order to develop a strategic  plan  for  each  country  to
      implement. The strategic goal would be inline with those of WIPO which
      essentially are the following:
      (a)   Promotion of an IP culture; on the one hand, to encourage
          creators and innovators to obtain, use and license IP rights and
          assets, and, on the other hand, to seek greater respect by the
          public for IP rights and assets. This will include making
          resources and expertise available to assist Member States in
          their own efforts to develop an IP culture through cooperation
          with governments, intergovernmental organizations and partners in
          private sectors.
      (b)   Development of balanced international IP laws which are:
          responsive to emerging needs; effective in encouraging innovation
          and creation; and sufficiently flexible to accommodate national
          policy objectives.
      (c)   Provision of consistent and customized assistance to Member
          States in developing national/regional IP systems, including
          legal infrastructure, institutional framework and human
          resources.
      (d)   Enhancement of global protection systems to make them more
          easily accessible and affordable to all stakeholders, in
          particular.
      (e)   Further streamlining of the management and administrative
          processes within WIPO to intensify efforts to achieve greater
          efficiency as well as the initiation of improved monitoring and
          evaluation systems to examine the achievement of expected
          results.
      The ultimate goal here is for government to  validate  and  adopt  the
      strategic plan as developed for them specifically. Mechanisms will  be
      put in place for its success in each country. Five countries have been
      selected for the audit and SA is one of them, even though South Africa
      did not complete it. It is anticipated that with the collaboration  of
      the Department of Science and Technology intellectual property will be
      developed  in  South  Africa.  What  is  foreseen   are   intellectual
      creations.


      WIPO  was  established  in  the  1970’s  with  183   members   as   an
      intergovernmental organisation. It served  the  purpose  of  promoting
      protection for members even though members were not obligated to  sign
      all treaties. It facilitates the patent process for  its  members  and
      promotes their services to industry and the private sector  alike.  It
      offers registration as well as renewal of trademarks  as  one  of  the
      major services. Also, mediation and arbitration, if necessary. 91%  of
      WIPO income is generated from services and 7% comes from members.  Its
      General Assembly meets once a year during September. WIPO employs  915
      staff members from 94 different countries.


      In  terms  of  Traditional   Creativity   and   Cultural   Expression,
      expressions of folklore also fall under the ambit of WIPO.  It  serves
      to offer protection against misappropriation, including misuse,  abuse
      and copying. Examples of these include the Hoodia plant  used  by  the
      San  people  and  Ndebele  Art.  Policies  have  been   developed   to
      investigate these types of matters, and institutions assisting in  the
      investigations include, UNESCO, The  African  WIPO  bodies  and  human
      rights organizations. Issues pertaining to these are  whether  or  not
      additional protection should be offered to these communities who  have
      founded the traditions, should there be communal rewards  offered  for
      the new copyrights  and  to  which  extent  is  originality  rewarded.
      Currently the programme is nine years old, a process  of  fact-finding
      is being pursued in SA regarding the San  and  the  Hoodia  plant,  an
      intergovernmental committee has been established and a draft has  been
      developed. It is now up to member states to respond by  31  July  2006
      regarding provisions in the draft. These all relate  to  the  kind  of
      outcome that will ensure a treaty or law as well as  the  content  and
      time frames.

      In terms of Intellectual Property (IP) and  new  technologies,  patent
      drafters  are  not  available  in  African  countries  or   developing
      countries. However South Africa has the capability to strategise  this
      policy. It is important  because  if  you  own  intellectual  property
      rights, royalties are paid. The challenge for the developing world  is
      then to use intellectual property; to make it do-able  and  brace  the
      intellectual  property  divides.  Intellectual  Property   should   be
      integrated with Science and Technology especially for South Africa  to
      advance on this. If you are the owner of intellectual property you are
      able to reap economic rewards.


      Trademarks  and  Industrial  design  is  registered  with  WIPO.   The
      Singapore Treaty related to this  has  recently  been  adopted.  South
      Africa is a member of the Standing Committee on trademarks. An example
      of this is the geographical agreement between South Africa and the  EU
      regarding “Champagne”. The Hague  Treaty  on  Industrial  Design  also
      governs industrial design.


      The WIPO has a World Wide Academy created in 1998. It offers  training
      for member states. During 2002 – 2005 it trained 921 participants. The
      policy development portion provides a forum  for  sharing  information
      and  training  to  government  officials,  decision   makers,   policy
      advisors, law enforcement officials, judges, professors, diplomats and
      the general public. 2949 people were  trained  in  policy  development
      during 2000 – 2005. A  program  for  diploma/degree  in  IP  has  been
      designed. WIPO – UNISA have embarked on a  joint  Diploma  in  IP  and
      these distance learning have  positive  outputs  such  as  being  cost
      effective, flexible, attracting large  audiences,  specialisation  and
      customisation, state of the art information  and  a  core  faculty  of
      tutors.

      Intellectual Property is definitely a wealth generator. For this to be
      effective law reforms and effective development need to  be  addressed
      and  these  are  contingent  upon  the  appropriate   development   of
      individual countries. The challenges  faced  here  are  the  types  of
      assistance needed by the WTO in terms of IP,  technological  transfers
      from developed to the developing nations and tangible decisions to  be
      taken.


      The Standing Committee on Copyrights and related rights  protects  the
      creator of the work. There is a steady increase in development in this
      area, nationally as well as in civil society. The potential of the  IP
      sector will be approximately $3 Trillion by 2020. One major  challenge
      faced here is the evolvement of digital – it gives  good  quality  but
      has increased piracy. It is estimated that between 400 000 –  600  000
      films are down loaded daily. To assist with this, a  sound  regulatory
      framework amongst members is envisaged with sound enforcement regimes.
      Education increased capacity  building  and  facilitating  trading  of
      rights through cost effective easy licensing practices. To this effect
      various Conventions have been signed.


      There has been recent awareness of  the  economic  value  of  patents.
      These have been displayed in civil society, the political  and  social
      arena. There has been an increase  in  the  demand  for  international
      patents and an increase in the quality of patents.  Patent  Agreements
      currently under review include the Patent  Co-op  Treaty,  Patent  Law
      Treaty and Draft Substantive Patent Law Treaty. Of importance  is  the
      alignment of organisations around this especially the WIPO/  WTO/  WHO
      and their aim is to produce a better quality of patents, an  efficient
      system and increasing the accessibility to the system.


      UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT (UNCTAD)
      Mrs. Lakshmi Puri, Director: International Trade Division.


      COMMODITIES


      Commodities metals in particular as well as minerals  and  energy  and
      agriculture play an important role in the SA  economy.  Four  clusters
      have been identified in this area:

       • UNCTAD in collaboration with the World Bank has  provided  support
         in setting up the Intergovernmental  Forum  on  Mining,  Minerals,
         Metals  and  Sustainable  development  –  an  extension   of   the
         initiative  started  at  the  2002  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
         Development (WSSD). The objective of the forum is to  enhance  and
         promote the contribution of the mining, minerals and metals sector
         to sustainable development. The forum provides governments with  a
         framework in which to discuss the opportunities provided by theses
         sectors and to respond to the challenges they pose. Thus  far  two
         partnerships were implemented, one in South Africa and  the  other
         one in Canada.


       • UNCTAD developed different tools to link commodity information and
         knowledge management as well as to monitor commodity market trends
         and prospects. The main aim of the programme is to enhance  global
         market transparency and provide  users  with  information  on  key
         commodity sectors. In this context, exchanges of  information  and
         data have, inter  alia  been  initiated  with  the  Department  of
         Minerals and Energy of South Africa. South Africa is  respectively
         the first and  second  world  leading  producer  of  platinum  and
         palladium and these sectors have been included in the coverage  of
         the programme. Other commodities such as nickel, zinc,  iron  ore,
         wheat  and  maize  are  also  available.  Furthermore,  additional
         sectors of interest to SA such as diamonds, gold and  copper  will
         be analysed and included in UNCTAD Infocomm  portal  in  the  near
         future.


       • UNCTAD has supported the development and the  functioning  of  the
         commodity futures exchanges and has  co-operated  with  the  South
         African Futures Exchange (Safex) which is  part  of  the  JSE.  In
         particular,  UNCTAD  and  Safex  organised  different  events   in
         collaboration with the Swiss Futures and Options  Association  and
         the Association of Future Markets (an association representing the
         interests of emerging exchanges) to facilitate the sharing of best
         practices as well as stimulate the information  flows  and  South-
         South collaboration.


       • In the domain  of  energy,  UNCTAD  has  collaborated  with  civil
         society in South Africa and particularly  with  the  national  oil
         company Petro SA as well as other major  players  like  Engen  and
         SASOL.  These  companies  have  been  substantive  and   financial
         contributors, by means of sponsorship to UNCTAD energy activities,
         including the  yearly  African  Oil  and  Gas  Trade  and  Finance
         Conference which is the principle experience-sharing forum on  the
         African  Energy  Industry.  The  role  of  South  Africa  in   the
         technology of gas to liquid and synthetic fuel has been one of the
         successful experiences discussed during  these  events.  Similarly
         UNCTAD has also co-operated with the banking sector,  namely  ABSA
         Bank and Pivot Capital Partners, through knowledge and experiences
         sharing in the field of  commodity  finance  as  these  banks  are
         considered to be pioneers in this area.


      BIOTRADE


       • In Southern Africa –  Botswana,  Malawi,  Namibia,  South  Africa,
         Zambia and Zimbabwe – the Bio Trade Facilitation Programme  (BTFP)
         is supporting Phyto  Trade  Africa  –  a  trade  association  with
         membership populated by private sector and NGO working on  product
         development of species native to Southern Africa.


       • UNCTAD has supported Phyto Trade with grants of over US$  300  000
         aimed at financing applied research and development,  as  well  as
         trade promotion efforts, product  development  and  market  access
         strategies. Co-operation is also taking place on the issue of  the
         EC Novel Food Regulation, which constitutes a serious  hurdle  for
         the kind of exports that Phyto Trade Africa aims at promoting.


       • As a result of the support of UNCTAD and other  funding  agencies,
         PhytoTrade  has  negotiated  various  business  partnerships  with
         companies in South Africa and France. It has submitted to  the  EC
         Commission a request for registration as Novel Food of an  African
         species. It is recognised by the Southern  African  Customs  Union
         (SADC) as a centre of excellence on biodiversity.  The  activities
         of the Phyto Trade are resulting in trade of  natural  ingredients
         which generates income for poor communities living in remote areas
         of Southern Africa.


      NEW and DYNAMIC AREAS


       • UNCTAD  in  collaboration  with  the  United  Nations  Development
         Programme (UNDP) African Trade Project will be  organising  a  two
         day  regional  conference  (19  –  20  July)   on   one   of   the
         technologically advanced new and dynamic sectors of  world  trade,
         namely the electrical and electronic sector.


       • The regional conference will bring together African policy  makers
         (Ministries of Trade and Industry/Finance) from 11 countries.  The
         countries  are  South  Africa,   Botswana,   Mauritius,   Lesotho,
         Swaziland,  Namibia,  Zambia,  Malawi,  Zimbabwe,  Mozambique  and
         Tanzania. SMME in the region, UNCTAD, Philips and donor  countries
         will discuss practical issues  related  to  the  participation  of
         Southern African countries in production/trade in  electrical  and
         the electronic sector.


       • The aims are to clarify policy  issues  that  governments  of  the
         region  have  to  tackle  to  improve  the  business   environment
         including regional co-operation.


       • Find potential opportunities for  Southern  African  countries  to
         establish business in light bulb production with Philips.



       • Improve, within a relatively short  time-frame,  supply  capacity,
         competitiveness and market access related to these products in the
         Southern African region.

      COMPETITION POLICY

       • A seminar for judges and public prosecutors on the enforcement  of
         competition law as well as a training course on investigation  and
         evidence gathering on competition cases will be offered.
       • A  draft  agreement  for  regional  competition  policy  has  been
         designed  for member states of the  South  African  Customs  Union
         (SACU) which was adopted by Ministers in 2005.

      TRADE NEGOTIATIONS


       • Assistance was provided to a number of national assessment studies
         undertaken in the context of the regional integration in the  SADC
         region.

      ANALYTIC TOOLS
       •  About  100  users  from  South  African  institutions,  including
         government, universities, and  research  institutes  are  actively
         benefiting from the database and simulation tools.



      UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT (UNCTAD)
      Mr. Kamran Kousari,  Special  Co-ordinator  for  Africa:  Division  on
      Globalisation and Development Strategies.
      Mr. Kousari explained that the Development of Africa has been  on  the
      Agenda of this  particular  office  since  1997.  A  report  (Economic
      development in Africa) is published annually.   Various  studies  have
      been  completed  regarding  Africa’s  economic/  trade  and  commodity
      status. Steadily agriculture has  decreased  and  this  obviously  has
      increasing financial implications. For Africa diversification has been
      very difficult. As a result, this  particular  office  instigated  the
      writing off of Africa’s debt, especially as Africa  had  paid  up  its
      debt minus the arrears on interest.


      An impact study done on Foreign  Direct  Investment  (FDI)  on  Africa
      showed that only 3% of total FDI are  received  in  the  minerals  and
      metals category. Restructuring in  terms  of  African  policy-  making
      should mean that national policies should be custom  made,  especially
      in Africa. Poverty  has  risen  in  recent  years  and  this  is  only
      prevalent in African nations. A report entitled “Aid  for  Africa”  is
      due to be available shortly. This report refers to the  UN  Millennium
      Goals for 2015 and doubling aid to Africa. This addresses debt  relief
      in Africa, the question remains when. In order to  reduce  poverty  by
      half in 2015, an 8% growth rate for all African countries is required.
      This is not foreseeable.  Aid  driven  growth  has  not  been  working
      either, such as in Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola. A change of  macro
      economic policy at national level is necessary to assist  in  positive
      growth  for  poverty  reduction.  Rebuilding  state  institutions   is
      imperative,  even  though  structural  adjustment  policies  destroyed
      institutions  across  Africa.  African  states  need  to  address  the
      following issues:
    • Diversification
    • Debt
    • Official Development Assistance (ODA)

      5.    CONCLUSIONS

      • Multilateral negotiations are imperative to government  departments
        and civil society. Thus training in this regard are  imperative  to
        members of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry. There  is
        a synergy between the departments of Foreign  Affairs,  Agriculture
        and Trade  and  Industry  and  Parliamentary  Committees  regarding
        multilateral relations.  Obtaining  clarity  on  the  stance  South
        Africa takes on WTO related issues will  assist  members  in  their
        understanding of their roles as policy makers.  The  South  African
        Parliament has the ability to assist with the work done at the  WTO
        and for this reason members should receive this type of training in
        exercising their duties more efficiently.
      • The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry  would  embark  on  a
        training programme with the WIPO Academy and follow–up training for
        members is required with the WIPO Academy.
