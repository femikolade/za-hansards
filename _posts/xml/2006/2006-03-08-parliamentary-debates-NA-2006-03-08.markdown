COMMITTEE REPORTS


National Assembly

1. Report of the Portfolio Committee  on  Correctional  Services  on  Annual
  Report and Financial Statements of the Department of Correctional Services
  for 2004/05:

The Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services, having considered the
Annual Report and Financial Statements of the Department of Correctional
Services for 2004/05, reports as follows:

A.    Introduction

      The Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services has scrutinised the
      Annual Report of the Department of Correctional Services for 2004/05,
      including the Report of the Auditor General.

      On 28 October 2005, the Committee met with the Deputy Minister of
      Correctional Services and representatives from the Department of
      Correctional Services (DCS) to discuss the 2004/05 Annual Report and
      Financial Statements of the DCS.

      In terms of the Annual Report, the Portfolio Committee notes the
      following key issues:

      1.    The Annual Report 2004/05 provides a clear overview of the
          functioning of the DCS for the financial year 2004/05.
      2.    Targets are clearly identified and reasons have, for the most
          part, been provided in instances where targets have not been met.
      3.    Key targets that were not met during this period, which include:


           a.    Underspending in the programme of Administration.
           b.    Number of assaults on prisoners and staff.
           c.    Number of unnatural deaths in prison.
           d.    The assessment and profile of offenders as part of its
               risk management strategy.
           e.    The training of 41 000 offenders as HIV/AIDS peer
               educators, volunteer care givers and lay counsellors.
           f.    Number of offenders participating in formal education
               programmes.
           g.    Number of offenders participating in skills development
               programmes.
           h.    Number of probationers and parolees per supervisory
               officer.
           i     Building/ Procurement of New Generation Prisons.
           j.    Number of prisons being renovated.

      In terms of the Report of the Auditor General the Portfolio Committee
      notes the following key issues:

       1. The Committee is concerned that once again the DCS has received a
          qualified audit opinion by the Auditor General.
       2. Key areas of concern include:


           a. Control Assets – Instead of zero balances reflected at the
              end of the financial year, significant balances were still
              reflected at year-end.
           b. Compliance with laws and regulations - The AG reports non-
              compliance by the Department with laws and regulations
              relating to overtime and the reporting of financial
              misconduct to the National Treasury and the AG.
           c. Internal audit - The Department did not submit quarterly
              reports as required by Treasury Regulation No. 3.2.7.
           d. Information systems audit - The AG reports that the
              Department’s security systems are inadequately protected and
              the system of internal control and data integrity could be
              seriously jeopardised due to a number of weaknesses in the
              system. The weaknesses exist because the Department either
              does not have standardised security procedures, or its
              security procedures are not comprehensive.
           e. Medical expenditure - The Department could not provide the AG
              with membership records that indicate Members’ number of
              dependants and benefit options for January, February and
              March 2005.

      Areas of Improvement

      The AG has concurred with the following areas of improvement
      (progress) reported by the accounting officer:

      1.    The AG reported no unauthorised expenditure by the Department in
          the 2004/05 financial year.
      2.    The Department has effected normal employer’s medical expense c
          ontribution (2/3) in line with the rest of the Public Service,
          with effect from 1 January 2005.
      3.    All regions and branches have developed action plans to improve
          compliance with internal control measures.
      4.    Performance contracts of senior managers have been reviewed to
          include risk management and compliance with policies. This should
          address the problem of lack of commitment by management to
          exercise internal control identified by the AG.
      5.    A Master Information System Plan will be completed soon and
          measures are taken to improve security and backup capacities.
      6.    The Department has started phasing in the 7-day working week
          system  substantially.
      7.    Measures are currently put in place to improve personnel well-
          being to reduce current levels of disability leave.

B.    Presentation by the Department on its Annual Report
      2004/5

      The DCS made a formal presentation on the Report to the Committee. The
      Annual Report of the Department is structured into five parts as per
      the guidelines of the Department of Public Service and Administration
      and Treasury Regulations i.e.


      Part 1:     General Information
      Part 2:     Programme performance
      Part 3:     Report of the Audit Committee
      Part 4:     Annual Financial Statements
      Part 5:     Human Resource Management

      The Committee was then briefed on Part 2 of the Annual Report, which
      is Programme performance. The Operational areas of the Department are
      as follows:
      a.    Administration.
       b. Incarceration.
       c. Rehabilitation.
       d. Corrections.
       e. Facilities management and capital works.

      1.    Administration

      The Department has done significant work in this programme during this
      financial year. The development and implementation of the White Paper
      contributed to the successes of this programme. The DCS has interacted
      with Treasury and other government departments in seeking solutions to
      the problem of overtime. Measures have been put in place to ensure
      that overtime is properly managed and an agreement has also been
      signed with the Trade Unions in respect of the movement from a 5-day
      to a 7-day establishment. Certain sections of the Correctional
      Services Act were promulgated in October 2004, except for sections
      that deal with children, as child matters will be addressed in the
      Child Justice Bill. Another highlight was the implementation of
      Section 76 and 77 of the Correctional Services Act and the appointment
      of community members to serve on the Correctional Supervision and
      Parole Boards. The DCS has made headway in exposing corruption amongst
      officials. The DCS has also launched its magazine, SA Corrections
      Today, as well as DCS logo during December 2004. 36 Centres of
      Excellence have been identified during the year and systems for the
      operation of the Centres have been put in place.


      2.    Security


      As a measure to improve security within the DCS, biometric security
      access systems will be installed in 60 Correctional Centres. This was
      prioritised for the bigger Correctional Centres, such as Pollsmoor and
      the Centres of Excellence. The DCS has almost completed the vetting of
      senior managers and will vett operational staff as well, but because
      the DCS is not directly responsible for the vetting of operational
      staff, backlogs are experienced. Marginal progress has also been made
      in curbing the number of escapes from facilities. Most escapes took
      place outside facilities at courts or hospitals. However escapes had
      become very violent. The DCS has also introduced a policy on Minimum
      Security Standards. A classification system for placement of inmates
      in facilities in terms of their security levels has also been
      developed.


      3.    Corrections


      This programme functioned mainly around the development of policies
      and programmes, which will be implemented this financial year
      (2005/6). A training manual for Unit Managers has also been developed.
      The Minister, Deputy Minister and the Commissioner participated in
      many Imbizos to promote corrections as a societal responsibility.


      4.    Care

      The DCS is registered by the Department of Health for compulsory
      community service by psychologists (within the DCS). 24 Hour access to
      comprehensive health services for inmates is also being provided. The
      DCS complies with providing a three-meal system within the required
      timeframes per day. Services, such as psychological, social work and
      spiritual care services, has increased during the year under review.
      In partnership with external service providers, 1086 inmates have been
      trained as HIV/AIDS peer educators.

      5.    Development

      A highlight in this programme is the accreditation of 7 Correctional
      Centres as training service providers in terms of the requirements of
      the National Skills Development Act.  The New Zealand government
      donated funds to the Department of Arts and Culture, which was handed
      over to the DCS to launch a project called arts and culture against
      crime in Kroonstad. INDLELA assisted the DCS with the number of
      programmes that were accredited. National Skills Fund provided funds
      for improving further learning of inmates. This assisted in the
      increase in the average number of offender work opportunities within
      the centres.

      6.    After Care


      This programme’s name will be changed to Social Reintegration. This
      programme facilitates the continued integration of inmates in
      communities and the work and appointments of the Parole Boards. 64% of
      parolees and probationers, who had absconded, had been traced. There
      is also a continued increase in the number of inmates provided with
      material assistance upon release to ensure re-integration.

      7.    Facilities


      During the previous year, the DCS realised it was unable to spend all
      capital funds, because the Department of Public Works does repair and
      maintenance work on DCS sites. Accordingly, a decision had been taken
      to start a programme of building the Departments’ own capacity. This
      was piloted at centres in the Western Cape and the Free State, where
      the inmates did renovations to the facilities. 245 inmates acquired
      critical training and practical knowledge transfer. The DPW upgraded
      10 Correctional facilities. A Transactional  Advisor has been
      appointed to conduct a feasibility study for a new Head Office.

      8.    Annual Financial Statements


      The Auditor General reported no unauthorised expenditure by the DCS in
      the 2004/5 financial year. The Department has effected normal
      employer’s medical expense contribution (two thirds) in line with the
      rest of the Public Service, with effect from 1 January 2005. The
      reason for implementing this only at 1 January 2005 is that the end of
      the Financial year of Medcor ends in December. The DCS determined
      benefits of officials at the end of December. The DCS has also managed
      a significant improvement in Asset Control and Management (98% of
      total assets of DCS was registered). There was also an improvement of
      IT contract management compared to the concern raised by the Auditor
      General in the previous financial year. The DCS also geared up its
      recruitment strategy to fill vacancies. Other issues of security will
      be addressed. The Minister has submitted a report to SCOPA as per the
      recommendation of the Portfolio Committee in which the Committee
      recommends that a report on Programme of Action of the DCS must be
      submitted. Two programmes of the DCS were qualified on two accounts in
      that the DCS, over a period of nine months, took a risk of subsidising
      Medcor, with the knowledge that at the end of the financial year its
      books will not balance. The DCS requested an extension from Treasury,
      which was granted. This was done because of the conversion from the
      financial management system (FMS) to the basic accounting system
      (BAS).

      Parliament appropriated R 8.4 Billion to the DCS in this financial
      year. The actual expenditure was appropriated at R 8.3 billion, which
      accounted for 98% of budget. The Department was not able to spend all
      funds in specific programmes because of the following reasons:
       i) over expenditure in certain programmes, because of inadequate
          control measures
      ii) filling of vacant posts
     iii) inability to work with Department of Public Works to spend capital
          budget.
      However, the DCS undertook alternative ways to spending these funds
          i.e.
      (i)   The DCS procured external services for the implementation of
          biometric access in 60 Correctional Centres, of which a
          substantial amount of work will be finalised during November of
          this year
      (ii)  The DCS also used funds, in consultation with Treasury, for the
          settlement of a tax liability the DCS had because of subsidies for
          medical aid cover of officials.

C.          Key areas of concern raised by the Committee


      1.    Administration

      Corruption: Whilst the Committee notes the Department’s efforts in
      rooting out corruption, it still exists especially in Correctional
      centres amongst inmates and staff. The Committee wanted to know how
      the Department plans to address this.

      The DCS stated that it has strengthened its investigative capacity and
      has identified a number of cases. At a Management Retreat held earlier
      this year, it was determined that there was a need to look at the
      culture of DCS. Whilst the DCS has a code of ethics, it was not clear
      whether officials are familiar with it. The DCS will also look at
      harnessing an organizational culture in support of the White Paper on
      Corrections as well as encourage the revitilisation of batho pele
      within the Department.


      The DCS is aware of misbehaviour and corruption in Correctional
      Facilities and will focus on the detection and follow up of such
      cases. The DCS also urged the Committee to bring such cases to their
      attention.


      The Committee wanted to ascertain what the DCS targeted official to
      inmate ratio is.


      The DCS reported that its Interim Promotion Policy would address the
      ratio of official to inmate. With the movement to a 7-day
      establishment the DCS aims to employ 8300 officials over the next
      three years, and has started this process already. The DCS aims to
      move staff to more supervisory positions, but this is often difficult
      as most of the facilities are old and are not conducive to
      Rehabilitation programmes.

      The Committee was also interested in the Retention strategy of the
      DCS, especially in retaining professionals such as psychologist,
      nurses, social workers and educationists. The Committee stated that
      whilst it is important that the DCS evaluate its services, the DCS has
      a responsibility to retain staff.


      The DCS stated that it was a very difficult process to retain
      professionals. In the past many professionals flocked to the DCS
      because of the overtime benefits, but with the phasing out of
      overtime, staff had started leaving the Department. The DCS has
      advertised positions for doctors on the level of deputy directors with
      a scarce skills allowance, but despite this, the DCS did not receive
      any applications. A discussion was held with Treasury to review these
      packages.


      Whilst the Department of Health advertised scarce skills allowance for
      nurses, the DCS could not register the same need, as scarce skills
      requires nurses to work in theatres. Not all Correctional Facilities
      are in rural areas, but the DCS is in the process of formulating
      policies around scarce skills and rural allowances with the
      Departments of Public Service and Administration and Public Works.
      The DCS upgraded the salary packages of Social Workers during this
      year as part of a retention strategy, aligning these with the rest of
      the Public Service.


      The Committee wanted to know how the DCS planned to boost the morale
      of staff, especially after the phasing in of the 7-day establishment
      and whether the DCS has an Employee Assistance Programme in place, as
      many Correctional Centres experience high numbers of absenteeism and
      sick leave.


      The DCS stated that it is concerned about the low morale amongst staff
      members. Recent research studies had shown that morale of lower level
      staff is not as high expected, especially since staff on these levels
      was mostly affected by the implementation of the 7-day establishment.
      The Department has indeed an Employee Assistance Programme as stated
      on page 30 of the Annual Report. A new project to intensify employee
      assistance has also been launched at the Drakenstein Correctional
      Centre.


      The Committee said that the Estimates of National Expenditure
      indicated that the DCS aimed at filling 1162 vacant positions and
      wanted to ascertain how the recent recruitment drive impact upon the
      realizing this target, addressing staff shortages and the
      implementation of the 7- day establishment.


      The Committee also noted that Recruitment within the DCS has been
      outsourced to external agencies and wanted to know if these agencies
      are being monitored and adhere to the government policies of
      Employment Equity.

      The Committee also wanted to know whether the DCS is managing
      Overtime.
      The DCS has spent R740 million on overtime in this financial year
      whilst an amount of R960 million was projected. The DCS was then in a
      position to advertise vacant positions, but because of the impact of
      overtime payments on the Departmental budget, the filling of these
      posts was delayed. During 2005, the DCS filled 4000 vacant positions.
      Even though the DCS was threatened with industrial action, it had to
      tackle the problem of Overtime and the positive results in its
      expenditure trends, is clearly visible.


      Many challenges are faced with the massive recruitment drive the DCS
      is undertaking, but the DCS reported that it receives regular reports
      from the Recruitment agencies in terms of progress and challenges
      faced.

      2.    Care


      The Committee wanted more clarity on the roll out of Anti - retroviral
      drugs within Correctional Facilities, especially in the light that a
      person receives these drugs in the area that he/she is coming from.
      This is often very difficult for inmates, as many of them are not
      detained in the areas they are coming from, but rather in the area the
      crime has been committed. What is being done in this regard?


      The DCS has difficulty in obtaining accreditation for the roll out of
      anti-retroviral drugs.

       3.   After Care

      The Committee noted that 40% of released inmates receives financial
      and material assistance upon release and wanted to know what kind of
      material assistance inmates are receiving.


      The DCS said that those inmates who participated in specific skills
      related training at Correctional Centres receive basic tools to assist
      them to operate or seek employment opportunities.


      The Committee stated that page 54 of the Annual Report mentions a
      number of work opportunities for offenders and wanted clarity as to
      whether this number represents offenders or work opportunities.


      The DCS responded that the Annual Report set out a target for job
      opportunities for offenders for that specific year. The number relates
      to those doing duty on any given day at a facility. The DCS managed to
      give job opportunities to 65 000 inmates and offered 303 technical
      programmes, but not all the programmes are accredited. However, there
      is an ongoing relationship between the DCS and certain SETAs (Sector
      Education and Training Authorities), FIETA (Forest Industries and
      Education Authorities) and MERSETA (Manufacturing, Engineering and
      Related Services Authories), who have accredited many of the DCS’
      programmes. The Department aimed at having all its centres and
      programmes accredited in future.

       4.   Facilities

      The Committee raised serious concerns with regard to Facilities and
      Facility management in the DCS. The DCS was asked to give more clarity
      on:


       a) poor progress made in the building and completion of the New
          Generation Prisons (NGs);
       b) the cost effectiveness of the NGs;
       c) the tender specifications for the NGPs; and
      (d)   what remedial steps have been taken to address the challenges
          faced.


      The DCS responded in writing that it had budgeted R350 million for
      construction of each one of the four planned New Generation Prisons.
      The construction work is planned to commence during the 2005/6
      financial year. In all cases except one, bulk earthworks were
      completed, i.e. Kimberley, Leeuwkop and Nigel. At the last site in
      Klerksdorp, the tendering process combined provision of both
      earthworks and construction.


      The processes of procuring construction for buildings are done by the
      Department of Public Works on behalf of all government departments,
      including the DCS. These processes include bulk works. Currently the
      DCS is aware that tenders were issued and are in various stages of
      adjudication. Therefore until the DPW has finalized the process of
      adjudication and awarded tenders to bidders, the matter remains
      confidential’.

      Pre predictions of the estimated total costs of the NGPs amounted to
      R463 million, but when tenders were put out the total costs came to
      R609 million per NGP. A number of factors contributed to this i.e. the
      increase in the price of steel. The DCS is engaging in discussions
      with the Department of Public Works and Treasury to try and come up
      with solutions. The reality is that contracts for these prisons had
      already been signed and breaching these contracts will impact on the
      DCS’ expenditure.


      The Committee also raised concerns with regard to the Private Prisons
      and asked what the cost differential was between the PPPs and the
      public prisons.


      The DCS confirmed that operating the PPPs is extremely expensive and
      that transaction advisors had been appointed to engage with the two
      PPPs in lowering their costs and to renegotiate a contract. The
      possibilities to reduce operational costs of these facilities are very
      limited. The proposals to recoup some of those expenses included
      increasing the capacity at these facilities, but this is still under
      negotiation.

       5.   Rehabilitation

      The Committee is aware that Cabinet has approved the White Paper on
      Corrections in February 2005 and is interested in whether the DCS has
      made any progress in implementing and prioritizing the aims of the
      White Paper, since rehabilitation is at the core of the DCS’
      priorities.


      The DCS responded that there is no reason why it cannot ensure
      effective rehabilitation and participation programmes. The DCS is in
      the process of harnessing organizational culture in support of the
      White Paper and rewards and recognition will be included in this
      process. The DCS wants to move away from a culture of locking and
      unlocking of facilities. Whilst the ratio of staff to inmates is often
      very high, it is important that rehabilitation is effected. The 7-day
      establishment would create better opportunities to capacitate the DCS
      in realizing this. More time would be spent on working with inmates
      than on administrative tasks.

       6.   Inmate Tracking System (ITS)
      The Committee is extremely dissatisfied with the implementation of the
      ITS, specifically at the Durban Westville Correctional Centre. The
      Committee was of the view that the ITS is for Security purposes, but
      at Durban Westville, it is merely used for identification purposes,
      i.e. fingerprints and photos. Of grave concern to the Committee is the
      lost equipment (8000 tags) that amounted to R7million, and the fact
      that the problem had not been addressed as this loss was reported in
      February this year. The readers placed on the outside walls of the
      facility are often damaged by lightning and these readers are not
      insured, whilst the total cost of this contract amounts to R28million.
      The Committee was informed that the straps are being cut off and
      replaced when detainees go to court and return to facilities. The cost
      per strap amounts to ±R3.50 and can escalate to R700.00 per day for
      200 offenders attending court daily. This is not a very viable
      exercise.


      The DCS responded in writing that ‘the initial cost for inmate
      tracking were estimated at R28 543 438.56. Today a total amount of R27
      193 951.24 has been paid to the Service Provider consistent with
      delivery of services. The remaining total of R1 349 487.32 would still
      be paid to the service provider for maintenance. Inmate tracking
      project is an IJS pilot project aimed at facilitating management and
      movement of Awaiting Trial Detainees (ATD) between facilities and the
      courts. It also facilitates easy location and placement of ATD within
      the holding facilities in the event where they are required for any
      specific reason. Phase one of the pilot project was conducted at
      Medium A of Durban Westville and phase two at the Johannesburg
      management area.
      The project aimed to introduce new technologies in the administration
      of awaiting trial detainees and therefore required strong management
      and focused management change processes. In the case of Medium A of
      Durban Westville both management and change management processes,
      which are critical to the successes of similar projects, were proved
      to have been ineffective. As a result of the staff resistance and
      management incapacity, management of the project resulted in loss of
      tags that compromised the efficiency of the system. The DCS is
      instituting measures to investigate the total impact that poor
      management and ineffective change management process has on the
      project at Durban Westville. The results of the investigation should
      reveal the actual financial loss, the causes of the loss and make
      recommendations of the action taken.

      The Commissioner has approved the appointment of the Evaluation
      Committee whose main aim will be to assess the value of the pilot
      project in both centres and recommend to the IJS whether or not the
      pilot was a success and required to be extended to other management
      areas.


      In terms of the management of the pilot, this project is a project of
      the IJS and the DCS was appointed as the lead department. Accordingly,
      in terms of institutional management of the project, a project manager
      and a Task Team were appointed for effective implementation.
      Accountability for the success of the project is the sole
      responsibility of the Commissioner of Correctional Services.

       7.   Corrections

      The Committee agrees that the high number of ATDs is not the
      responsibility of the DCS alone. The Committee reported that the
      2004/5 Annual Report of the Inspecting Judge reports 9311 ATD’s with
      unpaid bail of less than R1000.00 in Correctional centres. Section 62
      (f) of the Criminal Procedure Act is clearly not implemented and yet
      the Correctional Services Act empowers a Head of Prison to act in this
      regard. What is the DCS doing to ensure the implementation of the
      above-mentioned Acts?


      The Committee is also concerned with the low number of offenders on
      parole and in those sentenced to community corrections.


      The Deputy Minister stated petty criminals often become real criminals
      in the current system. Deterrents need to be brought into the system.
      If this was not possible via the Integrated Justice system, it was
      necessary to start driving the process by setting achievable goals. A
      sentencing framework which supported the minimum sentencing framework
      should be drafted that clearly indicates that a person could not go to
      prison for certain offences. More funds need to be invested in
      community corrections, in order for Magistrates and Judges to sentence
      offenders to community corrections. Harsh sentencing frameworks do not
      reduce crime.

       8.   Auditor General’s Report (AG) and SCOPA Resolutions

      The Committee noted that a substantial amount of staff debt is due and
      requested clarity on the matter. The AG’s report also reflects that
      the DCS has various shortcomings with internal controls despite the
      fact that the accounting officer has a documented system of internal
      control in place.

      The Committee wanted to know what progress has been made in terms of
      SCOPA’s resolutions. At a SCOPA meeting on 10 November 2004, the AG
      noted that taxes were due by the DCS on medical aid contributions in
      excess of R341million. Issues of information technology have also not
      been resolved.


      The DCS responded both verbally and in writing to the above matters. A
      tax liability of R273 821 176.00 was settled by the DCS with the South
      African Receiver of Revenue. It should be noted that at the time of
      settlement, the SARS waived DCS liability in respect of penalties and
      interest to the value of R67 390 281.00. The DCS has ensured
      compliance with Schedule 7 of the Income Tax Act of 1962 since January
      2005.


      Coordination with SITA and Service Level Agreements


      The DCS has monthly meetings with SITA to co-ordinate SITA/DCS
      activities and the Service Level Agreement. The senior manager of the
      two organizations agreed to institutionalize Quarterly Executive
      Meetings to address strategic issues and resolve bottlenecks.


      The DCS has a Service Level Agreement with SITA on mandatory Services,
      as per the SITA Act. This agreement is renewed on an annual basis.
      However, in other instances the department sources services from
      suppliers that participate in existing contracts with SITA. The SITA
      policy obliges individual departments to negotiate their own SLA when
      entering in these specific contracts. The Department does have the
      required Service Level Agreements applicable in these cases. As
      required by the SITA Act, the department has a Business Agreement with
      SITA and this agreement is renewable every second year. The current
      agreement was renewed this year.

       IT and Disaster Recovery Plan
      The Operational Plan has scheduled completion of the IT Plan
      containing Disaster Recovery Plan for January 2006. There is already
      an off- site disaster recovery site that may only need upgrading.

      The monies owed in terms of staff debt are due to the fact that many
      staff members leave the organization without the necessary deductions
      made. The huge amount of monies owed is due to the Judge White
      Commission cases where a lot of irregular promotions took place
      especially in the Eastern Cape and the former Ciskei. These promotions
      had to be rectified and the DCS had to find ways of recovering these
      monies.

D.    Committee observations and recommendations

      The Committee, having considered the Annual Report of the Department,
      wishes to make the following observations and recommendations:

      1.    Administration

          a.     The Committee recommends that the DCS report back to
              Parliament on progress made with regard to its Retention
              Strategy and Recruitment drive.
           b. The Committee is aware that the DCS will implement its
              Promotion Policy by November 2005 and requests that the
              Committee be kept abreast of all developments in this regard.


          c.     The Committee recommends that the DCS report back on the
              impact the Jali Commission’s report will have on DCS’
              controls and governance.
          d.     The Committee requests the DCS to provide information on
              the Recruitment agencies in terms of implementing Government
              policy and its feasibility.
          e.     The Committee recommends that the DCS’ magazine called SA
              Corrections Today, contain information on all policies and
              programmes the DCS intends implementing.
          f.     The Committee also requests a report on the Centres of
              Excellence and their operation.


      2.    Security

          a.     The Committee requests a detailed report on the
               implementation of the biometric access systems, which will
               be implemented at the seven biggest Correctional centres as
               well as at the Centres of Excellence.
          b.     The Committee notes the marginal progress that has been
               made in terms of curbing escapes, but recommends that the
               DCS implement measures to curb escapes en route to courts
               and hospitals.

      3.    Corrections

          a.     The Committee recommends that the DCS involves members of
               the Committee in its Imbizos as the Committee is committed
               to playing a role in educating communities on the
               reintegration of offenders after release.
               The Committee recommends that a detailed report be provided
               on the DCS’ assessment and profile tools of inmates and how
               this has succeeded.
          b.     The Committee recommends that the DCS report back on the
               impact and efficacy of the parole system after the
               appointment of the new Correctional Supervision Parole
               Boards.
            c. The DCS must also take the initiative in reducing
               overcrowding by ensuring that there are no awaiting trial
               detainees within prison who do not need to be there.
            d. The Portfolio Committee requests a report back from the DCS
               on the results of such an exercise.

      4.    Care

          The Committee recommends that the DCS speedily obtain
          accreditation for the roll out of anti-retroviral drugs at
          Correctional Centres and report back on its successes and
          challenges.


      5.    After Care


          The Committee recommends that more stringent measures be taken
          with regard to the role community supervision officers play in the
          release and reintegration of offenders.

       6. Development


              a. The Committee requests that the DCS speedily obtain
                 accreditation for all programmes and courses at
                 Correctional centers as these play a major role in seeking
                 employment after the release of offenders.
              b. The Committee recommends that the DCS look at measures and
                 or policies to use its own capacity in building and
                 maintenance projects.


      7.    Facilities


           a. The Committee recommends that the DCS reports back upon the
              finalisation of procurement projects in respect of the New
              Generation Prisons.
          b.      The Committee recommends that feasibility studies be done
              in respect of the building of additional New Generation
              Prisons, which will be situated in Port Shepstone, East
              London, Allandale and Upington and that this be submitted to
              the Committee for its consideration and recommendation.
           c. The Committee recommends that it be provided with the report
              of the transaction advisors who are negotiating the contract
              and costs of the Private Prisons.
           d. The Committee strongly recommends that the DCS considers
              placing juvenile offenders in the Private Prisons, as it is
              more conducive to rehabilitation and education of juveniles.
              It is senseless to place adult offenders with long sentences
              in these facilities.


      8.    Inmate Tracking System


          a.     The Committee requests the DCS to present before it the
              findings of the investigation into the Inmate Tracking System
              as well as the report of the evaluation committee.
          b.     The Committee further recommends that strong action be
              taken against those found guilty, negligent or irresponsible
              in the handling and management of the equipment.
          c.     The Committee recommends that the situation at the Durban
              Westville prison be attended to and progress made be reported
              to the Committee.
          d.     The Committee also recommends that any projects, similar
              to inmate tracking and or electronic monitoring be tabled
              before the Committee for its consideration and
              recommendation.

Conclusion

      The Committee noted that the Annual Report contains a lot of
      unnecessary information. Many of the pages have photographs rather
      than information. The Committee is of the opinion that it is very
      difficult to compare the Annual Report with the Strategic Plan of the
      DCS. What are noted as key departmental objectives in the Strategic
      Plan is reflected in the Annual Report as outputs or indicators. This
      makes it difficult to compare plans against progress and the format
      does not reflect accountability and transparency. The Annual report
      also does not reflect end results and impact of projects and audits
      undertaken by the DCS. The Annual Report of 2004/5 is merely a “cut
      and paste” exercise.


      The Committee commends the DCS on successes attained during the
      2004/05 financial year and recommends that concrete steps are taken to
      address areas, which have been identified as problematic, particularly
      those areas of financial management identified as concerns by the
      Auditor General.
