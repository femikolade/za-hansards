FRIDAY, 2 JUNE 2006
                                    ____


                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

                                    ____

The House met at 09:03.

The House Chairperson Mr G Q M Doidge took the Chair and requested members
to observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.


                              NOTICES OF MOTION


Mr S L TSENOLI: Chairperson, on the next sitting day of the House, I shall
move:

   That the House notes –


   (1)      the heroic sacrifices made by Chief Bambatha Kamancinza in
        defence of the rights of African people;


    (2)     that this year marks the centenary of the Bambatha uprising; and
    (3)     that the ANC therefore moves that this House debates the
        significance of the Bambatha uprising to land restitution,
        distribution and economic emancipation of the African people.
[Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Hon Tsenoli, that is a notice of
motion. There was an appeal from my left for a notice of motion.
[Interjections.] I’m coming to you. Are we clear? Hon Spies?

Mr W D SPIES: Chair, this is also a notice of motion. Chairperson, I hereby
give notice that, on the next sitting day of the House, that I shall move:


  That this House notes that since –


      1) the Employment Equity Act has now been in operation for more than
         eight years, since 1998;


   (2)      the unintended consequences of the implementation of the
         measures prescribed in the Act, such as large-scale
         impoverishment, alienation and emigration of South Africans from
         the so-called non-designated groups, and increasing discrimination
         by employers against employees within the so-called designated
         group, based on alleged degrees of former disadvantagement, as was
         illustrated by the recent argument by Eskom at the arbitration
         proceedings of a certain Mr Christiaans, are becoming more
         apparent by the day; and


   (3)      recent market research has shown that the majority of South
         Africans, including ANC members, support the phasing out of
         affirmative action measures in as far as this applies to young
         South Africans;


The FF Plus hereby gives notice that it will move for a debate in the House
on the negotiation and adoption of a code of good practice for affirmative
action as proposed by the trade union, Solidarity, at a meeting held in
Gauteng on 23 May 2006.

Thank you.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move tomorrow
in the House:

   That the House notes that -


     1) when members put questions to Ministers on the Order Paper,
        Ministers are duty bound to give replies;
     2) I put a question, question 196, on the Order Paper to the Minister
        of Justice for reply on 17 March 2006;


     3) the Minister has however, not answered the question nor tendered an
        explanation as to why she has not answered the question;

   4) the question is now overdue by two and a half months; and


   (5)      I bring this matter to the attention of the House and request
        that the House, in exercising its oversight function, sanctions the
        Minister for not doing her duty.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: May I enquire who will be
presiding when Mr Van der Merwe moves this motion tomorrow?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): I take it is a notice of motion,
Mr Van der Merwe, and not specifically for tomorrow, because you’ll be
sitting alone here. [Laughter.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: I was hoping that Mr Jeffery would be chairing
tomorrow! [Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): Order! That will be accepted as a
notice of motion. Yes, hon member?

Mrs L MALONEY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House, I shall move:


    That this House –


    (1)     notes the heroism of and sacrifices made by South African women
        in the struggle for national and social emancipation;


    (2)     further notes that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the
        historic march of the women of South Africa to the Union Buildings
        in Pretoria; and


    (3)     notes that I hereby give notice on behalf of the ANC that this
        House should debate the significance of the role of women in the
        struggle for a united, democratic, nonsexist, nonracial and
        prosperous South Africa.

Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, the IFP was dismayed to learn that 22 500 teachers
left the teaching profession in South Africa last year. Clearly, this is a
disastrous development for an education system that is already
understaffed, underresourced and under tremendous pressure to produce
quality education and quality learners. This development is compounded by
the fact that currently only 8 000 newly qualified teachers enter the
system every year.
Clearly, here we are dealing with a net loss of teachers of alarming
proportions. It is estimated that South Africa will, in future years,
require ...
The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, on a point of
order: Is this a statement or a notice?

Ms S C VOS: It’s a member’s statement, sorry.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): No, we are still taking notices of
motion.

I am not sure whether we have dealt with notices of motion. I know we are
off to a bit of a slow start this morning. Before I move on, I just want to
draw the attention of members to notices of motion.

They are meant to be succinct and not actually pre-empt the debate. You
have an opportunity for statements, so if we can just keep to that
agreement that we have amongst the Whips that notices of motion should be
succinct. Let us move on to motions without notice.


                           EARTHQUAKE IN INDONESIA


                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move without
notice -

  That the House –


  (1) notes


        (a) the great tragedy that befell the people of Indonesia on
              Saturday, 27 May 2006, when an earthquake measuring 6.3 on
              the Richter scale hit the country; and


        (b) that more than 5 000 people died as a result of the earthquake,
              more than 20 000 people were injured, and 130 000 people were
              left homeless, of whom 40% are children;


    2) conveys its condolences to the government and people of Indonesia;
       and


    3) expresses its gratitude to the United Nations, countries, private
       organisations and individuals who have made contributions to assist
       the victims.


  Thank you.


  Agreed to.


                          DEATH OF EUGENE SCHAEFER


                             (Draft Resolution)

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Chairperson, I hereby move without
notice:


  That this House –


  (1) expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Mrs Eugene
       Schaefer, aged 72, who was brutally murdered in her home on Tuesday,
       and robbed of a mere cellphone;


  (2) recognises with great regret that this is not an unusual event, but
       part of a deeply disturbing vortex of violence which is engulfing us
       on a daily basis;

  (3) notes that Mrs Shaefer was murdered in Parys, the town in the northern
       Free State where I grew up and which is also in my constituency;


  (4) notes that her daughter Toni and son-in-law, Soli Philander, are my
       neighbours in Cape Town;


  (5) notes that less than a month ago, Soli amused us here in Parliament
       with his view of members of the Cabinet, and showed himself to be as
       much a philosopher as a comedian; and


  (6) simultaneously notes that he showed his commitment to ending violence
       by actively participating in the ``Silence the Violence’’ march in
       the Peninsula at that time; and
I therefore implore this House to recognise that we are all enmeshed in
these events and need to take personal responsibility for changing the
direction of this tide of brutality by giving moral guidance and insuring
meaningful action.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chair, could I just rise on a
point of order?

I think we would obviously be very sympathetic to the matters raised by Ms
Botha in her motion without notice. However, we have not had sight of this
and, therefore, we request that it stand over so that we could consider it.

Mnr W P DOMAN: Agb Voorsitter,  ons  as  swepery  het  vir  die  ANC  gister
daarvan kennis gegee so dit het miskien nie reg uitgekom  nie.  Ek  wil  dit
net op rekord stel  dat  ons  probeer  het  om  volgens  die  reëls  en  die
ooreenkoms dit af te handel. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Hon Chairperson, we as the whippery gave the ANC notice of
this yesterday, so maybe it was not conveyed in the right manner. I want to
mention for the record that we tried to deal with it according to the rules
and the agreement.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mr G Q M Doidge): I am not going to put the question
on this motion without notice, because there is also some editing that I
think needs to be applied. There was an issue raised in the motion about, I
think, the hon member ``implores the House’’. So, I think if we can just
look at that. I won’t put the question, but I will leave it to the Table to
advise the member on how to resolve the issue between the Whips as well as
on some editorial problems that need to be rectified.


                   WEEK FOR PROTECTION OF CHILDREN’SRIGHTS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnu B Z ZULU (ANC): Sihlalo, uhulumeni wezwe lethu oholwa umbutho wesizwe,
i-African National Congress, uqoke leli sonto esikulo njengelokuvikelwa
kwabantwana bethu namalungelo abo. UMthetho weNhlangano yeZizwe nathi
esivumelana nawo uthi abantwana, njengawo wonke umuntu, banamalungelo nabo
okufanele ukuba ahlonishwe. NoMthethosisekelo wethu uyakuqinisekisa lokhu.

Mhla zinga-30 kuNhlaba kuwona lonyaka, iPhini likaNgqongqoshe wezokuPhepha,
umhlonishwa u-Susan Shabangu, uqalise ngokusemthethweni umkhankaso wokuthi
sibambisane sonke singumphakathi ekulweni nobunswelaboya obenziwa
kubantwana bethu. Siyi-African Nation Congress siwusekela kakhulu
lomkhankaso. Sithi-ke kubo bonke abantu bakithi asibambisaneni, sivikele
abantwana bethu, sibakhulise kahle, sibafundise futhi sibakhe babe ngabantu
bakusasa abaqotho. (Translation of isiZulu member’s statement follows.)

[Mr B Z ZULU (ANC): Chairperson, the national government led by the African
National Congress has chosen this week as the week for protection of
children’s rights. The United Nations convention that we agree with also
states that children, like everybody, also have rights that have to be
respected and our Constitution ensures this.

On 30th May 2006, the Deputy Minister for Safety and Security Susan
Shabangu officially started the campaign of working together as a community
to fight the abuse of our children. As the African National Congress we
firmly support this campaign. We therefore say to all our people: Let us
work together, protect our children, nurture them well, teach them and
mould them to be faithful future citizens.]


               AWARDING OF TENDER CONTRACTS: CITY OF CAPE TOWN


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr W P DOMAN (DA): Chair, another scandal and example of mismanagement by
the former ANC-led city council of Cape Town has been exposed. Hundreds of
millions of rands worth of tenders awarded by the ANC Executive Mayoral
Committee of Nomaindia Mfeketo behind closed doors after 17 June 2004, have
been found by the National Treasury and legal experts of the State Law
Advisor to be unconstitutional and in breach of national legislation.

The SA Federation of Civil Engineering contractors said a lot of money was
wasted on appeals, to no avail, and that their legal advice was that it was
beyond Mfeketo’s legal powers to amend the procurement requirements to
insert that all tenders should have at least 30% BEE ownership before an
award could be considered.

Die koalisie-regering van die DA-Uitvoerende Burgermeester Helen Zille moet
gelukgewens word dat hulle hierdie uitsluitingsbeleid weer reggestel het in
‘n voorkeurbeleid waarin tenders weer op ‘n puntestelsel oorweeg sal word
met bykomende punte vir swart eienaarskap sodat histories-benadeelde
individue steeds op ‘n verantwoordelike wyse bemagtig kan word sonder om
ander tenderaars op ‘n rassegrondslag uit te sluit.

Is hierdie ‘n rede waarom Dr Wallace Mgoqi so graag wou vashou aan sy
posisie as munisipale besutuurder?

Die DA doen ‘n beroep op alle ANC-beheerde munisipaliteite on hulle
voorkeurbeleid volgens Tesourievoorskrif te bepaal. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[The coalition government of the DA’s Executive Mayor, Helen Zille, should
be congratulated on having changed this policy of exclusion into a
preferential policy whereby tenders will once again be considered according
to a points system, with bonus points for black ownership so that
historically disadvantaged individuals may still be empowered in a
responsible manner without the exclusion of other interested parties on
racial grounds.

Was this the reason why Dr Wallace Mgoqi was so keen to hang on to his
position as municipal manager?

The DA appeals to all ANC-controlled municipalities to determine their
preferential policies in accordance with Treasury regulations.]


              RETAINING OF TEACHERS AND ATTRACTING NEW ENTRANTS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms S C VOS (IFP): Chairperson, once again today the IFP notes with dismay
the fact that 22 500 teachers left the teaching profession in South Africa
last year. Clearly, this is a disastrous development for an education
system that is already understaffed, underresourced and under tremendous
pressure to produce quality education and quality learners.

This development is compounded by the fact that currently only about 8 000
newly qualified teachers are entering the system every year. Clearly, we
are dealing here with a net loss of teachers of alarming proportions.

It is estimated that South Africa would in future require at least 30 000
new teachers every year just to maintain the number required by the
education system. We produce barely a quarter of that number at the moment.

Drastic and urgent action is clearly required to retain skilled teachers in
the profession and to launch new training programmes to more rapidly
increase the supply of new teachers. If we do not take immediate action our
education system, with the best will in the world, is bound to fail to
provide enough quality learners to satisfy the demands of the job market or
eliminate the overall skills shortage.

       YOUTH MONTH CELEBRATIONS: 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF STUDENT UPRISINGS

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms T V TOBIAS (ANC): Chairperson, today marks the beginning of Youth Month,
and this year’s June 16 celebrations will be launched on Sunday here in
Cape Town, kwaLanga, and this marks the 30th anniversary of the Soweto and
other related student uprisings.
We, as the ANC Youth League, are still committed to the national democratic
revolution and will deepen the hegemony of the national liberation movement
and continue to champion it with interest. This year’s focus will be on
deepening youth participation to fight poverty and create jobs. This
objective is based on the fact that we need to deepen the political
consciousness of the South African youth and mobilise them to participate
in democracy and fighting youth unemployment.

We will continue with our campaign to ensure that young people access
decent and permanent jobs and therefore it is important to the youth of our
country to participate in programmes initiated by our organisation. As they
heed this call, they must understand that: The ANC lives! The ANC leads!


                       SALARIES OF MUNICIPAL MANAGERS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr P J GROENEWALD (VF PLUS): Agb Voorsitter, die VF Plus het sedert 1998
deurentyd sy kommer uitgespreek oor die buitensporige hoë salarisse van
munisipale bestuurders. Die VF Plus het ook herhaaldelik ‘n beroep op die
regering en die Ministers gemoeid met plaaslike regering gedoen om
beperkings te plaas op salarisse van hierdie bestuurders.

Dit is onaanvaarbaar dat ‘n munisipale bestuurder van ‘n plaaslike regering
soos Matlosane in Klerksdorp ‘n salaris ontvang wat gelykstaande is aan dié
van ‘n Minister, en ‘n munisipale bestuurder van ‘n metroraad soos
byvoorbeeld Johannesburg, ‘n salaris ontvang wat selfs meer is as dié van
die President van die land.

Dit is die belastingsbetaler wat moet opdop vir hierdie salarisse. Die VF
Plus het in Begrotingsdebatte, debatte van die stadsrode en in amptelike
vrae aan die Parlement aan die betrokke Ministers gevra dat die regering
moet ingryp.

In die lig hiervan verwelkom die VF Plus die aankondiging van  die  Minister
dat daar nou ingegryp  word  en  skale  nou  gepubliseer  sal  word  in  die
Staatskoerant vir kommentaar en implementering.  Die  VF  Plus  sal  hierdie
skale ondersoek om te verseker dat daar nie steeds ‘n onbillike las  op  die
belastingbetaler  geplaas  word  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member’s
statement follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD (FF PLUS): Hon Chairperson, since 1998 the  FF  Plus  has
consistently raised its concern about  the  exorbitantly  high  salaries  of
municipal managers. The FF Plus has also repeatedly appealed  to  government
and the Ministers concerned with local government to place  restrictions  on
the salaries of these managers.
It is unacceptable that a  municipal  manager  of  a  local  authority  like
Matlosane in Klerksdorp receives a salary equal to that of a  Minister,  and
that a municipal manager of  a  metro  council,  for  example  Johannesburg,
receives a salary that is even higher than that  of  the  President  of  the
country.

It is the taxpayers who have to cough up for these  salaries.  The  FF  Plus
has in budget debates,  city  council  debates  and  official  questions  to
Parliament asked the Ministers concerned for government intervention.

In light of this, the FF Plus welcomes  the  announcement  by  the  Minister
that they are now going to intervene and that scales will now  be  published
in the Gazette for comments and implementation. The  FF  Plus  will  examine
these scales to ensure that  an  unreasonable  burden  is  not  still  being
placed on the taxpayers.]


                SECRET PROFITS BY PENSION FUND ADMINISTRATORS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms C C SEPTEMBER (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC notes with concern the recent
reports about secret profits being earned from bulking and other practices
by administrators of pension funds.

One instance where an administrator makes a secret profit is where the
administrator bulks the funds under its administration and negotiates a
higher rate of interest to be paid on the funds but then takes some of
these benefits for itself without disclosing this practice to or getting
explicit approval from the pension fund. This is tantamount to taking away
benefits from pension fund members without anyone’s knowledge or approval.

Pension fund administrators operate in terms of a licence from the
Registrar of Pension Funds and must observe all the conditions and
obligations that come with such a right to operate. The ANC therefore calls
for this practice and any other form of secret profits to be investigated
thoroughly in order to maintain public confidence in the retirement fund
industry.

In this respect, public hearings in Parliament into these unlawful
practices, are justified and in the public interest. I thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]


              INCORPORATION OF SCORPIONS INTO SA POLICE SERVICE


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M DIKO (UIF): Chairperson, the UIF noted with interest the submission to
President Thabo Mbeki of the final report of the Khamphephe commission of
inquiry into the mandate and the location of the Scorpions. Clearly, the
future home of the Scorpions is uncertain until President Mbeki makes a
decision.

Sadly, the whole saga has occurred when the Scorpions had achieved a
conviction rate of higher than 90% in comparison with the 8% rate achieved
by the police’s Serious and Violent Crimes Unit.

We are waiting for these findings at a time when the whole world is
expecting our country to be exemplary, especially in Africa, and take the
leading role as far as the fight against corruption is concerned.

The UIF calls on President Mbeki not to incorporate this elite crime-
busting unit into the SA Police Service, as this may be a setback to our
commitment to fight corruption. South Africa cannot afford to take two
steps forward and then take 15 steps backwards.

                        FRAUDULENT CLAIMS BY DR RATH

                            (Member’s Statement)

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD (DA): Chair, the DA wishes to point out to this House
that despite the fact that the so-called star patients of Aids dissident
Matthias Rath died here in Cape Town, no investigation has ever been
undertaken into the dealings of this man. In Europe and America he is being
prohibited from exploiting the desperation of the sick by authorities that
recognise the danger he poses.

But here in South Africa, despite overwhelming scientific evidence of the
fallacy of Rath’s claims, the Minister of Health repeatedly refuses to
condemn him or sanction any action against him. Rath should long ago have
been prohibited from making fraudulent claims and his bogus health clinic
should have been shut down.

On his website he has moved on from allegedly curing the world of all heart
disease and cancer and Aids and now claims that his vitamins cure bird flu
and tuberculosis too. As usual no clinical trials have ever been undertaken
and no recognised medical professional buys into his ravings except, it
seems, the South African Minister of Health.

The reason why Rath’s so-called scientific studies are gathering dust in
laboratories is because no self-respecting scientist would deign to give
them a second glance. His partners, SANCO, claim that ARVs are irrelevant
and that the citizens should rise up against those who insist that they be
made available to Aids patients.

The fact that Rath has spread his tentacles to the east coast, where SANCO
parades its nonsense about global conspiracies, should be sounding warning
bells for those who quietly left this country for more gullible climes. We
truly have sufficient Aids charlatans of our own without having to import
them from Germany.


             REGIONAL MINI-PARLIAMENT IN ENNERDALE, JOHANNESBURG


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr S J NJIKELANA (ANC): Chairperson, on 12 May 2006 a regional mini-
parliament was held in Ennerdale in the Deep South area, south of
Johannesburg. In this mini-parliament, which has been actively convening
for the past few years, the ten years of existence of our beloved country’s
democratic Constitution was celebrated.

This session was attended by 10 learners from Orange Farm, Poortjie, Thula
Mntwana, Ennerdale, Vlakfontein and Lenasia. There were also youth from the
Hindu, Tamil, Islam and Christian faiths, not to mention the presence and
participation of youth who were HIV-positive and also orphans - a clear
expression of the socio-economic reality in the Deep South.

I want to thank all those who have made the event a success, especially Mr
Tony Reeves - the brains behind, engineer and architect of this project -
Mrs Sally Rabichand, Bongani Majosi and Gavin Machete. I also want to
express my extreme gratitude to the Speaker of this House, hon Baleka
Mbete, for gracing this session.

I therefore call upon all the other hon members to consider such projects
favourably in their own areas. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

                          ELECTION OF FEMALE MAYORS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr M JOHNSON (ANC): Chairperson, the ANC welcomes the inauguration of the
first female mayors in the metros and other districts. Examples include the
Nelson Mandela Metro’s Ms Nondumiso Mapazi, Tshwane Metro’s Gwen Ramokgopa
and Buffalo City’s Zintle Peter, among others. This development heralds a
new move in gender equity for the municipalities and the country as a
whole.

One of the great leaders and statesmen, Comrade Samora Machel, said in
March 1973:

   The emancipation of women is not an act of charity, the result of a
   humanitarian or compassionate attitude. The liberation of women is a
   fundamental necessity for the revolution, the guarantee of its continuity
   and the precondition for its victory.

These comrades join other capable female cadres in leading society towards
a caring society that recognises equality in its quest for a people’s
democracy. Together with your male comrades, ours is to nurture these
efforts towards realising our nonsexist, nonracial and democratic society.

The ANC wishes all these comrades and other leading female comrades success
in their work towards a better life for all. [Applause.]


                  VULNERABILITY OF CHILDREN IN SOUTH AFRICA


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE (IFP): Chairperson, the vulnerability of children in
South Africa, especially girls, is a cause for great concern. Although
there are measures in place to try and give these vulnerable members of our
society the protection that they rightly deserve, we have to ask ourselves
whether enough is really being done or whether the current mechanisms that
we have in place are adequate to deal with this very serious issue.

Earlier this week, police officers in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, used metal
cutters to cut free a 16-year-old girl who was locked behind a gate with
burglar bars and used as a sex slave. This young girl was unable to leave
the locked room and was forced to use a plastic ice-cream tub as a
makeshift toilet. She had allegedly been sold to a Nigerian national to pay
a drug debt.

According to a senior member of the SA Police Service, this type of sex
slavery is not uncommon. Therefore, we cannot fail our children. It is up
to us all to ensure that they have the necessary protection and are not
preyed upon by the many cruel and inhumane criminals that exist in our
society.

We therefore urge the relevant authorities and all concerned people to use
the mechanisms in place to stop the abuse of our children or to implement
new mechanisms if those currently in place are not effective. Thank you,
Chairperson.


                     THE FLAUTISTS OF AQUADA DE SÂO BRAS


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr S E OPPERMAN (DA): Voorsitter, die fluitspelers van Aquada de Sâo Bras
sal moontlik een van die onderskrifte wees van die voorgestelde standbeeld
in Mosselbaai, wat erkenning sal gee aan die plaaslike inwoners wat Diaz in
1488 en Da Gama in 1497 by Sâo Bras aangetref het. Hierdie inboorlinge het
reeds baie eeue voor Diaz hierdie deel van die kontinent bewoon.

In Mosselbaai is daar ‘n Diaz Strand, Diaz Museum, Diaz Standbeeld, Diaz
Hotel, D’Almeida Woonbuurt en Sâo Bras Sekondêre Skool.

In hierdie see van Portugese name en monumente wil ons hierdie standbeeld
oprig. Ons sal die Departement van Kuns en Kultuur nader en vertrou dat
hulle sal bydra om dit te verwesenlik.

Ons moet erkenning gee aan hierdie groep mense en aan elkeen van ons wat ‘n
deel van die DNA van hierdie inboorlinge in ons dra. (Translation of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN (DA): Chairperson, The Flautists of Aquada de Sâo Bras
will possibly be one of the inscriptions on the proposed statue in Mossel
Bay that will give recognition to the local inhabitants that Diaz
encountered in Sâo Bras in 1488 and Da Gama in 1487. These indigenous
people had inhabited this part of the continent many centuries before Diaz
arrived.

In Mossel Bay you find a Diaz Beach, Diaz Museum, Diaz Statue, Diaz Hotel,
D’Almeida Township and Sâo Bras Secondary School. In this sea of Portuguese
names and monuments, we wish to erect this statue. We shall approach the
Department of Arts and Culture and trust that they will contribute towards
realising this.

We must acknowledge this group of people and each of us who carries a part
of the DNA of these indigenous people within us.]

The rhythm and the harmony of the music by the five flautists amazed Da
Gama and his crew – and the same rhythm and harmony in dance and song is
still part of the descendants of these early inhabitants who are not
ashamed to declare // ib Koasa Kare re! I thank you, Chairperson.
[Applause.]

                       TRANSFORMATION CHARTER OF SARU


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mrs D M MOROBI (ANC): The ANC welcomes the adoption of the Transformation
Charter by the SA Rugby Union last Friday. The objective of the
Transformation Charter is to drive the moral and strategic transformation
of rugby on the basis of broad-based empowerment principles.

Whilst we do agree that transformation is a process and commend SARU for
embarking on a complete re-design of the organisation, we need to remind
rugby administrators that the unity process in rugby started in 1990. As a
result, we are growing impatient with the slow and lacklustre approach of
the 13 key provincial unions towards transformation. The charter should
harness and accelerate the pace of transformation instead of starting from
scratch to transform the game.

While the selection of players in the national team is the competency of
the selection panel of SARU, we need to keep federations accountable to
ensure that their selection policy is aligned to the transformation
commitments and development agenda of the government. I thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]


                     DEPLOYMENT OF SANDF IN THE COMORES


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr O E MONARENG (ANC): Chairperson, South Africa continues to play a
pivotal role in peacekeeping missions on our continent. South African
peacekeeping forces were deployed in Burundi, the DRC, etc.

The Commander-in-Chief, the hon President of the Republic of South Africa,
has once again deployed our troops to the Commores to deal with important
problems of that country as we all know that this island is small and has
experienced many coups d’état, which were foreign initiated. This
deployment also comes at a time when our Parliament is dealing with the
Anti-Mercenary Bill, which seeks to tighten systems in our country.

We also know that the SA National Defence Force not only does this sterling
work with little pay from the UN, it also engages in community work such as
disaster management and therefore at the current juncture our troops are
also working on a relief programme after the eruption of a volcano.

Whilst deployed on a peacekeeping mission therefore we as members of
Parliament would like to thank the women who belong to the SA National
Defence Force doing the job in peacekeeping. And we want to thank them
greatly. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

                 SOUTH AFRICA MOVING TOWARDS A DICTATORSHIP


                            (Member’s Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Mr Chair, the ANC caucus yesterday rejected with
contempt allegations by the SA Communist Party and Cosatu to the effect
that Parliament is being sidelined and that the President is leading South
Africa towards a dictatorship.

The thing that interests the DA and the people of South Africa is that
there were members of the SACP and Cosatu who were sitting in that caucus
and are therefore presumably bound by the decision of the caucus, which
rejects with contempt these allegations.

What I would like the SACP and Cosatu to tell South Africa is why two years
ago they campaigned for the ANC to be re-elected and two months ago they
campaigned mightily and vigorously in the municipal election? Nothing has
changed in the last two months. Those two organisations need to explain to
the people of South Africa why they misled them into voting again for the
ANC when those organisations say we are on our way to a dictatorship. They
say there are too many things in South Africa that make us think that we
are on our way to a Zimbabwean crisis.

I think the members of the SACP and Cosatu in this House should stand up
and apologise both to the House and to the people of South Africa for the
gross way in which they misled people into voting against their own better
judgement and against the interests of South Africa. [Applause.]


           ATTRITION RATE OF TEACHERS MONTH CELEBRATIONS THE YOUTH





                          VULNERABILTY OF CHILDREN


                            (Minister’s Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I imagine that when the hon
Jeremy Cronin becomes a Minister he will have an opportunity to respond to
the statement by Mr Gibson.

I would like to assure the hon Vos that we are carefully monitoring the
attrition rate of teachers. There are more than 350 000 teachers employed
by the Department of Education, and the normal attrition rate varies
between 5% and 10%. Obviously, we are concerned about the employment of
educators. We have noted that the opening up of the economy has created
huge opportunities for many people, amongst whom are educators. Poaching is
taking place.

We have also recognised, with concern, the fact that as a result of
overrapid urbanisation, many of the teachers in the rural areas are moving
to the city centres and, in fact, leaving their profession. We have taken
specific measures in this regard, amongst which are the fact that we have
set aside R4,2 billion for teacher development, for career-pathing, to
ensure that there are incentives paid to teachers to retain teachers in the
rural areas. So this is a matter of great concern. There is no crisis at
this point in time, but this is a matter that we are looking at very
carefully.

We have also set aside, through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme,
a dedicated amount for teacher development because we think it is critical
and necessary to do so. We have urged provinces also to ensure that they
promote the need for teachers and monitor this very carefully.

What is very critical is that we manage the process very well. We have
surplus teachers in certain schools and we have a scarcity of teachers in
other schools. So, teacher provisioning must be done more meticulously, and
I’m glad you’ve raised this. This is something that is being taken note of,
and we are monitoring it very carefully. There is no crisis in so far as
this is concerned.

I would like to thank Comrade Thandi for raising the issue of the youth
month celebrations. Obviously, this is an important matter. This year we
are celebrating, amongst the various anniversaries, the 30th anniversary of
the June 16 uprisings. The hon Minister of Arts and Culture is a convenor
of the interministerial committee responsible for the celebration of these
anniversaries that will, amongst other things, focus on the youth.

From the side of the Department of Education, we have made particular
interventions in this regard. We have, amongst other things, engaged in a
programme with the Department of Home Affairs in accordance with which the
Deputy Minister of Education and the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs visit
the various provinces, invite the youth, and profile the further education
and training colleges that are important institutions that offer separate
career paths to our learners to ensure that we increase them and, in this
regard, we have set aside R1,9 billion for FET colleges. These and other
initiatives certainly endorse the sentiments that you have raised, and
certainly all sectors of government are concerned about this matter.

Chairperson, with your permission may I just touch on the issue the hon Van
der Merwe raised. He raised the issue of vulnerable children. This is a
matter of great concern. We have a particular response, because it’s
Children’s Week and this year we are focusing on children.

From the Department of Education perspective, there is a particular focus
on orphans and vulnerable children. This is something that we have to look
at attentively. We have a movement for the awareness of the vulnerability
of women in which male learners or boy learners are asked to take care of
their sisters, become their sisters’ keepers, to make them aware of gender
equity and equality, and to ensure that as they grow up they become aware
of their responsibilities so that they become protectors of the learners.

Certainly, the Department of Safety and Security is paying particular
attention to this specific aspect. You may well be aware of the fact, Mr
Van der Merwe, that we don’t have 16 days of activism any longer. We have
365 days of activism. That is an initiative of government, which says that
every department of government should look at its responsibility to ensure
that it promotes awareness of the vulnerability of our women and
particularly our children. Thank you very much, Chairperson.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SC ON PRIVATE MEMBERS’ LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND
              SPECIAL PETITIONS – PETITION BY MRS C J KELLERMAN

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:

  That the Report be adopted.


Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.


                             APPROPRIATION BILL


Debate on Vote No 14 – Arts and Culture:

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Mr Chairperson, hon Ministers and Deputy
Ministers, hon members, the government’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework,
reflecting the mandate given to us by the people of South Africa at the
last general elections, focuses on three areas: The need to accelerate
growth and promote the equitable economic development of our country and
its people; stepping up efforts to achieve social cohesion and nurture
social identity to realise the goals of nonracialism and nonsexism, through
a deepening and expansion of democracy; installing robust mechanisms and
systems to monitor and evaluate progress on all objectives, strategies and
plans of the government in relation to these priorities.

The strategies, plans and expenditure commitments of the Department of Arts
and Culture proceed from this medium-term framework and seek to align its
budgetary patterns with it. This speaks directly to the needs of the
majority of our people who mandated us to govern, manage the economy and
our cultural institutions on their behalf.

Many years ago, the great African patriot, Amilcar Cabral, described
cultural practice as an act of liberation. The manner in which we spend
public finances this year hopefully will contribute to the development of
the soul of our nation and promote its further liberation.

During the 2006-07 financial year, the Department will spend close to R70
million on language programmes and on activities to promote linguistic
diversity in South Africa. This includes the financial resources allocated
to the work of the Pan South African Language Board, which will be given
R39,09 million.

These resources are utilised to translate all documentation of all national
government departments into the 11 official languages, plus a number of
foreign languages. Language policy mechanisms such as the Telephone
Interpreting Service of South Africa – TISSA - language research and
development centres, human language technologies, terminology development,
literature development and promotion are all funded from the same source.

On the telephone interpreting service alone, my department will spend more
than R30 million over two years. It is one of the projects through which my
department has already created employment for more than 60 previously
unemployed people. The department will continue creating new job
opportunities in the field of interpretation and call centre management as
the telephone interpreting service is rolled out throughout the country.

TISSA gives effect to functional multilingualism by providing professional
and efficient telephone interpreting services to all those who need to
access the government. It particularly seeks to enhance oral communication
between the public and government agencies, so that anyone can be served in
the language of their choice, provided it is an official language in South
Africa.

TISSA is an innovative strategy for entrenching democracy as it speaks to
the right of citizens to use the language of their choice in accessing
government services and information. It is fair to postulate that language,
as one of the most sensitive matters in South Africa, has been brilliantly
tackled by the introduction of such an innovative communication tool as
TISSA.

South Africa has departed from the previous bilingual dispensation that
entailed only English and Afrikaans being promoted, advanced and utilised
for government business and communication at all levels. Eleven of the
languages spoken in the country have official status in our Constitution.
We therefore have an obligation to promote and advance their usage. I want
to emphasise that Afrikaans, as one of the official languages, is being
actively promoted and protected by the government, the hysteria of certain
academics notwithstanding.

The experiences of June 1976, whose 30th anniversary we are commemorating
this year, demonstrate that the use of a language or languages to oppress
other human beings cannot be an option for South Africa. The only sensible
course for us is the equitable promotion and use of all official languages,
and parity of esteem for all our languages, where each language is
embraced, nurtured and encouraged to grow and develop.

Even though Afrikaans in the past has been used as a tool for domination
and oppression of the African people, that language remains one of the
official languages of South Africa. Nothing, and no one will change that!
The development and advancement of the African languages will not be at the
expense of Afrikaans. The status of Afrikaans as an official language in
the Republic of South Africa is not under threat.

Effective programmes for literature development, literary awareness,
identification of community liaison personnel and other initiatives that
address the unique language needs of previously marginalized language
communities are equally important for the full participation of these
African language mother-tongue speakers in all provinces and regions where
these languages are spoken.

A community-based approach to the promotion of provincial and regional
literature is the most viable option for the implementation of the policy.
A number of literary awards were established last year to ensure that
deserving writers are recognised, encouraged and rewarded for their
efforts.

During 2005 we spent R490 million on heritage institutions, which accounted
for almost 67% of our budget. This expresses the department’s mandate as
the “custodian of the nation’s collective memory”. The budget for heritage
this year will come down to 48% of the total and stands at R635,22 million.
Heritage contributes to social cohesion and the building of a South African
national identity because it is a palpable record of our past. A special
transformation budget has been steadily augmented over the last three years
to reflect the diversity of South African society and contribute to the
decolonisation of our minds.

After we unveiled the Albert Luthuli monument in KwaDukuza, in KwaZulu-
Natal, we designated Sheik Yusuf’s Kramat in Macassar, in the Western Cape,
as a national monument, during 2005. This year, government adopted the
decision to erect two more significant monuments in Evaton and
Bloemfontein, respectively. The first will be a statue of Charlotte Manye
Maxeke, in Evaton, where she and her husband established Wilberforce
Institute in 1908; the second will be a statue of Abram Fischer, one of the
most illustrious sons of the Afrikaner people, in his hometown
Bloemfontein. [Applause.]

During the latter part of this year, we shall also unveil a sculpture
executed by Noriah Mabasa, dedicated to the women of South Africa, as part
of the commemoration of the 1956 march on Pretoria. The Women’s Monument,
at the Union Buildings, will also be refurbished as part of this year’s
celebrations. The Wesleyan Church Hall, in the old Waaihoek Location in
Bloemfontein, the venue of the inaugural conference of the ANC, will also
become part of our heritage estate.

The year 2006 is probably overloaded as a year for heritage. Apart from the
50th anniversary of the Women’s March on Pretoria, it is also the centenary
of the Anti-Poll Tax Rebellion, of Satyagraha – the technique of non-
violent resistance pioneered by Gandhi while he was in South Africa; the
30th anniversary of the Soweto Students’ Uprising; the 60th anniversary of
the African Mineworkers’ Strike; and the tenth anniversary of our
Constitution.

The Department of Arts and Culture has been tasked with giving leadership
in marking all these anniversaries and I chair an Interministerial
Committee responsible for co-ordinating the various departments of
government.

In July 2005, working with the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism, we hosted the 29th Session of the World Heritage Committee in
Durban. That event was a coup for Sub-Saharan Africa and coincided with the
inscription of our newest World Heritage Site, the Vredefort Dome in the
Free State, and the extension of the Cradle of Humankind to include Taung
in North West and Mokopane’s Cave in Limpopo.

Significantly, this has culminated in the establishment and launch of an
African World Heritage Fund through which African governments committed
themselves to the preservation, protection and promotion of Africa’s
heritage. Hopefully, this will result in fewer African sites being on the
endangered list and more African sites being on the world heritage list.
South Africa took the lead in proposing and piloting the heritage fund
through the councils of the United Nations educational and cultural
organisations and at the African Union.

Our National Heritage Council is rallying civil society’s support to put
the heritage issue on the public agenda and to raise awareness of our
heritage sites amongst our people. The South African Heritage Resources
Agency continues to identify and promote new heritage sites and is
conducting an audit of movable cultural property. This will assist us in
fighting the illicit trade in African heritage resources.

The theme for this year's Heritage Day is “Our Indigenous Music”, and we
will be celebrating it in Cape Town to coincide with South African Music
Week and Moshito, the National Music Conference Expo, during which we take
stock of the music industry, its development and new trends.

Heritage is inseparable from our National Archives, Libraries and Heraldry.
To promote our national symbols, together with the Department of Education,
we launched the “Flag in every School Project” at the A Z Berman School in
Mitchells Plain. We plan to roll out the project across all the provinces
over the next two years.

We are currently building a multi-million rand, state of the art new home
for our National Archives. We hope to open the northern campus of the
National Library in the centre of Pretoria in early 2008. One billion rand
has been set aside for the development of our libraries over the next three
years and a Library Transformation Charter is being developed. The thrust
of all this is to cultivate a reading culture amongst South Africans.

The new library development pilot project in Mdantsane, Buffalo City, will
be a trial run for a new vision of public libraries as more than just
depositories for books, but as cultural centres, which can also serve
communities as points at which to access government services.

The dearth of literature in the African languages still poses a huge
challenge. This year, a small publishing house, based here in Cape Town,
with encouragement from the Ministry, rose to the challenge and has already
published two titles in isiXhosa - the African language most widely spoken
in this province. New Africa Books has also taken the plunge, by re-
printing W B Rubusana’s Anthology of Xhosa Epic Poetry, “Zemk’Inkomo
Magwalandini”.

The Department of Arts and Culture’s own efforts to stimulate writing and
publishing in the indigenous languages are slowly bearing fruit. During
2005 we awarded a number of prizes to authors who had written in Tshivenda,
Xitsonga, Sepedi and isiZulu. These literary awards will be augmented when
we mount the Literary Heroes Campaign, which includes the celebration of
the Life and Works of Solomon T Plaatje.

Our government has made a commitment to rescue the Timbuktu Manuscripts,
ensuring that they are restored and the information they contain is
preserved for posterity. That project is now very well advanced and we
hosted an academic conference on the Timbuktu Manuscripts here in Cape Town
during August 2005. The papers written and discussed at that conference
will be reproduced as a book towards the end of January 2007, both as a
contribution to knowledge, but also for the more utilitarian purpose of
disseminating information about these important writings and their
restoration.

As we consolidate our democracy and our people become more certain about
their future, interesting gems are being uncovered in the dust of
yesteryear. It recently came to light that a number of Cape Muslim families
have in their possession what might be invaluable diaries and manuscripts,
written in various Indonesian dialects as well as in Afrikaans, employing
the Arabic script.

In co-operation with the Muslim community leaders of the Cape, we shall be
embarking on a project to have some of these translated. We trust that our
scholars and universities will be prepared to play a role in rescuing these
works from oblivion.

Arts and Culture in peri-urban and rural areas has transformed the lives of
many and contributed directly to the fight against poverty. By March 2006
we had created 1 612 new jobs. The overwhelming majority of beneficiaries,
68%, were women, and 8,2% were disabled. They have thus far performed 196
154 person days of work, 44 526 of which were devoted to training.

More than 100 learners have been enrolled in learnerships and skills
development programmes directly linked to arts and culture. To grow the
economy and narrow the gap between the first and second economies, through
investing in culture projects, we have invested 31,5% of available funds in
nodal municipalities to support the Integrated Sustainable Rural
Development and Urban Renewal Programmes.

The successes we have scored are exemplified by a R55 000 labour contract
awarded by Woolworths to the Tsohang ke Iketsetse Basotho Project, located
in Qwaqwa in the Free State, as well as award-winning projects we have
supported, such as the Hothouse Film Incubator in Gauteng, the Cape Craft
Design Institute and the Grandmothers Against Poverty project in the
Western Cape, which have all been celebrated for innovation and their
contributions to national life.

Overall, we are allocating R91 million to invest in culture. The Department
of Arts and Culture adds an important dimension to South Africa’s
international relations through the cultural agreements we have reached
with a number of countries. Beyond the shores of our continent, we have
concluded a number of agreements during the course of the past year,
yielding remarkable results for our country and its people.

Thanks to a cultural agreement with France, South Africa was able to host
the first-ever exhibition of the work of Pablo Picasso on the African
continent. Picasso and the school of modern art he was associated with
readily accepted their debt to African sculptors, which gave rise to the
art movement known as cubism. With the assistance of Standard Bank, the
Embassy of France and the Picasso Museum in Paris, Iziko National Gallery
here in Cape Town played host to this important exhibition.

Reports indicate that it was amongst the best patronised exhibitions to
visit our shores, and was visited by a number of school pupils. I have
signed yet another cultural agreement with my French counterpart when I
attended the Cannes Film Festival last week. We hope to reciprocate the
Picasso exhibition by mounting a major South African cultural festival,
spread across a number of artistic disciplines, in France before 2009.

I also signed a film co-production agreement with the United Kingdom,
building on a memorandum of understanding signed two years ago in Cape
Town. We already have eight out of ten trainee curators seconded to British
galleries and museums.

The Slave Lodge, here in Cape Town, will be entering into a relationship
with a sister institution in Liverpool. The twinning of these two museums
will not only be mutually enriching but could also add an important
dimension to our understanding of one of the darker chapters in human
history.

With the assistance of the British Council, our two countries will engage
in exchanges in the performing arts that will result in more South African
performers gaining access to arts festivals in Britain. We will reciprocate
by inviting British performers to our festivals. We can expect to stage a
number of performances during the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2008.

Norway, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Australia are some of the countries
with which we have reached similar agreements. The long-standing cultural
agreement with Flanders continues to give support to our community arts
projects.

Our cultural links with the rest of the world have increased exponentially
as South Africa assumes her rightful place in world affairs. South Africa
will participate in the Venice International Biennale during September this
year. When Brazil hosts artists from India and South Africa later this
year, we can expect to see a number of South African acts showcased.

Two years ago, Mexico showcased South African performers at her most
prestigious arts festival, the Cervantino. This June, the city of
Cartagena, in Spain, Cervantes’s native land, will host South Africa at its
annual festival.

We have been invited to fly the “Africa’s time is now” flag during the 2006
Soccer World Cup in Germany. At the invitation of the German authorities we
will be mounting a cultural programme that will include the performing arts
and crafts in Berlin and Cologne, to create a top-of-the-mind awareness of
South Africa as the next host country for the World Cup in 2010. Madam
Speaker, given these ambitious plans, we shall be allocating R19 million to
our international relations in this year’s budget.

South Africa’s cultural industries and their potential for wealth
generation and job creation have been underestimated for far too long.
Under the stewardship of the incumbent Ministry we have begun a
comprehensive mapping of our cultural industries with a view to maximising
their contribution to the national economy.

After the extremely successful Crafts Expo in Mafikeng last December, we
will be mounting a major crafts expo in Pretoria in November this year to
offer a high-profile showcase to our crafters. The Beautiful Things
Exhibition, designed to showcase crafts in Soweto, will hopefully become a
retail brand. We have already secured an important contract with a major
overseas retailer, which can become a platform for South African crafters
to become major players in the international market.

The impact of South African music and musicians on the world stage is an
established fact. Despite this no one could claim that our musicians are
getting a fair deal, at home or abroad. The Department of Arts and Culture
has tried in a number of ways to improve the situation of our musicians
and, where necessary, we have given them backing in their dealings with
international promoters and companies.

With the Department of Arts and Culture’s assistance the family of the late
Solomon Linda, the composer of “Mbube”, won an out-of-court settlement from
Disney Studios after years of litigation over the use of their father’s
composition in the blockbuster film The Lion King. [Applause.]

Securing the intellectual property rights of South African musicians
remains a huge challenge, which has been compounded by the rapid
development of new information and communications technologies as well as
the shameful practice of pirating of music that takes place here in South
Africa. A proposed levy on the sale of blank recording tapes and CDs has
been mooted, but I suspect that technology has already overtaken us.

We have repeatedly told the Moshito Conference that the South African
recording industry is an untapped gold mine. During Heritage Month we plan
to fast-track the entry of South African music into the international
market by commencing a well-targeted campaign to promote our music product
internationally. The establishment of an Independent Record Companies
Association, our recently gained access to Midem in France, as well as the
footholds we have gained by exposure at international festivals should
serve us well.

This year will also see the realisation of a project that is very close to
my heart, the unveiling of South Africa’s first jazz orchestra, under the
leadership of Dr Abdullah Ibrahim. This will be the first of the two large
instrumental ensembles I undertook to build during my first budget debate
in 2004.

The building blocks of the second are being slowly assembled through
initiatives such as “Mzantsi’s tribute to Oliver Tambo”, which was very
successfully staged by Victor Ntoni at Gallagher Estate on 28 October 2005,
as well as ESP’s “The Exile’s Re-Initiation”, staged in Port Elizabeth in
December 2005.

These highly experimental initiatives have served not only to revive old
choral classics by indigenous composers, but have also demonstrated the
versatility of the various musical idioms and styles that were thought to
be incompatible.

Over the past 12 months, South Africa’s relatively young film industry has
again won kudos in the international arena. Most recently, a young South
African was chosen as the winner of the Student Oscar at the Hollywood
Academy of Motion Pictures.

Four other young South Africans, from Cape Town, had the courage to submit
their short film for the Cannes Film Festival. Though they did not walk
away with the prize, their film was amongst the top ten in that category.
Coming so soon after the Oscar won by our local feature film Tsotsi, these
are portents of a promising future for our film industry.

During the first decade of democracy South Africa became a favourite
destination for moviemakers from every part of the world, attracted by our
beautiful climate and low prices. Foreign filmmakers continue to shoot
their films here and their work contributes billions to our national
economy.

In order to make South Africa even more inviting, our Department of Trade
and Industry introduced an indirect subsidy for foreign filmmakers by
offering them a handsome tax rebate. While this rebate makes perfect sense
from every point of view as we begin to establish ourselves as a film-
producing country, we shall have to revisit such measures so as to maximise
the benefits accruing to our South African film industry and our own
filmmakers.

The National Film and Video Foundation, through which the Department of
Arts and Culture supports film and video production, will see its budget
increased to R35,8 million this year. We are also engaged in exploring new
and creative ways of funding films so that the NFVF will not be exclusively
dependent on government.

A national theatre indaba, planned for 2006, will be a partnership between
the Community Theatre Development Network and the Department of Arts and
Culture to create a platform for theatre practitioners to meet at national
level to deliberate on the key challenges facing theatre in this country.

We will also witness interesting developments in theatre during the course
of the next six months, including the staging of Samuel Becketts Waiting
for Godot in Pollsmoor Prison, by a cast drawn from the inmates of that
prison as part of our Arts in Prison project, run in collaboration with the
Department of Correctional Services.

In that context I must mention the name of Albert Thomas, one of Cape
Town’s oldest theatre practitioners, whose untimely death last year robbed
this country of a major talent. Waiting for Godot behind bars was his idea.
I once again extend our condolences to his family and friends.

In addition to the Dumile Feni Retrospective, mounted in Johannesburg and
Cape Town, we expect to see an Ernest Mancoba Retrospective here in Cape
Town and possibly one also for George Pemba.

I am compelled to say something about the National Arts Council. I
dissolved the board of that council in 2004 because it had lost the
confidence of the arts community. Owing to lengthy litigations we have been
unable to reconstitute the National Arts Council. But I hope to be able to
constitute an arts council during the course of July this year.

I think it is important to note that despite the misgivings, fears and
scepticism expressed by many hasty critics, the personnel of the National
Arts Council have been able to perform their duties well, even in the
absence of a board.

To be sure, there are inevitably companies and personalities who have not
been happy or have been disappointed by the decisions regarding their
funding. But on the whole the arts community does not appear unduly
aggrieved by the absence of a board. The National Arts Council will receive
R62,08 million for its work this year.

Madam Speaker, we are indeed living through an “Age of Hope” as the people
of South Africa begin to harvest the fruits of freedom and democracy. In
the field of arts and culture, our country has repeatedly been crowned with
a laurel wreath for its achievements. We hope to be able to keep that up in
the way we conduct our work, by creating an environment in which the South
African people, in all their diversity, can have the opportunity to express
themselves culturally. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M R SONTO: Madam Speaker, Ministers present here, Deputy Ministers, hon
members, honoured guests, ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends, I
gladly follow the Minister of Arts and Culture uJola. As I rise on behalf
of the ANC to support this budget, I am reminded that over 50 years ago
South Africans declared that when they were liberated the doors of learning
and culture should be opened. This exercise therefore is in pursuit of that
declaration.

South Africa’s diverse and dynamic arts and culture heritage is one of its
richest and most important resources, with an enormous potential to
generate significant economic and social benefits. Since its establishment
in 2004, the Department of Arts and Culture has been succeeding in
promoting and developing South Africa’s arts and culture, and protecting
and promoting the country’s heritage, legacy sites, museums and galleries.

As complex as that task has been, anniversaries that the country has
commemorated or are about to commemorate are an indication that we are
moving forward as a country. These anniversaries include the tenth
anniversary of the adoption of the new Constitution for the Republic of
South Africa, the 30th anniversary of the 16 June 1976 uprising, the
centenary of the poll tax uprising led by Bambatha, the 50th anniversary of
the women’s march to the Union Buildings in August 1956, and many other
anniversaries.

These anniversaries epitomise the kind of hurdles we had to jump, the
rivers we had to cross and the bruises we had to suffer when the
governments of those days ran arts and culture on a race card. Where we are
today is in a big way the result of those processes and struggles. The
roles of the Ministry, the Department of Arts and Culture and related
public entities must complement one another if we are to succeed in
transforming arts and culture and the heritage landscape.

What should not be left out are mechanisms to seek means to ensure that
communities generate economic benefits from the processes that we engage
in. The project of social cohesion is crucial in the broader role of nation-
building, and the Department of Arts and Culture is a key role-player in
this. The Ministry and the department must intensify their roles in
educating the public about the unifying role of the Constitution, broadly
speaking.

Arts and culture, without leaning heavily on the rest of the Constitution,
would be meaningless in our country. It is from the Constitution that we
derive the ethics and values that guarantee our being. The 10 years of
freedom and democracy have freed the art and cultural practices of our
nation from the severe limitations of the past. However, we still have a
mammoth task of giving sufficient support to this sector. It is therefore
appropriate that Asgisa has identified the creative industry as a key and
strategic sector.

As the ANC we support the call of the department to all stakeholders to
support arts and culture initiatives, because of their usefulness to the
spiritual health of the nation, including its potential for job creation
and poverty alleviation. Because of complexities in the process of
transformation and the need to go forward, I am reminded of Ben Okri’s
words, which were pronounced in this House earlier this year by the
Minister of Finance, and I quote:

   The joys that spring from the challenges are profound. And the challenges
   will always be there. As long as there are human beings there will be
   challenges. Let no one speak of frontiers exhausted, all challenges met,
   all problems solved.

Madam Speaker, that statement talks to the problems that the department may
be facing in its task, but also reminds us of the need to be patient and to
persevere. This department is also faced with challenges that it should
confront. If I were to mention but a few, they would be the following.

The issue of compliance with co-operative governance principles and
requirements must remain a focus of the department. Financial probity and
ethical practices by board members and officials in institutions the
department is working with constitute an important issue for us in the ANC
and the committee in our campaign for clean governance.

The relationship between the department and each one of these entities
requires improvement. There have been concerns that, having established
these entities, the department has continued to take initiatives considered
a duplication of these entities. If that is the case, it needs to be looked
into and be corrected.

Another challenge is that amongst some of these entities there exists
current role confusion and/or a belief that there is unnecessary
fragmentation. If that is the case, we need to look into that and resolve
that problem. Is it therefore not appropriate to review the work of some of
these entities with a view to bringing about more clarity and certainty
about roles and responsibilities?

Reference has been made to some of these entities, such as the National
Heritage Council, the National Heritage Trust and the SA Heritage
Association. Sometimes people cannot differentiate between these bodies.
Another two are the National Language Service and PanSALB. We need to look
into those.

Further, Minister, a painful feeling exists out there that artists are left
on their own, and the wolves are freely feeding on them. How about
considering legislative support to initiatives aimed at protecting artists
and cultural workers? Here I am reminded of an old story.

Ingcuka okanye ixhwili ekwakukholelwa ekubeni ziinyamakazi zasebusuku
ezixhwila abantu. Bekusithi kweza zindlu zingoongquphantsi yakufika ingcuka
ixhwile umntu, akhale engakwazi ukuzinceda esithi, “Yandithatha,
yandibeka.” Bathi ababukeleyo nabafuna ukunceda loo mntu kuba besazi ukuba
ingcuka okanye ixwhili liyasoyika isikhuni esinomlilo, kuthiwe, “gibisela
ngesikhuni.” ukwenzela into yokuba kusindiswe loo mntu. Nawe ke Mphathiswa
xa amagcisa ethu engamaxhoba ala maxhwili, gibisela ngesikhuni.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Hyenas or African wild dogs are believed to be nocturnal wild animals, but
they do attack people. When the hyena gets to the mud house it will seize a
person, and that person will cry for not being able to help himself saying
that “It has caught me and holds me down.” Those who are watching and
seeking to help that person, knowing that the hyena or African wild dog is
afraid of a burning stick will say, “Toss a burning stick at it to save
this person.’’ The same applies to you, Minister. When our artists become
victims of these hyenas, toss a burning stick at those hyenas. [Applause.]]

Much needs to be done in terms of the promotion of multilingualism as a
contribution towards nation-building and social cohesion, and the promotion
of mother-tongue education to improve the overall performance of pupils in
their education efforts. Madam Speaker, it is not only for pupils, but will
be of benefit even for members of this august House, so that they will stop
saying “Benjamin Netanyau”, but when you say they should pronounce
“Nyanga”, they say “Nayanga”. [Laughter.] When they have to say “Mfeketho”,
they pronounce it “Mafeketho”, and they say “Mapetho” instead of “Mphetho”
- there is no “Ma” in that word, it’s “Mp”. That education should therefore
also benefit members of this House.

The relationship between arts and cultural workers and municipalities
across the country leaves much to be desired. A case in point is our
oversight visit to Mpumalanga in 2004. We found out that these cultural
workers were not being paid in time for services rendered and they
complained about prohibitive regulations and access fees in respect of
facilities for practise and performance. This is not only a problem in
Mpumalanga; it is a problem across the country.

Minister, can we save our cultural workers? As the ANC and the committee,
we think a focused discussion about these issues between councillors,
officials and arts and cultural workers should take place. One of those
platforms could be the growth and development summits that are planned for
each of the districts and metros in the country. There is no doubt that
arts and culture play a crucial part in all our city and town profiles.

We urge the Minister to convey these viewpoints and share with relevant
stakeholders best practices about these issues, using local and
international examples. Madam Speaker, arts and culture have this cross-
cutting presence in our society. And, hon Minister, I would be interested
in understanding interdepartmental co-operation in pursuance of intended
objectives, with special reference to budget implications.

While the budget has remained in the main static, there remains a strong
case for more funding allocation to this department. We will, as the ANC,
under its stewardship, drive our processes and unite this nation and
preserve the heritage of this country. The ANC supports the budget. I thank
you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Mev D VAN DER WALT: Agb Speaker, Minister, Adjunkminister en kollegas, met
inagneming van die Grondliggende Bepalings en die Handves van Regte soos
vervat in ons Grondwet, en die visie en missie van die Departement van Kuns
en Kultuur, die volgende: in u posisie as Minister van die portefeulje is
dit u verantwoordelikheid om die leiding te neem en die implementering van
bogenoemde te verseker.

Taal in Suid-Afrika, Minister, behoort nie verdelend te wees nie. Ons kan
en moet ons diverse, opwindende samelewing ontwikkel, en kan dit regkry
indien ál die mense uit ál 11 ons taalgemeenskappe hulle beywer vir die
beginsels in ons Grondwet.

In sy ondersteuning van afsonderlike penklubs is Mhlobo Jadezweni, skrywer
en letterkundige, in die kol wanneer hy onder andere sê:


  ’n Klem op steun aan die minder ontwikkelde tale deur die reeds
  gevestigdes sal tot groot trots aanleiding gee as enige van die Suid-
  Afrikaanse tale ’n prestasie behaal.


Tog, wanneer ons eerstens na ons inheemse tale kyk, hoekom kan ons nie
verder beweeg as om die tale net tot gerieflike spreektale te beperk nie?
Dit moet sodanig ontwikkel dat dit in alle moderne aktiwiteite benut en
gebruik kan word.

Watter stappe het u die afgelope twee jaar as beskermheer van tale gedoen
om te verseker dat ook u kollegas in ander departemente die publiek in
hulle eie taal bedien? Ons Grondwet bepaal immers ook dat
streeksomstandighede en die ewewig van die behoeftes en voorkeure van die
bevolking as geheel in die betrokke provinsie in aanmerking geneem moet
word. Ook moet munisipaliteite die taalgebruike en voorkeure van hulle
inwoners in aanmerking neem.

Oor Afrikaans spesifiek het u verlede jaar tydens die begrotingsdebat, en
trouens vanoggend ook, gesê: “Afrikaans is a South African language ... We
will protect it, defend it and promote it,” maar gedurende die taaldebat by
die Universiteit van Stellenbosch het u nie ’n enkele woord gesê nie. En
wat sê u oor moedertaalonderrig? U is besonder stil.

Die DA hou by ons standpunt dat daar ten minste twee Afrikaanse
universiteite, een in die noorde en een in die suide van ons land, behoue
moet bly, natuurlik met die insluiting van ander taalgroepe. Dit het tyd
geword dat die ANC-beheerde regering aanvaar en erken dat Afrikaans as taal
ontkoppel behoort te word van sy stigma as taal van die verdrukker en dat
daar nie langer teen Afrikaans gediskrimineer moet word nie.

Dringende navorsing moet gedoen word met betrekking tot die rol van
inheemse tale in die ekonomiese sektor. Onlangs het die taalkenner dr
Neville Alexander tydens ’n lesing ook daarna verwys. Ook is prof Esther
Ramani, senior lektor by die Universiteit van Limpopo, besig om vir
gebruikers van inheemse tale ’n toekoms in die ekonomie te skep deur ’n BA-
graadkursus. Dit sal mense van dié arm provinsie werkgeleenthede in ’n wye
veld in hulle eie taal bied.

Kan ek byvoeg dat die befondsing hiervoor nié van die ANC-beheerde regering
kom nie, maar wel van ’n buitelandse instansie! Ek vra dat u dringend met
die universiteit in aanraking kom en saam met die Departement van Onderwys
planne in aksie stel vir befondsing sodat die kursus se toekoms verseker
kan word.

Die ontwikkeling en gebruik van ook die Khoi-, Nama- en Santale, en
gebaretaal moet drasties verbeter word. In die Rapport van 1 September 2002
sê prof Rosalie Findlayson die volgende: “Wanneer ’n taal uitsterf, is die
rykdom van die bepaalde taalgroep se kulturele erfenis daarmee heen.”

Ons onderskat ook nie die proses van bewusmaking van die slawetydperk in
ons geskiedenis nie. Die persepsies wat egter dikwels geskep word dat dié
inheemse mense maar altyd slawe was, is vér verwyder van die waarheid! Wat
van die era toe inboorlinge na Tafelberg verwys het as “Hû! Gais,” oftewel
“The Great Storm Rocks”, wat later verander het na “Cabo dos Tormentos,”
oftewel “The Cape of Storms”, en weer later verander is na die bekende
“Cabo da Boa Esperança”, oftewel “The Cape of Good Hope”? En wat van die
era toe daar nog lewe en betekenis was in name soos Tarrakamma, Matzikamma,
Keiskamma en Tsitsikamma?

Ons moet nog op die linguistieke spoor loop van onder andere Shona, soos in
Masjonaland, Komati; Ab soos in Gari-Ab en Karoo. Die spoor sal ons baie
ver lei. Dit is egter ’n pad wat geloop moet word as ons ware substansie
wil gee aan die deel van ’n erfenis wat die toets van die tyd en die
kruisondervraging van die geskiedenis, argeologie, godsdiens en
antropologie sal deurstaan.

Die noodsaaklikheid van die ontwikkeling en bevordering van ’n leeskultuur,
gestimuleer deur goed opgeleide onderwysers en met maklike toegang tot goed
toegeruste biblioteke is van kardinale belang, en ek hoop die Minister sal
ook na ons voorstelle luister. Ons sou graag wil sien dat byvoorbeeld die
afskaffing van BTW by die aankoop van boeke dringend aandag kry en dat
mobiele biblioteke, waarvoor ek voorheen al gevra het, voorkeuraandag
geniet, veral in plattelandse gebiede. Ons moet reeds by voorskoolse
kinders die liefde vir lees ontwikkel. Alle biblioteke, ook dié by skole,
móét boeke in Afrikatale aanhou.

Die portefeuljekomitee kry nou sy vierde voorsitter sedert 2004, wat glad
nie bevorderlik is vir die taak wat ons opgelê is nie. Ek stel voor dat
indien u ernstig is oor nasiebou, u die DA in dié posisie aanstel.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Dit is kommerwekkend dat slegs vier van die 27 entiteite in u departement
ongekwalifiseerde ouditverslae van die Ouditeur-generaal ontvang het. Dis
duidelik dat hier dringende ingryping moet plaasvind, en dit is dan ook
duidelik dat daar sekere probleme in u departement is. Ek moet sê, ook die
wyse waarop u my vrae soms met absolute sarkasme beantwoord, dui eintlik
dat daar probleme is.

Die gedurige verwysing na ras deur u woordvoerder in sy persoonlike
hoedanigheid in die pers, waar hulle noem dat hy die woordvoerder van u
departement is, is 100% strydig met nasiebou. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek kan nie nalaat om u te bedank daarvoor dat u nie ’n oorhaastige,
ondeurdagte besluit geneem het ten opsigte van die voorgestelde
naamsverandering van Pretoria nie. Tog moet die kwessie ook nou tot
finaliteit kom. [Tussenwerpsels.] U aankondiging dat dit die hoofstad is en
vir eers Pretoria sal bly, word verwelkom, maar word steeds deur die
Tshwane-munisipaliteit, die SABC - soos hulle hul deesdae bekendstel – en u
eie amptenare geïgnoreer! Selfs die voorgestelde gebied wat by aanvaarding
van die aansoek steeds Pretoria sal bly, word deur u amptenare Tshwane
genoem, en omdat daar tans glad nie so ’n pleknaam geregistreer is nie, vra
en pleit ek by u dat u die gebruik van die naam Tshwane in plaas van
Pretoria stopsit. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Minister, my tyd is om, en ek wou graag, omdat u laaskeer nie in die Huis
was nie, vir u voorgelees het uit regter H A Fagan se Afrikaanse vertaling
van 1946 van “Nkosi sikelel’ i-Afrika,” maar ek is seker u het die Groot
Verseboek van André P Brink en sal dit self kan lees. [Tussenwerpsels.] En,
André Gaum, jy hoef nie vir my te sit en skree nie; jy’s ’n Afrikaner.
Dankie, Voorsitter. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs D VAN DER WALT: Hon Speaker, Minister, Deputy Minister and colleagues,
considering the Founding Provisions and the Bill of Rights as contained in
our Constitution, and the vision and mission of the Department of Arts and
Culture, the following: in your position as Minister of the portfolio it is
your responsibility to take charge and to ensure the implementation of the
above-mentioned.

Language in South Africa, Minister, should not be divisive. We can and must
develop our diverse, exciting society and can succeed in doing so if all
the people from all 11 of our language communities strive for the
principles in our Constitution.

In his support for separate pen clubs Mhlobo Jadezweni, writer and man of
letters, hits the nail on the head when he says, inter alia, that emphasis
on support for the less developed languages by the already established ones
will result in a lot of pride if any of the South African languages attain
an achievement.

Even so, when, in the first place, we look at our indigenous languages, why
can we not move further than merely limiting the languages to convenient
spoken languages? They must develop to such an extent that they can be
utilised and used in all modern activities.

What steps have you as patron of languages taken over the past two years to
ensure that your colleagues in other departments also serve the public in
their own language? In fact, our Constitution also provides that regional
circumstances and the balance of the needs and preferences of the
population as a whole in the relevant province must be taken into
consideration. Municipalities must also take the language practices and
preferences of their inhabitants into consideration.

Regarding Afrikaans in particular you said during the budget debate of last
year, and in fact also this morning: ”Afrikaans is a South African language
... We will protect it, defend it and promote it”, but during the language
debate at the University of Stellenbosch you did not utter a single word.
And what do you say about mother-tongue education? You are very quiet.

The DA maintains the standpoint that at least two Afrikaans universities,
one in the north and one in the south of our country, should be retained,
naturally including other language groups. The time has come for the ANC-
controlled government to accept and admit that Afrikaans as a language
should be freed from its stigma as the language of the oppressor and that
Afrikaans should no longer be discriminated against.

Urgent research should be done with regard to the role of indigenous
languages in the economic sector. Recently the linguist Dr Neville
Alexander also referred to this during a lecture. Prof Esther Ramani,
senior lecturer at the University of Limpopo, is also creating a future in
the economy for users of indigenous languages by means of a BA degree
course. This will offer people from this poor province job opportunities in
a wide field in their own language.

May I add that the funding for this does not come from the ANC-controlled
government, but from an overseas institution! I request you urgently to
contact the university and, together with the Department of Education, set
plans in motion for funding so that the future of this course may be
ensured.

The development and use of the Khoi, Nama and San languages, as well as
sign language must be drastically improved. In Rapport of 1 September 2002
Prof Rosalie Findlayson said the following: When a language dies out, the
wealth of the relevant language group’s cultural heritage is lost.”

Nor do we underestimate the process of creating an awareness of the period
of slavery in our history. However, the perception so often created that
these indigenous people had always been slaves is far removed from the
truth! What about the era when indigenous people referred to Table Mountain
as “Hû Gais”, that is “The Great Storm Rocks”, which later changed to “Cabo
dos Tormentos”, that is “The Cape of Storms”, and was again changed later
to “Cabo da Boa Esperança”, that is “The Cape of Good Hope”? And what about
the era when there was still life and meaning in names such as Tarrakamma,
Matzikamma, Keiskamma and Tsitsikamma?

We still have to follow the linguistic trail of, inter alia, Shona, as in
Mashonaland, Komati; Ab as in Gari-Ab and Karoo. The trail will lead us
very far. However, it is a path that has to be followed if we want to give
true substance to the part of a heritage that will withstand the test of
time and the cross-questioning of history, archaeology, religion and
anthropology.

The necessity of developing and promoting a reading culture, stimulated by
well-trained teachers and with easy access to well-equipped libraries, is
of the utmost importance, and I hope that the Minister will also listen to
our proposals. We would like to see, for example, the abolition of VAT when
books are purchased receiving urgent attention and mobile libraries, which
I have already requested in the past, receiving priority attention,
especially in rural areas. We must inculcate a love of reading in pre-
school children. All libraries, including those at schools, must keep books
in African languages.

The portfolio committee is now getting its fourth chairman since 2004,
which is not at all conducive to the task imposed on us. I suggest that, if
you are serious about nation-building, you appoint the DA to this position.
[Interjections.]

It is alarming that only four of the 27 entities in your department
received unqualified audit reports from the Auditor-General. It is clear
that urgent intervention must take place here, and it is also clear that
there are certain problems in your department. I must say, the way in which
you sometimes reply to my questions with absolute sarcasm actually also
indicates that there are problems.

The constant reference to race by your spokesperson in his personal
capacity in the press, where they mention that he is the spokesperson for
your department, is 100% in conflict with nation- building.
[Interjections.]

I cannot refrain from thanking you for the fact that you have not made an
overhasty, ill-considered decision in respect of the proposed name change
of Pretoria. Even so, the matter must now be finalised. [Interjections.]
Your announcement that it is the capital city and will remain Pretoria for
now, is welcomed, but is still being ignored by the Tshwane Municipality,
the SABC – as they call themselves nowadays - and your own officials! Even
the proposed area, which is to remain Pretoria even after the acceptance of
the application, is called Tshwane by your officials and, because no such
place name has been registered at present, I ask and beg you to put a stop
to the use of the name Tshwane instead of Pretoria. [Interjections.]

Minister, my time has expired, and because you were not in the House last
time, I wanted to read aloud to you from Justice H A Fagan’s 1946 Afrikaans
translation of “Nkosi sikelel’ i-Afrika”, but I am sure that you have André
P Brink’s Groot Verseboek and that you will be able to read it yourself.
[Interjections.] And, André Gaum, you don’t have to sit and shout at me;
you’re an Afrikaner. Thank you, Chairperson.]

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Madam Speaker, Minister of Arts and Culture, hon members
...

... ndiyanibulisa nani enikwelo cala ... [... I greet you also up there
...]

... our future Ministers of Arts and Culture. You are the future
parliamentarians, and you must stick to that. [Applause.]

Ndithetha nani ke bantwana besikolo. [I am referring to you, young people.]
The Department of Arts and Culture has interpreted the vision of the
Freedom Charter to address the previously inadequate framework for arts and
culture, which the ANC-led government inherited and corrected. A broad
guiding framework, the White Paper on Arts and Culture and Heritage was
passed, out of which flowed a number of policies and programmes. A central
component of this framework was to redirect and grow the arts and culture
project.

Moreover, we are given a mandate to explore and utilise arts and culture
for social and economic regeneration. In terms of this mandate, a new Chief
Directorate: Arts and Culture in Society was established in 2003. In the
main, Arts and Culture in Society will seek to define a role for arts in
relation to a range of social challenges.

In this regard the department has now developed multipronged strategies to
create intergovernmental synergies and institutional arrangements to
enhance deliverables across all spheres. This entails, inter alia, skills
development and creative interventions in the second cultural economy
through a programme of auditing and mapping activities in the second
economy. These are certainly welcome developments, since they will augment
the role of arts and culture as a major economic contributor.

It goes without saying that under the political leadership of Comrade Pallo
Jordan the department’s socioeconomic imperatives have gained the kind of
momentum we expected. The national cultural mood is more positive than ever
before. We have a booming cultural tourism industry. Our film industry is
proud of the success of Tsotsi. Last year we hosted the 29th session of the
World Heritage Committee.

In other words, South Africa is enjoying recognition and progress. This
shows indisputably that this is indeed the age of hope. Perceptions that
might otherwise exist have been negated by this sense of optimism. However,
Minister, the poorest sector of our society still experiences economic
conditions that are less favourable, while they remain confident that our
government can deliver.

It is against this background that I would like to focus on what we in the
ANC consider important in terms of developing our country and promoting its
unique and rich tapestry of cultural conditions. But how do we do this? As
a government for the people we have a political responsibility to ensure
the fulfilment of key objectives and broader government imperatives.

Central to this, we believe, is the provision of support and assistance
that is consistent with job creation and economic development. To this end
we need increased consciousness about the socioeconomic empowerment
opportunities available within the realm of arts and culture, which brings
me to the role that community art centres can play in this regard.

As we all know, community art centres are positioned to serve as leading
centres for poverty alleviation in both rural and urban areas. We have
examples of thriving local projects at many community art centres.
Furthermore, it is at these community art centres where the creative
instincts of women, the youth and persons with disabilities find
expression. It is at these centres where the people’s contract must have
the desired effect. It is also at these centres where social cohesion is
evident in their lives.

From an Asgisa perspective, it is critical that we increase our efforts to
demonstrate to our people, particularly the poor, that as government we
have the drivers to bring about meaningful socioeconomic transformation. In
fact, two of the key pillars of Asgisa are awareness of opportunities and
supporting ongoing initiatives.

A major obstacle is and remains access to information. It is incumbent upon
us to popularise all the opportunities available to strengthen our efforts
for the creation of a better life for all.

During the state of the nation address President Thabo Mbeki alluded to the
importance of integrated communication to strengthen social partnerships.
And in this regard we call upon the private sector and other stakeholders
to assist with translating the President’s call into reality.

Similarly, we want to urge the department to continue with its efforts to
ensure an environment conducive to growth in arts and culture in general,
and community art centres in particular. Special attention should be
focused on infrastructure development and provincial projects, and, most
importantly, interventions in the second economy.

Somlomo, vumelana nam xa ndisithi lo rhulumente okhokelwa nguKhongolozi
simthembile ukuba uza kusibuyisa isidima sethu, ngokuvula amathuba
emisebenzi kwezokhenketho, ukuze zitsho iindwendwe zithenge imifanekiso
yethu eqingqiweyo. Ukanti kwakhona xa iNdebe yoMhlaba ilapha eMzantsi
Afrika iSebe leZobugqi noBugcisa liza kudlala indima enkulu, ngokubonisa
imixhentso yethu nangokuthengisa imizobo yethu ukuze siphuhlise ezoqoqosho.

Sicela uRhulumente ke ngoko ukuba akhusele abantu ekuqhathweni ngabo
banyolukileyo. Mandibulele kakhulu kuni baPhathiswa ngokuthi gqolo nithetha
iilwimi zethu. Abantu bayayivuyela loo nto, ibenza bathande nokumamela.
Mandichaze ke kodwa ukuba ngaphaya emaXesibeni nakuGatyane kanti
nasemaMpondweni abantu basasibuza ukuba yintoni na le Asgisa. Ndicela
undincede kuloo ndawo ke, nkosi. UKhongololozi uyaluxhasa olu Hlahlo-
lwabiwo-mali. Ndiyabulela. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Speaker, I am sure members agree with me when I say we have confidence
that this government that is led by the ANC will return our dignity by
creating jobs in tourism, so that the tourists can buy our sculptures. When
the World Cup is here in South Africa, the Department of Arts and Culture
will play a major role in exposing our traditional dances, and in selling
our art to enhance economic development.

We therefore request our government to protect our people from being robbed
by moneylenders. Let me thank you, Ministers, for continuously speaking our
language. People are enjoying that and it makes them interested in
listening more. Let me be honest and say to you, the people in Willowvale
and in Pondoland are still enquiring as to what this Asgisa is all about.
I’m asking you to help me there. The ANC supports this Budget Vote. I thank
you. [Applause.]]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker and the hon House ...

... mhlonishwa nesekela likamhlonishwa, nabo bonke abakhona endlini
ngiyanibingilela. [... hon Minister and hon Deputy Minister, and all those
present in the House, I greet you.]

Imagine a world without “Mbube”, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, gospel singers,
jazz, poetry, songs, crafts, traditional festivals, national dishes,
pictures, photos, film and theatre. It would be a bleak and boring country.
It is largely through arts and culture that the government must establish
the delicate balance between uniting the country and celebrating its
differences, between moving into the future and preserving the skills and
stories of the past.

The Minister has tried to clean up the corruption and vagueness in some of
the cultural institutions and make development and craft promotion
sustainable and tourist-based. In many ways he has succeeded: witness the
several cultural festivals held to celebrate and showcase music, songs and
crafts. But not enough were held, apart from the few that have an
established and strong following, such as the Cape Town International Jazz
Festival. They tend to be haphazard in sourcing talent and craft.

The target was to fund and participate in 15 festivals from the budget of
the programme for Arts and Culture in Society. It would be interesting to
know, Mr Minister, how many were in fact held. The aim of the Arts and
Culture in Society programme is crucial to this sector and too important to
have the ten years of freedom celebration draw away budgetary support from
it. Yes, the National Arts Council supports various disciplines in all
forms of creative arts, but the spending is too little and, again, too
haphazard to make a sufficiently meaningful contribution to developing a
strong performing or visual arts community in South Africa.

The outreach to smaller groups and amateurs is important, but equally
important is the development of the second tier of skilled artists. This
would require the funding of dedicated educational institutions in all of
the provinces to promote talented students in various arts. It would also
require better training of successful amateur groups to help them develop
the expertise to progress from amateur to professional, or to reach a
standard where they will be sponsored for productions that go beyond
workshops into financial viability.

Theatre is the best means of educating people about important lifestyle
changes such as healthy living and eating, or HIV/Aids prevention. In large
cities such as Johannesburg, corporates keep a talented group of
professionals afloat through contracting them to educate workers. In rural
areas the government does not step in where corporates fail.

The sponsorship of arts in schools has steadily declined, Mr Minister, over
the past few years. Is this the fault of education or a lack of co-
operation between the Department of Arts and Culture and the Department of
Education?

While much was gained by expanding funding to the grass roots through the
National Arts Council, something was also lost by weakening the provincial
bodies such as Artscape, the Playhouse and Pact. They were involved in
outreach programmes that were of a high standard and helped bridge the gap
we speak of between excited amateurs and committed professionals.

One of the triumphs of the department’s programme was Tsotsi winning an
Oscar. The moving event held in Parliament to honour Gavin Hood and his
cast must have been a high point for the department. But how many Athol
Fugards are there, and how many Gavin Hoods with connections in Los Angeles
and the networking that comes from living abroad?

We need more support for local scriptwriters and more support at the
highest level of film development to maximise on the storytelling potential
of our diverse and interesting country, so that the excellence of films
like Tsotsi can be repeated often.

The development of crafts has been put on a sound footing through better
accountability, but most craft projects lack integration with the
Department of Trade and Industry to develop the crafts beyond the level of
poverty alleviation into a viable and sustainable world-class craft
industry.

Kufanele mhlonishwa umnyango wezamasiko nobuchwepheshe ubambisane
ngokupheleleyo nomnyango wezemfundo, ukwenza isiqiniseko ukuthi izilimi
lezi ezikhulunywa kulelilizwe zonke ziyagxila emqondweni yabasha, afundayo
nabakhulayo. Izifundazwe zonke kufanele zenze isiqiniseko sokuthi noma
lukhona lukhulunywa ulimi lwesilungu, kodwa kufanele kube khona izilimi
zethu ezibizwa ngezilimi zendabuko ukuze sikwazi ukuthi nalapho la sikhona
izingane zethu zingagcini sezingabelungu abamnyama.

Lokhu kufanele sikwenze sikuqinisekise ukuthi uma kuthiwa kuyaphunyelelwa
esikoleni, akushiwo ngoba umuntu ephumelele isilungu nesibhunu. Kufanele
umuntu aphumelele noma kuyisiZulu kumbe isiTswana ngoba nalolu ulimi
mhlonishwa okufanele lukhulunywe. Ngakho ke izilimi ezikhulunywa yithi
emakhaya kufanele impela zigxiliswe la emnyangweni ukuze bonke abantu
bakwazi ukubona ukuthi walukhuluma ulimi lwakhe usobanibani futhi wamuhle
ekhuluma lona. Akufanele kube ngathi ukhuluma ulimi lwakho ngoba
ungafundile, abafundile bona bakhuluma o because.

Cha, mhlonishwa izilimi lezi ezikhulunywa yithi kufanele kube yizo
ezidlondlobaliswa kakhulu ngoba yizona ebezincishwe amathuba
okudlondlobala. Izingane zethu ke lezi ezifunde ezikoleni ezixube
izinhlanga, kuyingozi enkulu kabi ukuthi zingazazi izilimi zethu ngoba
zikhuluma isilungu esikoleni, ekhaya kanye nase toilet. Akukuhle ke
mhlonishwa ngoba kufanele isilungu kube wulimi nje lokulekelela ukuthi
kuthelwe ukudla kodwa olwethu ulimi lungasali ngemuva.

Ngiyabonga, Somlomo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Minister, the Department of Arts and Culture should work hand in hand with
the Department of Education, to make sure that those languages used in this
country are known by the youth, learners and those still growing up. All
the provinces should see to it that even if there is English being used,
there should also be our indigenous languages, so that wherever we are our
children will not be speaking English only.

We should do this to ensure that if we are talking about the pass rate at
schools, it is not because the person passed English and Afrikaans. The
person must pass even if it is isiZulu or Setswana, because these are
languages to be spoken. Therefore, languages used in our homes should also
be used in the departments, so that we will be exemplary. It shouldn’t be
that you speak your language because you are illiterate; those who are
literate are using words like “because”.

However, Minister, our indigenous languages should be the ones that are
mostly developed, since they were marginalised. For our children who attend
multiracial schools, it is a big danger not to know our languages because
they speak English at school, at home and even in the toilets. It is not
good, Minister, because English should be a language used to communicate
and to get food, but our languages should not be marginalised.

Thank you, Chairperson.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Thank you, Madam Speaker, hon
Minister and hon members. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the march
of over 20 000 women to the Union Buildings on 9 August 1956, I’d like to
dedicate my speech to all those women, and the children of South Africa
who, despite present-day challenges of poverty, disease, unemployment and
violence, toil every day to build a better South Africa and a better world.

I’d like to pay tribute to the late Comrade Nomngqengqo Duna, uMamqocwa,
who passed away in July 2003. She was my friend, my comrade, and my hero:
An inspirational woman who was a repository of knowledge and an embodiment
of the philosophy we are promoting today, a philosophy that recognises that
every woman has a God-given innate leadership ability.

Although Mamqocwa was not as fortunate as some of us to have received an
education beyond primary school level, she was amazingly endowed with
intelligence and an analytical mind. She was naturally gifted. She was a
role model, a brave woman, a great leader in her own right, who
demonstrated that knowledge is not only gained through formal education but
through lived and experiential wisdom. An unsung hero: long live the spirit
of Mamqocwa! [Applause.]

In his opening statement at the Special Event on the Challenges of
Eradicating Poverty for Sustainable Development in 2001, the United Nations
Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, had this to say:


  The poor are seldom poor by choice. Very few people in this world enjoy
  living on hand-outs. Most people know that they are quite capable of
  earning their living by their own efforts, and are eager to do so. But
  they must be given a fair chance to compete. That applies to individuals,
  it applies to companies and it applies to countries.


I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Kofi Annan, and in today’s Budget Vote
debate I would like to focus only on those programmes and projects of the
Department of Arts and Culture that address the challenges of the second
economy through the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative of South
Africa, Asgisa, and the Joint Initiative for Priority Skills Acquisition,
Jipsa. As stated in the Asgisa document, we are convinced that to achieve
Asgisa’s goal of halving unemployment and poverty by 2014, we will have to
pay particular attention to the concerns of women and the youth.

The first programme, which is very close to my heart, is the Mosadi wa Kono-
Kono campaign – “Women of Substance”. It is a programme that aims to
unleash the God-given, innate capabilities possessed by all women,
regardless of their circumstances. The campaign acknowledges and pays
tribute to the incredible leadership role played by ordinary women,
especially in the poorest of communities. It strongly advocates the
development of women leadership and the creation of a cadreship of role
models.

The women involved in this programme play a leading role in their
communities, championing development initiatives that are supported by our
Investing in Culture Fund. We do not expect women to demonstrate excellence
without having invested in the cultivation of that excellence. The Mosadi
wa Kono-Kono campaign has already been launched in six provinces, but
believe me, the fever has already caught on in all nine provinces. Women
and women’s networks have been actively involved in cultural development
and skills training programmes.

At this point, I wish to congratulate one Mosadi wa Kono-Kono who has
recently received the Order of the Baobab, Mama Grace Masuku. She was
recognised for her role in promoting indigenous plants with medicinal value
and passing on her incredible knowledge to large groups of equally
enthusiastic youth.

Later in the year, during the month of August, which is Women’s Month, we
will be hosting an awards ceremony to honour and give due recognition to
women who have done outstanding work in their communities, women who have
played a significant and courageous role in history, as well as those who
have contributed to the development of their communities. The youth will
play a critical role in identifying and profiling Mosadi wa Kono-Kono.

The programme Arts, Social Development and the Youth is also working
towards arts access to all communities, particularly the marginalised
groups, such as children, women, people with disabilities, the inmates in
correctional centres and other vulnerable groups. The range of arts
services includes art therapy and art making for social and economic
development.

Through the support of the Art Therapy Centre, the department is funding
the training of 20 community arts counsellors, who will graduate this year.
With additional support during the current financial year, 12 more
community arts counsellors will have their training upgraded to meet SA
Qualification Authority requirements and will graduate this year as well.
These graduates are currently doing their internships at community
facilities.

In serving marginalised communities, the Department of Arts and Culture
hopes also to strengthen the working relationships and partnerships between
the Departments of Labour, Health, Education, Correctional Services, Social
Development and Trade and Industry, as a shared social cluster mandate.
Services through arts access must be acknowledged and advocated at the
highest level in order to direct appropriate portions of resources into
meaningful development and roll-out nationally.

The other important programme that we hope to launch this month, to
coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Soweto student uprisings, is the
National Youth Expressions campaign. This campaign targets young people and
will provide educational and skills training opportunities, and viable and
sustainable employment opportunities for young people.

It is envisaged that accredited learnerships will be run from the community
art centres and other sites of learning situated within the targeted
communities, and learners will be expected to complete a nine-month
programme that will be assessed on an ongoing basis.

The programme for our correctional facilities is a programme that was
introduced in three of the correctional facilities, but we intend expanding
that to 36 correctional facilities and we are planning to do that together
with the Department of Correctional Services. The programme provides skills
training and a creative outlet for inmates, in the process rehabilitating
them.

We also have an early childhood development programme for the children who
live with their parents within those correctional facilities. We know that
society has a vital role to play in the preservation of the family, whether
it is child-headed households, single parenting, or any other family
structure, and through arts, universal positive human and family values can
and should be promoted.

The department has also introduced a Cultural Fluency campaign. The
campaign speaks to issues of removing barriers to intercultural competence.

The department has recently been seriously considering the role of culture
in human settlements. For us, the overarching challenge is to present
solutions that are not only practical, but incorporate a heightened level
of social consciousness. This may be derived through the suggested approach
of Cultural Planning, which has already taken root in other developing
nations such as Botswana and Cuba, which looks at social inclusion, social
integration, creative expression, cultural diversity and of course funding.

A presentation has already been made to the social cluster but we hope that
we will again work together with the Departments of Housing, Social
Development, Environmental Affairs and Tourism, to look at how this
approach can also be adapted in our country.

The Community Arts Centres programme is a four-year-old programme that has
grown in status from its early beginnings. It is now a fullyfledged
programme. The vision “Towards optimally functioning community arts centres
in South Africa” has led to the development of many strategies that the
department has implemented.

Today we are proud to say that from the agreement between South Africa and
the Flemish government we have come up with a new vision that promotes and
positions community arts centres as institutions of development. We
understand that critical to the sustainability of community arts centres is
effective management and good programmes that address wider community needs
in accordance with this new vision. We are continuously working to ensure
that the centres become relevant to government priorities.

With regard to investing in culture, the Department of Arts and Culture has
already started funding arts, culture and heritage projects that have the
potential to grow as small businesses. Projects range from music
development to craft training and development, jewellery making, leather
works and many other cultural innovations.

A total of R7,5 million has been invested in 15 community arts centres,
Comrade Mbombo. However, we must put in more resources and efforts to
unlock the creative assets that are in the hands of our poor and
disadvantaged people. The department is now aware of what can be achieved
through community arts centres that are strategically situated where the
less privileged and poor people of our country live.

The current debates on underdevelopment and the second economy, and what
can be done to fast-track women and the poor out of the second economy,
urgently require us to rethink these arts and culture centres and afford
them as important mechanisms to fight both underdevelopment and poverty in
our communities.

With this investment, we would like to demonstrate that, given the relevant
support and adequate resources, community arts centres can help to narrow
the poverty gap and create more jobs in communities where they are located.

In keeping up with the relevance of proper and up-to-date use of
information and communication technologies and how these can enhance the
projects and outputs in and around our community arts centres, the
department has partnered with the University of Pretoria to establish,
alongside the community arts centres, women entrepreneurial skills training
centres. These centres will provide skills training and capacity-building
programmes for women. Amongst other things, women will be trained in
computer literacy, entrepreneurship, and business and financial management.


To this end we have already invested R500 000 for a feasibility study,
which will be done by the university. This initiative will be piloted in
Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, Nkosi Holomisa. The department is also working
very closely with the Departments of Trade and Industry, and Communications
on this one.

Following a conference we attended in Brazil last year, where we discussed
the issue of enhancing the creative economy and looking at shaping an
international centre on creative industries, the department also hopes that
this project will plant the seed of shaping a South African centre on
creative industries. The centre’s role is envisaged as serving as a
knowledge bank and clearing house for programmes and activities on creative
industries. It will also link up with the international centre on creative
industries. We will also have an awards ceremony at the end of the year as
an incentive for these community arts centres.

Almost 30% of Investing in Culture funding has already been channelled to
the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme and the Urban
Renewal Programme nodes. This has contributed to the creation of more than
800 jobs. Planned projects for 2006 in music, crafts, design, book
publishing, visual arts, films and television, include the formation of the
national music body, the establishment of the national representative body
for crafters, the launch of the literary heroes campaign, the drafting of
the design and visual arts policy, and skills development for youth in the
field of TV and film studies. I hope those people up there heard that.

At this point, I wish to point out the challenges women face in the film
industry. There are fewer women in the film industry and there are still
fewer African women. Many of them occupy non-creative positions as co-
ordinators, producers etc. The few women who are directors face great
challenges from their male counterparts. They are often seen as and used as
tokens. With the greatest respect, they are filmmakers too as much as their
male counterparts, and they must be offered the same treatment and
opportunities. Is somebody listening up there? This is South Africa, where
equality between women and men and between races is entrenched in our
Constitution.

So, through the NFVF, we need to encourage women to tell and direct their
own stories. And, before I forget, let me once again congratulate the women
and men who made it possible for Tsotsi to win the Oscar Award. [Applause.]

President Thabo Mbeki has on numerous occasions laid emphasis on our
responsibility to play a role in ensuring the success of SADC, the AU and
its programmes, and Nepad. He has also committed this country to continue
engaging the challenges focussing on peace and democracy in the region and
continent, and to further strengthen the African Union.

As South Africans, we are also informed by the principles and protocols of
the AU. The Department of Arts and Culture will be looking into issues
pertaining to the relationship between cultural diversity and peace-making
efforts on the African continent. In this respect, the department has
commissioned the HSRC to look into and develop a framework on the
relationship between cultural diversity and peace and security in Africa.
Conflict between states in Africa has decreased significantly over the past
decade but civil wars and conflicts within states persist in some of these
countries.

Cultural diversity, which should demonstrate the richness of a country, is
used by some leaders to position themselves in the struggle for political
power. Cultural differences are then used to label others as inferior in
the same way as the colonisers psychologically and physically enforced the
identity of others on the natives. As such, cultural differences can be
used to justify not only political dominance but also economic dominance.

Our sense of identity is rooted in our past and where we come from, and
includes a heritage springing from the very cradle of civilisation, while
on the other hand we are bombarded by the onslaught of globalisation which
both threatens the preservation of this cultural heritage as well as
challenges the promotion and protection of cultural diversity.

I just want to move on to the project that I think is the most important,
before my time runs out. We had the Events Indaba, the first of its kind,
which was held in September 2005 at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, to highlight
the challenges that confront the technical production industry and to
explore the issues of opening up economic opportunities and industry
governance. The technical production industry is made up of, amongst
others, academics, technicians, engineers, stage designers, production
companies, events organisers and managers and corporate bodies.

The indaba created a fertile ground for redress in so far as the make-up
and composition of the industry is concerned. International speakers who
were invited to the indaba applauded the department and the industry for
its initiative and gave landmark pointers on how issues of a common nature
could be addressed.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Minister, I regret your time has
expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: In my five seconds that I have, I
just want to thank everybody and the Minister for his support, the
officials of the departmental for their support, and my supporter, Melanie
Hess, who is the person that I really lean upon in the Ministry. Thank you
very much.

Mnu B Z ZULU: Sihlalo, ngiphakama lapha egameni likaKhongolose ukweseka
lolu hlahlo lwesabiwomali olwethulwa umhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe lapha kule
Ndlu. Lubonakala luzobeka esimweni esingcono uMnyango wezobuCiko namaSiko
ukuba ukwazi ukubhekana nezinselelo eziqondene nawo. Siyazi ukuthi
kunemizamo emikhulu eyenziwa umnyango ukuba izilimi zonke esizikhulumayo
zigcine nazo sezinikezwe isithunzi sokuhlonishwa ezikufaneleyo.

UMnyango wezobuCiko namaSiko kazwelonke uzokwethula umkhankaso omkhulu
wokubhala izincwadi zokukhuthaza abantu baseNingizimu Afrika ukuthi bakwazi
ukubhala nokufunda. Uzokwenza lokhu ubambisene nabashicileli bezincwadi
futhi lomkhankaso uzokwaziswa ngezilimi zonke ezikhona kuleli zwe.
Kuyathokozisa futhi ukuzwa ukuthi umnyango kaNgqongqoshe ufuna ukubhekana
nenselelo yokuvuselela ukubhala kabusha kwezincwadui ezindala ngezilimi
zabomdabu ezahlukeneyo kusukela onyakenikhulu we-19.

Lezi zincwadi sezitholakala kuphela ezinqolobaneni zokugcinwa kwamagugu.
Inselelo evelayo lapha ekubhalweni kwezincwadi ezindala kabusha ngeyokuba
sibe nemininingwane egciniwe yothisha nolwazi lwabo ekuhumusheni izincwadi
ezibhalwe ngesilungu bezisa ezilimini zabomdabu. Lokhu sekuyobavulela
amathuba emisebenzi. Izokhumbula le Ndlu ukuthi izolo uqabane Hlengiwe
Mgabadeli uphawule kabanzi ngezincwadi ezindala nezingasatholakali ezitolo
okungasenasidingo sokuba ngiziphinde lapha. Okukhulu ngazo ukuthi nxa
ubuzifunda, ubugcina kukhona isifundo ositholileyo.

Umnyango kuzomele ubhekane nalezi zinselelo ezilandelayo: Abantu bakithi
bakhombisa ukungabinawo umndlandla nokuphokophela ukukhuluma nokukhuthaza
ukuthuthukiswa izilimi zabo; okwesibili, abashicileli bezincwadi nabo
abasazemukeli izincwadi ezibhalwe ngezilimi zabomdabu ngoba kazithengwa
kamuva nje ezitolo; okwesithathu, uma uya ezitolo eziningi ezithengisa
izincwadi kuleli zwe, awusazitholi emashalofini izincwadi ezibhalwe
ngezilimi zabantu; nokuthi kulukhuni kakhulu namhla kumuntu oqala ukubhala
incwadi ukuba athole abashicileli ngoba babuka ukuthi unalo yini igama
kwezokubhalwa kwezincwadi.

Kuhle sikhumbuzane kule Ndlu ukuthi intsha yakuleli zwe yavuka umbhejazane
ngo-1976. Enye yezinto eyayizilwela neyazichitha ukuqonelwa kwezilimi
zabomdabu ngezezinye izizwe. Kusanda kuphuma ucwaningo oluthi abantu
abaningi balelizwe bakhuluma izilimi zabo zomdabu uma behlezi nemindeni
emakhaya, kodwa uma befika emsebenzini baqala ukukhuluma isilungu baze
bakhululwe ukubuyela emakhaya ntambama. Ukufunda izincwadi kuyamakha umuntu
bese ekwazi ukukhetha kahle indlela angathanda ukuba ayilandele ekuphileni
kwakhe, futhi afunde nobuciko obunonophele bokubekwa kolimi lwakhe
alukhulumayo, kukhulise nomqondo wakhe.

Sibonakala njengabantu abangenayo intshisekelo yokubhala kanti futhi noma
sesibhala amanoveli, imidlalo kanye nezindaba ezimfushane azithengwa
ezitolo ngenxa yokuthi zibhalwa ngolimi lwabantu abangenamndlandla
wokufunda izincwadi zabo. Kanti nezizwe esiphila nazo zibonakala sengathi
azizimisele ukufunda izilimi zethu ngoba azinayo ingxaki yokukhuluma nathi
ngolwazi.

Izilimi zethu seziphenduke izintandane ngokwesela abantu abazikhulumayo.
Ulimi olungakhulunywayo lungagcina lushabalele lwaphela ebusweni bomhlaba.
Ukubhekana nale nselelo yokungabibikho kwezincwadi ezibhalwe ngezilimi
zabansundu, kungakuhle umnyango uhlinzekele uxhaso lokukhuthaza abazobhala
izincwadi ngezilimi zase-Afrika. UMqulu weNkululeko kaKhongolose uthi ...
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B Z ZULU: Chairperson, I stand up on behalf of the ANC to support this
Budget Vote that is presented by the hon Minister in this House. It looks
like it will improve conditions in the Department of Arts and Culture so
that it will be able to overcome the challenges it is facing. We know that
there are efforts being made by the department for all the languages we
speak to get the dignity they deserve.

The national Department of Arts and Culture will announce a big campaign
about writing books to encourage South Africans to learn how to read and
write. The department will work together with the publishers and this
campaign will be in all official languages. It is with great pleasure that
I hear that the department is in the process of reviewing all the old books
written in indigenous languages from 1900 onwards.

These books are now only found in archives. The challenge that arises in
rewriting old books is one of gathering the preserved details from teachers
and utilising their knowledge of translating books from the English
language into African languages. This will create job opportunities for
them. This House will remember that yesterday Comrade Hlengiwe Mgabadeli
commented about old books which are no longer found in bookshops, and there
is no need for me even to mention those books here. The importance of these
books lies in the lesson that one will get when reading them.

The department has to face the following challenges: Firstly, our people
show no enthusiasm for and interest in speaking and encouraging the
development of their own languages. Secondly, publishers are no longer
accepting books written in our indigenous languages because lately they are
no longer bought. Thirdly, when one goes to the bookshops of this country
one no longer finds books on the shelves written in our indigenous
languages, and today it is difficult for new writers because the publishers
want to know if the writer submitting the manuscript has made a name for
himself.

We need to remind each other in this House that the youth of this country
fought gallantly in 1976. One of the things they fought for and did away
with was the disrespect by other nations for the indigenous languages.
Recently research has shown that most people speak their indigenous
languages when they are at home with their families, but when they reach
their workplace they start to speak English till they go back home in the
afternoon. Reading books moulds a person and makes him able to choose the
way of life he wants to lead, and then that person will learn the art of
using the language he speaks to develop his mind.

We are seen as people who do not have enthusiasm and when novels, dramas
and short stories are written, they are not bought because they are written
in the language of people who do not have an interest in reading their own
books. Even the other nations we live with show no interest in learning our
languages, because they have no problems when interacting with us.

Our languages are marginalised because they do not have speakers. The
language that is not used ends up dying. To face this challenge of not
having books written in our African languages, it will be better for the
department to provide funding to encourage those who will write books in
African languages. The ANC Freedom Charter says ...]

... all cultural treasures of mankind shall be open to all by the free
exchange of books.

Umtapo wolwazi lwezincwadi usemqoka kakhulu esizweni ukwandisa ulwazi kepha
umnyango wakho, mhlonishwa, usabhekene nenkulu inselelo ngokungabibikho
kwemitapo yolwazi ezindaweni zabantu emakhaya. Inqolobane yokugcinwa
kwezilimi zabomdabu e-Unisa ivule uphiko lokukhuthaza ukubhalwa
nokukhulunywa kwezilimi zomdabu e-Afrika. Kunabhala abanjengoSolwazi uMaja
Serudu, u-O K Matsepe kanye nabanye abenza lomsebenzi. Siyakuqonda ukuthi
ukwakhiwa kwemitapo yolwazi yezincwadi akusiwo umsebenzi womnyango wakho
kepha kuwumsebenzi womasipala. Kuyathokoziza-ke kakhulu kodwa ukuzwa ukuthi
umnyango wakho ubeke usabelo esingangezigidi ezinhlanu zamaRandi [R5
million] kulo nyaka wezimali ukwenza ucwaningo lokwakhiwa kwemitapo yolwazi
yezincwadi ezindaweni zomasipala.

Kanti khona ngaleso sikhathi kuhlinzekwe imali eyisigidigidi esisodwa
samaRandi [R1 billion] ezosetshenziswa iminyaka emithathu ukwakha imitapo
yolwazi yezincwadi kusukela onyakeni ozayo wezimali kuya phezulu. Ngakho
kunikeza ithemba ukuthi umnyango uyayisukumela inselelo yokufinyelelisa
ulwazi esizweni lokufundwa kwezincwadi. Lena yindaba engakaze inakwe
ngohulumeni bengcindezelo kanye nabezabelo kodwa namhlanje izindawo ezifana
namalokishi, izikole nezindawo eziphethwe amakhosi sezizoba nemitapo
yezincwadi.

Uhulumeni oholwa uKhongolose uyohlala njalo eyisixazululo sokuthi lapho
okukhona khona izinkinga kube khona isixazululo sokuthi siqhubeka kanjani
kuleyo nkinga. Bekuyoba kuhle-ke mhlonishwa ukuthi uma umnyango sewenza
lolu cwaningo ngokwakhiwa kwemitapo yolwazi ubambisane noMnyango wezeMfundo
kazwelonke ukuze mhlawumbe lemitapo iqale ezikoleni. Kuzodingeka futhi
ukuba kuqeqeshwe othisha abanolwazi lokuphatha izincwadi ababizwa ngokuthi
ama-Librarians.

Okunye okusemqoka esisilele emuva kakhulu kukho ukubhalwa komlando wethu
eNingizimu Afrika. Uma singabhali lutho, siyogcina sesibizwa ngezifiki
kulelizwe lokhokho bethu ngoba kungekho esiyokushiyela izizukulwane ukuthi
singabomnsinsi wokuzimilela kuleli zwe. Ngiyasesekela-ke lesi sabiwomali
esisethula lapha. Ngiyabonga. [Kuphele isikhathi.] [Ihlombe.] (Translation
of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Libraries are very important to the nation to broaden our knowledge, but
your department, hon Minister, is still facing a big challenge regarding
the shortage of libraries in rural areas. Unisa’s indigenous language
archive has established a unit to encourage the use of indigenous languages
in Africa. There are professors like Prof Solwazi Maja Serudu, Prof O K
Matsepe and others who are doing this job. We understand that the building
of the libraries is not your department’s duty, but the duty of the
municipalities. It is great to know that your department has put aside an
amount of R5 million during this financial year to do research into the
building of libraries by municipalities.

At the same time there is the provision of R1 billion that will be utilised
for three years to build libraries from next year onwards. It gives hope
that the department is addressing the challenge of cascading knowledge and
the reading of books down to the nation. The apartheid and homeland
governments never addressed this issue, but today places like townships,
schools and tribal areas will have libraries.

The ANC-led government will forever find a solution where there is a
problem. It would be good, hon Minister, if your department, in conducting
the research into the building of libraries, could collaborate with the
national Department of Education so that schools could be first to use
these libraries. There is also a need for the training of teachers to
become librarians.
Another important thing we are left with is the writing of our South
African history. If we do not write anything, we will end up being called
foreigners in this country of our forefathers, because there will be
nothing that we left behind to show that we originated from this country. I
support this Budget Vote presented here. Thank you. [Time
expired.][Applause.]]

Mr H B CUPIDO: Madam Chairperson, hon members, the 22% increase in the
budget is really to be welcomed. The ACDP also welcomes the initiatives by
the Department of Arts and Culture with regard to the promotion of language
awareness among South Africans. Language is one of the most significant
components of cultural heritage and identity. It is a means by which people
indicate and develop a sense of belonging to a particular culture, while at
the same time striving towards a sense of national pride as South Africans.

At the dawn of our democracy in this country, the prevailing political
discourse centred on the concept of a melting pot ideal that embraced the
idea of a rainbow nation, and promoted a culture of unity within diversity.
At the heart of this respect for diversity was a commitment to ensure the
survival of all our languages.

The proposed awareness campaign of the National Language Policy Framework
will play a major role in bringing to the fore the needs and aspirations of
various communities with regard to language issues. I would also like to
support those members who cautioned against the overuse of English in all
our spheres, and the neglect of the mother-tongue languages in our country.

The ACDP is further encouraged by the initiatives to promote the
recognition of sign language in South Africa, and a word of thanks goes to
those who are translating in the House itself. The development of hearing-
impaired individuals is further hampered by the fact that they are
generally excluded from access to information. The recent attempt by SABC
television to address the needs of the hearing-impaired in their news and
other broadcasts is already setting an excellent example for the
mainstreaming of sign language, and increases public awareness of the needs
of the hearing-impaired. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Geagte Voorsitter, die VF Plus neem kennis van die goeie
werk wat hierdie departement onder sy program 3 doen. Program 3 is die een
wat gaan oor die bevordering van die elf amptelike tale. Daar is sonder
twyfel ’n groter sensitiwiteit in hierdie Parlement maar ook daar buite vir
die verskillende tale. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Hon Chairperson, the FF Plus takes note of the good work
that this department is doing under its programme 3. Programme 3 deals with
the promotion of the eleven official languages. There is without a doubt a
greater sensitivity in this Parliament, but also outside, for the various
languages.]

In that sense I agree with the hon Ndlovu. I see these little black kids
out there with cheesecutters on, speaking Oxford English to each other, and
they cannot speak to their grandparents in their own language. Really, that
worries me.

Die stryd van kleiner tale in Suid-Afrika, soos in die res van die wêreld,
is altyd teen die groter tale, soos byvoorbeeld Engels. Baie
staatsdepartemente en ander instellings in Suid-Afrika ignoreer steeds die
Grondwet se standpunte hieroor. Ek kan nie sien hoe hierdie departement
hierdie stryd vir kleiner tale teen ’n groot taal kan wen sonder wetgewing
wat krag en tande aan die departement en aan Pansat gaan gee nie.
Taalwetgewing sal dit vir almal makliker maak om te weet wat mag en wat mag
nie, en ook om die departement en Pansat se hande te sterk. Ek weet nie
waarom ons nog steeds wag om dit vir onsself makliker te maak nie.

Program 6 van hierdie departement het as doel om Suid-Afrika se argiewe uit
te brei en goed te bestuur. Een van die probleme van alle argiewe is dat
bergingspasie te min word. Tans moet argiewe ’n vraelys van die departement
voltooi oor hoe hulle die argiewe aanwend. Daar is ’n gerug - ek weet nie
of dit waar is nie; ek dink dit is net ‘n gerug - dat die departement op
grond van hierdie vraelys van die argiefstukke, veral vanuit die tyd voor
1994, ontslae wil raak.

Ek kan moeilik glo dat enige persoon wat erns met die geskiedenis maak,
ongeag van watter kant jy kyk, van enige argiefstuk sal wil ontslae raak
nie. Meneer die Minister, is daar so ’n vraelys? Wat is die doel van die
vraelys? U antwoord kan hierdie gerugte, dat die regering alles voor 1994
wil vernietig, die nek inslaan.

Ek dink die departement se rekord in terme van hulp, ook aan monumente van
alle taalgroepe, bevestig dat dit nie die benadering is om ’n streep deur
als te trek nie. Ek het baie krities na die Minister se toespraak geluister
en ek moet ongelukkig sê ek het min gevind waarvan ek verskil het. Die VF
Plus sal hierdie begrotingspos steun. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The struggle of minor languages in South Africa, as in the rest of the
world, is always against major languages, for example English. Many state
departments and other institutions in South Africa still ignore the
Constitution’s position with regard to this. I cannot see how this
department can win this struggle for the minor languages against a major
language without legislation which will give power and authority to the
department and PanSALB. Language legislation will make it easier for
everybody to know what is allowed and what is n’t, and will also strengthen
the hand of the department and PanSALB. I do not know why we are still
waiting to make it easier for ourselves.

The objective of programme 6 of this department is to expand the archives
of South Africa and to manage them well. One of the problems of all
archives is that there is too little storage space. Archives must currently
complete a departmental questionnaire as to how they utilise the archives.
There is a rumour – I do not know if it is true; I think it is just a
rumour – that the department wants to get rid of archived documents,
especially those from the period before 1994 by means of this
questionnaire. I find it difficult to believe that any person who is
serious about history, irrespective from which side you are looking at it,
would want to get rid of any archived document. Mr Minister, is there such
a questionnaire? What is the purpose of the questionnaire? Your answer can
put an end to these rumours that the government wants to destroy everything
from before 1994.

I think the record of the department in terms of assistance, also to
monuments of all language groups, confirms that this department’s approach
is not to draw a line through everything. I listened very critically to the
Minister’s speech and must unfortunately say that I found very little with
which I disagreed. The FF Plus will support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]]

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister, hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, the ANC supports the budget.

During the apartheid era one of the instruments that was used to oppress
the people was language. If you could not speak especially Afrikaans during
that time, you would not be offered a job. It was therefore compulsory for
you to take Afrikaans at school as one of your subjects. This was imposed
without any consultation.

Hon Van der Walt, it is not our fault that we keep on referring to
apartheid. This is history. When they named the streets and cities, surely
they found these roads had names. They changed them to “Paul Kruger”, some
of them were changed to “Verwoerd” and other names, without consulting
anybody. If you go to Gauteng, you find Pretorius Street, and when you go
to Cape Town you find Pretorius Street. These are the very same people who
want to be consulted. Fortunately for them, because the ANC is a
transparent and democratic government, it will always consult.
[Interjections.]

In our election manifesto we pledged ourselves to a vision for 2014 to
build a better South Africa during the second decade of freedom. The ANC
believes that, working together over the next 10 years, we can build a
South Africa where every South African will be able progressively to
exercise constitutional rights and enjoy the dignity of freedom.

When South Africa’s first democratically elected governing party came into
being in 1994, it restored human dignity, achievement of equality, and the
advancement of human rights and freedoms as its values. South Africa was
colonised by the Afrikaners and the English, and these two languages were
predominant over the other languages. If you go to a publishing company to
ask for a book in an indigenous language, you won’t find it in stock.
Instead you will be told that it will be ordered.

I can quote a few other African countries that were colonised. Mozambique
and Angola were colonised by the Portuguese, and used Portuguese as their
official language. In Zimbabwe, English was the official language. Ivory
Coast and Nigeria were colonised by France, and therefore French was their
spoken language. The DRC was colonised by Belgium and hence they spoke
Belgian.

The Freedom Charter, which was adopted at the Congress of the People on 16
June 1955 in Kliptown, states:


   All people shall have equal rights to use their own languages and to
   develop their own folk culture and customs.


We will therefore not impose our language on other people, as they did.

We are dealing with a human tragedy that apartheid exerted on our society.
This is not only about bringing back our indigenous languages, but to
provide for the recognition, implementation and furtherance of
multilingualism in the Republic of South Africa. It is about the
development of previously marginalised languages.

The budget is a tool we use to transform a society that was for many years
oppressed by the beneficiaries of apartheid, who had the capacity to
support resistance to change. The Pan South African Language Board received
transfer funding and is responsible for creating a conducive environment
for the development, usage and promotion of 11 languages. It is for this
reason that we see steady increases in expenditure at an average annual
rate of 14,1% from 2002-03 to 2008-09.

Expenditure on the Pan South African Language Board increases faster over
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, from R27 million in 2005-06 to R47,1
million in 2008-09, at a rate of 20,4%. The increase is to improve the
institution’s head office capacity, and to increase language development
and the promotion of multilingualism.

In his state of the nation address the President of the country said that
our people are firmly convinced that our country has entered its age of
hope. We do hope that PanSALB will continue to improve the institution’s
capacity.
Section 185 of our Constitution provides for the protection of the rights
of cultural, religious and linguistic communities. It is through this
Constitution that today we have written languages.

In the year 2005 the National Language Service programme met most of its
targets. However, there are delays in finalising and implementing the
national language policy, which we hope will receive more attention over
the 2006 MTEF.

There was a decrease of 22% in the overall demand for English translation
and editing this year, due to the lower demand from the Departments of
Foreign Affairs, Science and Technology, and Arts and Culture. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M M MDLALOSE: Madam Chairperson, my dear Ministers, colleagues, it is
heartwarming to hear the Ministers talking about progress in our
department. It is heartwarming to hear that there is advancement and there
is promotion of arts and culture. But as a member of the committee, I have
some problems with this very committee.

Firstly, I would say that an important part of Nadeco’s approach is to look
for positives in any given situation. Problematic governance arrangements
around the department and the portfolio committee make it difficult to find
positives on this occasion.

Let me begin with the portfolio committee. The committee has become
demoralised and ineffective, especially concerning its oversight role. The
frequent changing of chairpersons and the coming and going of members of
the committee has left the committee with a poor sense of direction and
function.

Nadeco calls for the Chair of Chairs to intervene and help the committee to
re-establish itself. Proper oversight over the department must be restored.
Then there is the department, which also displays a certain reluctance when
it comes to accounting to Parliament.

Siyazimema izinhloko zeminyango, siyakhuluma, siyacela ukuthi kube khona
ukusebenzisana. Akucaci ukuthi inkinga iyiphi. Sithola izikhalo njalo
ezinhlangothini zombili. Izinhloko zeminyango ezithinta umnyango wezamasiko
nobuchwepheshe zibonakalisa ukuba nenkinga. Siyanxusa ke kungqongqoshe
ukuthi ake kube khona ukusebenzisana nokubambisana sikwazi ukuthi silingise
ngoba akusebenzeki kahle. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[We invite all the heads of departments. We are urging co-operation. It is
still not clear as to where the problem lies. We always receive complaints
from both parties. The heads of departments which are in the cluster of the
Department of Arts and Culture appear to be having a problem. We humbly
make a request, hon Minster, that there must be collaboration and co-
operation so that we can make some corrections because we cannot work
effectively.]

I am not proud to be a member of this committee at the moment. But I do
wish for progress and I do have a passion for this committee. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr H P MALULEKA: Hon Minister, Deputy Minister, hon members, and esteemed
guests, when the Congress of the People declared in 1955 that the doors of
learning and culture shall be opened for all, arts and culture, like other
aspects of our lives, was under attack by the apartheid regime. People were
not free to express and nurture their artistic prowess in the way that they
could best do.

I would like to cite a case in point here, and that is The Blue Notes,
which was led by Chris Macgregor, with its members being Mongezi Feza,
Louis Moholo, Mbizo Dyani and Dudu Pukwana. These were some of our most
outstanding musicians, but because they were a racially mixed band, they
were not accepted by the obnoxious apartheid regime.

While the international community revered their music, the rest of us were
denied the pleasure of enjoying the beautiful melodies that they created.
Sadly, they are amongst those who were not fortunate enough to come back
home to a democratic South Africa because, unfortunately, they all died in
exile, except Louis Moholo. This speech is dedicated to Chris Macgregor and
The Blue Notes.

Many musicians, although they are no longer trapped in the claws of
apartheid, continue to be exploited by the music industry and criminals who
pirate their work. We want to encourage musicians and other artists to
organise themselves and fight this exploitation that leads to some of them,
like the legendary Mahlathini, dying as paupers.

Democratic South Africa offers new opportunities, which only informed and
organised artists will benefit from. Internationally, strong unions protect
musicians, which ensures that artists have a strong safety net. We hope
that the industry will take advantage of opportunities provided in the
proposed security initiatives of the department, and that there will be co-
operation with musicians inside and outside our country.

The festivals that take place in some of our provinces, such as Macufe in
the Free State and the International Jazz Festival in Cape Town, provide an
opportunity for up-and-coming musicians and seasoned musicians to network
with musicians from our continent and the international arena.

These festivals do not only give jobs to our artists but also contribute to
cultural tourism. The ANC supports this budget because it seeks to realise
our objective of promoting arts and culture for social cohesion.

The work done to help promote the film and video industry has considerably
assisted in popularising this industry. It is encouraging when we see that
young and emerging practitioners from previously disadvantaged communities,
who could not participate meaningfully in this industry, are afforded an
opportunity to compete and prove their worth.

South Africa happens to be the single most substantial moviegoing community
in the world. This testifies to what has been repeatedly lamented by would-
be moviegoers, that they would watch movies if they are told their stories.
They said, ``Tell us our stories, and we will go to the movies in droves.’’

One myth that this emerging market has exploded is that for a movie to
sell, it has to have an American superstar. This proves that for our
proudly South African movies to sell we do not need Halle Berry to play
Brenda Fassie, or Denzel Washington to play Madiba. [Interjections.] Not
one of those movies, in which these international stars were leading
actors, has ever won an award.

We have the success of box office movies like Yesterday, Gums and Noses,
Mama Jack, Max and Mona and others, just to cite a few examples. South
Africa is popular at many if not most of the film festivals and markets.
Everyone wants to sign a co-production with South Africa. America, Europe
and the United Kingdom have dominated the silver screen, and audiences now
want new and fresh stories, and this is what we have to offer.

However, what is needed is more money to encourage this excitement. The
creative industries are identified as one of several sectors of our economy
for investments to boost accelerated growth.

According to Acumen, a business and management magazine, creative
industries include graphic design, advertising, film and video, music,
performing arts, fashion design and product design. New media such as the
Internet, cellphones, publishing, radio and television, visual arts,
architecture and crafts, poetry and writing, exist symbiotically with some
of these areas identified above.

We commend government for seeing these areas as having huge potential.
Investment in them will certainly have major multiple effects on the
economy and will thus eradicate poverty and create jobs. The magazine
further says on this matter that, in London, creative industries are now
the second biggest job generators.

Given the depth of talent in our country, all of us in the public and
private sector, and in municipalities, must seriously increase our
investment in these industries. Film and video as well as music are
critical components of our creative industries. To date, the Ministry and
the department have given important financial support to these areas.

The listening campaigns have been very helpful in informing the Ministry
regarding the challenges facing these industries. We are, however
concerned, Minister, about the static fund of the National Film and Video
Foundation. Some of the huge film successes last year and also this year
are the result of vigorous networking and funding that they gave to the
producers.

The fact that they had to stop further requests for film and video is
unfortunate. We appeal to Cabinet to heed the calls for additional support.
This appeal goes to others in the private sector as well as those who have
shown that it can be done. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M T LIKOTSI: Deputy Chairperson, Kim Il Soong writes: “ Truly realistic
and revolutionary literature and art show the people the most beautiful and
the most noble things of human life.” It is impossible to imagine life
without literature and art. The PAC of Azania aspires to a society that has
developed fully in all fields of the economy, culture, ideology and
morality.

It is a truly popular society where people of a new type, who have
intellectual, moral and physical integrity and are developed in a
comprehensive way, fully enjoy rich and cultured lives as masters of nature
and society. In building this great society, writers and artists play a
significant role, holding a very important position, which no one can
replace. This is what humanity is all about.

Actors too should explore reality, otherwise they cannot accurately
represent new characters in line with how people are changing and
developing. The actor is a direct and independent creator of a character.
Without the actor it is impossible to create a character in film and,
accordingly, to carry out a screen presentation.

The PAC of Azania advocates for a cultural revolution thoroughly, training
all the working people to be builders of socialism and to equip them with a
profound knowledge and nature and society, and a high level of culture and
technology.

The PAC strongly believes in building a true people’s revolutionary
culture, which serves the socialist working people. Our people should
oppose a cultural infiltration of colonial and capitalist forces, and the
tendency to return to the past and to protect the national cultural
heritage, taking it over and developing it in keeping with socialist
teachings. The PAC supports this Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G LEKGETHO: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, members of Parliament,
citizens in the gallery and elsewhere, let me, at the outset, inform you
that the ANC supports the budget. It gives me great pleasure to stand
before you and address you on deeply emotional issues related to heritage.
Heritage is usually defined as what we inherit, what we value or what we
want to pass on to future generations in building a nonracial, nonsexist,
democratic and prosperous South Africa.

Cultural heritage encompasses any cultural form that is building language
and arts that we value as a society. Intangible heritage is comprised of
those symbols, symbolisms, living heritage, music, dance and narrative
forms that are part of our heritage resources. Heritage is a very broad
concept, encompassing places. It is an object that has primary significance
to a particular group of people.

As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of 16 June 1976, the ANC declares that
the Department of Arts and Culture will lead in the transformation of arts
and culture and the promotion of a South African identity, drawing on the
rich heritage of our country. The ANC will lead the promotion of national
symbols as a mechanism for building a new South African identity,
particularly by adopting the national anthem of the country as an official
version for ANC gatherings.

The ANC will protect its own cultural heritage, including history, as part
of a major contribution to the South African national identity, and ensure
ways to keep the history alive so that it passes from generation to
generation.

Government will expedite the programme to develop heritage sites and
historical memory at local level through all forms of remembrance. The
government should accelerate programmes to develop and promote all
languages in our country, particularly previously disadvantaged languages.

The indigenous knowledge systems of our country and the African continent
and the liberation processes must be promoted and protected as part of our
transformation process and as an integral part of the New Partnership for
Africa’s Development.

Let me inform you and the Parliament of an important historical site in
Lehurutshe, a sub-region in the North West province. Tswenyane is the ruins
of the fallen kingdom of Chief Moiloa. It remains a tourist attraction and
heritage site to locals and foreigners alike.

Lotlamoreng Dam in Mafikeng used to be the epitome of a rich cultural
heritage in the form of a cultural village established by Credo Mutwa. The
Lotlamoreng Dam cultural village had Zulu, Ndebele, Sotho, Swazi, Setswana,
Xhosa and Tsonga villages, which taught people about these cultures and
languages. In the same village, Mozambican and Zimbabwean craftsmen and
women had a flourishing arts and craft-market. We must revive this village.
In fact I want to invite the Minister to come and see this art.

The departmental budget should also be used to revive and instil a culture
of patriotism through institutions like the Montshiwa Cultural Village,
Tswenyane Heritage Site and Lotlamoreng Dam Cultural Village. It is
important that we begin to erect statues and monuments of indigenous
national traditional leaders like Montshiwa, Moshweshwe, Shaka and Hintsa
in government buildings, national roads, and also in entrances and exits of
municipalities of these kings and queens.

The national orders, national symbols and our national anthem and coat of
arms must instil patriotism, nation-building and reconciliation.

We owe it to our children to cherish, protect, restore and promote our
heritage. From today and for years to come, we must not kill birds, burn
this monument, destroy or eat our national birds, and destroy flowers, fish
and animals.

The archives legislation has been promulgated to manage national
institutions. This National Archives of South Africa Act, Act 43 of 1996,
amended by the Cultural Laws Amendment Act, Act 36 of 2001, provides for
national archives and records services. [Time expired.] Ke a leboga. [Thank
you.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): You know, hon Minister, I think next
time we have this debate, you should ask the members of this committee to
each give us either a song, a poem or a little dance when they speak here.
[Laughter.]

Mr R B BHOOLA: Chairperson, rooting ourselves in an extremely diverse
society with a fusion of cultures and traditions and a bouquet of various
forms of arts, South Africa may boast of being affluent in this respect.

It is true that creative communities and activities across the globe are
increasingly becoming the largest generators of economic activities. A
country as affluent in this arena as South Africa needs to seize the
opportunities to promote ourselves in the global arena, and thus benefit
our economy.

In view of these endeavours and the objectives of the Department of Arts
and Culture, the MF welcomes the budget allocations for 2006. Along with
our many cultures and traditions, we have the variety of languages spoken
in South Africa. We are pleased at the department’s efforts to engage in a
nationwide language awareness campaign through the National Language Policy
Framework.

We, however, express our concern as to why the department has only managed
to employ 39 interpreters out of an intended 80. What has been done to meet
the shortfall?
We are pleased that the heritage of our nation is being extended to our
learners who, at this young age, need to be taught the values of our great
South Africa so that preservation and appreciation begin here. The MF is
pleased about the department’s Flag in Every School project that it has
embarked upon jointly with the Department of Education.

We are, however, concerned about the progress the department is making in
respect of the nine provincial heritage resource agencies that it targeted
to establish by April 2006. What has been achieved in this regard?

The MF believes that the skills our people deliver through arts and culture
may be utilised to benefit our economy by alleviating poverty, creating
jobs and boosting our tourism revenue. The idea, however, should also be to
ensure proper representation, preservation, and inculcation of all cultures
and traditions in South Africa. We are pleased with the efforts of the
KwaZulu-Natal department of arts and culture. The MF supports the Budget
Vote. [Time expired.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): I’ll give an extra minute to anybody
who gives us a poem in Siswati. I now call the hon Gololo.

Mr C L GOLOLO: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, colleagues of
the department, members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, the ANC
supports this Budget Vote.

Allow me to focus my speech on the importance of a library, which is a
nation’s treasure house of published materials. This is a centre of
excellence, providing access to its valuable resources to society at large.
It facilitates the provision of knowledge and information to all those who
are literate.

The National Library Act, Act 92 of 1998, provides for the national library
to collect, record, preserve and make available to the South African public
materials, including national heritage documentation, published in print
and other forms.

The Department of Arts and Culture has the mammoth task of promoting the
culture of reading and writing in all languages among the youth and elderly
citizens in order to deal with the backlog in libraries in our country,
particularly in the remote areas. A very good example is Mpumalanga
province, where they are currently providing library services through
mobile libraries and book boxes where fully established libraries are
unavailable.

I want to call upon all public representatives to lead by example and adopt
a library in their respective constituencies in order to inculcate the
culture of reading in our society. [Applause.] This will not only sharpen
their minds, but it will also produce a decent and well-educated people
that will eventually develop and contribute to a better life for all. This
budget is indeed bringing hope to our people in this age of hope.

The higher education libraries hold the bulk of South Africa’s scientific
and scholarly information resources and fulfil more than half of all the
interlibrary loan requests. Pressures on higher education libraries include
the redistribution of educational resources, rising prices and declining
student numbers. These libraries have responded by forming consortia,
looking at access and exploring digital resources.

By July 2004 the Department of Education was working on the policy
framework for school libraries. This draft document locates itself within
the context of the sociopolitical and education transformation process that
is driven by the new legislative framework and by the educational paradigm
shift to outcomes-based education.

The draft policy argues that educators and learners will only be able to
access an OBE curriculum if they have access to learning resources. This
has implications for the way school libraries conceptualise, manage and
provide resources.

The draft policy recommends different models of school libraries to provide
access to resources for learners and draws attention to the relationship
between the school library, the curriculum and learning resources. It also
supports the view that the school library is a facility ideally suited for
providing learners with a wide range of curricula.

Nine bekunene, asimhalalisele hulumende wetfu lowetama ngato tonkhe

Phela, sibokhumbula kwekutsi sive lesite emalayibrari singeke sibe nato

[Tandla.] (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[Ladies and gentlemen, let us congratulate our government, which has made
it imperative for all schools in the country to have libraries. It is
important to remember that a nation without libraries cannot produce a well-
equipped society to bring about the necessary development in innovations
and technology.]

The Department of Arts and Culture is erecting a R165 million building to
house the National Library of South Africa in Pretoria. The project will be
executed by the Department of Public Works. There will be about 33 000
usable square metres of space for its book collections, reading rooms and
other facilities currently scattered over various premises around Pretoria.
The building will provide about 1 800 seats for library users, a marked
improvement on the 130 seats available now. The site will become part of
the Government Boulevard, linking the city centre with the Union Buildings.
Its central location will benefit the many users who rely on public
transport. Internet access will also be available to all users of the
facility.

Regarding the SA Library for the Blind, this library provides a national
library information service free of charge, as far as is reasonably
possible, to serve blind and print-handicapped readers in South Africa.
Blindlib produces documents in special media such as Braille and audio
formats.

As a nation that strives to be competent in the global economy and play a
pivotal role in the advancement of science and technology, we need
libraries for human resource development in all our schools. These
libraries should be sources of information for all our people. We need to
equip them with the latest technology. Equally, we need to find more
information from our elderly citizens by way of storytelling. We must
always remember that when an old man dies, a library is burnt down. We must
take good care of them while they are alive.

This budget also ensures that our fallen heroes, who laid down their lives
for this new democratic dispensation, are brought back from the African
diaspora and elsewhere to be laid to rest in peace here and to enjoy the
fruits of freedom.

I want to appeal to and warn all those perpetrators of music and film
piracy that their acts of sabotage of our artists will be met with the full
might of the law. The music and film industry in this country is
experiencing a difficult time at the moment. As responsible and law-abiding
citizens, we need to join hands and stop buying pirated CDs and DVDs.
Millions of rands have been lost already. Enough is enough.

In February 2005 U-Carmen eKhayelitsha, the acclaimed version of the Bizet
opera Carmen, set in Cape Town’s Khayelitsha township, won the prestigious
Golden Bear award at the 55th Berlin Film Festival in Germany. The South
African film Yesterday was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best
Foreign Film category in 2005. The National Film and Video Foundation
funded Yesterday.

Hotel Rwanda, a co-production partnership involving South Africa, Italy and
the UK, was also nominated for an Oscar. Cecilia Bobak was nominated for an
Oscar for set design for the film Phantom of the Opera. Tsotsi, directed by
Gavin Hood, won the Standard Life Audience Award and the Michael Powell
Award for the best film at the Edinburgh Film Festival and the People’s
Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was South
Africa’s official submission for the 2006 Academy Awards for the Best
Foreign Film.
Lastly, the Centre for the Book has been incorporated as a specialist unit
in the National Library of South Africa, ensuring greater stability and
increasing the capacity of the two institutions to serve, as a single
entity, the needs of a culture of reading, and to preserve and make
accessible our national documentary heritage.The ANC supports the budget. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon Kohler-Barnard, how about a few
notes from Carmen à la Pauline Malefane? [Interjections.]

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Madam Deputy Chair, how embarrassing it must be to be
the Minister of Arts and Culture! A thorough reading of the latest Auditor-
General’s report proves that it does no good to send in a dilettante to do
a Minister’s work.

The report reveals that you, Minister, allowed R6,6 million to be rolled
over. This money could have been supporting performance after performance;
training sessions for young artists; the visual arts; displays - the list
is endless. You rolled over R6,6 million. And how could you allow
unverified allocations of R17,3 million? Where are the minutes? Who should
have taken them?

But then why should the distribution of the money so carefully gathered to
support the artists of South Africa be high on your agenda? You have been
too busy ensuring that your department diverts funds to one of the most
odious, racist bodies this country has had forced upon it since the
Broederbond. How the architects of apartheid in your midst must be
grinning!

Perhaps you have forgotten, Minister, that our Constitution guarantees that
all South Africans are equal. Yet here you are, using taxpayers’ money to
support the so-called Native Club. Let us be quite clear: the Native Club
is nothing more nor less than a racially exclusive group of intellectual
lackeys whose aim is to legitimise state policy.

Allow me, Minister, to point out a few home truths to you. The Portfolio
Committee on Arts and Culture, which I am sadly rarely able to attend
because of my other portfolio, is absolutely unanimous in its wish to see
the back of your director-general, Prof Itumeleng Mosala. This man has
proved to be an arrogant soul who believes that members of Parliament are
merely there to ensure he lives the high life at our expense.
[Interjections.] I was specifically asked by the ANC members of the
committee, who know that I am always on top of things, to point out to this
body ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Order!

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: Pardon?

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Not yourself, but the hon members. I
just want the noise levels to go down.

Ms D KOHLER-BARNARD: I was specifically asked by the ANC members of the
committee to point out to this body that MPs are not going to take
arrogance on the part of paid employees for one more day. Enough is enough.
We were told only yesterday that you intend to address the committee two
weeks after this budget: so much for democratic debate and budget
preparation. None of the proposed legislation has even appeared before the
committee. What a disgrace!

As for the artists, how long is it really going to take you to appoint
another NAC board? Another year perhaps, or two? Yes, you were forced to
fire the last board in December 2004, after the DA pointed out time and
again the mound of evidence against its members, but what is the delay now?
There is no board, no executive committee, no CEO, no CFO, and a 50%
vacancy rate. Meanwhile there is the small matter of that R6 million you
failed to give out to the artists - their money, Minister, not yours -
which a board might not have allowed to happen. Come July this year we will
be watching.

As for the rest of your portfolio, frankly it is a disgrace. Once again the
man who, under you, is directly responsible for 25 boards, Prof Mosala, has
somehow managed to hang onto his job, this despite the fact that he oversaw
the demise of the NAC, suspended perfectly competent and honest people on
trumped-up charges, and has suffered the humiliation of having his own
staff toyi-toyi outside his office in protest at his lack of action.
Everything about this Ministry is moving in a downward spiral.

In the last budget you had five clean reports. This budget shows just
three, and five of your units were not even able to pull a year-end report
together. The Auditor-General has even been moved to offer you advice on
how to run the museums in this country. Their income rate is a disgrace,
and to top that, they have incorrect asset descriptions or no register of
the description of their assets, or can’t find them at all. Are our
country’s paintings adorning private dining rooms around the country? We
will never know.

Then again, the museums look positively successful when compared to some of
our theatres. Perhaps you could explain to this body how Pacofs came to
report a loss of R1,8 million, or the Windybrow Theatre, which this
Ministry gave R4,5 million, only managed to generate R3 526. There are no
minutes, no declaration of interest, no control policies, no internal audit
function, no CFO, no strategic plan, and the payment of directors’
remuneration contradicts the articles of association.

As for the other entities, the bizarrely expensive Freedom Park is, as
ever, going nowhere, using only 8% of its budget for its development.
Obviously the highly paid staff were too busy spending the R1,1 million in
contradiction of the procurement policy. It took a threat from the Unesco
inspection team that it would delist Robben Island to force you to get the
place cleaned up. The signage is still dismal, but at least the rat problem
is under control.

You were enthusiastic for all of ten minutes with your izimbizo around the
country - since then, nothing. Well, not for the artists, but I do have
more here in my hand: a plan for a gathering to talk some more. You
apparently intend to spend R2 500 per night on a room: that’s for you, the
same for your director-general and the same for every one of your 40
officials. An amount of R2 500, and the list goes on. You intend to spend
R1,8 million, which is half a million more than initially approved. It is
billed as a policy review process. Just read the Auditor-General’s report
and that should provide more than enough information without another visit
to the trough at the expense of South African artists.

I have no doubt that later you will either choose to ignore my input or you
will waste some of your final speech here today attacking me. The hon
Minister Manuel always does that and it is really quite flattering. Well,
it would be if he ever got his facts right. But the artists of South Africa
would far rather hear concrete proposals from you, turnaround strategies
for the ailing divisions in your care, news of the appointment of a rock-
solid and experienced NAC board, and the roll-out of a national development
strategy.

Something seems to have slipped your mind, Minister: both arts and culture
are here to provide a unifying force within this land, a means to pull the
diverse strands of our nation together in a relationship of mutual respect
and admiration. Surely the artists of South Africa deserve better and, no,
the DA will most certainly not support this travesty of a budget.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr K M KHUMALO: Mudzulatshidulo, Minisita, mirado ya Phalammennde,
vhafumakadzi na vhanna, dzikhonani na vhaeni vha thonifheaho ...
[Chairperson, Ministers, members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen,
comrades and respected visitors ...]

... it is unfortunate to speak after Ms Kohler-Barnard because there is no
staccato in her language as she speaks. I guess this is because of her
background of having been a presenter for SABC 2. Chairperson, you have
said that if I recite a nice poem or sing a song, you will give me one or
two additional minutes. I just want to refer to a little ...

... liedjie wat mense in die 1940’s en 1950’s gesing het. Toe was die
oorlog teen Engelse en Afrikaners. Die liedjie lui: [... song that people
sang in the 1940s and 1950s. Then there was a war raging between the
English and Afrikaners. The song goes as follows:]

    Daar onder by die mielies
    By die groen doringboom,
    Daar woon my Sarie Marais.
    Jy moenie huil nie,
    Jy moenie treur nie,
    Jare kom en gaan.
    Bobbejane trap die wêreld
    So haastig en so lastig,
    Bobbejane trap die berge
    So lastig en so haastig.

Many of you know it. Please give me a hand. [Applause.] Now, this is just a
demonstration that the rumour and allegations that the ANC does not like
Afrikaans or Afrikaners is not true. All of and us who can sing and dance
are artistic here in this House, and all those who can speak any language
and have a common identity, values and moral systems are cultural.

The success of arts and culture is not embedded in programmes as espoused
by Department of Arts and Culture, but by continuous engagement with
important historical facts. Marginalisation of indigenous languages
continues unabated, despite criticism from the opposition.

I need to give just a brief background to this issue of Tshwane. Where does
this Tshwane come from? In terms of the renaming, it is a pity that the
Minister has actually put this matter aside. But just to give you an
uncorrupted history about Tshwane, Firstly, Tshwane was the son of Musi,
who was a great leader and a son of Mhlanga, whose headquarters were in
Mohlakeng in Randfontein.

The seven leaders of those brothers to Musi were Manala, founder of the
Mabena tribe, the reigning king Masombuka. There is Mabena over there.
[Applause.] There is Masombuka today, and Ndzundza who then had Gengana,
and in Limpopo they call him Kekana. Then there is Dhlomu who today is
called Dlomo. Then there is Sibasa and Mhwaduba, and Mohaduba, who are
called Bahwaduba. In that whole area of the Zion Christian Church, as you
go to Limpopo, they are called Bahwaduba. This is where these people come
from. One of those sons is Tshwane.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, would you kindly take
your seat. Hon member, do you have a point of order?

Mr M B SKOSANA: I just wanted to say to the hon speaker: NguMusi ka Mhlanga
mina. [Musi, son of Mhlanga.] [Applause.] [Laughter.]

Mr K M KHUMALO: Thank you very much, Mr Skosana. Quite clearly, there are
the seven sons, the great sons of Musi. Then this son called Tshwane, a
great warrior, a man for whom that area around Wonderboom is called Tshwane
ka Mnyamane. What it means is that it is a place of black people. In those
years, in Radio Bantu by then and Radio Setswana, they used to say:
Tshwane, tswara jwalo, which meant that they were going for a commercial
break.
Now, you can’t come today and say Tshwane is a new name. The name has been
there and everybody knows that. Now, part of the uncorrupted history is the
fact that ... [Interjections.]

Jy sal jou kans kry, man! Ek het ’n probleem met hierdie bankrotpolitiek
wat mev Van der Walt bedryf. [Tussenwerpsels.] [You will get your turn,
man! I have a problem with these bankrupt politics practised by Mrs Van der
Walt.] [Interjections.]]

The second issue is what is called Bon Accord is actually called Mabena
Accord. And that must be corrected. The third issue is the areas around
Moretele and Moretele River, which people call Moretele because the river
used to do what in Setswana is called go retela, which means to dry up and
not produce the same amount of water as before.

Tshwane is not a new name, Minister. It is an old name of a warrior, a son
that came from the kingdom of Musi ka Mhlanga and all those who have
actually led the area in times of wars of resistance. This is a very
important history. [Applause.]

This history is not free political education, but it is called historical
materialism from a Marxist perspective. You need to understand that. To
understand the present you need to know the past, that is, where you come
from in terms of dialectics. You need to understand where you come from.
So, we need to restore the name of Tshwane, hon Minister.

Just to give the background in terms of the restoration of names
Chairperson: Firstly, what is today called Pietermaritzburg is
Umgungundlovu, Klerksdorp is Matlosane, Potchefstroom is Tlokwe, East
London is eMonti, Grahamstown is Rhini and Butterworth is Gcuwa. These are
the original names that we must restore and bring back without any debate
or discussion or referring to any political leader.

The cultural industries that we are dealing with in terms of the department
are the area that gives the economic growth within the department - things
like handicrafts, music, publishing, design and visual arts.

Now, in respect of the support of institutions like Sithengi, SA Fashion
Week, we need to increase the bilaterals with African countries in Southern
Africa. These are important areas that relate to the cultural industries
that you are dealing with. We must have indigenous South African crafts and
arts in all our foreign missions. What this means is that in embassies and
everywhere in our missions, we need to reflect the South African culture.
You need to know that you are now entering a South African embassy.

In respect of the programmes that are forthcoming, the Sithengi Film
Festival that is coming, the Fashion Week that is in August, the Craft
Imbizo and the SA Music Week in September, must all reflect the rich
tapestry of South African culture.

In respect of language - because it has also become an important issue for
the opposition all of a sudden - the people who are leading the debate in
the continent - Ngugi wa Thiongo and Prof Heila Girima from Ethiopia -
inform us that we need to centre the margins and bring the languages that
had been marginalised into the centre, because in South Africa today you
continue to have Afrikaans and English dominating all the municipalities
and council meetings with very few reference to indigenous South African
languages.

Secondly, in government buildings of the documentation is in Afrikaans or
English. Now, we need to have a situation where we also reflect that rich
history of the African people in terms of language. Mario Spevach and
Jacques Derrida also say that we need to encourage all South Africans,
black and white, to use language for economic development and social
upliftment.

It is quite sad to inform you that at the last jazz festival here in Cape
Town, one of the American guys who came here actually could speak isiZulu
and isiXhosa so fluently, but I was disturbed by the fact that some of the
African people around here, South Africans, are unable to speak a single
paragraph in isiZulu, Sesotho, Setswana or Xitsonga. That is a disgrace and
it is actually disturbing. We need to change that.

The speaker before me, Mr Lekgetho, spoke about the fact that we should not
eat the national birds and others. I think what is important is that we
have five national symbols. Our national animal is the springbok, our
national bird is indwe, mamasilanoka, the blue crane, our national flower
is the protea – the protea that we use in all our games whenever we play -
our national tree is the yellowwood tree.

Dit word geelhout genoem. Ek hoop jy het gehoor. Die geelhoutboom is een
van daardie vyf simbole. [It is called yellowwood. I hope you have heard
this. The yellowwood tree is one of those five symbols.]

These are the five national symbols. I agree with Mr Lekgetho when he says
let us not destroy ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms C-S Botha): Hon member, I have given you 30
seconds extra as I had promised, but your time has expired.

Mr K M KHUMALO: Let us just make sure that we don’t eat, destroy and burn
all the national symbols. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS AND CULTURE: Deputy Chairperson, I want to thank all
the hon members who participated in today’s debate. I think most of the
points were well taken. And, for a change, I will take the sterling advice
of the hon Kohler-Barnard and not say anything about her since she says it
is a waste of time. I agree it is a waste of time to address anything she
has to say. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

There are a couple of points I think we need to respond to which were
raised by hon members during the course of the debate. I think there is a
need for us to clarify the roles of the various bodies. The Pan South
African Language Board – PanSALB - and the National Language Service are
two discrete entities. The National Language Service resides in the
Department of Arts and Culture. PanSALB, although we fund it, is not a
function of the department. It falls outside the department and it reports
directly to Parliament whereas the National Language Service reports to us.


So, those are two discrete bodies having different assignments. PanSALB’s
task is the promotion of multilingualism and the promotion of our languages
as a nation. The National Language Service is what it says it is – it is a
service provided to government and society in general. I know that because
of the names sounding so similar, it does cause a great deal of confusion
amongst members of the public. But, I think hon members should begin to
understand those distinctions.

Obviously, I would very strongly support the improvement of our budget
because we think that the work that we do is very important and I think we
can always use a great deal more.

On the issue of the vulnerability of our artists, yes, I agree that South
African artists, especially those in the performing arts, are extremely
vulnerable to all sorts of promoters, shysters and others who are out to
exploit them. Which is why, as Minister, one has repeatedly encouraged the
South African performing artists to form themselves into some sort of a
union or organisation through which they can exert their collective
strengths to protect one another from exploiters.

One is pleased to see that this advice is being heeded by some of the
performing artists who have now constituted themselves into the Creative
Workers Union of South Africa, and we say more power to them. We would like
to see more of such organisations because it is only by pooling your
collective strengths that you could actually defend yourselves against
exploiters. You leave yourself vulnerable if you are going to face the
promoters on your own on each occasion.

I am also pleased to see that what we are doing in the area of language is
appreciated by the members of this august House. Yes, we agree that all our
languages should be promoted. One of the difficulties we are facing,
especially with respect to the indigenous African languages, is the absence
of literature in those languages. And, regrettably, most of our South
African publishing houses do not seem to be very alive to that particular
challenge.

I want to correct one little misapprehension on the part of the hon Van der
Walt, though. On the taaldebat [language debate] at Stellenbosch, I did
actually make some comments. She might not have seen them. There was a very
extensive interview I did on the issue with Rapport, an Afrikaans language
newspaper, in which I expressed my views. She might of course not agree
with those views, but that is her right just as it is my right to express
them.

My view on the matter is that we should stop speaking about and people
should stop referring to Afrikaans as a minority language. It is not a
minority language. Afrikaans is probably the third largest language group
in this country. And, what is more, it does not seem to make a great deal
of sense to me, in the case of a language group that is that large, to
always speak of it as being under threat. I cannot see what could possibly
threaten such a large language community.

I would also say in that respect that I think that much of the discourse
around the threat to Afrikaans that comes from a handful of Afrikaner
academics - and interestingly not the Rector of the University of
Stellenbosch, who does not feel that way - is occasioned by concerns other
than language. I frankly am not convinced by what they are saying. As I
said on that occasion, it would make much more sense, to me if people who
wanted to see Afrikaans being preserved as an academic language insisted
that other universities, which at present use English exclusively also
incorporated Afrikaans as a language of teaching. What would be wrong with
that, for God’s sake? I mean really what would be wrong with the University
of Cape Town incorporating Afrikaans as a language of teaching? What would
be wrong with Grahamstown University and Rhodes University incorporating
Afrikaans as a language of teaching? Why insist on an exclusive Afrikaans
institution somewhere? It does not seem to make sense to me. Anyway, that
is my particular view.

Much as one would like to see the Khoi and the San languages also being
developed, unfortunately when we negotiated our Constitution we did not
include them as official languages. Maybe that is something that needs to
be looked at. Maybe that is something that needs to be reviewed. But, as
long as that has not been done, there is no obligation on the part of the
department to actually do anything about those particular languages. Not
that I think they are any less important. My own mother tongue, isiXhosa,
was enriched a great deal by the Khoi and the San languages. Even the name
itself derives from a Khoi-Khoi word.

Yes, I also agree with the hon members about the importance of libraries –
which is why we have set aside R1 billion to try and develop our libraries
over the next three years. We are going to invest that money, hopefully
wisely, and act in co-operation with the municipalities with respect to
that.

The hon Mulder raised the issue of a questionnaire about archival
documents. I want to assure him that there is no such questionnaire.
Regrettably, he is not here – he apologised that he had to catch an early
plane. But, there has never been such a questionnaire drawn up or
circulated by the National Archives. So, I would like him to rest assured
that this is just one of the numerous urban legends that make South African
life very colourful.

With regard to the issue of a database raised by one of the hon members, we
do actually have such a database that includes translators of African
languages into English and vice versa, but also includes translators from
foreign languages into English and vice versa. That database exists and
perhaps it should become more generally known.

The problem of the relationship between the portfolio committee and the
department is something that we perhaps will have to address. I will speak
to our director-general about that. But, I was not aware that there seems
to be reluctance on his part to report to government.

I was particularly touched by the remarks of one hon member with respect to
The Blue Notes, which left South Africa some 40 years ago to play at the
Antibes Jazz Festival. Those were all very good friends of mine and I want
to join you in mourning their loss. But, let us not forget the one member
of The Blue Notes who came home early and did not bother to stay in London,
Nick Moyake, who tends to be forgotten.

There are a number of people that one has to thank. I would like to say a
special word of thanks to my Deputy Minister, Ms Ntombazana Botha, who
shares the burden of leading this department with me. I also would like to
say a special word of thanks to Director-General Prof Itumeleng Mosala, to
Deputy Directors-General Mr Victor Julius and Temba Wakashe, and to all the
personnel at the Department of Arts and Culture.

Let me also thank the people who work in my Ministry, beginning with Mr
Freddy Mashamba, the Chief of Staff and all the others who work under him.
Last but not least, I want to thank Prof Kgositsile, my advisor, who has to
take the blame for all my mistakes.

Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 12:36.
