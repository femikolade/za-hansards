ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS – see col 000.


                                 NO MOTIONS


The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I have been informed that the
Whippery had agreed that there will be no notices of motion or motions
without notice today. We will therefore proceed with the questions as
printed on the Order Paper.


                            WELCOMING OF VISITORS


The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Before we proceed, hon members, I wish to
announce that we have visitors on the gallery. They are members from
different states on the continent. We have an important workshop here that
deals with the transformation of the PAP from a consultative body and
advisory body into a legislative body, so that we can legislate over
continental issues, like defence, for instance, or correctional services.
[Laughter.] I remember you from your days in Sport and Recreation. We have
the Deputy Speaker of Mozambique and an MP from the Egyptian Parliament. We
have the hon Mr Masanga from Congo-Brazzaville and we have the Deputy Clerk
of the PAP and his staff. [Applause.] They want to come and observe
proceedings in the Chamber. They will not be long, because they have to go
back to their workshop.  Welcome also to all the Ministers who are here
today.

QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY

MINISTERS:

        Transporting of detainees and prisoners by SA Police Service

34.   Kgoshi M L Mokoena asked the Minister of Safety and Security:

      (1)   Whether the SA Police Service will continue transporting
           sentenced and awaiting-trial detainees or prisoners between
           courts and prisons; if so, for how long;

      (2)   whether he will make a statement on the matter?
      C82E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, the answer to
Question 34 is: yes, the SA Police Service is responsible for the
transportation of all awaiting trial detainees between court and prison, as
well as the transportation of a prisoner from court to prison after being
sentenced. This will continue as long as the need arises.

An answer to the second part of the question is: no.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, arising from the Deputy Minister’s
``progressive’’ response, my follow-up question to that second part of the
reply is: why? Is the department indemnified if something happened while
they are transporting these inmates who belong to the Department of
Correctional Services?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, may I indicate
that the reason for us continuing in transporting prisoners or inmates or
awaiting-trial detainees - as we refer to them nowadays -is that South
Africa has an integrated justice system. That is the first issue, which is
very important. Also, we need to bear in mind that the people who are
competent enough and have the necessary facilities to ensure the safety of
inmates is the police because they are responsible for the security of
everybody in this country, including those who have already been sentenced.
We will continue to do this as part of our responsibility to ensure that in
that process they cannot escape. You are quite aware that most of the time
we even provide back-up police where we escort dangerous criminals in our
country because we have the capacity and the competence in doing that. So,
may I say to the hon member that we will indeed continue to protect
innocent citizens of South Africa and ensure that those who have already
been sentenced and are a threat to society are properly secured and taken
care of so that they don’t tend to be a danger to any environment and
community. Thank you, Chairperson.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, I would just like to ask: the Minister made
reference to the escapees. Does she have any figure of how many trial-
awaiting prisoners or detainees have escaped this year? Are there any new
safety precautions to curb these incidents occurring, and if so, what are
those heightened security measures?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Ms Terblanche, that’s a new question
altogether. That is not a follow-up question. But normally I do allow
Ministers to answer, if they are ready to answer such questions. I don’t
want to cause a precedent. I am inviting follow-up questions, and not new
questions.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you Chairperson. Hon
member, I cannot give you statistics on the numbers you are looking for
because indeed that is the details that one would not have off the cuff.
However, on the issue of escapees, as I have indicated, we have an
integrated justice system. We, together with Correctional Services, make
sure and take precautions in ensuring that for any individual who is
arrested there are proper security measures in place and making sure that
they are not able to escape. That is part of our function - the co-
ordination between us as SAPS, Correctional Services together with the
courts. We always liaise in ensuring that any individual who goes to court
is safe. Also, I indicated to this House that currently, because of the
close cohesion and working together of the various departments, we have
seen successful reduction in the number of escapees, whether be at the
courts or at correctional centres. We are prepared to put in resources to
improve on the capacity of security within these areas. Also during transit
to either the courts or correctional centres we make sure that we don’t
have any escapees.

But one needs to take it further to say our justice system is becoming more
efficient and effective. Currently, even those who manage to escape, we
bring them to book within a very short space of time. So, it’s a reflection
on how best we are improving on policing and on co-ordination.

What is key is the role of communities in making sure that we are able to
work together and apprehend individuals who want to run away from the law.
So, the participation and partnerships with community have yielded lots of
results in this particular area.
Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, arising from the well-thought response by
my dynamic Deputy Minister, I want to find out because those inmates, after
being sentenced, are now the property of the Department of Correctional
Services. In case something happens, is the Department of Safety and
Security indemnified?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, Chair. To hon Kgoshi
Mokoena, may I indicate that even when members are in transit or sentenced,
they are supposed to be the property of Correctional Services. But the
responsibility for providing security lies with the police. On that basis,
and on the basis of the regulation and the convention, we are indemnified
to transport and in making sure that if anything happens we are not liable.
Let’s assume that there are escapees. We will not be held liable. We are
indemnified because it’s in the process of providing security but also of
fulfilling our duties and responsibilities as the SA Police Service.

                   Counselling offered to police officers

  35. Mr A J L Moseki asked the Minister of Safety and Security:

      Whether counselling is offered to police officers because of the
      demanding and stressful kind of work they are doing; if not, why not;
      if so, what are the relevant details?              C83E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, hon Chair. The
answer to Question 35 is yes, the SA Police Service has a well-established
employee assistance service in terms of which counselling and other support
services are offered to our members. The employee assistance service of the
SA Police Service comprises psychology services, social work services and
spiritual services, and all these people are also professionally trained in
trauma debriefing. Thank you.

Mr A L MOSEKI: Ke a leboha, Modulasetulo. Ke ne ke lakatsa ho lekola feela
le Motlatsi wa Letona hore ... [Thank you, Chairperson. I would just like
to check with the Deputy Minister ...]

... are the police using this service as effectively as expected?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, hon Chair. I would
like to say to the hon Moseki that our members are indeed encouraged to
utilise this service at all times. May I also indicate that this service is
not available to members only, but is also available to their families.

There are challenges faced by our members at various times. Therefore we
also look at how best we can improve the services rendered to our members,
and also at making sure that they do utilise this service to the fullest.
So far we are satisfied that our members are utilising this service
effectively. We are also working with other private institutions to make
sure that they are provided with this kind of service at all times and to
the satisfaction of our members.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Thank you, Chairperson. With reference to the debriefing
sessions that are available, isn’t it possible that members of the service
can have compulsory training beforehand - before they go into these
stressful situations - to assist them with coping? I ask this specifically
with reference to the number of police suicides this past year in my
province, the North West.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, Chair. May I
indicate to the hon member that the issue of suicides committed by our
members is not a problem faced by our members only, but a general problem
that we face as a country. Therefore it requires all of us to come together
to find the other factors that are contributing to the increase in suicides
committed in our country. In terms of our members I must also indicate that
there are socioeconomic challenges that our members are facing, like all
members of our society.

I think you are quite aware that recently in your province – you said you
were from the North West – we have just had a tragedy in that one of the
community members and a political leader wiped out his family.

So this is not just a challenge facing the police but a challenge that
needs all of us in South Africa to see what the challenges and difficulties
faced by our various communities are in a way that we can assist - as a
country, as a society and also in terms of legislators and representatives
of the people - in what would be the best way, in terms of the social and
economic challenges faced by our various communities in distress at
different times.

Nk N F MAZIBUKO: Sihlalo, ngithanda ukubuza kwiPhini likaNqgongqoshe  ukuthi
ngabe lingakwazi yini ukusinika inani  lamaphoyisa  akwaziyo  ukuthi  angene
kulolu hlelo ngokwamaphesenti, nokuthi, ngokobulili, mangaki amaphoyisa  aya
kulo lolu hlelo? Ngifuna  nokubuza  ukuthi  impumelelo  yakhona  iba  njani,
unyaka nonyaka? Ngiyabonga.

IPHINI LIKANGQONGQOSHE WEZOKUPHEPHA NOKUVIKELEKA: Sihlalo, ngiyabonga
kwilungu lale Ndlu. Engingakusho ukuthi anginawo amanani nangokwamaphesenti
acacisa ukuthi mangaki amaphoyisa angena kulolu hlelo. Nangokobulili,
nakhona kuzoba nzima ukuthi ngikucacisele amanani akhona. Kodwa
engingakuphawula kule Ndlu ukuthi maningi kakhulu amaphoyisa alungenelayo
uhlelo lwethu oluhlose ukuwasiza uma ehlangana nezinkinga.

Ngifuna ukuphawula futhi ukuthi bese ngikucacisile ukuthi ziningi  izinkinga
abantu bakithi abahlangabezana nazo. Ohlelweni lwethu,  okunye  esikubhekayo
yizo izinkinga esibona ukuthi zihlupha amalungu  ethu  emaphoyiseni.  Sesize
safaka uhlelo lokuthi  nezingxaki  zezimali  sizame  ukubasiza  ngazo  ngoba
siyazi  phela  ukuthi  uma  ubaba  wekhaya  engakwazi  ukunakekela   umndeni
ngendlela efanele, lokho kudala izilingo  ezenza  kube  nezinkinga  eziningi
phakathi kwekhaya. Yingakho lolu hlelo lungasebenzeli kuphela amalungu  ethu
kodwa  lusebenzela  nemindeni  yawo.  (Translation  of  isiZulu   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mrs F MAZIBUKO: Chairperson, I  would  like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Minister
whether he could provide us with the figures in  percentage  of  the  police
who are already part of this programme, and according to  gender,  how  many
police are  getting  into  in  this  programme?  I  also  want  to  ask  how
successful this programme is year by year. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, I  thank  the  hon
member of this House. What I can say is that I do not have  the  figures  in
percentage which clarify how many police are engaged in this programme.  And
according to gender, it will be difficult for me to  clarify  the  available
figures. However, what I can say in  this  House  is  that  there  are  many
members of the  police  force  who  are  in  this  programme  of  which  its
objective is to help them if they have problems. I just want to say  that  I
have already  clarified  that  there  are  many  problems  that  our  people
encounter. In our programme, what we also look at is the  very  problems  we
believe are a hindrance to our members in the police  force.  We  have  even
implemented a system of helping them financially, so that  we  try  to  help
them because we know that if a father figure at home is unable to take  care
of his family properly, that creates problems within a  household.  That  is
why this programme does not work for our members only but it also works  for
their families.]

Ms H LAMOELA: Thank you, hon Chair. My question to the hon Deputy Minister
is whether the counselling continues in extreme cases after members leave
the service to ensure peace in the family home and to prevent separation or
divorce. Thank you, hon Chair.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, hon Chair. Hon
member, even if members do leave the service, these kinds of services or
facilities continue to be provided to former or ex-members of the SAPS. We
continue to provide this kind of support to them, together with their
families. This is because we believe that at some point they were our
members and that we have a responsibility and an obligation to ensure that
at all times their health, their wellbeing, is taken care of. So, even if
they leave our service, we continue to provide these kinds of service.

    Arrangements to ensure proper co-ordination between investigators and
                                 prosecutors

36.   Mr N J Mack asked the Minister of Safety and Security:

     Whether there are any special arrangements between his department and
     the Department for Justice and Constitutional Development to ensure
     proper co-ordination between investigators and prosecutors; if not,
     what is the position in this regard; if so, what are the relevant
     details?                                      C84E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Yes, investigators and
prosecutors do have direct communication mechanisms, which facilitates
proper co-ordination between the two departments.

Investigators also consult with prosecutors prior to commencement of such
cases, and an additional mechanism that is in place is the existence of
court liaison officers who serve as co-ordinators between prosecutors and
investigating officers pertaining to cases on court rolls. The prosecutors
further communicate in writing to the relevant investigators.

    Members of SA Police Service paying allegiance to one political party

37.   Mr Z C Ntuli asked the Minister of Safety and Security:

     (1)    Whether he has found that the SA Police Service has some members
          who pay allegiance to one political party rather than serving the
          whole community indiscriminately; if so,




     (2)    whether the SAPS will take any action against those members; if
          not, why not; if so, what are the relevant details?
                                                        C85E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: The reply to question 1(a) is
no, question 2, it’s not applicable.

Ms B L MATLHOAHELA: I just want to say to the hon Deputy Minister that I
really gave her an honour by addressing her by the slip of the tongue as
the hon Deputy President; maybe it’s a prophesy for the future. Thank you.

And my question, hon Chair, follows up on question 37: Are the government
high official’s requests or orders executed with bias towards communities
or members in communities? If so, why? If not, what assurance is there,
that it does not happen? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: May I take this opportunity,
Chair, to say to the hon Member, to my knowledge there is no service
rendered by our members to any members of, or citizens of this country in a
biased way.

I think that arises from our own Constitution which allows freedom of
association, but I think what is key is that every individual in this
country, whilst they have the right to associate but also, they’ve got to
respect their areas of duty and be able to execute their duties in an even-
handed way. So, whether an individual belongs to political parties within
our service, that’s irrelevant to us.

The key issue is that, as soon as they come to us and they’ve got to
execute their duties, they must do that in a way that is prescribed and
described by the requirement of their duties. So, political affiliation of
our members is irrelevant, as long as they are able to execute their
functions accordingly and fairly.

Ake ngibuze lapha kusekela lika Nqgonqgoshe ukuthi ngabe okuvuka
empendulweni yakhe ukuthi ubulunga bakho eqemjini kwezopolotiki
akabalulekile kangako. Ngabe kuyenzeka yini ukuthi umuntu uma ejoyina
umbutho lona wamaphoyisa azichaze kwifomu aligcwalisayo ukithi ungowaliphi
iqembu uma ngabe kwenzeka kuyaye kwenziwe njani ke kulokhu ukuze kugwemeke
ukuthi angakusebenzisi ngiyabonga.

IPHINI LIKANGQONGQOSHE WEZOKUPHEPHA NOKUVIKELEKA: Ngiyabonga Sihlalo
kwilungu lale Ndlu ubaba uMzizi ngingacacisa nje baba Mzizi, uma abantu
abahlukahlukene becela umsebenzi lapha esiphoyiseni akukho lapho okushoyo
khona ukuba abazicacise ukuba bangamalunga ayiphi inhlangano ngoba lokho
akubalulekile kithina akuyona futhi into esiyibeke phambili ukuba sazi
ukuba bangamalunga ayiphi inhlangano, esikubheke kakhulu ukuba ngabe
lomsebenzi abawucelayo kithina bazowenza ngendlela efanele ngalokho imigomo
nemiqathango esiyibekile kwimithetho yethu yiyo okumele ibe umkhomba ndlela
ukuba bangalungela na ukuba babe amaphoyisa kulesi sizwe sethu.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[May I ask from the Deputy Minister, arising from your answer, either is to
say that political membership is not important? Does it happen when the
person completing the application forms to join the SAPS states the party
he belongs to, if it does happen what do you do to avoid the candidate to
use partisanship.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you Chairperson, to the
hon member of this House Mr Mzizi, I can simply explain that if different
people apply for jobs in the SAPS there is nowhere, where it says they have
to state their political party because that is not important to us and it
is not what we regard as the priority to know which party they belong to.
Our concern is only if they will be able to efficiently perform the duty we
are requesting from them. As a result the terms or the conditions we
stipulated in our Act are the ones to be the guidelines to tell whether
they are fit to be the police in our nation or not.

Dr F J VAN HEERDEN: As a follow-up question, if the Deputy Minister could
tell us, she indicated that it’s not required for applicants to indicate
their political affiliations.

If it’s not required, do some of the candidates who apply, do they indeed
indicate their political affiliations or is it stated clearly that they
should not indicate their political affiliations when they apply for
occupation in the SAPD or security service. Thank you, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: May I indicate that the
political affiliation of any individual is irrelevant. I must stress that
it is irrelevant to us. Because the SA Police Service is not running a
political party nor intends to contest any political office in this
country, it’s not relevant for us.

The requirements which are clearly stated for any individual who wants to
be a police officer, as long as that individual would meet those
requirements, that’s the criteria we will use in making sure that our
recruitment becomes a success.

However, I must indicate as I have said before that the question of
political affiliation, we cannot tamper nor interfere with that because our
Constitution allows freedom of association. So, who are we in the police to
gag what is in the Constitution, which is the supreme law of this country?

As long as those individuals are not going to join the SA Police Service in
pursuance of their political affiliation or their political association...
So, may I say to the Member, it’s irrelevant where you belong. To us you
must meet the criteria and the requirements, which is required in terms of
the law or in terms of our own regulations as the SA Police Service.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We now come to Question 38 but before we do
so, I must announce to the members that I have received a request from the
hon Minister of Defence to respond to question 49 after question 39,
because of other urgent matters that he has got to attend to. I have agreed
to that request.

 Members of SA National Defence Force charged with serious crimes in African
                                   states.

38.   Kgoshi M L Mokoena asked the Minister of Defence:

      (1)   How many members of the SA National Defence Force that are
           deployed in some African states have been charged for committing
           serious crimes in those countries;




      (2)   whether the SANDF has taken any action against those members; if
           not, why not; if so, what action?            C87E

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: The answer to this question is that two members of
the SANDF deployed in peacekeeping missions abroad have been arrested and
found guilty of crimes. One was a case of murder and another was a case of
culpable homicide. With regard to action taken against these members, the
courts passed their sentences. The SANDF then discharged them with
ignominy. They were found to be no longer fit to serve in the National
Defence Force.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): Are there any follow-up
questions, hon Mokoena? Since there is no follow-up question, we will move
to question 39.

 Role of SA National Defence Force in crime prevention strategy cluster for
                            2010 Soccer World Cup

  39. Mr A J L Moseki asked the Minister of Defence:

      Whether the SA National Defence Force will form part of the crime
      prevention strategy cluster for the coming 2010 Soccer World Cup
      tournament; if not, what is the position in this regard; if so, how
      does the SANDF fit into this whole programme?
                                                   C89E

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, the SANDF acts in support of the SA
Police Service as a general rule because that is the secondary function of
the SANDF. With regard to the 2010 World Cup Tournament, the National
Defence Force will constitute part of the national joint agencies planning
the security of the tournament. Whether members of the SANDF are directly
involved in day-to-day activities or not, they will be on stand-by to
intervene when they are called upon to provide such necessary support by
the SA Police Service.

Mr D A WORTH: Thank you, Chairperson. It is well known that the border
patrols have been taken over by the SAPS because it was felt that this was
the job of the SA Police Service and not of the SANDF. Likewise commandos
have been done away with. Is this not what the Minister is stating, even if
it is only for a month during the World Cup. Is this not a contradiction in
terms?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, it is not a contradiction in terms.
The Constitution of this country prescribes that there shall only be one
policing agency in this country. We inherited a situation where under the
old order both the police force and the armed forces were used to perform
policing functions and all of us know that as a consequence of that, very
many civilians lost their lives. Members of the armed forces are not
trained to arrest and to deal with civilians. They are trained to kill
enemies of the people of South Africa. Today we find ourselves constrained
by the Constitution to systematically withdraw members of the armed forces
from civilian functions of policing the population and restrict their
activities to guarantee the national security and the integrity of the
country and guard the borders, as well as to support diplomatic work by way
of assisting in the stabilisation of conflict areas in the continent and
around the world. This is a process of transformation and of making sure
that the armed forces of our country conform to a democratic state, as
opposed to a dictatorial one. Thank you.

 Audit of equipment used by commandos, and transferral thereof to SA Police
                                   Service

47.   Mr A Watson asked the Minister of Defence:

     Whether, with reference to the reply of the Minister of Safety and
     Security to Question 7 on 12 April 2005, the SA National Defence Force
     has conducted an audit of the equipment used by the commandos and has
     transferred this equipment to the SA Police Service; if not, why not;
     if so, what are the relevant details regarding the equipment that has
     been transferred? C244E

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, with regard to the issue of the
relationship between the commandos and the police, we have been
withdrawing, as well as our own equipment, where the SAPS indicate interest
in facilities or equipment of the SANDF that was previously used by the
commandos. Where there are specific requests or such needs are indicated,
we are willing to support and therefore we pass such equipment or
facilities to the SAPS. That is an ongoing process as I speak here.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: What progress has been made in filling the rural safety
vacuum that has been created since the commandos were disbanded?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: We have not as yet withdrawn the commandos
entirely from the areas they were policing and supporting. At the present
time we are still partially in charge of certain parts of the country.
Nevertheless, there are areas where the SAPS have indicated to us that they
would like us to withdraw in those areas. In the process of doing that,
they have asked us to release some of the people that were in the
commandos. They have sought to recruit those people to replenish their own
personnel by retraining them, re-equipping them and taking them on. Other
people that formed part of the commandos were part-time members, for
example, farmers. Those people could not be taken on full-time and do
police service work. That is the relationship that we are now busy working
on at the present time in order to achieve this programme.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: I hear, Minister, that people are being retrained to
assist. Why then is it that the rate of farm killings is still so high,
especially if people are being sent there to go and assist?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, the causes of murders are multiple. I
would not be in a position to explain. The Department of Safety and
Security busies it with both identifying the causes and rooting and sorting
them out. They would be best placed to deal with this issue. When people
say, as the hon member does: Why is the rate of murders so high? Well, so
high as what? It is a relative thing. Whilst all of us agree that the
levels of crime are higher than is desirable in any event, crime is not
desirable under any circumstances. If we could eradicate it completely, we
would not even allow one murder to happen. At the present time the country
is faced with huge levels of unemployment. There are large numbers of
people crossing our borders to come and look for work here. Many of these
people have grown up in situations of conflict in Mozambique, in Zimbabwe,
in Angola and so on. Many of these people have no other way of income. They
have grown up under conditions where force is the only way by which to
survive. This is apart from dealing with other problems that are localised.
This has got nothing to do with the commandos. It has to do with the
general regional history of Southern Africa. We are in a transition period
coming out of a very dangerous situation of liberation wars and so on,
which has got its own excesses. The old armed forces of apartheid murdered
so many people, traumatised communities and left with a legacy where we are
trying to cure and render, once again, more sociable and rehabilitate
people. These are the difficulties we are faced with, as the Deputy
Minister of Safety and Security just talked about. We have to have multiple
strategies to attack the psyche of people and make them understand that
there are other ways of solving problems, than using force and murder and
so on.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, arising from this honest and fair reply
from my hon Minister, some alarmists warned the country that the
discontinuation of the commando service will cause some cacophonous
hullabaloo in the country. Is that happening, Minister, because to some of
us, we thought maybe they were realists, only to discover that they were
just alarmists? Can it be confirmed?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, as a matter of fact, it is quite
disturbing that members of our society and communities are worried that
commandos and sections of commandos had been drawn into the police service.
Young men and women who were in the commando – it was mostly young men –
were not there on a full-time basis. They were not paid. When we draw the
younger ones with potential and retrain them within the SAPS, we actually
make them full-time police personnel who get paid salaries. They are now in
a position to devote more time, more energy with proper training to
discharge the function of policing. This is a better arrangement than to
have people who come and do this job and get a piece of bread or some
pittance as allowance. These are now trained police personnel who come from
the same communities that they are policing. Their loyalty to the security
of the community that they serve is better than when we didn’t use them on
a full-time basis. It is a matter that requires a little bit of patience
and all will enjoy the fruits of the transformation that we are doing, in
due course.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I am not sure whether it is another question.
There is a rumour in the media that there is a convergence of people who
would love to overthrow this lovely government of ours. Are there really
such forces and some South Africans who think like that?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I missed something of the part of the question.
Could you clarify it and repeat it?

Rev P MOATSHE: Well, if I have to repeat it then. There is a rumour in the
media that there is a convergence of people who would love to overthrow
this democratic government that has liberated the minds of so many people.
Other minds are not yet liberated. Some are still living in the dreamland,
where they think that things can be reversed and return to the past? Are
these rumours for real? Our system surely should be able to detect, if
these rumours are for real.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Chairperson, I think it is appropriate just to
assure members that this country is more secure than it has been at any
time under the old order. There are a few isolated mavericks, such as the
ones who stole some equipment that was used by a small group of right-
wingers to use as explosives on the railways lines near Soweto and so on.
There is nothing, absolutely nothing that can be regarded as a threat to
national democracy today. South Africans, black and white, in the biggest
majorities are now comfortable and committed to maintain the situation as
it is in this country and actually improve it. In the armed forces, as
well, there are very few isolated elements of this nature and you do find
some of them. They are not quite right in their minds when you catch them.
These are people that are not so well. In general, everybody else is okay.
[Laughter.]

        Plans to close salary gap between magistrates and prosecutors

40.   Mr S Shiceka asked the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
      Development:

      Whether her department is planning to close the salary gap between
      magistrates and prosecutors; if not, why not; if so, when?
                                                                    C90E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
Chair, this matter was dealt with at length in the joint report of the
Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs and the Portfolio
Committee on Justice when dealing with the hearings on the implications and
approval of the proposed new salary scales for magistrates, in particular
the introduction of a new motor vehicle allowance for magistrates, as
recommended by the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public
Office Bearers.

However, due to an intervention, the National Assembly was recently stopped
from considering the said report. The report still has to be considered by
both Houses of Parliament.

Despite this report not yet having served in this House, I will just make a
few remarks. There are attempts being made to create a more equitable
salary dispensation between magistrates and prosecutors to avoid the
numerous problems being experienced because of the highly fragmented and
unequal salary dispensation within the justice family.

The Department for the Public Service and Administration is leading a
departmental task team, together with National Treasury and the Department
of Justice and Constitutional Development, to look into this matter. As
soon as this process has been completed, we will report on the matter.

The hon member, however, must be aware that the salaries of magistrates are
no longer determined by the executive, but by the Independent Commission
for the Remuneration of Office Bearers. The department only makes an input
into the process. However, when we look at our own staff needs, we take
into account the processes for the determination of the salaries of
magistrates. Thank you.

       Measures to deal with unbecoming behaviour by some magistrates

  41. Mr S Shiceka asked the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
      Development:

      Whether her department has put any measures in place to deal with  the
      unbecoming behaviour by some magistrates; if not, why not; if so, what
      measures?                                                C91E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: As the hon
member knows, the judiciary is a separate branch of government, is
independent and, as the executive, we cannot directly take disciplinary
action against a magistrate, as one would do with civil servants. That is
the reason for referring disciplinary matters involving magistrates to the
Magistrates Commission, as it is the body responsible for disciplinary
matters of all magistrates.

I would like to inform the hon member that there is a disciplinary
procedure for magistrates in place within the Magistrates Commission to
deal with unbecoming behaviour by magistrates. All magistrates who are
involved in incidences requiring disciplinary action are reported to the
Magistrates Commission for action and decision.  After the investigation by
the Magistrates Commission of an incident and where found guilty, the
Magistrates Commission will sanction the magistrate having regard to the
transgression in question.

In more serious or impeachment cases in which the Magistrates Commission
recommends the removal of a magistrate, it is not unusual for the
magistrate to be removed from office after Parliament has voted with the
requisite majority on the matter. Following certain procedures by the
Magistrates Commission, a magistrate may also be suspended by Parliament
pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing. So, we should not get mixed
up between judges and magistrates. For magistrates there is a full
disciplinary procedure in place. For judges there is not, and that is one
of the issues that, as you know, is being publicly debated.

Mr S SHICEKA: Thank you very much, Chair. Well, I must say that on the
issue of judges I have been addressed, but I come back to the issue of
magistrates. Could you say, Minister, in your view that these measures
taken by the Magistrates Commission are acting as a deterrent to unbecoming
behaviour, or is the situation continuing as normal without showing any
improvement? Thank you very much.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Um, whew
... [Laughter.] I better be careful and choose my words carefully. I do
think the first thing we must acknowledge is that there is a system in
place to deal with the issues. Then we must look at whether that system is
working efficiently and correctly; and, I think, in some respects yes and
in other respects no.
Hon member Kgoshi Mokoena will tell you that we‘ve removed quite a few
magistrates through the commission and through Parliament that were
involved in terrible things: having sex with a young girl on the front seat
of a car and getting caught; a magistrate was involved in an armed robbery
the other day; a magistrate was involved with murder, and so on. So, there
are a group of magistrates whose activities are clearly very unbecoming,
and they are being dealt with and removed from the system. The problem I
have is that it takes very long, and often the procedures followed were
incorrect and we have had to refer the matters back.

I remember there was a magistrate Zulu who was removed three years ago. By
the time the matter arrived here, we felt that the wrong procedures were
followed. So they had to reinstate him and pay him  three years’ salary. I
think that in some instances we have problems with the implementation, and
I personally am not all that happy with the quality and the speed with
which it is done at times.

When we are dealing with the whole procedure in terms of discipline for
judges, one of the issues we are raising there is that a similar procedure
that we will create for judges must then also be provided for magistrates.
Hopefully, in that way, we can try to make the system work better, because
there, for example, the head of the disciplinary process will be a full-
time retired magistrate. At the moment the problem is that we are getting
different magistrates dealing with the matters. There is no uniformity,
there is no consistency and, therefore, I think at times I am not very
happy with the processes. However, we have a system in place and it is
working, but not always as well as it should.

Mr M A MZIZI: Thank you, Chairperson. Thank you, Deputy Minister; we
actually follow what you are saying, but when we talk of unbecoming
behaviour, there are measures in place. I know that there was a move to
have grievance forms that could be completed by even an ordinary layman if
there was unbecoming behaviour of the presiding officer. How far are we
with that, and how effective are those grievances forms? Do they result in
disciplinary hearings?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: I really can’t
answer you. I imagine those grievance procedures you’re talking about are
an initiative of the Magistrates Commission. I have not been made aware of
that yet. So, I’m not aware of any such process. It may very well be that
that process has already been done, but I just do not have the information
readily available.

 Adequacy of number of magistrates’ courts in Western Cape metropolitan area

 42. Mr N J Mack asked the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
     Development:


     Whether the current number of magistrate courts within the Western Cape
     metropolitan area is enough to serve all the people of  Cape  Town;  if
     not, what is the position in this regard; if so, what are the  relevant
     details?                                      C92E

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Within the
present outdated and archaic norms and procedures followed with the
establishment of our courts, I can at the very least say that the courts in
the Western Cape are adequately resourced, according to national standards.


The issue of the sufficiency of the number of courts or otherwise requires
considerate care. There are a number of factors that require consideration
in this regard. This includes the efficiency and productivity with which
the courts themselves function and dispense justice.

As the hon member next to me will know, there are a number of departments
that are involved in the dispensing of justice in courts including the SAPS
and the NPA. Furthermore, you will know that finalising a case depends on
the availability of witnesses, completed investigations by the police,
availability of prosecutors and magistrates and a host of other matters.

There has never been a full study done in this country relating to the
efficiency and the productivity of our courts. We have observed in the work
that we have done in the department that magistrate courts generally do not
run for an optimal period every day. This applies throughout the country.
There are a number of reasons for this which I do not want to go into here.


However, the most common is the unavailability of witnesses. So, when we
talk about matters like backlogs, it is important to be aware of these
numerous challenges so that we spend time looking for the correct solutions
and not just any solution. The number of courts is only one such factor in
the equation. It cannot be correct without having address all these issues
that we start talking about whether there are enough courts in any given
area or not.

The initial question should rather be whether we are using courts that
exist efficiently and productively. Our approach in the department is to do
an assessment of the various aspects of the functioning and productivity of
the courts so that we can determine those factors that contribute to
inefficiencies and then correct them.

It is within this context that we should asses if the number of courts is
efficient or not. Within the present resource envelope available for courts
services, I am satisfied that this province is one of the best-resourced
provinces as far as courts are concerned. However, as resources become
available, we shall keep improving our courts infrastructure throughout the
country. Thank you.

Mr N J MACK: Thank you, House Chair. Sometimes you would be at a particular
court and it would look as if there are a lot of cases at the specific
court, whilst at another court it looks as if there are only a few cases.
What I would like to know is whether this has been taken into account and
what are the possibilities? Can cases be moved to another court if there is
less cases on that role for a specific week or day as to alleviate
congestion maybe? Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: That is a
court management issue and it is obviously what we encourage but sometimes
you do find that there are turf battles; people don’t want to move cases
because it is their case as if they own it and so on. But I do think that
what we are trying to do is that - this is I think one of the biggest
problems we have in our system, no just in court, generally in this country
- and that is proper management system and of approaches, whether it is in
our hospitals, whether it is in our courts. As you said, you find that in
one court, there are huge court roles and just next door, somehow, it was
maybe in a township and they had a court in the township away from the
white areas and they may not have any cases, or vice versa. For some reason
people that live close together should be able to use the same resources
but for some reason none of them think or if they do think don’t do
anything about it. They don’t move the cases to make sure it works more
speedily. It is a question really of proper case management.

What we are doing is, as we are trying to rationalise the high courts which
is the process we are busy with it now and which has lot of coverage and so
on, obviously our next step is to then once that is it done, to then
rationalise and deal with the lower courts and then we have to find all the
mechanisms to deal with those issues properly. You sometimes find it is
either just through ignorance or lack of knowledge or just because people
are fighting about their turf that they don’t deal with things more
efficiently and move into different courts and so on.

I have even found in some courts in Gauteng where there are lots of courts
in the city, like Johannesburg, that sometimes you find magistrates who
finish work at 11h00. They say: No, no, no, I am finished with my work and
I am not prepared to work or take other cases on the roll and no one can
tell me to do so. I am independent. These are my cases, I have dealt with
them.

So, we have those kinds of problems. I don’t want to generalise and say it
is a general problem. I am saying there are such isolated issues, but the
issue of administration of our courts generally as I say just like others,
is a problem that we are working on and we have to improve that.

However, you see again, those decisions have to be judiciary and we have to
be very careful that we don’t intrude on that area of their independence
where the allocation of cases and how cases are dealt with is the preserve
of the judiciary. It really has to be an interaction on how we get a good
administrative system without us interfering with their independence that
we need to find.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson. I don’t know whether we are winning insofar as
the quality of cases taken by the police officers is concerned, but
sometimes the quality is not so good and does not sustain the case
accordingly. I want to know as to whether we are working towards that so
that they come up with better statements?

The other thing I want to ask deals with missing case files. Somebody just
make that file to be missing and that is the end of that case, because
somebody is collaborating with somebody who has committed an offence. What
are we doing in our justice system in as far as that is concerned?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Well,
obviously we can give you details on another occasion on these issues. I do
think that overall, the quality has improved but it is difficult to
generalise about it because the quality of a person’s work depends on the
skills and capacity of that person. You may find in one police station that
policemen have good skills and capacity and it works well there, but you
may find that in the next police station it is not like that. Just like
schools, you find some schools work well, others don’t; hospitals and so
on. So, it is difficult to generalise, but I do think that the police have
done a whole lot of stuff and maybe you should ask the Minister of Safety
and Security that question.

About their training, the detective school created training for detectives.
I think that all of that helped and it has improved to some extent.
Regarding the issue of lost files, I think we are finding a solution and we
are busy implementing it and that is to put all our files on an electronic
system. At the moment, most things in Justice work on a manual system. That
is one of our biggest problems. However, we now have a system called Jadas
and the E- scheduler. In fact, your committee should actually ask the
department to come and give inputs on this because it is really an
excellent input they give. We have already started rolling it out to some
courts, where we are now capturing your docket plus all the annexures to
the docket onto the computer. Once we have done that, they can take the
docket, they can steal the docket but it doesn’t matter. We can reproduce
the docket in seconds so that the days of dockets being lost and those
cases not being followed-up are over, once we have implemented this Jadas
and E-scheduler. So, that issue is going to be much easier to solve because
you can solve it through technology.

The issue of the quality and the capacity of the staff, that is a longer
process and that takes training and training and retraining and that will
take a long time for us.

Another problem, of course is that, after training people and when they
become good particularly in the Justice system, all the Ministers will tell
you, within a period of time they get taken and get employed somewhere
else. So, it is a continuing process that you have just to repeat over and
over again.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thanks, Chair. Arising from the Deputy Minister’s
accurate response to the initial question, in trying to address the
congestion, or the shortage of courts in the Western Cape for example, to
be specific, in the metro, as outlined by my colleague, hon Mack, can’t we
reconsider the mobile courts to try and alleviate this challenges?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Sorry, what
courts?

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Mobile courts.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT: Oh, the mobile courts. I
think we must consider all possibilities. One of the problems with mobile
courts and traffic cases for example, is that some of the magistrates have
said that they don’t want to sit on those courts because they feel it
doesn’t have the right status and so on and so on. I tend to disagree with
that. I think if it is done correctly, then in a vast country like ours,
where there is enormous poverty and we can’t build courts everywhere,
mobile courts are a possibility. We should use them and of course in using
them you should not see them and treat them any differently from other
court. When you are in a mobile court you should do all the procedures you
do in the court. It is as simple as that. No one is saying that we should
take shortcuts. So, I think we must encourage the whole issue of mobile
courts, and where people are resisting, we should keep on talking. I think
your committee can help a lot with this. I must say I am not going to make
a full announcement now, but we are also looking at a very exciting
programme on how to deal with backlogs and the department will after it had
spoken to the Minister and to our cluster partners on what we want to do
about this, we will make the announcement on dealing with backlogs. It is a
whole new programme that we thinking of trying and deal with some of the
problems we face in backlogs.

                    Measures to deal with prison escapes

43.   Ms F Nyanda asked the Minister of Correctional Services:

      Whether his department has put any measures in place to deal with
      escapes from cells or prisons; if not, why not; if so, what measures?
                                                                    C96E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, we are getting there!
We are getting there! [Laughter.] We are! We are getting there! The last
escapes we had, we managed to capture those criminals in three days’ time
and they are now languishing together with two members who helped them. I
fired the two members from the service, of course. The prisoners are in
Kokstad and they will come out when I am a little bit older than this. They
are doing their time in Kokstad. I probably won’t even remember them by
that time when they come out; neither will they probably remember me.

The Department of Correctional Services has to deal with escapes on a daily
basis. The curbing of escapes is a critical performance area in this
department. In dealing with this problem of escapes, the department is not
only concentrating on certain areas of escape, but a holistic approach is
followed in order to address all the causes of the escapes. But also, keep
in mind, some escape from police cells and some from correctional centres.
I am really concentrating on those that escape from correctional centres,
because I don’t have the responsibility over police cells or in-transit
when they come from court. That is why I am saying we are getting there.

The implementation of the national regional escape prevention strategies,
which focus amongst others on the following, special security measures
during admission of inmates, any inmate that we take into our centres, we
take through those measures; be it Johnny de Lange or Ngconde Balfour, you
go through those measures and you are told exactly what is going to happen
with you.

They increased access control measures at correctional centres to prevent
unauthorised articles from entering the centres. This is where again we are
getting to be quite tight so that when you go in any of our correctional
centres, you don’t enter with unwanted items. We make sure. We are also
going ahead with cutting down on the privileges of inmates, particularly
parcels that are brought in from outside. That is going to come to a
screeching halt.

These include installation of access control equipments as well and
security fences at several correctional facilities with the main focus
being to prevent dangerous items such as fire arms, hacksaws, etc from
entering correctional facilities. Strong emphasis is placed on the proper
identification and searching of all persons entering or leaving any
correctional facility. You cannot enter or leave without this. This is
mine! I can go into any correctional centre in this country with this and
make sure that I know exactly what they are doing. Whether I wake up at 12
o’clock or 2 o’clock in the morning I can enter and I will tell you exactly
what they are up to. We are making sure that nothing goes in without us
knowing about it.

Increased control and supervision over offenders in units or in sections
during the day and night, which includes regular visits by senior officials
is to ensure that guarding officials are vigilant at all times. We don’t
want guarding officials to be sleeping, that is why the Minister has got
this, because he can walk in at any time and take a photo of you and the
following day tell you to pack your bags and leave.

Concerning the increased searching of cells, we search our cells all the
time and our living units, which include regular surprise searches. Judge
Nathan Erasmus, who is the acting inspecting judge, just went on a visit to
Malmesbury Prison the other day to search for the double bed and the 74cm
flat screen TV set. He didn’t find any of those. The establishment of
secure correctional units for the incarceration of high-risk awaiting trial
detainees and high-risk offenders - all those who kill police and all those
who ambush and do heists - we have particular sections for them, where we
keep them individually and make sure that their movements are monitored all
the time.

The establishment of communication links with the criminal justice system –
what the Deputy Minister was saying here – we’ve got that system now that
is going to link all of us together so that if any offender is picked up by
the police, we know exactly the right path for that offender to come to us.
And if you escape, the police have your file, justice has your file, we
have your file and we will nail you.

The number of escapes from all correctional centres decreased with 29 from
108, which is 27% decrease in 2004 to 79 in 2005. 43 offenders escaped from
within correctional centres during the period of January - August 2006,
this year, which is a 12% reduction compared to the 49 escapes for the same
period in 2005. And all of them, those that have escaped, probably are on
the run just for a day or two and after that we take them to the maximum
facility in Kokstad, which is my best, best facility. If any of you think
they can do something and not end up there, think again.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, arising from the calculated response by my
Minister, are we getting any fruitful outcome by the usage of the CCTV
cameras of late?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Double trouble. Thank you very much,
hon Kgoshi. We are getting quite a number of benefits from there. As I
said, we have cut down on the number of escapes and secondly, we are going
to expand this closed circuit TV system to look at the cells themselves,
because we didn’t have them in the cells before. We’ve got them in the
passages, in the entrance, the exit and outside, but now we are extending
their use, because we have had some savings. We are extending them to
inside the cell so that we know exactly what is happening in each cell of
each prisoner. No offender is going to tell us that they have privacy. You
break the laws of a country, you take your limitations away and you have no
privacy. You will do as we are doing in our correctional centres, end of
story.

          Progress in reducing number of child offenders in prisons

44.   Ms F Nyanda asked the Minister of Correctional Services:



     Whether any progress has been made by his department in reducing the
     number of child offenders in prisons; if not, why not; if so, what
     progress?
     C102E

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: The department has little control,
really, over the number of offenders that are referred to correctional
centres either as sentenced offenders or awaiting trial. However, efforts
are made to remove children from correctional centres. This is something
that we, the justice system together with Social Development have to try
and sort out. The department is engaging in collaborative interaction with
other role players in the integrated justice system, and has embarked on
initiatives to remove children from its facilities.

The existing initiatives include among others Intersectoral Committee on
Child Justice. We are working there with Justice and Constitutional
Development. They are taking the lead in that one. Social Development leads
the National Children’s Bill task team. The referral of children designated
to reformatory schools is led by the Department of Education. Conversion of
sentences to correctional supervision is led by the Department of Justice
and Constitutional Development, because we depend on them and on the
magistrates, as the Deputy Minister was saying, to actually divert children
away from prisons into these reformatory schools and to other areas, but
also for correctional supervision.

One of the problems we sometimes encounter is that when we need an address
for the parents and people who are going to look after the children and for
the child to go to, parents have the tendency of saying, “keep him there Mr
Balfour, we do not want him here.” We need you people, as legislatures to
assist us with this. Children who are awaiting trial are continually
referred to courts for the reviewing of detention or to finalise their
cases. Information is submitted to the Department of Social Development
monthly from us so that they can find alternative placement for these
children. A name list of children waiting to be transferred to reformatory
schools is forwarded to the Department of Education on a monthly basis.

In March 2006 the Department of Correctional Services had 19 children
awaiting trial, designation to reform schools and by the end of June 2006
there were only seven children. I was in a courtroom by the way yesterday,
listening to a court case of a 15-year who has been caught selling dagga,
and I knew immediately that he is going to get some years and we will have
to look after him. So these are some of the things that we are busy looking
at with these other departments.

At a political level the Deputy Minister Loretta Jacobus of the department,
and Deputy Minister Jean Benjamin of Social Development are facilitating
discussion with all stakeholders for the expansion of diversion systems and
alternative placements such as home based supervision for these children
and their release into the custody of their parents or families who
sometimes do not want them.

Monthly meetings are held with various stakeholders to discuss strategies
for the removal of these children from detention facilities. Statistics
reflect that the number of children in custody fluctuates up and down, form
April 2006 to May 2006 numbers decreased and between May and June there was
a serious increase. It should be mentioned that correctional centres admit
offenders and awaiting trial detainees daily.

And as they come in we must ensure that the ends of justice are not
defeated by simply releasing children, because some of them have committed
serious crimes. Therefore we do not want to be defeating the ends of
justice without looking at the safety of the communities, and that of the
children as well. Hence an integrated approach with relevant stakeholders
with interest in the criminal justice system is quite necessary in dealing
with the issue of children in custody.

My department is of the opinion that children do not belong in correctional
centres, as the facilities are not conducive to their development. We
believe in that and we panic when we see children in these centres, because
they do not belong there at all. Their detention exposes them to undue
influences. The children belong to environments that can help them learn,
grow, and mature as good human beings and as productive citizens. Thank
you.

Nk F NYANDA: Ngiyabonga Sihlalo, bengithanda ukubuza kuNqgonqgoshe ukuthi
ayikho yini enye indlela engenziwa ukuthi lababantwana bangahlali lapha

[Ms F NYANDA: Thank you Chairperson, I want to ask the Minister whether
there is any other means which can be used to remove juveniles from prison
cells and be kept in protective custody, because if they stay in prison
cells, they get mixed up with adults who abuse them and they also learn all
sorts of things which they are not supposed to learn and they get confused.
Thank you.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Hon member, it is exactly what we
have been saying. For instance, there is a 14-year old whom we have to deal
with. She was arrested with her aunt. They had given coffee to his grandma
who died after that. The coffee was poisoned. The aunt has managed to get
herself bail, but not for the 14-year old girl. We do not have a section
for 14-year old children. She was thrown into the women’s section of the
East London prison, and we had to deal with that.
We agree with you fully hon member that these are some of the issues. And
with the justice system that is integrated now I think I have related that
to the Deputy Minister. We had to find the way, together with the social
workers and everybody else to get this young lady out of the system.
However, she will still have to face the courts. There is no way we can try
and hide her away from the courts. She will still have to face the courts,
but at least not from the prison itself, but from a home where she can then
go to court, and then it will be the magistrates and the courts who make
decisions on what to do. We are trying our best ...

... ukuba bathathwe ke mama, babe neendawo zabo, bangahlali apho
ezintolongweni kuba baza kufunda... [To remove them, Madam, so that they
can have their own places and not remain in prison because they will learn
...]

... all kinds of things when they are in prison. We are trying our best,
its not easy. We really depend on the magistrates and judges, and that is
if judges see children, they will see them to really try and divert them or
give alternative sentencing or let them wait somewhere else, and not in a
prison environment.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Chair, and Minister it’s heartening to hear that you
are not happy with children being in prison. But again we want to say that
no child deserves to be in prison, even for one night. Surely we can now
look at secure places where they could go, and we should instruct
magistrates, seeing that we have this cluster of magistrates and judges,
that children are not to go in prisons and to keep children at the prisons,
and work the rehabilitation thing after the sentence, they should work in
safe houses and whatever. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: There is something going on here. I
must actually emphasise the point that it is because these kids have
committed crime. I must admit that, because some of them do commit crimes.
Nobody - not even I, the Minister - ever invites anybody to prison. I
don’t. I would never stand on a street corner and invite people to come to
prison. It is one place that I do not need growth in. I need growth outside
of prison not in prison. So, when they are there, it is because they have
been arrested for committing crimes. So, we have to be very realistic about
that.

However, again all we are saying is, they don’t belong there, they belong
somewhere else in places of safety and they need to continue their
education so that as the case goes on, the life of that child does not come
to an end. He or she can continue with whatever they were doing. Then, once
the sentences are given, again sentences in my mind, – and again I am not a
magistrate, I’m just a farm boy from Alice in my mind all that can be done
is to try and divert them and give them community service.

Yes, there will be cases where they won’t be able to get that because of
the seriousness of the crime. However, the more they can be given community
service, the more they can be diverted away from the prisons, the better
for all of us. We can then work at rehabilitation, not only in prison, but
also outside in the communities. Then we need communities to help us, but
also to help with talks out there so that children do not commit crime. We
do it from the prison side as well as Correctional Services, side. If we do
have some rehabilitated inmates, we send them out to give the message out
there to say, “doing crime is not the right thing.”

However, we are also encouraging parents and making an appeal to parents.
“Surely you cannot go to bed without knowing where your 12-year old or 11-
year old and 13-year old is. Surely you can’t”. You have got to say to
yourself “I have a responsibility, I brought this child into this world, I
have to find out where that child is”. You must make sure that continues,
so that it does not become Ngconde’s problem. It cannot be like that. It
must be a societal responsibility for all of us. I am making that plea so
that even if you visit correctional centres or churches, please make that
plea that children ought to be looked after properly. Thank you very much.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I must thank the Minister for the
elaborative response. Rising from that, hon Minister, I wonder what we as
the people can do to parents who refuse to accept these kids immediately
after they are released from these prisons because of the crimes they have
committed? I do not know if there are measures that we can apply in order
to try and educate these parents to accept them back, because while we
doing our oversight we came across many of these kids who said,” Our
parents have chased us away from our homes because of the crimes we have
committed. ”They went back to prison to say, “No, we feel safe here because
they don’t want us at home.”

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES:  Kgoshi, it is very painful to come
across those kind of issues. But I think we need to think with our heads
sometimes, and not with our hearts. Sometimes we do make that mistake.  I
am one of those people who think with my heart when I see some of these
children in prison and women who are pregnant or women with children in
prison, I think with my heart. Sometimes I think I am going to get into
trouble here one day.

Johnny De Lange and Bridget Mabandla are going to have me arrested for
saying to these young women and these children: “What are you doing here?
Open the doors! Go home!” I am going to get arrested one day for doing
that. So we have got to think with our heads and not with our hearts. I
think the moral regeneration movement is critical in that it has always
preached the values and the responsibilities that we have as parents, not
only as leaders of our communities.

We preach that all the time. I know there is a member, -I have made a call
last time to members, one member from the NCOP, – and I take my hat off to
you. He has been visiting prisons in his area where he lives. And every
time he visits, he will phone and report to me that, “Minister I have done
this.” And I appreciate that so that I am not the only bloubaadjie here. At
least there are other bloubaadjies. I call my self a bloubaadjie because I
spend most of my time in prison.

So, the programmes like Heartlines are actually espousing the values that
we want to live by in this country. We need to push moral regeneration,
other issues and other programmes of education all the time. And we need to
be real parents, not only for our children but parents for other children
as well.

Umntwana ayingomntwana wam kuphela. Umntwana ngumntwana wethu sonke. [A
child does not belong to an individual, but to the whole community.] We
need to do everything in our power to say, no when something is wrong. Even
at the expense of not being popular. Thank you very much.

 South Africa’s role in attempt to establish peace in Somalia; and progress
      in the creation of a common market in the Southern African region

45.   Mr J M Sibiya asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:
     (1)    Whether South Africa is playing any role in an attempt to bring
          about peace in Somalia; if not, why not; if so, what (a) role,
          (b) other role players are there and (c) success has thus far
          been achieved;



     (2)    whether any progress has been made in the recent Southern
          African Development Community Foreign Minister’s meeting held in
          Maputo to discuss the creation of a common market in the Southern
          African region; if not, why not; if so, what progress?
                                                   C217E

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Ms S van der Merwe): Chairperson,
may I say how delightful it is for me to be here. We don’t often get the
opportunity to address this august House. The response to the question is,
yes, indeed, South Africa does support the efforts of the African Union and
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, Igad, in bringing about
peace in Somalia. Through our membership of the AU Peace and Security
Council, we are part of the collective, which is involved in this peace
process.

The successes that the role-players, including the AU and Igad, have
achieved thus far include the setting up of the transitional federal
government in Somalia and the continued functioning of that government. But
many contentious and challenging issues do remain regarding that area. For
example, the AU and Igad have made a proposition that peacekeepers ought to
be deployed to Somalia. However, the United Islamic Courts, the grouping
that took control of Mogadishu earlier this year, have opposed such
deployment of foreign forces. So there are a number of difficulties and a
great deal of challenges that still face the peace process in Somalia.

In response to the second part of the question, regarding the SADC Council
of Ministers, yes, indeed, in 2006 the SADC Council of Ministers meeting
discussed the issue of the common market within the context of preparations
for the SADC customs union. It will be recalled that the targets adopted by
SADC include a free trade area in the region by 2008, customs union by
2010, a common market by 2015 and a monetary union by 2016.

The council, on this occasion, endorsed the formation of a broad-based task
force to spearhead the customs union preparations. The task force is made
up of Ministers of Finance, Investment and Economic Development, Trade and
Industry and the SADC Secretariate. This task force is expected to report
to the extraordinary summit in 2007.

I also thought I should add that at the SADC summit in Lesotho, in August,
integration, generally, was also the subject of discussion. It was decided
there that there would be a special summit in October this year in order to
deal with some of the integration issues which are also very closely
related to the customs union.
Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Thank you very much for the answer. My follow-up is on
the second part of the question: How do you propose that we should deal
with economic liabilities such as Zimbabwe in this common market?
[Interjections.]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): Order, hon members!

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Ms S van der Merwe): Chair, we will
obviously be pursuing the issues through all the relevant structures. As I
have said, a task force consisting of all the different Ministers will be
thrashing out the issues.

We do continue to believe that the deadlines that have been set – with 2008
as the first one – are rather tight deadlines. However, it is our stated
objective, as members of the Southern African Development Community, that
we will continue to pursue the customs union in order to get a properly
integrated and functioning system in our region.

Of course, the SADC region is one of the recognised regions of the African
Union as well. It is one of the five regions which form the pillar of the
African Union’s regional policy. So it is in our interests to pursue these
ideals and to continue to work towards the development of a customs union
and the associated benefits for all the countries in the region. I thank
you.
 Motivation for draft interception legislation requiring registration of SIM
                          card and cellphone users

46.   Ms M P Themba asked the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
      Development:



      (1)   What is the motivation for the draft interception legislation,
           which requires the registration of SIM card and cell phone
           users;




       (2)  whether there has been an increase in certain crimes committed
           since SIM cards have become readily available; if so, (a) what
           crimes and (b) what are the further relevant details;




       (3)  whether the registration and data base of SIM card and cell
           phone users is expected to assist with the investigation of
           crimes; if not, why not; if so, (a) what are the relevant
           details, (b) what is international best practice in this regard
           and (c) how do some other countries deal with the issue of
           registration of SIM card and cell phone users;




       (4)  (a) what is expected from holders of SIM cards and cell phones
           which are not currently registered and (b) what are the
           penalties for non-compliance?
           C218E


The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Hon Chair,
these questions are obviously a bit unusual in so far as the Bill is still
being processed in the National Assembly. It is still coming to this House.
So, I am dealing with a fluid situation because I don’t know what the
outcomes of all those processes will be.

However, as far as I know, there has been huge lobbying by the service
providers in Parliament, and they must have reached the NCOP as well. I
have endeavoured to answer the question on the basis of what the Bill was
when it was introduced, and not what it may become. But, in the process, I
have had to give a rather lengthy answer, of course, because the questions
are rather detailed regarding the aspects on which these service providers
are also opposing the matter.

The Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of
Communication-related Information Amendment Bill, 2006, was introduced in
Parliament in order to amend sections 40 and 62(6) of the Regulation of
Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related
Information Act, 2002.

As the hon member is aware, the primary purpose of the Act is to regulate
the interception of communications in the case of serious crime or in
instances where the security of the state is threatened. Such interception
can, however, only take place on the authorisation of a judge of the High
Court, which is granted on a case-to-case basis.

For such interception to be effective, in the case of cellular phone
communications the law-enforcement agencies need to know who the owners of
the cellular phones and SIM cards are, particularly in the case of prepaid
users, in respect of whom the cellular phone operators currently hold no
information.

For this purpose, sections 40 and 62(6) of the Act require sellers of
cellular phones and SIM cards to obtain and keep the personal particulars
of persons who buy or own cellular phones and SIM cards which are used on
their telecommunication systems. The information required includes names,
identity numbers and addresses.

Section 40 regulates this registration process in respect of cellular
phones and SIM cards which are sold after the legislation comes into
operation, while section 62(6) regulates this registration process in
respect of persons who own cellular phones and SIM cards when the
legislation comes into operation, giving existing owners a specific period
within which to ensure that their particulars are registered.
The amendments to these provisions emanate from a request of the cellular
phone operators and, in essence, allow for the electronic capturing of the
information rather than the paper-based process, which the provisions of
the current Bill require.

The answer to 2(a) and 2(b) is that I would propose that the questions
should really be addressed to the Minister of Safety and Security, because
these have something to do with investigation procedures. However, I must
tell you that, from my own experience and particularly from passing this
legislation, it is common knowledge now that most of the organised crime in
this country is done through cellular phones and particularly prepaid
phones. With a prepaid phone that you just pick up, you don’t have any
identity and nobody knows who you are. You can throw it away. You can use
it to commit a crime and leave.

A lot of bank robberies that take place today are facilitated by bank folks
who live and work there. You withdraw your R5 000; they just SMS their
friends and tell them that, “It’s the one with a red shirt.” and when you
come out, you get robbed. That is all done through cellphones. At the
moment, your vast majority of crime, particularly organised crime, is done
through your cellular networks. When we passed the legislation originally,
we were given inputs on those matters.

As to question 3(a), again, most of this question should be addressed to
the Minister of Safety and Security. However, I can venture to state that
the capturing of the information of a cellular phone and SIM-card user will
assist the law-enforcement agencies in the investigation of crimes, to the
extent that they will be able to trace the owners of the phones and SIM
cards which are used in the commission or planning of serious crimes. As
already mentioned, this is of specific importance in the case of prepaid
users whose particulars are not captured or available at the moment.

The answer to question 3(b) is that it is not possible to furnish
information in respect of international best practices since different
countries have adopted different measures suited to their particular
circumstances in order to facilitate the interception of communications.

As to question 3(c), countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Norway, the
Slovak Republic, India, Thailand, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Germany, Malaysia,
Australia and Brunei Darussalam are among the countries that have taken
steps to ensure the registration of the particulars of cellular phone
users, and in particular those of prepaid users.

The reason why prepaid services need to be regulated is because the users
thereof, unlike contract users of cellular services whose particulars are
kept by the cellular operators for billing purposes, are anonymous. In
order to register prepaid users, these countries have required cellular
operators to implement a process to ensure that their customers are
registered within a certain period of time. The registration process, in
general, entails that the user of a SIM card must submit an appropriate
nationally recognised identification document to the operator, against
which the user’s identity can be verified.

In some countries cellular operators are required to keep copies of the
identification documents of their customers. The particulars of the users
are captured and stored by the operators in their storage facilities. Law-
enforcement agencies have access to these storage facilities in accordance
with the laws of these countries. Registration is enforced in some
countries by means of deactivation of a person’s service if he or she does
not register within the required period determined for registration.

The answer to question 4(a) is that, since the draft legislation is still
in the parliamentary process and subject to change, it is not possible to
say at this stage what is expected of SIM card and cellphone owners whose
particulars are not registered. However, the Bill, as introduced into
Parliament, envisages that owners of cellphones and SIM cards, when the
legislation is implemented, will, within a period of 12 months, be required
to have their particulars registered at registration points by agents of
the mobile cellular operators.
Their cellular phone and SIM card numbers will be captured, as well as
their full names; identity numbers; and residential, business and postal
addresses, where applicable. These personal particulars will be verified in
a certain way.

As to 4(b), non-compliance is not criminalised. However, if a person does
not submit the required details to an operator within the 12-month period,
his or her cellular service will be terminated. An operator which allows
service to a customer - after the 12-month period - whose particulars are
not registered, is subject to criminal sanctions. I am sorry about that,
but the questions required a detailed response. I thank you.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): Hon members, I just want to
remind you that you must indicate whether you will be part of the Peoples’
Assembly or not. In fact, that is the programme of Parliament and therefore
members are requested to submit those forms that were given to them by the
end of today, and they should contact their provincial Whips.

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson

    (a)     Resolutions of the 114th International Parliamentary Union
        Assembly.

        THE NEED FOR URGENT FOOD RELIEF IN ORDER TO COMBAT DROUGHT-INDUCED
        FAMINE AND POVERTY IN AFRICA, FOR THE WORLD'S MOST INDUSTRIALIZED
        NATIONS TO SPEED UP AID TO THE CONTINENT AND FOR PARTICULAR EFFORTS
        TO BE MADE TO REACH DESPERATE AND POOR POPULATIONS


        Resolution adopted unanimously by the 114th Assembly
        (Nairobi, 12 May 2006)


        The 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


        Deeply concerned that intensive  natural  and  human  activity  has
        continued to upset the environmental balance  and  thus  erode  the
        global environmental capital,


        Noting that  the  negative  effects  of  globalization,  population
        growth and the exponential increase in demand for natural resources
        driven by consumerism pose far-reaching dangers to the ecosystem,


        Further noting that Africa in particular is  faced  with  the  real
        challenge of high levels of poverty and environmental  degradation,
        which  compound  the  effects   of   floods,   soil   erosion   and
        desertification, and  that  the  consequent  destruction  of  water
        catchment areas results in unreliable water supplies for  domestic,
        industrial and agricultural purposes,


        Aware that urgent food relief is needed  in  order  to  combat  the
        drought-induced famine and poverty now  pervading  large  areas  of
        Africa,


        Further aware that Africa needs sustainable development  strategies
        to combat famine and poverty rather than  relying  on  food  relief
        every time natural disasters and calamities occur, and recalling in
        this regard the Millennium Development Goals, which aim inter  alia
        to achieve a massive  reduction in poverty,


        Conscious of the need for a multisectoral approach  to  sustainable
        development that encompasses not only sustainable  food  production
        but also good governance, respect for human rights, eradication  of
        corruption, development of infrastructure and provision  of  access
        to communities, and security for the population,


        Recalling that the right to food is  a  basic  human  right  and  a
        binding obligation that is well established under international law
        and recognized in the Universal Declaration on  Human  Rights,  the
        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  and
        a plethora of other instruments,


        Recognizing that women in Africa play a key role, especially in the
        agricultural sector,  and  that  their  empowerment  can  therefore
        contribute significantly to improving food security,
        Aware that the heavy external debts owed  by  most  African  States
        constitute a major hindrance to development and that  debt  relief,
        where provided, has released substantial  additional  resources  to
        support food security and other programmes, such as  education  and
        health, in many countries in Africa,


        Noting that the world's most industrialized countries  are  capable
        of speeding up aid to the continent for the  immediate  purpose  of
        famine relief, and recalling the numerous commitments made by these
        countries in, inter alia, the Monterrey Consensus,  the  Millennium
        Development Goals and the New York Declaration  on  Action  against
        Hunger and Poverty,


        Recalling the numerous previous resolutions adopted by  the  Inter-
        Parliamentary Union on the  many  issues  relevant  to  famine  and
        poverty, in particular the resolution on the right to food  adopted
        at the 96th IPU Conference in Beijing in 1996,


        1. Makes a pressing appeal for increased supplies of emergency  food
           assistance to be made available to  drought-affected  nations  in
           Africa, and calls on governments collectively to meet the targets
           contained in the repeated appeals from international agencies, in
           particular the World Food Programme, for such assistance;


        2. Urges the governments concerned to take every appropriate measure
           to facilitate  access  to  the  affected  areas  for  the  speedy
           delivery of food supplies and to provide security;



        3. Calls on all parties to ensure that food  relief  programmes  are
           not used for political ends and that food is distributed to those
           in need without political interference;


        4. Recommends that parliaments in the affected countries monitor the
           delivery of food relief programmes, and invites them to report on
           their findings to the Inter-Parliamentary Union;

        5. Calls on the governments of the countries concerned to make every
           effort  to  implement  the  Millennium  Development   Goals,   in
           particular those relating to the reduction of  poverty,  and,  to
           this end, to pursue sustainable development strategies;

        6. Affirms that  such  medium-  and  long-term  strategies  must  be
           comprehensive and aim to promote good governance and respect  for
           human  rights,  eradication  of  corruption,   sustainable   food
           production, development of infrastructure and provision of access
           to  communities,  and,  most  importantly,   security   for   the
           population;

        7.  Calls  on  all  African  countries  to  develop  policies   that
           facilitate the full and equal participation of women in political
           and economic life, so that they can  contribute  to  and  benefit
           from the development of their countries;

        8. Further calls on African countries to take  measures  to  promote
           and protect the security of land tenure, especially with  respect
           to women  and  poor  and  underprivileged  segments  of  society,
           through legislation and programmes  that  protect  the  full  and
           equal right to own land and other property, including  the  right
           to inherit,  in  accordance  with  the  Voluntary  Guidelines  to
           support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food
           adopted by the United Nations Food and  Agriculture  Organization
           in November 2004;

        9. Further calls on  the  international  community  to  support  all
           efforts to improve access to education  and  vocational  training
           for people in poverty-stricken regions, this  being  one  of  the
           most effective measures of reducing poverty in the long term;

       10.  Further  calls  on  all  governments  to   facilitate   conflict
           resolution in affected areas in order to ensure human security;

       11. Urges governments to encourage people in the  affected  areas  to
           end certain practices that promote hostilities, including  cattle
           rustling;

       12. Appeals to the developed countries  to  respect  the  commitments
           they have made to provide assistance to developing countries  and
           calls on them to  accelerate  implementation  of  the  Millennium
           Development Goals and the New York Declaration on Action  against
           Hunger and Poverty in this regard;

       13. Strongly urges the developed countries substantially to  increase
           their financial assistance, notably through innovative sources of
           financing for development, for the specific purpose of  improving
           agricultural industry  in  affected  countries  with  a  view  to
           boosting food production and thus ensuring food security;

       14. Calls on the developed countries to  extend  and  implement  debt
           cancellation programmes  in  respect  of  all  African  countries
           affected by drought-induced famine;
       15. Invites relevant international and multilateral  institutions  to
           review their policies and programmes to ensure that these do  not
           in  any  way  detract  from  or  undermine  policies  pursued  by
           countries to ensure food security;


       16. Calls on the developed  countries  to  phase  out  all  forms  of
           agricultural  export  subsidies,   to   reduce   trade-distorting
           domestic support to agriculture, and to open their markets to the
           world's poorest countries;

       17. Calls on the United Nations agencies, in  particular  the  United
           Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),  to  increase  funding  and
           other measures to combat worsening environmental  degradation  in
           Africa, in particular in areas affected by drought and famine;

       18. Encourages African  parliaments  to  promote  the  socio-economic
           development of areas affected by drought and  famine,  which  are
           also often marginalized,  through  a  range  of  legislative  and
           budgetary measures, including income-generating measures;

       19. Invites the United  Nations  to  give  rapid  effect  to  General
           Assembly resolution 57/265 on  the  Establishment  of  the  World
           Solidarity Fund (and the eradication of  poverty),  in  order  to
           expedite the provision  of  financial  resources,  and  calls  on
           parliaments to adopt the requisite implementing  legislation  and
           to encourage their respective governments to contribute to  those
           resources so as to  enable  African  countries  to  become  self-
           sufficient and ensure their food security.

        THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENTS IN STRENGTHENING CONTROL OF TRAFFICKING  IN
        SMALL ARMS AND LIGHT WEAPONS AND THEIR AMMUNITION


        Resolution adopted by consensus* by the 114th Assembly
        (Nairobi, 12 May 2006)


        The 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


        Deeply concerned by the tremendous human suffering, especially  for
        women and children, who are the most vulnerable in armed conflicts,
        associated with the proliferation and  misuse  of  small  arms  and
        light weapons (SALW),


        Stressing that, by definition, SALW include all arms  that  can  be
        used by one person alone and all associated  ammunition,  including
        grenades, rockets, missiles, mortar  shells  and  man-portable  air
        defence systems (MANPADS), and that landmines can be considered  as
        having similar effects,
        Recalling that items such as daggers, machetes, clubs, spears,  and
        bows and arrows are also frequently used  in  armed  conflicts  and
        criminal acts, and that, although they do not fall under  the  SALW
        category, their use may need to be regulated,


        Recalling also that the  definition  of  SALW  should  not  include
        daggers and other items which are not firearms and are not used  to
        cause bodily harm, but as part of the national dress,

        Deeply concerned also by the high political, social  and  financial
        costs incurred when SALW fuel armed conflict, armed criminality and
        terrorism, exacerbate violence, contribute to the  displacement  of
        civilians, undermine respect for  international  humanitarian  law,
        impede the provision of humanitarian assistance to victims of armed
        conflict, and hinder a return to peace and sustainable development,




        Recognizing the threat posed to  civilian  aviation,  peacekeeping,
        crisis  management  and  security  by  the  illicit  transfer   and
        unauthorized access to and use of MANPADS,


        Affirming that combating  the  proliferation  and  misuse  of  SALW
        requires coherent and comprehensive  efforts  by  governmental  and
        other players at the international, regional and national levels,


        Welcoming in this regard the adoption in 2001 of the United Nations
        Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and  Eradicate  the  Illicit
        Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons  in  All  Its  Aspects  (SALW
        Programme of Action),


        Recalling the relevant United Nations General Assembly  resolutions
        concerning international arms transfers,


        Welcoming the adoption in  December  2005  by  the  United  Nations
        General Assembly of the International Instrument to  Enable  States
        to Identify and Trace, in a Timely  and  Reliable  Manner,  Illicit
        Small Arms and Light Weapons,


        Also welcoming the entry into force in July 2005  of  the  Protocol
        against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking  in  Firearms,
        their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United
        Nations  Convention  against  Transnational  Organized  Crime  (the
        Firearms Protocol),


        Recalling that the Second Biennial Meeting of  States  to  Consider
        the Implementation of the Programme of Action  to  Prevent,  Combat
        and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons  in
        All Its Aspects was held in New York from 11 to 15 July 2005,


        Pointing to the  existence  of  several  other  SALW  and  firearms
        control instruments at the level of the United Nations, and in  the
        Americas, Europe, sub Saharan Africa and Pacific regions,


        Emphasizing that  these  multilateral  initiatives  must  be  fully
        implemented by their member States and  be  supplemented  with  the
        development of high national standards,


        Underscoring that the active involvement of the  relevant  national
        authorities and of parliaments is essential for  the  effectiveness
        of any measures to combat SALW proliferation,


        1. Urges parliaments to engage actively in efforts to  combat  SALW
            proliferation  and  misuse  as  a  key  component  of  national
            strategies on conflict prevention, peace-building,  sustainable
            development, the protection of human rights, and public  health
            and safety;


        2.  Calls  upon  parliaments  to  encourage  their  governments  to
            reaffirm their commitment to implement the  SALW  Programme  of
            Action and to build on their current commitment to combat  SALW
            proliferation and misuse at the 2006 SALW Programme  of  Action
            Review Conference, while focusing on areas where  obstacles  to
            full implementation of the SALW Programme  of  Action  persist,
            namely: brokering, transfer controls, marking and tracing, end-
            user  certification,  stockpile  management  and   destruction,
            ammunition and capacity-building;


        3. Encourages parliaments to agree to a set  of  global  principles
            for international arms transfers based on  States'  obligations
            under international  law  and  internationally  accepted  human
            rights standards, as a  fundamental  requirement  for  national
            arms transfer controls and to be included as a  key  output  of
            the 2006 Review Conference;


        4. Urges parliaments to encourage  their  governments  to  redouble
            their  efforts  in  this  area  following   the   2006   Review
            Conference, notably by organizing additional biennial  meetings
            in order to develop ideas and recommendations for consideration
            at future international and United  Nations-sponsored  meetings
            and conferences;


        5. Urges parliaments to promote and  ensure  the  adoption  at  the
            national level of the legislation and regulations  required  to
            control SALW effectively  throughout  their  "life  cycle"  and
            actively to combat SALW proliferation and misuse;


        6.  Encourages  parliaments  to  promote  the  development  of   an
            international arms  trade  treaty  to  strictly  regulate  arms
            transfers  on   the   basis   of    State   obligations   under
            international law and internationally accepted norms and  human
            rights standards;


        7. Encourages parliaments to  promote  greater  international  and,
            where appropriate, regional efforts to develop common standards
            to strictly  control  the  activities  of  those  brokering  or
            otherwise facilitating arms transfers between third countries;


        8. Calls upon parliaments to ensure that those who provide SALW  to
            children, or who recruit and use children in conflicts or armed
            operations, are subject to strong legal sanctions;


        9. Urges parliaments to enact legal sanctions at the national level
            for those who commit crimes and atrocities  against  vulnerable
            sections of society such as the elderly,  women  and  children,
            and to adopt measures to prevent such crimes and atrocities;


        10.       Encourages  parliaments  to  ensure  also  that  national
            legislation is matched by the allocation of adequate means  for
            the national authorities, including training and equipment,  to
            ensure the strict enforcement of national controls;


        11.       Urges  parliaments  to   adopt   and   enforce   national
            legislation incorporating the two instruments that provide  the
            most specific guidance regarding States' obligations to prevent
            misuse: the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law  Enforcement
            Officials and the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of
            Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials;


        12.      Recommends that parliaments work towards the harmonization
            of national  SALW  controls  on  the  basis  of  strict  common
            standards, while ensuring that  national  controls  provide  an
            appropriate response to the national and regional realities  of
            each State;


        13.      Recommends that parliaments exchange with each  other  and
            the IPU information on national legislation on SALW control, in
            order to enhance understanding  of  controls  and  to  identify
            existing   best   practices,   and   establish    international
            parliamentary forums to consider SALW issues;


        14.      Urges parliaments to consider ratifying, if they have  not
            already done so, the multilateral SALW control  treaties  their
            governments have signed, to incorporate their  provisions  into
            domestic legislation in a timely manner and in accordance  with
            the aims of these treaties, and to see to it that they are duly
            implemented;


         15. Calls upon parliaments to ensure that  the  provisions  of  the
             recently adopted International Instrument to Enable  States  to
             Identify and Trace, in a Timely and  Reliable  Manner,  Illicit
             Small Arms  and  Light  Weapons  are  fully  implemented  under
             national legislation, and that ammunition for SALW  is  covered
             by national legislation to trace illicit SALW;


        16.      Urges parliaments to make violations of arms  embargoes  a
            criminal offence under national law; to sanction logistical  or
            financial support for such violations; and,  in  the  event  of
            breaches of arms embargoes,  to  trigger  the  specific  action
            prescribed for each particular embargo;


        17.      Recommends that parliaments develop  and  help  implement,
            where  appropriate  and  together  with  governments,  national
            action plans  on  preventing,  combating  and  eradicating  the
            illicit SALW trade in all its aspects;


        18.      Encourages parliaments, where  necessary,  to  set  up  or
            strengthen procedures enabling them  to  scrutinize  government
            practice and policy on SALW controls,  to  ensure  respect  for
            their countries' international commitments, and to work towards
            the high degree of transparency allowing for such scrutiny;


        19.       Calls  upon  parliaments  to  designate  a  parliamentary
            committee, or to create one at the national level  if  no  such

            on national SALW policy and control practice;


        20.      Encourages parliaments in this context to promote  regular
            reporting  by  governments  to  national  parliaments  on  SALW

            government practices are in conformity with stated  policy  and
            legislation;


        21.      Recommends that parliaments closely monitor the efficiency
            and effectiveness of their governments' fiscal measures related

            governments to  provide  financial  and  technical  support  to
            international SALW research initiatives and funds;


        22.      Invites the  relevant  parliamentary  committees  to  seek
            regular exchanges of views and information with governments  in
            a debate on government policy and action at both  the  national
            and multilateral levels, and to request  their  governments  to
            include parliamentarians in national  delegations  to  regional
            and international meetings  between  States  on  combating  the
            illicit trade in SALW;


        23.      Encourages parliaments in a position to  do  so  to  offer
            assistance to other parliaments requesting such assistance,  so
            as to develop national capacities to engage in  a  dialogue  on
            SALW with governments and scrutinize their policy  and  action,

            provide assistance in this field to interested parliaments;


        24.       Invites  the  IPU,  in  cooperation  with  its   relevant
            partners, to promote capacity-building programmes  that  enable

            and combating of SALW proliferation and misuse;


        25.       Recommends  that  parliaments  in  countries  engaged  in
            disarmament, demobilization, reintegration  and  rehabilitation
            (DDRR) programmes encourage their governments to prioritize  in
            such programmes "weapons in exchange for  development"  schemes
            to  provide  community-based  incentives  for   the   voluntary
            surrender of illicitly held SALW;


        26.      Recommends that  parliaments  in  post-conflict  countries
            encourage their governments to ensure that  the  reconstruction
            process  is  promoted  under  an  international  framework  for
            conflict prevention and peace-building;


        27.      Encourages parliaments to support  the  participation  and
            active role of  women  in  DDRR  processes  and  peace-building
            activities, and stresses the   need  to  incorporate  a  gender
            perspective  in  DDRR   and   peace-building   strategies   and
            activities;


        28.      Encourages parliaments to  urge  governments  involved  in
            DDRR programmes to  pay  particular  attention  to  the  unique
            circumstances of child  soldiers  and  the  rehabilitation  and
            reintegration of former child soldiers into civilian  life,  in
            order to prevent such children from resorting to armed crime;


        29.       Encourages  parliaments  to  urge  their  governments  to
            destroy, in public view and wherever possible, all illicit SALW
            that are recovered by the national authorities in  the  context
            of armed conflict and crime, including SALW  recovered  in  the
            context of DDRR programmes, and to dispose of such  SALW  in  a
            safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner;


        30.       Calls  upon  parliaments   to   intensify   international
            cooperation to prevent the illicit international arms trade and
            its links with international organized crime, particularly drug
            trafficking;


        31.      Exhorts the parliaments of countries that produce SALW  to
            develop effective mechanisms  for  regulating  their  sale  and
            distribution,  both  nationally   and   internationally,   thus
            preventing their proliferation;


        32.       Recommends  that  parliaments  continue  and   strengthen
            efforts, and work together with civil society, including  NGOs,
            to prevent the outbreak of conflict in regions and States prone
            to  tensions  and  to  resolve  social  and  economic  problems
            underpinning  such  tensions  and  armed  conflict,   including
            efforts to fight  poverty,  social  exclusion,  trafficking  in
            human beings, drugs and  natural  resources,  organized  crime,
            terrorism and racism;


        33.      Urges parliaments in this context  to  adopt  and  support
            adequate national measures to limit demand in  their  societies
            for SALW and firearms,  and  in  particular  to  eradicate  the
            demand for illicit SALW and firearms;


        34.      Encourages parliaments  to  develop  strategies  aimed  at
            building public  awareness  of  the  negative  effects  of  the
            illicit acquisition of SALW, including  by  proposing  that  an
            international day  be  observed  annually  to  publicize  these
            effects, and to participate in  relevant  programmes  with  the
            media, in coordination with the government and civil society;


        35.      Calls upon parliaments to promote full  implementation  by
            their governments of their pledges  under  the  United  Nations
            Millennium  Declaration  to  ensure  the  achievement  of   the
            Millennium  Development  Goals,  a   measure   which   requires
            disarmament and the reduction of armed violence.



        *  The delegation of India expressed strong reservations to the
           text of the resolution as a whole.

        Deeply concerned that, while there has been some action relating to
        these commitments, many of them remain unfulfilled, and emphasizing
        the support expressed by the Inter-Parliamentary Union for measures
        aimed at curbing global environmental  degradation,  especially  in
        the following statements, declarations, and resolutions:


         • The statement adopted by the 87th Inter-Parliamentary Conference
           and  entitled  Environment  and  Development:   The   views   of
           parliamentarians on the main directions of  the  United  Nations

           Protocol (Marrakech, 2002);
         •  The  resolution  adopted  by  the   108th   Inter-Parliamentary
           Conference  and  entitled  International  cooperation  for   the
           prevention and management of transborder natural  disasters  and
           their impact on the regions concerned (Santiago de Chile, 2003);


         • The resolution adopted by  the  111th  Assembly  of  the  Inter-
           Parliamentary Union and entitled  The  role  of  parliaments  in
           preserving   biodiversity   (Geneva,   2004),   supporting   the
           commitment of the 2002 WSSD to achieve a  significant  reduction
           in the current rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010,
        Recognizing that global environmental problems pose a common threat
        to  all  humanity,  particularly  to  developing   countries,   and
        constitute a  common  but  differentiated  responsibility  for  all
        countries,


        Considering the high level  of  exhaust  substances  in  the  ozone
        layer, and concerned about  the  growing  environmental  impact  of
        climate change,


        Acknowledging the need  for  cooperation  among  all  stakeholders,
        including government, civil society and business,


        Recognizing that it has  become  urgent  to  reconcile  sustainable
        development with globalization, the latter being  the  cause  of  a
        vicious   cycle   of   environmental   degradation   triggered   by
        unsustainable production and consumption patterns in both developed
        and developing nations, among other factors,


        Also recognizing the  importance,  in  establishing  a  sustainable
        society, of the role of  education  and  learning,  which  have  an
        impact on the awareness, lifestyle and work ethic of individuals,


        Emphasizing that preservation of the environment  is  essential  to
        poverty eradication and the achievement of the MDGs,


        Noting the launch in 2005 of the United Nations Decade of Education
        for Sustainable Development (UNDESD), involving all actors and  all
        levels  of  national  education  systems,  UNESCO’s   International
        Implementation Scheme  for  the  UNDESD,  and  the  United  Nations
        Economic Commission for Europe’s Regional  Strategy  for  Education
        for Sustainable Development  and  the  Vilnius  framework  for  its
        implementation,


        Also noting that the  International  Conference  on  Financing  for
        Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico, reaffirmed that the  target
        for the provision of official development assistance (ODA) was  0.7
        per cent of developed  countries'  gross  national  product  (GNP),
        recognizing  the  need  to  study  new  approaches  to   innovative
        financial mechanisms, and  calling  on  governments  of  developing
        countries  to  take  urgent   action   for   ensuring   sustainable
        development,


        Believing that effective administrative bodies and  enabling  legal
        and regulatory  frameworks  constitute  the  cornerstones  of  good
        governance and  thereby  enable  governments  to  address  critical
        environmental protection concerns,


        Emphasizing the importance of the gender perspective in efforts  to
        tackle national disasters, degradation of the natural  environment,
        environmental pollution, deforestation, global  warming  and  other
        environmental problems,


        Recognizing the need to establish a  sound  material-cycle  society
        with the 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) initiative,


        Concerned about the contamination of global water resources and the
        deterioration  of  the  quality  of  drinking   water   for   human
        consumption, and about water consumption increases worldwide, which
        together result in water shortages in some regions  of  the  world,
        worsening desertification and deforestation,
        Emphasizing that environmentalism should become a way of life  that
        governs the behaviour and activities of all,


        Acknowledging  the  significance  of  the  precautionary   approach
        advocated in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and
        Development, the objective  of  the  UNFCCC  climate  stabilization
        clauses, and the fact that scientific  uncertainty  concerning  the
        causes of global warming can no longer be an excuse for not  taking
        any action,


        Noting the UNEP publication Natural Selection: Evolving Choices for
        Renewable  Energy  Technology  and  Policy,  and  anticipating  the
        potential of a cleaner economy in the future,


        Recalling the essential role played by parliaments in strengthening
        efforts to encourage sustainable  development  through  legislative
        and budgetary policies that are consistent with the objectives  set
        forth  in  the  international  conventions,   through   appropriate
        initiatives to monitor  government  action,  and  through  advocacy
        aimed at public opinion and society at large,


        1. Calls upon governments to ensure prompt  implementation  of  all
           international environmental conventions to which they are party;




        2. Proposes that international environmental governance and  UNEP's
           role as a provider of policy  advice  and  guidance  be  further
           strengthened, that the participation  of  all  relevant  actors,
           including NGOs, in international environmental policy-making  be
           ensured,  and   that   multilevel   environmental   partnerships
           fostered;


        3. Calls upon all environmental management  decision-making  bodies
           to take into account the experiences, perspectives and knowledge
           of women,  and  to  ensure  their  equal  participation  in  the
           planning,  formulation,   implementation   and   evaluation   of
           environmental  policies  in  order  to  mainstream  the   gender
           component in all environmental programmes;


        4. Recalls that the European Union advocates the transformation  of
           UNEP  into   a   full-fledged   United   Nations   environmental
           organization;


        5. Calls upon parliaments, as front-line actors in  the  system  of
           global  environmental  governance,  to  participate  actively  -
           through their own delegations - in all international  events  at
           which the major options for protecting the environment  and  for
           using natural resources sustainably are debated and negotiated;


        6. Calls upon governments, when deciding  policies,  to  take  into
           account the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and its main message
           that  human  well-being   and   progress   towards   sustainable
           development  hinge  on  improving  the  management  of   Earth’s
           ecosystems with  a  view  to  ensuring  their  conservation  and
           sustainable use;


        7. Proposes that UNEP prepare a list of global environmental  goals
           similar to the MDGs, supplement these goals  with  criteria  and
           indicators  for   their   implementation   and   promote   their
           implementation as  a  significant  contribution  to  sustainable
           development;


        8. Encourages parliamentarians to press their governments  to  give

           in mean global temperatures compared with pre-industrial levels,
           and to take action towards attaining that objective, bearing  in
           mind that a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by a factor  of

           society;


       21. Calls upon parliaments to promote, within  the  context  of  the
           ratification of  international  conventions  and  treaties,  the
           adoption of national plans on  major  environmental  issues  and
           sustainable development in which goals,  including  quantitative

       31. Calls upon parliaments and governments to ensure that women have
           access to land ownership  and  are  allowed  to  manage  natural

           requirement for avoiding environmental degradation;


       32. Urges all countries to formulate a  comprehensive  environmental

        HOW PARLIAMENTS CAN AND MUST PROMOTE EFFECTIVE  WAYS  OF  COMBATING
        VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN ALL FIELDS


        Resolution adopted by consensus* by the 114th Assembly
        (Nairobi, 12 May 2006)


        The 114th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,


        Reaffirming that violence against women constitutes a violation  of
        women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms,


        Stressing that the causes  and  consequences  of  violence  against
        women are intrinsically linked to longstanding gender  inequalities
        and discrimination that restrict the full  enjoyment  by  women  of
        their human rights,


        Recognizing that women belonging to minority and indigenous groups,
        refugee women, internally displaced  women,  migrant  women,  women
        living in rural or remote communities, destitute  women,  women  in
        institutions or detention, women with disabilities, elderly  women,
        women  in  situations  of  armed  conflict  and  in   post-conflict
        situations and girl children are especially vulnerable to violence,




        Alarmed by the perpetuation of violence  against  women  throughout
        the world, both  in  the  home  and  in  the  workplace,  including
        trafficking in women and  girls  and  forced  prostitution,  sexual
        violence within  and  outside  marriage,  and  certain  traditional
        practices that are harmful to women,


        Aware that violence against women increases their vulnerability  to
        HIV/AIDS and often impedes their access  to  prevention,  care  and
        treatment services, thus contributing to the conditions that foster
        the spread of HIV/AIDS,


        Stressing that it is the responsibility of States to act  with  due
        diligence to prevent human rights violations, investigate  acts  of
        violence,  punish  their  perpetrators  and  protect  and   provide
        reparation to victims of violence,


        Noting that rape, sexual  slavery,  enforced  prostitution,  forced
        pregnancy, enforced sterilization and all  other  forms  of  sexual
        violence of comparable gravity are crimes under  international  law
        and should be repressed and punished as such,


        Reaffirming that States are not justified in invoking  any  custom,
        tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations  to
        eliminate violence against women,


        Recalling the importance of the Convention on  the  Elimination  of
        All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) and  its  Optional
        Protocol (1999), of the Declaration on the Elimination of  Violence
        against Women (1993), and of the Beijing Declaration  and  Platform
        for Action (1995)  as  effective  instruments  to  combat  violence
        against  women,  and  noting  the  existence  of   regional   legal
        instruments on violence against women,


        Noting all relevant resolutions adopted by United  Nations  bodies,
        including Commission on Human Rights resolution 1994/45 of 4  March
        1994 appointing a Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its
        causes and  consequences,  and  Security  Council  resolution  1325
        (2000) on women and peace and security,


          Recalling  the  Inter-American  Convention  on  the   Prevention,
        Punishment and Eradication of Violence against  Women,  adopted  in
        Belém Do Pará in 1994,


        Noting that violence against women hinders  human  development  and
        the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals,


        Stressing that the eradication of violence against  women  requires
        preventive and responsive policies and actions and the  involvement
        of all members of society, including men,


        Stressing that the  newly  established  Human  Rights  Council  and
        Peacebuilding Commission will  be  crucial  to  the  promotion  and
        protection of the rights of women,


        Stressing the key  role  of  parliaments  and  parliamentarians  in
        preventing and eliminating violence against women, and the need for
        States to cooperate  with  and  support  organizations  working  to
        eliminate violence against women, especially women's organizations,




        Urges governments  and  parliaments  to  ratify  international  and
        regional instruments pertaining to violence against women, such  as
        the Convention on the Elimination of All  Forms  of  Discrimination

        compliance with those instruments and with pertinent United Nations
        resolutions;


        Calls  upon  parliaments  to  ensure  that  CEDAW  country  reports
        systematically include information on violence  against  women,  in

        eliminate violence against women;


        Urges parliamentarians to refer to  and  make  use  of  the  IPU/UN

        Protocol;
        Calls upon governments and parliaments  to  give  priority  to  and
        raise awareness about violence against women as both a cause and  a
        consequence of rising HIV/AIDS and to include these  considerations
        in the relevant national strategy;


        Calls upon governments to implement United Nations General Assembly
        resolution 52/86 on Crime prevention and criminal justice  measures

        all acts of violence against women perpetrated  by  State  or  non-
        State actors in the public and the private  spheres,  to  establish
        courts specialized in  hearing  cases  of  such  violence,  and  to
        establish a governmental body promoting the prosecution of all acts
        of violence;


        Calls   upon   governments,   parliaments   and    non-governmental
        organizations to organize activities to promote public awareness of
        the  problem  of  violence  against   women,   including   on   the

        Encourages the establishment of parliamentary bodies to monitor and
        evaluate  all  international  and  national  measures  designed  to

        measures to combat recidivism;


        Calls upon parliaments to review legislation  to  detect  practices

        sexes and to eliminate inequality in all spheres, in particular  in
        education, health and access to property and land;


        Calls for the promotion of  nationwide  awareness  and  educational

        and programmes to eradicate violence against women in all fields;


        Calls upon parliaments to denounce and combat the extreme forms  of
        gender violence against women that are derived from  the  violation
        of their human rights and shaped by  forms  of  misogynous  conduct
        that may go unpunished, and which have culminated in  homicide  and
        other forms of violent death of women;


        Urges all States to cooperate with  and  support  all  women’s  and
        other organizations working to eliminate violence against women;


        On domestic violence


        Calls upon governments and parliaments, if they have not  yet  done
        so, to develop and implement specific legislation and/or strengthen
        appropriate mechanisms to handle criminal matters relating  to  all

        violence - find it difficult to testify in court;


        Calls upon  parliaments  and  governments  to  examine  systems  of
