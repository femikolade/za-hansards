                              NOTICES OF MOTION


Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on next sitting day of
the House I shall move, on behalf of the IFP:

  That the Council-


  (1) notes with shock that the decomposing body of Ms Sibongile Rahlogo,
       who had been reported missing after not returning home from work, was
       found in the boot of her car in Westonaria on the West Rand;
    2) further notes that a case of murder has been opened against Ms
       Rahlogo’s boyfriend, Mr Oupa Tsakane, who was using the car at the
       time and who only pointed out her dead body a few days later;


  (3) acknowledges that a person capable of committing such a heinous crime
       has no place in society; and


  (4) therefore calls upon the relevant authorities to do their utmost to
       get this monster locked up behind bars for as long as legally
       possible so that he will no longer pose any threat to society.

Mr A WATSON: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move on the
next sitting day of the House:

  That the Council-


  (1) notes with utter disgust the pathetic attempt by the hon Freddy Adams
       to defame the good name of Cape Town Mayor Helen Zille, when he
       alleged in this House last week that Ms Zille and the DA had tried to
       bribe the voters of Tafelsig to vote for the party by handing out
       loaves of bread and fish;


  (2) further notes that these allegations are devoid
        of anything resembling the truth and that the true facts of the case
        are as follows-


       (a)  the NGO participated in a campaign visit which was funded and
           organised by that NGO, and no ratepayers’ funds were involved;


       (b)  the visit in question was nonpolitical in nature and no mention
           was made of any party-political issue;


       (c)  the NGO in question received donations of large amounts of
           loaves of bread and fish, and these were handed out amongst the
           poor as a symbolic Christian gesture; and


       (d)  several other celebrities accompanied Ms Zille on this visit,
           including the mother of murdered toddler Jordan Lee Norton; and


  (3) therefore demands that the hon member, Mr Adams, does the honourable
       thing for once and apologises to Ms Zille for falsely besmirching her
       name and also to the NGO in question for bringing into disrepute the
       good reputation of their tireless work to combat crime and abuse with
       his irresponsible statement.
[Interjections.]


Mr E M SOGONI: Chairperson, on a point of order, hon Krumbock has just
shown me an insulting finger.

An HON MEMBER: What did it look like?

Mr E M SOGONI: I don’t want to demonstrate the sign that he made because it
is unparliamentary.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, please, let’s not use those signs
in the House. Are we in order, Mr Krumbock? Please, let’s not do that
because it’s insulting and unparliamentary.

Mr S SHICEKA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on next sitting of the
House I shall move, on behalf of the ANC:

  That the Council-

  (1) notes-


       (a)  with serious concern that the country loses over R2 billion of
           revenue annually to the counterfeit industry and that, according
           to Sars, the global counterfeit industry is valued at US$500
           billion, which is equivalent to R3,4 trillion and has grown from
           7% of the world trade in 2003 to 10% last year, 2005;


       (b)  with appreciation that Sars and the police have clamped down
           heavily on the importation of counterfeit goods which,
           unfortunately, results in the increase in production in the
           local counterfeit industry, and that the counterfeit goods are
           available on shelves of stores and in the streets across the
           country at a reduced price in the form of, inter alia, CDs,
           DVDs, cosmetics, washing powder, foodstuffs, etc;


       (c)  musicians and actors, under the leadership of the people’s poet,
           Mzwakhe Mbuli, have responded by physically raiding the premises
           of those selling their counterfeit CDs, DVDs and cassettes and
           on Sunday alone counterfeit CDs, DVDs and cassettes worth R20
           million were confiscated during a raid on a Johannesburg
           warehouse;


       (d)  that several brands’ companies are approaching the courts to put
           a stop to this crime and that the police are in the process of
           restructuring and building capacity at police station level
           whilst also retaining the commercial crime unit to deal with
           organised syndicates;


       (e)  that first-time offenders, if found guilty, would receive a
           sentence of a R3 000 fine per item and/or three years in prison;
           and


       (f)  that an expert counterfeit lawyer, Marilyn Knige, from Adams and
           Adams law firm said: “I know of no instances where a
           counterfeiter has been imprisoned in this country.”;


  (2) resolves that counterfeiting and piracy are crimes that should be
       combated by all patriotic South Africans who are prepared to die with
       their boots on for the good of the nation;


  (3) supports all measures taken by all those who are at the forefront of
       this battle as long as they promote the rule of law;


  (4) calls upon-


       (a)  the law enforcement agencies to increase their capacity to deal
           with this crime and take the war to the enemy; and


       (b)  our courts to impose heavy sentences, including jail terms, so
           that criminals and potential criminals may know that crime does
           not pay.



                      JOB CREATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY


                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council –


  (1) notes that the ANC in this Council has always maintained that the
       government’s policies and programmes provide the best framework for
       meeting the needs and aspirations of the people;


  (2) further notes that in terms of the most recent General Household
       Survey –


       (a)  overall employment rose from 10,8 million in 2003 to 11,6
           million in 2005;
       (b)  the percentage of people aged between 7 and 24 who were not
           attending an educational institution because of a lack of money
           to pay fees declined from 39,6% in 2002 to 35,4% in 2005;


       (c)  households living in informal structures declined to 11,7%; and


       (d)  the percentage of households that relied on bucket toilets or
           had no toilet facility declined from 13,2% in 2002 to 10,2% in
           2005;


  (3) believes the increase in job creation and service delivery, as
       reflected in the survey, is as a result of the government’s policies,
       in particular its commitment to respond with the necessary
       seriousness and determination to implement its policies; and


  (4) welcomes these encouraging revelations as yet another sign that our
       country has indeed entered its Age of Hope.


Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the draft

Order Paper as follows:
   That the Council, noting that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is
   holding its elections on 30 July 2006, resolves, subject to the
   concurrence of the National Assembly, that –

   (1)       the  South  African  Parliament  send  a  30-member  multiparty
        delegation to observe these elections;


   (2)      the delegation form part of the South African National  Observer
        Mission;

        leadership of that Mission’s leader; and


     6) the delegation tables for consideration and debate the report of the
        National Observer Mission to Parliament on its return.

        Principles and rules governing observer missions



     1. General


           (1)   Observer missions must be conducted on the basis of the
                highest standards of impartiality concerning political
                processes in the host country and must be free from any
                bilateral or multilateral consideration that could conflict
                with impartiality.


           (2)   Observer missions must be conducted with respect for the
                sovereignty of the host country, including adherence to
                domestic laws, and with respect for the rights of the people
                of the country.


           (3)   Observer missions must not interfere with, obstruct or
                hamper the processes being observed.


           (4)   An observer mission must strive to gather information
                systematically and comprehensively, to analyse the
                information within the overall context of the event, even if
                the observer mission focuses on only a sector of the event,
                and to draw conclusions based on the highest standards of
                accuracy of information and impartiality of analysis.


           (5)   Observer missions must submit a report to Parliament or
                the House that mandated it within a reasonable time,
                presenting their findings, conclusions and, where
                appropriate, recommendations they determine could help
                improve the observed processes.


           (6)   All statements of the observer Mission to the public or
                the news media must be authorised by the Mission.


        2. Conduct of members


           Members of the observer mission must respect the integrity of
           the mission, including:


           (1)   following any reasonable written or verbal instructions
                from the observer mission’s leadership;


           (2)   attending all of the observer mission’s required
                briefings, trainings and debriefings if reasonably possible;




           (3)   reporting to the leadership of the observer mission any
                conflicts of interest they may have and any improper
                behaviour they see conducted by other members of the
                observer mission;


           (4)   maintaining strict impartiality at all times, including
                leisure time in the host country, and not conducting any
                activity that could be reasonably perceived as favouring or
                providing partisan gain for any political competitor in the
                host country, such as wearing or displaying partisan
                symbols;


           (5)   maintaining proper personal behaviour and respect towards
                others, including exhibiting sensitivity for host-country
                cultures and customs, exercising sound judgment in personal
                interactions and observing the highest level of professional
                conduct at all times, including leisure time; and


           (6)   not making personal comments about the observations or
                conclusions of the observer mission to the news media or
                members of the public prior to the observer mission
                reporting to Parliament or the House that mandated it unless
                authorised by the observer mission.


         3. Violations of the Code


           If a member violates this Code the observer mission may, through
           its leadership, suspend the participation of the member in the
           observer mission and must in that event report the circumstances
           to the relevant House.

                         N2 GATEWAY HOUSING PROJECT


                          (Subject for discussion)
Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Mhlalingaphambili namalungu eNdlu
ahloniphekileyo ... [Chairperson and hon members of the House ...]

... I rise to take part in this very important debate in this august House
and to kick-start this important discussion on the N2 Gateway project.

I would want, upfront, to set the scene, raise some contextual issues and
table some important facts so that the matter is laid to rest once and for
all. In creating that context, I think it is important to make the point
that I also rise to stand here representing the provincial government of
the Western Cape, led by the ANC – a party that has saved this country from
the brink of collapse.

We have turned this economy around, an economy that was inward-looking and
was never competitive. Not only did we do that in the economic sphere, we
also did so in the case of many other things, including the issue under
discussion today.

In terms of the Western Cape itself, this is a province where black people,
and Africans in particular, were never allowed to settle or to work, let
alone have homes. When we speak about this issue today we have to bring
that historical perspective into this kind of discussion, because it is
likely that some of those people who might raise problems here today have a
certain nostalgia and want to take us back. Therefore I do want to make
that point.

From 1994, during the past 12 years of our democracy, it was essential for
us to turn things around and deliver in numbers. It was necessary to do so.
We moved from quantitative access to what we now call qualitative access.
We had to build more than 1,8 million houses because they were needed. We
have learned key lessons out of that, in terms of how we need to improve on
quality issues.

The Western Cape is a province that has many challenges. When going around
this province daily, I meet people who share their own space with animals.
In the city of Cape Town, if you go to Site C in Khayelitsha, people live
with rats as big as cats. Nobody makes a noise about that because to some
of us it is acceptable that we must live under inhuman conditions.

If you go around this province to Bonteheuwel and other districts, you will
find that our communities spend time in pigsties. That is not the history I
want to dwell on today, but it is important to create that context.

It is in that context that the champion of the poor, Minister Lindiwe
Sisulu, who is not with us today and is also dealing with these matters
abroad in Canada, introduced to us the policy Breaking New Ground. In terms
of its objectives, it is aimed at assisting us progressively to eradicate
informal settlements, facilitate inter- and intra-settlement integration;
enable urban renewal and restructuring of urban renewal; improve settlement
designs; implement mechanisms that will assist with eradication of poverty;
facilitate greater responsiveness to livelihood strategies; and also ensure
that the active participation of all three spheres of government does
achieve a common goal.

In terms of that context, we have a policy and the N2 Gateway project is a
national pilot project of that policy. It is aimed at fast-tracking housing
delivery. “Pilot” itself means that we needed to do things in a fast-
tracking way and without going through the normal routes of red tape and
bureaucracy. It is possible therefore, in terms of this N2 Gateway pilot
project and the speed at which we move and the way we do things as pioneers
in this field, that we will learn the lessons I am going to speak about at
the end of this discussion.

I think it is important for me to make the point that the N2 Gateway pilot
project was designed as an exercise in co-operative governance and
intergovernmental relations, and was guided by a memorandum of
understanding signed by the Minister of Housing, the MEC for local
government and the Mayor of Cape Town.

The project has also sought an urgent but sensitive response to Cape Town’s
housing needs that I have just outlined, particularly along the N2, between
the airport and Langa. It is a pilot project of the Department of Housing’s
Breaking New Ground Policy. It incorporates rental ownership units to
accommodate 22 000 households.

The first element comprises Joe Slovo Phase 1, which borders Langa and
consists of 705 units that have been completed, in terms of two- to three-
storey blocks ranging in size from 27m² to 48m². This project’s units, as I
have just said, are complete and ready for occupation. As the MEC for local
government in this province, I will make that announcement with no pressure
from anybody. [Applause.]

We are already in the process, as I speak here today. Tomorrow I will be
addressing the entire community of Langa. We are excited about this project
and looking forward to the occupation of this first phase. We are talking
here about 705 units and family members in their thousands, because each
family unit is going to bring many family members who never had this
opportunity before.

We have heard a noise from people complaining about this and that, but the
people of Langa and the surrounding areas are excited and looking forward
to this. We will engage them tomorrow in a meeting. There are some of us
who are saying there is going to be war and chaos and I stand here to say
there is going to be none of those things. We are going to deliver houses
to our people.

It is also important for me to make the point that, contrary to what the
public, the print and other media have been reporting, the N2 Gateway
project is not the only project in this province and city of Cape Town.
This is a pilot project and there are other housing opportunities that
people are going to access.

In terms of the N2, beyond Phase 1 there are other phases such as Joe Slovo
Phase 2, which will be a mixture of bonded housing and what we call
“Breaking New Ground” houses, and will involve banks. We are going beyond
what was created in this province such as the houses at Delft and the
matchbox houses that were created by some of the people who will be making
a noise here today. [Interjections.]

Along that strip, we aim to build 1 000 units in the combination of GAP
housing units and BNG houses. Alongside Gugulethu, in the New Rest area, we
are already involved in upgrading an in situ project which will comprise 1
200 households. Work has already started on that project. In terms of Phase
2, planning has been finalised regarding Boys Town in Crossroads and it
will go further down along there.

In Delft and Symphony the Greenfields project, which is aimed at
accommodating 6 300 units, and will have 600 rental units, is already under
way. There is another Greenfields project in Delft called Delft 729, in
which about 4 500 housing units and 800 rental units are going to be built.
That project as well as part of Phase 2 and other phases has already begun.
We are already going beyond what you see with your naked eye. There is a
lot of work being done.

It was also recently decided that Thubelisha Homes, as an agency of the
Department of Housing, should be the developer of the N2 Gateway project
and will be supported principally by the national and provincial
governments. There has also been a commitment by the housing Minmec to
contribute funds from all the provinces to help expedite the N2 Gateway
project as a national pilot project.

I would also like to make the point that, as you are aware, the three
spheres of government co-operated very well before the elections to take us
to where we are. The process, with all of its challenges, ran smoothly.

It so happened that beyond the elections we had a problem in terms of how
we address those intersphere relationships. The problem related to a new
party that came and wanted to play petty politics, a party that does not
care for the poor and leads a city that does not care.

As an MEC of local government, I am monitoring that situation and watching
them quite carefully. All they have done so far has been to make noises
about investigations; nothing else. Regarding all of the investigations
they have talked about, we have had no results concerning all those kinds
of issues. They have not put a brick in place or built a single house in
about three or four months. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, howling should not be disorderly.
Let’s allow the debate to continue. Continue, MEC.

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Chairperson, perhaps, I can understand that
kind of interjection because the truth sometimes bites. But I rise here to
make these particular points. This is an ambitious project, which is a
necessary intervention for us to make.

The Western Cape, as a province, salutes the national government. It
salutes the national Minister for making this kind of intervention. Without
this intervention, without this pilot project, the Western Cape remains a
poorer province. We should all be grateful for the kind of intervention
that the national government has made.

We have to face the challenges that we have, and these include the lessons
that we learned in terms of the capacity of the city to do certain things,
because this is a project that has to deliver 22 000 houses within a three-
year period, and the city can only deliver less than 7 000 houses in that
period. This will therefore help us to improve our capacity as a province
and also as this city. As a government, there is a national programme that
all of us have to follow.

It does not matter who runs the City of Cape Town, we are going to force
them to do the kind of things that they are constitutionally obliged to do.
They have to provide land and they have to ensure that services are put in
place. I thank you, Chairperson.

Mr R J TAU: Chairperson, hon MEC, officials from the department and
comrades, let me take the opportunity to thank, of course, the presiding
officers for allowing us an opportunity to engage in this all-important
debate. This must be viewed, once more, as a process in which we as the
NCOP reaffirm our position as a strategic House where issues at the
provincial and local level of government can get national profiling and
expression.

This must also be viewed as a unique opportunity for provinces to bring
matters of strategic importance to the public domain so that we do not rely
only on the media or papers, which not many South Africans have an
opportunity to buy or read.

The subject matter before us today is long overdue. It has made media
headlines for a long time and in the process a lot of misconceptions,
misleading statements and assertions, leading to absolute confusion among
the beneficiaries, have been made. For the record, let me state that, as
the ANC, we reaffirm our commitment to the principle of creating a South
Africa that is nonracial, nonsexist and democratic. At the heart of it is a
country with a caring society.

Consistent with that principle we have said in our world-renowned document,
the Freedom Charter, that, “There shall be housing, security and comfort.”
It was therefore no mistake that, having learnt from the challenges that
presented themselves through the housing approach of our government since
1994, government, under the leadership of the ANC, developed a strategy to
house our people much better and faster. We did this precisely because, as
a caring organisation, we had to do away with apartheid planning and racial
segregation.

It was therefore by no mistake that in 2004 the Cabinet then approved a
comprehensive plan for the development of sustainable human settlement,
commonly known as “Breaking New Ground”. It is through this plan that this
caring government seeks to arrest the mushrooming of informal settlements,
and to upgrade some, where possible, in order to realise the sustainable
settlement development.

By so doing, government will then be addressing a very important pillar of
shelter needs, restoration of dignity of people, reducing the vulnerability
and ameliorating poverty and enhancing safety and security for our people.
It is with this understanding that government will be reversing the trend
of apartheid spatial planning and further spatial marginalisation of the
workers and the poor, and achieve new modes of intergovernmental co-
operation.

For this reason, all provinces developed pilot projects from which the
department would have learned some lessons on the new approach for housing
our people. It must be noted therefore that with this being a new
experience, the Minmec - which is a forum of all our MECs - then took a
decision that because of the challenges that are facing the country, it
would be better to “test-case” this strategy in one province as opposed to
having many pilot projects in all nine provinces. And because of that and
the unique position of the Western Cape, the Western Cape was then chosen
as a test-case province.

It must be further noted that because of the caring nature of our
government and the unselfish nature of the ANC MECs, they even went as far
as compromising their own provincial housing budgets in order to subsidise
the project in the Western Cape.

It is for this reason that some, if not all of us, including the rest of
Africa and the world, were quite shocked by the Mayor of Cape Town, Helen
Zille, when she said that the N2 Gateway project was an election tool of
the ANC. It is for this reason that, as the ANC, we supported the decision
of the Minmec of 12 June 2006 to remove the City of Cape Town from the
project’s responsibilities with immediate effect. [Applause.]

We did so because we found it very irresponsible for the leader of the city
and the DA, as a party that purports to be acting in the best interests of
our people, to go out in public and politicise the project along political
lines instead of appreciating what is being done for the poor.
[Interjections.] The ANC government has stood firm in reconstructing the
lives of our people through its social transformation programme and, in
this instance, housing.

While the ANC is working hard to build our society by developing nonracial
policies, programmes and projects, Helen Zille, instead, appeared on the
recent Special Assignment TV programme to propagate racial divides by
saying that this project is for the people of Joe Slovo. She therefore
meant that this project is for blacks, as opposed to other racial groups.
[Interjections.]

It is for this reason one can once more conclude that, as we said
previously, the DA has no interest in the reconstruction and development of
our country. They have no interest in rebuilding our society. They have no
intention of taking our people out of the squalid conditions under which
they live. They have no intention of fighting poverty and underdevelopment.
Lastly, they have no intention of building an integrated society.

Through her remarks on the programme, it is very clear that Helen Zille is
very comfortable with being a movie star with a leading role as a stirrer.
Perhaps being a movie star is not enough. She may as well apply to be
registered as a freelance journalist. I say this because the Mayor of Cape
Town enjoys being on television, giving media briefings and writing
articles to the media about nothing other than the N2 Gateway. Perhaps the
name of that movie should be “N2 Gate-Zille”. [Applause.]

It is important for the nation to know that when she had the opportunity to
raise the issues, as the MEC explained, at a forum established by the
Minister, she did not do so. She preferred to write to the press about
things that were discussed where she was absent. She prefers to instil
fear, uncertainty and racial hatred amongst our people.

Before I say the DA, and in particular Helen Zille, are lying to our
people, I would like to pose a few questions; and society, of course, will
decide as to whether they are lying or not regarding what she consistently
does in her movie. [Interjections.] The questions are: Why, when Breaking
New Ground was agreed to by Cabinet in 2004, when the N2 Gateway started in
May 2005 and the elections were held in March 2006, does she say that the
project was used as an election tool? Is it not true that because of the
challenges that the Minister picked up, she went as far as informing
Parliament that she had requested the Auditor-General to do an audit of the
project? If the Auditor-General has started this work, what forensic audit
is it that makes Helen Zille make such a lot of noise about investigations?
Is it not true that the N2 Gateway will go a long way in deracialising our
settlement patterns in this country?

Once more, is it not true that the nine waiting lists inherited from the
City of Cape Town, previously governed by the DA, have been consolidated
into one nonracial list by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Nkonki, following a
request by the ANC Minister? Is it not true that PriceWaterhouseCoopers and
Nkonki have validated these lists, through a public participation process,
where our people played a central role? Is it not also true that in Boys
Town 500 transitional housing areas have been completed and 500 families
have been housed?

Why is Helen Zille therefore lying to our people and misleading our people?
[Interjections.] Only the DA can give an answer to all the questions that I
am putting, an answer that says: No. More importantly, it is important to
note that our people in the Western Cape, our people in Langa and all other
areas where they have been misled, will definitely stand up unashamedly ...

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order, Chairperson: Is it parliamentary for a
member of this House to call an hon mayor, elected by the people, a liar?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No. I have listened very carefully. He did not
say that she was a liar. He did not say that. He said that she was telling
lies. [Interjections.] If you insist, we will check the Hansard and we will
rule on that. Continue, hon member.

Mnr R J TAU: Kan ek net weer sê dat as die ANC gaan ons voort; ons gaan
lewer aan ons mense en ons gaan seker maak dat hulle nie luister na mense
wat loop en lieg nie. Ons gaan seker maak dat ons mense waardeer wat ons
regering vir hulle doen. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr R J TAU: Can I just reiterate that as the ANC we will continue to
deliver to our people; and we will make sure that they do not listen to
people who walk around spreading lies. We shall see to it that our people
appreciate what this government is doing for them.]

It is in that context that we will continue to close the gap between the
first and second economies, through the programmes with which we will
continue. We will continue with our programme of social transformation and
the DA must stop misleading our people with lousy media statements through
which they seek cheap media publicity. We also call on the media houses to
verify some of these “facts” before they print unsubstantiated allegations.
That also calls into question their unbiased and investigative journalism.
[Time expired.][Applause.]

Ms D ROBINSON: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, and hon members ... uHelen
Zille akaxoki, nam andixoki. [... Helen Zille is not lying and neither am
I.]

This debate is a curious one. Never have I seen this House so eager to
debate an issue and so determined to convey a sense of urgency. What has
motivated the ANC to call for this debate? Not the desperate state of the
N2 Gateway housing project, not the allegations of corruption and
mismanagement under former ANC mayor, Nomaindia Mfeketo. [Interjections.]
Rather, this debate has been called by the ANC with the sole intention of
smearing the Mayor of Cape Town, Helen Zille.

These are the facts. In August 2004, the Minister of Housing, Lindiwe
Sisulu, announced the N2 Gateway project. In May 2005, she said that 22 000
families would be able to move in by June. As of June 2006, only 705
housing units are almost ready – 3% of the target.

Furthermore, they are all rental units, and will not be owned by their
occupants, as they are completely unaffordable to the people most in need
of homes. The actual cost of the units has grown by more than half, beyond
the reach of the poor.

Overall, the N2 ...

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, is it right for Ms Robinson to mislead the
House, because the N2 is not only near Langa. She is aware that there is
another housing settlement ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, sit down. That is not a point of
order. Continue, hon Robinson.
Ms D ROBINSON: In addition, work began before plans were finalised or
contracts signed. This project is being built on a 50-year flood plain,
adding to the city’s costs. Certain companies were appointed, even though
they missed the tender deadlines, and some companies were given more than
twice the money they tendered for.

Meanwhile, contractors who have worked on the project are still owed
millions of rands. To cover the costs, money was diverted by the ANC
administration from other priorities. These included the city’s capital
budget as well as essential services such as fire-fighting; and still the
ANC could not complete the N2 Gateway on time.

Now the ANC accuses Mayor Zille of making the N2 Gateway into a political
issue! But the N2 Gateway was a political issue right from the start, as
you said. It was used by the ANC to campaign for votes ahead of the local
government elections.

Minister Sisulu and Mayor Mfeketo wanted the N2 Gateway to show that the
ANC could fast-track delivery to its constituencies. But it has shown
exactly the opposite. In fact, the N2 Gateway demonstrates everything wrong
with the ANC governance. The project was aimed at some people, and not
others. [Interjections.]

Mr R J TAU: On a point of order, Chairperson: I think it is only fair that
Ms Robinson withdraws her statement that I said it was used as a tool for
the elections. I never said that. I said it was wrong of Helen Zille to use
it as an electioneering tool for elections, and to try to tell society
that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That’s not a point of order. Continue, hon
member.

Ms D ROBINSON: Planning was poor, and the costs were out of control. The
new city administration has committed itself to finishing the N2 Gateway,
but only as and when the national government makes funds available. The
city has also opened a forensic audit to see where all the money was going.

That is why Minister Sisulu is upset, because the truth is coming out. She
has accused Mayor Zille of going to the media instead of the set
structures, of being unprofessional and unethical. The mayor did no such
thing. What she did do, upon taking office, was to open mayoral committee
meetings to the media, so that the public would know what was going on.
[Interjections.]

The letter was read as matter of routine at a housing portfolio committee
meeting. The media reported on an open meeting, as they should in a free
and democratic state. If those meetings had been open to the public when
the ANC was in power, perhaps the problems with the N2 Gateway would never
have happened.

The problem is not that the ANC can’t deliver. The problem is that it won’t
deliver, because it would rather do everything behind closed doors and
reward its cronies in the name of empowerment. The ANC does not realise
that the fight against corruption and service delivery to the poor are
linked. You cannot deliver to the poor if you are busy giving corrupt
contracts to the ANC elite.

Now the national government says that each of the provinces is going to
give up 10% of its housing budget so that the N2 Gateway can be finished.
What do your provinces say about that, hon members? If I were a resident in
one of your provinces, I would be furious! Why must other people suffer
because of former Mayor Nomaindia’s mismanagement?

The ANC and the Minister are pretending that Mayor Zille failed to attend a
meeting on the N2 Gateway. They fail to mention that the mayor agreed to
attend the meeting, but the Minister rescheduled it twice. Eventually, the
meeting was moved to the very time that Mayor Zille had to be in a council
chamber to prevent the ANC and ID from toppling the multiparty government.
[Interjections.]

The meeting is just a red herring, a useful pretext for the Minister to
throw a tantrum and kick the city off the N2 Gateway project. But the
Minister has in fact scored an own goal.

The forensic audit will continue. The city will continue to expose the
ANC’s corruption and mismanagement. Meanwhile, the ANC national and
provincial governments will be solely responsible for the N2 Gateway’s
failure. The city will set ...

Mr M A SULLIMAN: On a point of order, Chairperson: The hon member just said
that the ANC is corrupt. Could she just withdraw that remark?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, if you said that, it would be
unparliamentary. Could you withdraw that?

Ms D ROBINSON: [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Pardon? You said it’s alleged?
[Interjections.] Order, order! We will check the Hansard on that, and come
and make a ruling.

Ms D ROBINSON: Cape Town will be able to focus on its own efforts to
provide housing for the poor and it will, I am sure, provide more for the
city than the national and provincial governments.

An opportunity has been lost, an opportunity to work together. It has been
lost, because the ANC preferred secrecy to transparency. It has been lost,
because the ANC preferred the spectacle of delivery to delivery itself. It
has been lost because the ANC and not Mayor Zille has decided to cut ties.

The voters have already delivered their verdict. The ANC has been thrown
out of the mayor’s office.

Members, I stand here as a proud DA member, proud of the multiparty
coalition that is being led by Helen Zille, and which is rescuing the City
of Cape Town from its poor administration. Enkosi. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Chair, Deputy Chair, hon MEC ... Mphathiswa, namagosa eli
sebe ... [Minister and the officials of the department ...] ... apartheid
has left the legacy that is the cause of us engaging in this debate today.
We cannot rest until the dignity of our people has been restored. The
binding principle of our movement is to deliver a better life for all. When
millions of our people are still homeless and their dignity has not been
restored, that poses a challenge and gives us sleepless nights.

Sihlalo, yinyani emsulwa le yokuba xa sasithabatha ilizwe ngowe-1994
salifumana lineengxaki ezininzi ezinje ngale sithetha ngayo namhlanje. Yiyo
loo nto namhlanje ndime apha ndithetha ngale ngxaki ye-N2 Gateway. Andoyiki
ukuthi nditsho ukuba kaloku lo N2 Gateway siphumeze imibono kaKhongolozi
yoMqulu wamaLungelo, hayi ekaNomaindia. Ukuze abantu babenezindlu
eziphucukileyo kuza kuba ngenxa yalo Mqulu wamaLungelo wethu. Nina DA anizi
kukwazi ukuthi sithi sikhona, singayanga ndawo njengoKhongolozi nivukele
izivumelwano zobuRhulumente bobuthathu.

Sele etshilo apha uMphathiswa, Mam’uRobinson ukuba, ... lo mba awunanto
yokwenza nesiqu somntu, uNomaidia. URhulumente kaZwelonke, wamaPhondo,
kunye noweZekhaya kumabhunga bathatha isigqibo sokuvuma esi sivumelwano
kodwa namhlanje xa sininika isandla niyasala, nisinqumle. Andazi ukuba
niyenza njani loo nto. URhulumente kaZwelonke uthi nantsi indlela yokwenza,
kumaphondo, abaPhathiswa, ooMasipala, ooSodolophu, nokuba ngowaliphina
iqela, yile yokuba makuhlanganwe kuncediswane ngalo mba we-Gateway. Lowo
ngumbono woMphathiswa okhokelayo kaKhongolozi, hayi okaNomaindia.

Nina ke DA, lo mkhuba wenu wokusoloko nifuna ukubuyisela emva izinto
zabantu asinako ukuwuvumela. Abantu boMzantsi Afrika baye bazenza ezi
zivumelwano koMasipala bonke, kodwa nina namhlanje nakuphatha, okwethutyana
ke phofu nifika nimise inkqubo yokuphuhlisa izindlu. Niyamosha ngoba
uMphathiswa wezeZindlu kazwelonke utshilo apha ePalamente ukuba ucele ukuba
kuphengululwe iincwadi. Nto leyo enisoloko ningxola ngayo nathi
esiyikhuthazayo ke phofu esingayigxekiyo. Sithi ke siyancoma nakuMphathiswa
ngeli nyathelo alithethe kanye ekungeneni kwakhe kwilinge uthe wabona ukuba
lihamba okonwabu.

Nathi siye sayibona loo nto, asiyivanga ngani, noMphathiswa uyinbonile
yilaa nto athe makhe kuphengululwe iincwadi. Uphengululo-ziincwadi ke
Mam’uRobinson phaya kuMgaqo-siseko lukwiCandelo le-188 apho uthi khona,
umphengululi uyakwazi ukuba  ayokujonga phaya kuRhumente kaZwelonke, abuye
eze apha kwiphondo kuwe Mphathiswa, asuke aye kuSodolophu uMam’u Zille
afike athi ndiyaphengulula ngoku. UMphathiswa ke kaKhongolozi umnikile
imvume yokuba ayenze loo nto, akhange athi, “hayi ndiyamfihla lo Nomaindia
enimtyhola ngokwenza oku noku ekunye nabaPhathiswa”, kodwa uthe, “ngena
ngoba liyakuvumela icandelo l88 lo Mgaqo-siseko”.

Nina ke ningoobani xa sihambe ngokoMgaqosiseko, simfakile umphengululi,
nithi nina nifuna olwenu uphengululo? Ngokwentetho ephandle kodwa
niyadelela. Kaloku xa ningakwazi ukulandela okutshiwo nguMgaqosiseko,
nifuna ukuzifunela owenu umntu, yenzani, asinangxaki, kodwa zeziyazi ukuba
eli lizwe liphethwe nguKhongolozi, inkunzi ibanye esibayeni. Ndithi ke
asiyonyani lento beniyithetha apha ngezi zindlu ze-N2 Gateway phaya
kwaLanga.  Niyazazi kaloku ukuba aninyanisekanga. Niyazi ukuba eza zindlu
ziqala phi, emva kwesikhululo seenqwelomoya zizokuqhina nge-District Six,
ngoko ke le beniyithetha apha asiyonyaniso, kufuneka sinilungise.

Yekani ukuthi sithi xa sizama ukulungiselela abantu bakuthi emva kweminyaka
engama-48 yolawulo lwengcinezelo, abantu bakuthi bengenayo nendawo
yokufihla intloko, niphazamise. Zonke ezi zinto noyaziphazamiso asingo-N2
Gateway esithetha ngaye apha. Naba abanye abantu sele behlala ezindlwini
zabo, natsiya imihlaba ngaphaya kooDelft. Izolo bendimmamele uMphathiswa
kunye naye uNksz Zille bethetha ebusuku, nabantu bephendula besithi bona
babehlala emva kwezindlu zabantu iminyaka engama-30 ukuya kuma 40 bengezo
ezabo. Abanye bathi i-Peoples’ Housing Project, PHP, ithe yancediswa
ziimali zikaKhongolozi ukwakhela abantu. Abantu bonwabile bebesitsho apha
eKapa ukuthi, “ngoku sineezindlu ezinamagumbi okutyela” besithi bebeqala
nokuyibona into enjalo kuba beqhele oovezinyawo bezindlu.

Thina sibakhupha ematyotyombeni kuba ngexesha lenu nanilibele ngabo, ukuba
nisakuna ukubalibala nangoku. Asoze sinivumele nenze lo nto. Xa ndiza
kuhlala phantsi Sihlalo, mandithi, DA masiyiyekeni le nto bantakwethu,
ingakumbi kule Ndlu yokuthi sithi xa kukho umba otya umzi siwenze
owezopolitiko. Ndicela ukuba kubanjiswane kwakhelwe abantu izindlu. Yekani
ukulwa ulwakhiwo lwezindlu. Yilwani ubuqhophololo kuleyo siyanivumela,
kodwa kule yezindlu inkqubela niyibambile imile oko nithe nangena andiyazi
esele niyenzile into. Nithanda amaphepha ngaphezulu kokwenza umsebenzi
wenu. [Kwaqhwatya.]

La maphepha awasoze anincedise emsebenzini, ayesibulala kwakudala, yiloo
nto abanye bethu side singakwazi nokuwamamela, ngoba amanye awo aye
ezizixhobo zengcinezelo. Andiyazi ke nina ukuba kutheni niwathanda kangaka.
Masike sakheleni abantu izindlu. Siyayamkela Mphathiswa, nomama ongekhoyo
apha ukuba le nkqubo oze nayo uthe mayithi xha. Bona bayamosha, kufuneka
uyithathele kuwe siza kukuncedisa thina siyikomiti enyonyuliweyo, namalungu
ePalamente anyanisekileyo wonke. Siza kumane sisiya kujonga ukuba uyalwenza
ulwabiwo lwezindlu ngokufanelekileyo. Uze uzisebenzise ke eza zixhobo
zokusebenza ozinikwe nguRhulumente kazwelonke ezifana nee-database.

Siyazi ukuba asoze ibe yinto encinci ukufunela abantu ababaleka phaya
eTranskei, eCofimvaba naseMthatha izindlu, besithi baze kufuna umsebenzi
abangawufumaniyo, baphela sele besakha amatyotyombe ngoku sele bebaninzi
kakhulu. Asazi ukuba uza kuyisombulula njani loo ngxaki kodwa
sikhuthembile, kodwa ukuba ufuna uncedo ikhona le komiti ikhokelwe ngulaa
mntana kaTau, ngamanye amazwi sikhona. Enkosi. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, it is the honest truth that when we took over the running of
this country in 1994, we also inherited problems like the one that we are
talking about today. That is why I am standing here today talking about the
N2 Gateway problem. I am consequently not afraid to mention that it is
through this Gateway project that we have successfully fulfilled the
mission and vision enshrined in the ANC’s Human Rights Charter, and not
Nomaindia Mfeketo’s vision. Included in this is that people shall have
better houses. You, as DA members, will under no circumstances be allowed,
as long as we the ANC is still in power, to revolt against an agreement
that has been reached by the three spheres of government.

As the Minister and Ms Robinson have indicated, this is not about an
individual, Nomaindia Mfeketo. This has nothing to do with Nomaindia
Mfeketo. The three spheres of government reached this agreement. We are
extending a hand of friendship to you, but you seem to be rejecting our
gesture. I don’t know how you could do that. The national government has
paved the way forward for the way in which the provinces should work
together. Ministers, municipalities, mayors and all political parties
should work together with regard to the N2 Gateway project. That’s the ANC
national Minister’s vision and not Nomaindia’s.

You, the DA members, have this bad habit of undermining whatever rights our
people have attained, and this will not be tolerated any longer. The people
of South Africa have reached these agreements in all municipalities, but
the day that you take over the running of the City of Cape Town for a
little while you stop the progress of housing development.

You are causing problems because the national Minister made a request in
Parliament for a financial audit - something that you have always been
asking for and which we are supporting and not criticising. We commend the
Minister for the steps she has taken, after taking over from her
predecessor, of requesting an investigation into the project that was
moving at a snail’s pace.

We have also seen that; we never got it from you. The Minister has also
seen that, and consequently asked for an audit. This, Mrs Robinson, is
contained in section 188 of the Constitution. This section gives the
Auditor-General the right to audit the national departments, go back to
provincial and local governments, and move on to the mayor, Mrs Zille, and
say, “I am investigating now”.

The ANC’s national Minister has given her the go-ahead to do that. She did
not say: “No, I am hiding away Nomaindia, whom you alleged has done this
and that, together with the Minister.” She said: “Go ahead, because section
188 of the Constitution does allow you to.”

And who are you, after we have followed the Constitution and involved the
Auditor-General, to say that you want your own investigation? I want to
tell you that you are cheeky. And so, if you cannot follow what the
Constitution says, and want to appoint your own person, carry on. We don’t
have a problem, but you must know that this country is ruled by the ANC,
and there is only one bull in the kraal.
You are not telling the truth about the N2 Gateway houses in Langa; you
know very well that you are not telling the truth. You know that these
houses start just behind the Cape Town International Airport and stretch to
District Six. You are not telling the truth here, on a point of correction.
You need to stop interfering when we are trying to provide housing to
destitute people who were subjected to apartheid for more than 48 years.
You stick your nose into everything we do, and not only the N2 Gateway
project that we are discussing here now.

Some people are already staying in their houses in Delft. Yesterday I was
listening to the Minister and Mrs Zille’s phone-in programme, when people
were saying that they had been living in shacks for about 30 to 40 years.
Some indicated that the People’s Housing Project, PHP, has financially
helped this ANC-led government to build houses for the people. They even
said: “Now we have houses with kitchens and this is the first time that we
have something like that, because we were used to small houses.”

When we built small houses for our people, we were taking them out of the
shacks, because you forgot about them when you were in power. Even now you
still want to forget about them. We will never allow you to do that.

In conclusion, Chairperson, let me sound a very strong word of warning to
our DA colleagues, and that is that we should refrain, especially in this
House, from politicising issues when answers are needed. I request that we
work together in building houses for the people. Stop fighting housing
development and instead channel your energies to fighting corruption; we
allow you to do that. But in as far as the project concerning the
construction of houses is concerned, you are retarding the progress,
leaving it stationary. Since you took over, what have you done? You like
the media publicity more than service delivery. These newspapers will never
help you in executing your duties. We do not read some of them because they
were used in the dark days of apartheid to suppress information. I don’t
know why you like them so much.

Let us start building houses for the people. Minister, we welcome your
programme. Let’s leave behind those who oppose it. Take it over and we’ll
help you, the select committee and the honest Members of Parliament.

We will always monitor whether the distribution of houses is done in the
correct manner. You must please use the information like the database that
you get from the government.

We know that it’s not child’s play to provide houses to people who ran away
from Transkei and places like Cofimvaba and Mthatha and relocated to Cape
Town in pursuit of job opportunities, and ended up building shacks, of
which the number has now increased. We don’t know how you will solve this
problem, but we trust you and if you need assistance, don’t hesitate to
consult this committee, led by hon Tau. In other words, we’ll always be
there for you. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mnu M A MZIZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekile, Ngqongqoshe wesifundazwe kanye
nozakwethu, eqinisweni, thina be-IFP sikholelwa entweni eyodwa: ukusinisa
amahleza nokunqakulisana akusiyisi ndawo ngoba kuthunuka imizwa yabantu.
Lolu daba lwe-N2 Gateway, okunguhlelo lwezindlu, empeleni lungene
ngesinxele ngoba abaningi bethu bebengazi ukuthi kuzokhulunywa ngani, ngoba
kutheni, kusukephi, kukhale nyonini?

Ake sithi lapha, uma sikhuluma ngezindlu sikhuluma ngento eseyaba
yinsakavukela umchilo wesidwaba, noma undabuzekwayo ngoba phela siqhamuka
laphaya kudala, lapho kwakukhona ukuthi siyizifikanamthwalo endaweni yethu
yokuzalwa, lapho singumnsinsi wokuzimilela khona. Sasibizwa phecelezi
kuthiwe singama-temporary “sojourners”.

Sabe sakhelwa izindlu esasingazange sizikhethe ukuthi sifuna ukuhlala kuzo;
sakhelwe amahostela okwakuthi uma uthi uyakhuluma uma ungumZulu kuthiwe,
“Hamba uye KwaZulu.” Babethi, “Hamba uye eZululand.” Uma uthi, hhayi bo,
angazi muntu ngoba ngazalelwa endaweni ethile, bona bathi “Uzothola okhokho
bakho khona le KwaZulu.” Kwakuthiwa iya kuleyo ndawo ehambelana nolimi
olukhulumayo.

Manje sesifikile-ke lapho sithi khona abantu abazikhethele izindlu abafuna
ukuhlala kuzo. Iminyaka seyithe ukuqhela kancane ngoba manje sekuyi-12
leminyaka. Ingakho-ke i-IFP ithi ayifuni ukungena odabeni oluthinta imizwa
yabantu. UNgqongqoshe ubekhuluma lapha ethi iGateway izobe ivulwa, inikezwa
abantu. Senikhulume kakhulu abantu bengakafiki laphaya. AbeSuthu bathi: le
tsosa dibata masene.

Abantu bayofika laphaya izinhliziyo nemimoya sekuphakeme ngoba
senikhulumile lapha ePhalamende. Esikukhethayo thina njenge-IFP ukuthi
kwakhiwe izindlu ezizonikeza abantu bakithi isithunzi nokuhlonipheka.
Asingabe silokhu sikhuluma ukuthi iGateway yayitheni, kuphi nalaphi.
Sizokhuluma thina siyi-IFP uma nje sekwakhiwe izindlu, sesibona nabantu
bengena ezindlini, hhayi uma sisalokhu sinqakulisana lapha.

Ngike ngaxakeka nxa sinikezwa amabhola lapha kodwa sengiyabona ukuthi
bekuluphawu lokukhahlela uhlelo lwezindlu i-Gateway, kusengathi kudlalwa
ibhola likanobhutshuzwayo. IGateway asiyiyeke; nokuthi uMeya uZille noma
uMfeketho utheni asikuyeke. Kuphela nje lezo zindlu ngoba zikhona,
asizinikeze abantu. Asiyeke ukukhuluma kodwa abantu abathole izindlu.

Uma ningathi nabaya abantu bayongena ezindlini, ngingacela mina ngithi
ngiyahamba ngiya kokwenanela lolo daba, ngithi ngiya kohalalisela abantu
bengena ezindlini. Siqhamuka laphaya ezindlini zomxhaso. Mina ngihlala
laphaya eThokoza. Maqondana nalezi zindlu zomxhaso, kukhona omunye umame
oke washo ukuthi kwakukhona osuthakuname. Laphaya eThokoza kosuthakuname,
phecelezi ama-single room, uma kudlula isitimela ngendlela iyanyikinyeka
indlu, ungaze uphume ubaleke nawe.

Uhulumeni akakhe izindlu ezisezingeni lokuba zingakhonwa abantu. Uhulumeni
akabonelele imindeni yethu ukuze sihlonipheke, singalali nezingane zethu -
ubaba nomama nezingane. Kunendawo laphaya eThokoza ababeyibiza ngokuthi
idunusa ngoba naniqulusa nje omunye adunuse abheke le nomunye alale abheke
le.

Bakwethu, uhulumeni akalethe izindlu, alethe isithunzi kubantu. Maqondana
neGateway, ngithi phambili, mfowethu! Vula izindlu lezo abantu bangene
phakathi bese niyeka ukunqakulisana ngebhola lapha. (Translation of isiZulu
speech follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: The hon Chairperson, the MEC, and  colleagues,  in  fact  we,
from the IFP, believe in one thing: playing  childish  political  games  and
politicking will not take us anywhere, instead these things rub salt in  the
people’s wounds. The story of the N2 Gateway, which is  a  housing  project,
was wrongly put because many people did not know what we were going to  talk
about. No one bothered to explain why we  have  to  discuss  this  topic  in
particular, what the reasoning behind it is.

Well, let us say here that if we  discuss  the  issue  of  housing,  we  are
discussing the daily issue, the daily bread, and a  thorny  issue  for  many
people because we have come a long way  as  far  as  housing  is  concerned.
Initially we were called settlers in  our  country  of  birth.  We  are  the
indigenous people here. We were even called temporary sojourners.

Those were the days when houses were simply built for us  without  us  being
asked what sort of houses we needed; we were put in hostels where, when  you
spoke and people realised you are talking isiZulu, you were  unkindly  told,
“Go to KwaZulu.” They would say: “Go to Zululand.”  If you  tried  to  plead
with them and explain that you  did  not  know  any  person  in  that  place
because you were born in a certain place, you  were  told  in  no  uncertain
terms: “You will meet your ancestors there in KwaZulu.” You were told to  go
to the place that matches the language you speak.

And now we are in an era where we say: Let the people themselves choose the
houses that they want to live in. We are now many years away from the old
era; 12 years to be specific. It is for this very reason that the IFP says
it does not want to get involved in a matter that hurts the people’s
feelings. The Minister said the N2 Gateway project will be opened and
people will be given houses. A lot has been said here regarding this
housing project and the people have not yet even started occupying the
houses. The Basotho would say: “Discretion is the better part of valour”.

When people start occupying these houses they will be very angry because a
lot has been said here in Parliament. What we, as the IFP, are saying is
that houses should be built for our people, which will give them the
dignity and the respect they deserve. Let us stop talking and deliberating
too much on the issue of the N2 Gateway Housing project or what was
supposed to have happened to it, how and why. We, in the IFP, will only
discuss the matter as soon as we see the houses being built and the people
occupying those houses, not when we are still bickering here.

I was a little perplexed and surprised when we were given  balls  here,  and
at least I can now see that it was an introduction to the issue  of  the  N2
Gateway Housing project. It looks as if we are playing  football  here.  Let
us leave the question of the N2 Gateway Housing project  alone;  and  forget
about what Mayor Zille said or the then mayor Mfeketo. What  we  should  do,
instead, is to give those houses to the  people  because  they  are  already
there. Let us stop talking and give houses to the people.

If, for instance, you can point them out to me and say to  me  those  people
are going to occupy their houses, I can ask permission  to  go  and  witness
that and also congratulate those people who would be getting the houses.  We
are in subsidised houses. I, for instance, stay in Thokoza. Regarding  these
subsidised houses, there is one woman who called them single rooms.  When  a
train in Thokoza goes past these  houses,  for  instance,  they  wobble  and
shudder to such an extent that if you  are  inside  you  start  thinking  of
getting out and running for dear life.

The government must build houses that are  affordable  to  our  people.  The
government must subsidise our families so that they can  be  respected,  and
give us houses in which we do not sleep together with  our  children  –  the
mother, the father and the children, all in one room! There is  a  place  in
Thokoza that the residents call “Dunusa”. It was  so  named  because  people
would stick out their buttocks when sleeping with  other  people,  and  each
person slept facing a different direction.

Dear people, the government must bring houses to the people and restore the
dignity of people. Regarding the issue of the N2 Gateway Housing project, I
say: Forward, my brother! Open the houses and let the people occupy them
and stop playing hide and seek.]

Ms B L MATLHOAHELA: Hon Chairperson ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Just a minute, hon
member. I want to remind the members in this House about Rule 33 and Rule
32 which say that during the debate in the Council no member may converse
aloud. Please, give the members a chance to put their case across. Thank
you. You may continue, hon member.

Ms B L MATLHOAHELA: Chairperson, I greet the hon House, the chairperson,
hon Ministers and MECs. Before I start my speech, I just want to say that
something about this “bread and fish” thing that reminds me of Jesus
Christ. So I don’t know who the new Jesus Christs are here in this country.

As an ID Member of Parliament, I need to make it clear to the House that
the ID is neither for nor against any party. As the name states, we are
independent. We will go against something where appropriate and support
something where that is appropriate, according to the ID’s constitution,
principles and policies, as issues emerge.

The N2 Gateway Housing project problems are extremely complicated. Firstly,
the project is a pilot project, open to all sorts of error. By saying “it’s
open to all sorts of error”, that means that if a thing is a pilot it’s
like an experiment. Therefore all faults can come into it. Do you
understand? That is not a criticism. When something is new, you learn.
Therefore faults will creep in.

I quote the city’s most senior planner, Steven Boshoff, when he said the N2
Gateway project was “... the right kind for Cape Town”. However, questions
have been raised, which need to be answered. There was R27 million
outstanding for work done during the project’s first phase. If the project
was planned properly, why has it been hampered by financial difficulties,
since it was launched as an intergovernmental initiative? Why didn’t the
city mayor raise the concerns in the forum of Ministers, MECs and mayors?

We have to be sympathetic towards the homeless and be less comfortable in
our cosy homes or mansions. We are looking forward to seeing these problems
solved. I thank you, hon Chair.

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: Hon Chairperson, hon members, hon MEC, welcome.
Regarding the N2 Gateway project, the current tussle and political point-
scoring ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order!

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: Members of the DA, be quiet so that you can hear.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Hendrickse, I
think I am still the Chairperson here.

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: Sorry, Madam Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): You can continue
now. Thank you.

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: This does not aid delivery, except to further delay
deadlines. The nonpayment of contractors is totally unacceptable.

The Minister has been criticised for bypassing certain formalities before
commencing with the project. I would hasten to say that if that route had
not been taken, the first sod would not have been turned on this project.
We need to fast-track things. I don’t know if a project like this was ever
undertaken in the Western Cape for people of colour.

We cannot have a situation where the metro impedes progress. We cannot have
a situation where finished homes stand empty or emotions are whipped up
whilst trying to sort out the waiting list. I think the Minister was quite
correct in taking this project back.

This is what I want to say to this House now: As we speak, Helen Zille and
her police are busy tearing down structures in Parkwood and, in fact, they
started on Saturday. I want to know: Where is the DA’s heart regarding
those people who have no homes? These people are lying in the rain as we
speak, right now. In fact, court orders are being delivered to them.
[Interjections.] There are 81 persons. [Interjections.] This is the second
time inasmuch as ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order!

Mr N D HENDRICKSE: I want to tell this House that I am not talking about
something I heard, I am involved in this thing. Zille was there herself
over the weekend telling people they must get out, with her police. There
were six or seven trucks. [Interjections.] They talk about home. Where is
the heart for the homeless? I thank you, Ma’am.

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon members, colleagues, on 8 May 2006 this
Parliament celebrated the 10th anniversary of our democratic Constitution.
Interestingly enough, this event took place within a period that we have
defined as the Age of Hope. Indeed, the functioning of the different
spheres of government and the state as a whole will prove and confirm the
correctness of the fundamentals we have inserted in this most important
document, which is the foundation of our democracy.

Our Constitution, amongst other things, has created a framework around
which we have to redress the imbalances of our past while at the same time
giving us a framework within which we have to build a functioning state. It
is only through a partnership between all role-players in the housing value
chain that we can hope successfully to find a comprehensive solution to our
housing challenges.

The envisaged sharing of information between all spheres of government and
the facilitation of processes to unlock impediments to delivery and joint
home ownership through education programmes will encourage the provision of
infrastructure and development funding to accelerate funding housing
delivery, and will improve access to housing.

When the three spheres of government channel their energies, resources and
commitment, we can change the fabric of our society for the better. The N2
Gateway was an excellent example of co-operation between the three levels
of government - before the DA-led city council started showing its true
colours. But the DA-led city council of Cape Town does not understand these
principles set out in our Constitution.

I would like to refresh memories regarding the breaking of promises to the
electorate, as in the previous local government elections where the DA had
stated in their election manifesto: The DA will use the executive committee
system not the executive mayoral system to govern cities. It was stated
that this would ensure that power is not centralised in one person and that
all residents are represented in the key decision-making bodies.

On 28 February 2006, Die Burger reported that the DA wanted to move away
from the current system of municipal management where all the powers are
vested in an executive mayor. The DA leader, Tony Leon, told reporters in
Malmesbury: “We want to revert back to a system that is more democratic and
transparent”.

On the same day, at the Fernkloof Nature Reserve in Hermanus - now you
should see the gap ... en die skeuring in ’n party soos wat die geval is in
die DA. [... and the split in a party, as is the case in the DA.]

In Hermanus the DA provincial leader, Theuns Botha, told the media that the
executive mayoral system “was the single biggest downfall of the ANC”.
Despite these statements, Helen Zille told The Cape Times in an article
that appeared on 8 March 2006, that she would “support any municipal
system”.

Contrary to all these promises made during the election campaign and in
their manifesto, the DA signed an agreement with smaller parties
stipulating, according to The Cape Times of 16 March, that the mayoral
system under an executive mayor and with 10 mayoral committee seats is to
stay. Clearly, power and the position of mayor are more important than the
... [Interjections.]

Mr A WATSON: On a point of order, Madam Chair, the hon member is not
addressing the subject for discussion; he is talking about ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): No! I don’t know;
you are out of order. Sit down.

Mr F ADAMS: I can see that the hon Watson is used to giving out orders, but
the ANC won’t adhere to the DA’s orders ... [Interjections.] Clearly power
and the position of mayor is more important to the DA than their promises
to the electorate.

Pink letters of demand were sent to residents of Tafelsig during the
election campaign in Tafelsig. The mayor promised residents that these
letters would be stopped, but again it shows that the promises were made
just to get the votes. The people of Tafelsig and other areas, hon Watson,
are still receiving these letters, which is another broken promise by the
DA-led council.

The core message of the DA during the municipal election revolved around
the notion of “Take back your city” which was directed at whipping up
emotions amongst the white community particularly, and taking it to its
logical and barely disguised conclusion “... from these inept Africans”.
Also still focused on the white community, was the poster “Bly getrou”
[Remain loyal], suggesting that whites should stand together against
Africans.

These two slogans “Take back your city” and “Bly getrou” [Remain loyal.]
are reminiscent of the slogans used by the Conservative Party in the 1980s
to rally the white folk against the “verligtes” [liberals]. The
Conservative Party’s version of “take back your city” was: “Klou aan wat
joune is”. [Cling to what is yours].

The other version of the election campaign was targeted at the coloured
community with slogans like, “Stop ANC’s racism”. The DA mayor, Helen
Zille, was even more crude when she said in The Cape Times of 28 February
2006 that the ANC-led council was “applying rigid racial quotas for city
contracts and employment”.

It was said:

  It makes no sense, for example, for the ANC to apply national demographics
  to government appointments and contracts in this region, and individuals
  have been identified as a group on the basis of their skin colour and
  singled out for privileged access by government policy.

In the Cape Times of 2 February 2006, she said that, in order to meet
employment equity target that reflect national instead of local
demographics, municipal employees are pushed out for having the wrong skin
colour. She went on to say that, in housing allocations, the decision to
build the N2 Gateway in Langa - another lie - was an indication to many
coloured residents that they were being left behind because of their race.

The theme of the incompetence of Africans was evident in the DA response to
the electricity outages in the Western Cape ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Order! I seem to
think that the members of the House don’t know the difference between
interjections and conversing aloud here. You are conversing with each other
across the floor.

Mr F ADAMS: The theme of the incompetence of Africans was evident in the
DA’s response to the electricity outages in the Western Cape, where they
tacitly blamed highly-paid black managers for the outages the city was
facing. A DA councillor, Ian Neilson, was quoted in The Cape Times of 22
February 2006 as saying:

  There may be numerous competent people at mid-management and lower levels
  who knew something was needed and said so, but the problem is that in most
  cases the new managers no longer have the depth of technical understanding
  of the problems that Cape Town faces now – three years of ANC government
  with one year of low-tech senior managers have led to inadequate
  performance.

A “new manager” is a code for African managers, all of whom, according to
Neilson, lack the competence to undertake the running of a city like Cape
Town.

The DA used, in particular, the allocation of land at Big Bay and the issue
of Jewellery City to claim the presence of corruption in the ANC-led metro
council, yet it was the DA that sold the Big Bay land without tender to a
specific company below its real value and in disregard of the black
economic empowerment policy in 2001.

The DA used crude radio advertising and pamphlets in their last campaign to
claim that coloureds were not white enough during apartheid and that now
they are not black enough in the free and democratic South Africa. They
mixed their message with a sustained attack on the ID in the last by-
elections.

I want to pose three questions. As far as I understand, when the mayor
wrote a letter to Minister Lindiwe Sisulu on 5 June, the letter was
received by the Minister’s office at 10h00 or 10h03. But then between 12h00
and 12h07 the media had received the letter. Is this ethical? The Minister
never had a chance to reply; where are the ethics of the DA? Instead, the
mayor discussed these issues through the media.

The second thing is the issue of the consortium that did not meet the
deadlines. The tender was opened publicly. Who is this consortium whose
tender was accepted after the deadline? If the DA can just give us the
names we would appreciate that, instead of misleading this House.

We have three types of units: Phase 1 has one bedroom and a bathroom; and
Phase 2 has two bedrooms and a bathroom, and three bedrooms and a bathroom.
The question that must be answered is: Did we get value for our money? Some
of our backyard dwellers will be much better off financially by moving to
the N2 Gateway than staying in the backyards and the slums.

I want to end my speech now and I want the hon Watson to listen. Employ the
entire nation as if you are employing a single person. Employ them and give
them actual tasks. Motivate them with benefits. Do not harm them. That’s
what the ANC wants. Employ the nation like one person. I thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr S SHICEKA: Deputy Chairperson, today we will hear the truth about the
issue of the N2 Gateway Project. One can start by saying that housing is a
second-generation right as enshrined in our Constitution. The ANC-led
government believes in the rule of law. Because South Africa is a
constitutional state, the Constitution should be followed to the letter and
the spirit.

Housing in South Africa was based on apartheid spatial planning, which
meant that the poor were located far from the places of opportunities and
economic activities. Whites were closer to the city, the Indians a bit
further away and then the coloureds, with the Africans the furthest away.
This is what you had in this country. That also ensured that our people
spent a lot of money travelling from their places of work, coming from
those ghettos that were established.

The ANC-led government was faced with a choice, whether to perpetuate the
status quo or reverse the apartheid planning and build a nonracial,
nonsexist society. The ANC-led government chose the latter, namely that
South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white. Cities and
towns belong to all, including places of economic opportunities. Cape Town
as a city cannot be exclusive. Cape Town cannot be in isolation and cannot
be an enclave either; and definitely Cape Town cannot be a “Boerestad”.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa raised an issue in Chapter
3 that talks about co-operative governance; saying that all spheres of
government are interdependent and also interrelated. We have passed a law
here in this august House, which is called the Intergovernmental Relations
Framework Act of 2005. The provisions of this Act are taking co-operative
governance further by ensuring that there must be co-operation at all
levels of government in this country.

The Minister of Housing, Lindiwe Sisulu, established a structure called M3.
This structure called M3 is a structure of the Minister, the MEC and the
mayor. This structure had been working very well before we had the local
elections. The intention of this structure was to ensure that decision-
making is fast-tracked, and blockages and obstacles removed in order to
ensure that delivery happens with speed.

In terms of facts, since the coming in of Mayor Zille, three meetings have
been convened and she has not attended one of them. During the last one she
sent an apology when the meeting had already started. On the same day, she
leaked the information to the media about the letter that she had written
to the Minister. This means she is undermining and violating the
Constitution of this country and the laws of this country on co-operative
governance, as stated in Chapter 3.

If she had an issue to raise, in terms of the laws of this country she was
supposed to raise them at appropriate platforms, such as the
intergovernmental structures. She should not use cheap publicity to outline
her views. We are saying to Mayor Zille: Go back to the M3 structure
because that is where you can raise your issues. You can’t raise your
issues and be heard if you use the media as a form of communication.

Ms Robinson says that the city will build more houses than national and
provincial government combined. [Interjections.] This is a fact: The city
cannot build more houses, as you stated. It has no constitutional or
legislative powers to do so. The building of houses is a national and
provincial function and therefore it means you will actually be acting
outside the law and the Constitution of this land. We are a constitutional
state.

The metros in Gauteng contribute to the top-up of housing to improve
quality. On average, they contribute R4 000 per home. The Durban metro
contributes R10 000 as a top-up per home so as to improve quality. Lets
hear about the City of Cape Town. What is your contribution?
[Interjections.] During Mayor Zille’s reign, nothing has been budgeted for
in terms of housing. During the reign of mayor Nomaindia Mfeketo, when the
ANC ruled, they budgeted for housing. When Mayor Zille came into power, she
took the last R50 million that was in the budget and shifted it somewhere
else. These are the facts. How can she build more houses than the national
and provincial governments combined?

I want to debunk another lie and myth. They say that there was no money,
and that there was an overrun. A total of R900 million was budgeted for the
N2 Gateway project. As we speak today, over R400 million has been spent.
Can you say then that there was no money whilst in the budget there is the
sum of R900 million and only R400 million has been spent? Can you talk
about an overrun? That is not true. You are misleading the public and even
yourselves; and you believe your own lies when you raise these issues.
[Applause.]

All of us know that this project was an experiment that was saying, “Let us
look at how can we ensure that the three spheres of government can work
together at the highest level to ensure that they can take decisions faster
at a policy level, and at the same time ensure that the officials can
implement.” These were the objectives of the project.

I want to read that to you, Mrs Robinson, because it seems that you don’t
know the truth ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon member, please
address Mrs Robinson through the Chair.

Mr S SHICEKA: Thank you. Let me quote:

  To facilitate inter- and intrasettlement integration; to enable urban
  restructuring and renewal; to design and deliver products that offer
  tenure diversification - rental, rent to own, mortgage homes and BNG
  homes etc; to improve settlement design; to implement mechanisms that
  will assist with the eradication of poverty; to facilitate the greater
  responsiveness to livelihood strategies; and to ensure active
  participation of all spheres of government to achieve a common goal.

Those were the objectives. I must tell you that as things unfold, these
objectives are on track, save to say that the city is a stumbling block.
The city is not assisting in this project. What is more important is that
the ANC supports the dispute that has been declared by the Minmec against
Mayor Zille.

We are following the prescripts of our Constitution and of our
Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act. That is what we are doing. We
are saying to Mayor Zille: Deliver to your people and that is what you must
focus on. As the Chairperson of the Select Committee on Local Government, I
am saying that I am watching the city with hawk-eyes. What I want to do is
to get all reports around the forensic audit, which is my constitutional
right as chairperson.

I am saying that if you continue to conduct a forensic audit on the N2
Gateway, that might be a fruitless expenditure. The Auditor-General, who is
the highest authority in this country in terms of auditing the finances of
government, is doing that on the purview of the Minister and through the
initiative of the Minister. If you do any other thing, we will hold you
accountable for that because there is a lot of laws that govern this
country in that respect.

I want to conclude by requesting Mayor Zille to follow the Constitution,
and not only the Constitution but also the laws of this country. The DA
believes that it is an organisation that believes in a constitutional
state. If you do so, you must act accordingly. You must not say that you
are somebody and then you don’t act accordingly. Whatever you preach, you
must practice. That is what we are requesting from you from this platform.

The N2 Gateway project is going to go ahead - with or without you. Our
people are going to get quality service delivery. They will be better off
than staying in the shacks and in those informal settlements that you see.
They will be there in those flats and walk-ups. That is what we want to see
with our people. Their dignity must be restored and therefore that’s what
we will preach as a movement, the people’s movement and the glorious
movement. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Chairperson, in defence of Minmec, M3 and the
provincial government, I want to respond to a few issues. Before I do that,
let me assure this House, in marching forward, that the Western Cape
provincial government is not going to be deterred by all the noise that is
being made by people who don’t want us to march forward and take care of
the poor and deliver the services we are supposed to be delivering.

We are already rolling out, beyond the N2, lots of pilot projects to
demonstrate the human settlement programme the Minister has initiated. I
also want to assure this House that, as an MEC for local government and
housing, the City of Cape Town is under my jurisdiction. [Interjections.]
[Applause.] I am happy, member Shiceka; I did not want to warn them.

Mr A WATSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon member is misleading
this House. The local government of Cape Town is not under his
jurisdiction. The same Constitution says there are three spheres of
government. He must withdraw. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Watson, that is
not a point of order. Thank you. You may continue, hon member.

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Thank you, Chair. Whatever the member says, as
an MEC I play an oversight role over all municipalities. [Interjections.]

I am therefore saying I am glad that member Shiceka raised the point. I did
not want to warn them about issues of fruitless expenditure and all of
that. All of those are monitored on a daily basis.

I quickly want to respond to some of the issues, because sometimes when
issues are ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon member, are you
raising a point of order?

Mr E M SOGONI: Yes, Deputy Chairperson. On a point of order, hon Watson
said the MEC is misleading this House. The term “misleading” is not
parliamentary.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Thank you, hon
Sogoni. I have already informed the hon Watson that he is out of order.
Thank you. You may continue.

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): Thank you, Chair. I want to thank all members
who contributed to this debate. I sat here as a representative of the
provincial government and listened to you regarding all the issues you
raised.

However, I want to raise a few issues in relation to what the hon member
Robinson raised in this House. Firstly, she spoke about the issue of
mismanagement. Quite clearly, as Minmec, we did take the position that we
had nothing to hide, hence the step taken by the Minister in asking the
Auditor-General to investigate any issues. When that is tabled, we are
going to make our own pronouncement on those issues. We have to move away
from making allegations that are not substantiated.

She went further and spoke about announcements and targets not met, and I
want to respond to that. I think the ID member raised the issue about the
pilot project, and there is a lot to learn from that. Just to demonstrate,
without being pressured and without being asked, one of the key lessons
that we have learned from this relates to the issue of the capacity of
municipalities.

The City of Cape Town proved not to have the kind of capacity to drive and
implement housing delivery. That is the reason why the Minister appointed
Thubelisha to drive this project, because, quite clearly, the City of Cape
Town over all these years was only able to deliver, as I said, fewer than
7 000 houses. And here you had a project that wanted to deliver 22 000
houses.

Thubelisha has been appointed and this is part of a key lesson that we have
learned. So, if you talk about issues that concern targets and the slow
pace, I think you have to go back to see how you can help this city. These
are not issues that come from the Minister or ourselves. We are putting
things in place to improve that capacity. So I don’t think this can be an
issue that you can raise here and score some points on.

I think you have also made the point that work began before contracts were
signed. So what? [Laughter.] Clearly, I stood here and made the point that
this is a pilot project. This is a pilot project in which we are testing a
number of issues. We are testing the pace of what we want to do and deliver
with speed. [Interjections.] We are testing many other things, so if it
happened that we laid the first brick before a contract was signed, I again
ask: so what, because today you have those houses standing there?

Everything else we did, we are very convinced we did within legal means. It
is a pilot project. Every inspection was done. Everything was done. It is a
pilot project and that we can attest to. We are saying that we are going to
have people occupying those homes without any problems. [Interjections.]
That’s important, therefore, that when you come ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): Hon Krumbock! Hon
Krumbock, will you please not converse with the member speaking. Thank you.

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): We were very clear from the very beginning
that we were not going to follow the normal bureaucratic channels that were
blocking housing delivery. Therefore you have to understand those issues in
that particular context.

Member Robinson raised the issue of priorities being shifted, that those
monies were taken away and then channelled into the N2. I want to put facts
here categorically and make them very clear. The very first thing that
Mayor Zille did - and please write this down - when she came in was to take
money amounting to R31 million away from housing projects in terms of
hostel development in Nyanga and other areas. She shifted that to fire
services. Please write that down. [Interjections.]

The reason she did that was because, in her campaign – in the DA’s campaign
- fire services was their top priority. Therefore they had to take this
money away from needy people and give it to fire services. [Interjections.]
The DA must look at itself. Don’t come here and score points when you don’t
have the facts.

Let me move further on. I think I do want to repeat this point, which I
also made last night on Special Assignment. I take serious exception to
anybody who would stand on any platform and say that the kind of efforts
that this government is making are about vote-catching. Our work is about
delivering to needy people and poor people. [Interjections.] They have
nothing to do with the elections or vote-catching. I can understand that
this can only be said by people who don’t care about the needy and the
poor. [Interjections.]

Ms D ROBINSON: I beg to differ; I sincerely beg to differ!

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): The next point she raised, I think, relates to
the issue of the availability of funds. Again, let me make the point
categorically clear: The N2 project, and perhaps other mega projects, are
not fund-driven. You don’t have a big pool of funds and then decide what
you want to do. They are needs-driven. There are needs that we are
responding to, and, in the process of that, getting funds becomes a worked-
on process. We have to get that kind of thinking so that other members
begin to understand that.

I think member Shiceka made the point that if there are any challenges with
the N2 Gateway, it is not because we ran out of funds. This relates to
issues of capacity, construction complexities and all of those issues. When
members stand here, they must speak the truth.

In defence of Minister Sisulu who is not here today, I want to respond to
member Robinson who also raised the point about a rescheduled meeting that
she could not attend. I want to stand here and say that there is no truth
in that statement. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: We are not surprised.

Ms D ROBINSON: It is the truth, it is the truth!

Mr R DYANTYI (Western Cape): We met on 1 June and the City of Cape Town,
quite clearly, could not finish a budget meeting that it held on 31 May. It
ran over and did not even send a representative to that meeting. They could
not send a single person, because they needed those votes. That is the
issue here on the table, not somebody not being informed. [Interjections.]

The other issue I want to raise in relation to them is that they claimed
here that they are going to build houses. The reason why they claimed that
they are going to build houses is because of that constitutional
obligation.

The Mayor of Cape Town has gone around and has met with about three banks,
promising that they are going to use those banks to build what we call GAP
housing. They are not saying that they met with the banks as a result of
the work that was done by Minister Sisulu. Minister Sisulu has met with all
the banks, and the banks have committed themselves to providing R42
billion. What they did was to piggyback on the work done by Minister
Sisulu. [Interjections.] It was not their own initiative, and we have to
table those kinds of facts.

Quite clearly, in terms of their policies, we are monitoring that trend,
because they are going to be focusing - you must watch this space – on
skinning the poor. They are not going to be providing any services to the
unemployed poor. They are going to be using the banks to build for those
that can buy the houses. And we are going to stop that process, because it
is not helping to build a home for all in this province.

I want to stand here and make the point quite categorically as well that
when it comes to the N2 Gateway project that we have in the Western Cape,
there has never been anything to compare it to in this province. You can go
anywhere else: The quality and the type of flats that we have, have never
been built before in this province in the way that they have been in terms
of the N2 Gateway project. It is new to them – no wonder they are up in
arms. This is something they could not do in 40 years, and we are doing it
in less than a year. We have to understand this in that context.
[Applause.] Please watch this space.

I want to continue to assure this House by saying that we are not going to
break down intergovernmental relations simply because ... sinoSodolophu
ofuna ukudlala upuca sisebenza [... we have a mayor who wants to play games
while we work].

We have built intergovernmental relations in this country and we have to
utilise that platform. I support member Shiceka when he says that when they
are done with playing marbles, the door will be open for them to come back.
But we are not going to wait for the City of Cape Town to play these kinds
of games. We have a programme and a vision here to build a home for all in
this province, and we will do whatever it takes to get to that point.

The N2 Gateway project, for the information of this House, is part of our
Asgisa contribution in this province and, therefore, it is not going to go
away; nobody’s going to stop it. You will also be witnessing us handing
over houses to new beneficiaries and we are not going to stop there. We
will continue “kuze kuyovalwa” [up to the end]. Enkosi. [Thank you.]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Ms P M Hollander): I thank the hon MEC
for local government and housing in the Western Cape. Thank you, hon
Dyantyi. Order! I have been informed by the Whippery that there will be one
speakers’ list for the First and Second Orders of the Day.

       SMALL BUSINESS TAX AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL
    SECOND SMALL BUSINESS TAX AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

Mnr D J BOTHA: Agb mev die Voorsitter ... [Hon Madam Chairperson ...]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): You may take the podium in front
here, please. [Interjections.]

Mr D J BOTHA: I don’t use the podium. [Laughter.]

Agb Voorsitter, ek staan hier om die wet voor hierdie Huis te lê, en ek wil
dit kategories stel dat hierdie wet nie daar is om punte te “score” nie,
maar vir alle burgers van Suid-Afrika volgens die beleid van die ANC.

Belasting het die afgelope jare wesenlik verander. Die openbare profiel
daarvan het meer sigbaar geword. Morele, etiese en sosiale dimensies is
daaraan gegee wat nooit tevore sigbaar was nie.

Deur die Wetsontwerp op Kleinbesigheids belastingamnestie en Wysiging van
Belastingwette voor die Parlement te lê, het die Nasionale Tesourie die
nodige inisiatief geneem. Die oorblywende taak berus by die
belastinggemeenskap.

In die poging om die belastingbasis te verbreed het “Sars” onlangs
uitstappies in die informele besigheidsgebied onderneem. Baie
kleinsakeondernemings wat so ontdek was dat hulle glad nie op die
belastingregister is nie en wat tans nie hul bedrywighede ten volle aan
Said geopenbaar het nie, het te kenne gegee dat hulle die geleentheid tot
normalisasie en regulering sonder vrees vir hul belastingaanspreeklikhede
voortspruitend uit nakoming van die verlede sou verwelkom. Hierby word ook
ingesluit taxi-operateurs wat graag wil deelneem aan die taxi-
herkapitalisasie program. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, I am standing here to present this law to this House, and
I want to state categorically that this law is not there for scoring
points, but for all citizens of South Africa according to the policy of the
ANC.

Taxation has changed drastically over the past few years. Its public
profile has become more visible. It was given moral, ethical and social
dimensions that were not previously visible.

By bringing the Small Business Tax Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation Laws
Bill before this Parliament, the National Treasury has taken the necessary
initiative. The remaining task rests with the tax community.

In an effort to broaden the tax base, Sars recently undertook excursions to
the informal business area. Many small enterprises which were discovered in
this way as not being on the tax register at all and are not at present
disclosing their activities to Sars in full, have indicated that they would
welcome the opportunity for normalisation and regulation without fear of
their tax culpability as a result of compliance, like in the past. Included
in this are taxi operators who would like to participate in the taxi
recapitalisation programme.]

The Minister of Finance, therefore, announced during the 2006 Budget Speech
that government would introduce a tax amnesty for small businesses.

The purpose and objective of this tax is therefore to broaden the tax base,
facilitate the normalisation of the tax affairs of small businesses,
increase and improve the tax compliance culture, and facilitate
participation in the Taxi Recapitalisation Programme.

The business community has been looking for a comprehensive tax amnesty
package for years, and the National Treasury has not only delivered a
package, but has gone much further. The amnesty does not include income tax
only, but a full range of small business taxes, such as secondary tax on
companies and a skills development levy.

Our appeal to the business community is that they should go to Sars between
1 August 2006 and 31 May 2007, join the queue of amnesty applicants and use
the generous opportunity provided by government. The amnesty from
prosecution offered to South Africans with funds illegally held offshore
and, more recently, to small businesses, is a reflection and application of
the ANC-led government’s critical strategy in terms of conflict resolution.

The Select Committee on Finance recommends that this House approves the
Small Business Tax Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation Laws Bill of 2006 and
the Second Small Business Tax Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation Laws Bill.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant). Thank you, hon member. That
concludes the debate. I shall now put the question in respect of the First
Order. The question is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule
63 I shall first allow political parties the opportunity to make their
declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to the voting on
the question. Those in favour say “Aye.”

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Those against say “No.” All
parties voted in favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms of
section 75 of the Constitution. [Applause.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.
The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): I shall now put the question in
respect of the Second Order. The question is that the Bill be agreed to. In

opportunity to make their declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall now
proceed to the voting on the question. Those in favour say “Aye.”

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Those against say “No.” All
members voted in favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms of
section 75 of the Constitution.

                       DEEDS REGISTRIES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Chairperson, hon members, the Bill before this House is
a further example of how deep the system of oppression was entrenched in
our society before 1994.

Under the Black Administration Act of 1927, certain citizens acquired
registered or registrable land rights and continued to transact with these
rights in terms of this Act up to this day. During 2004, 35 539 such
transactions were effected by the Registrar of Deeds throughout the
country. An example of such a right is the right arising out of the deed of
grant issued under chapter 2 of the Black Areas Townships Regulations,
Proclamation R 293 of 1962.

The remaining enabling statutory provisions under which these rights were
obtained, namely the Black Administration Act of 1927, as members would
recall, will be repealed by no later than 31 July this year, upon the
coming into effect of the Repeal of the Black Administration Act and
Amendment of Certain Laws Act, Act 28 of 2005, which was adopted by this
House in November 2005.

Therefore the Deeds Registries Amendment Bill is a direct consequence of
the effect of the Repeal of the Black Administration Act and Amendment of
Certain Laws Act, Act 28 of 2005, and seeks to confer powers on the
Registrar of Deeds to continue recognising and effecting the registration
of these rights, and also to transfer these rights originally acquired in
terms of the Black Administration Act of 1927.

These amendments are further examples of a caring government that seeks to
facilitate a smooth transition from an unjust past to a just future.
Therefore, the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs has
agreed to the proposed amendments, as provided for by the Deeds Registries
Amendment Bill and recommends that this House approves this Bill. I thank
you.

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): I shall now put the question. The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63 I shall
first allow political parties the opportunity to make their declaration of
vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to the voting on the question.
Those in favour say “Aye.”

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): All  members  voted  in  favour.  I
therefore declare the Bill agreed to.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                       SECTIONAL TITLES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mnr C J VAN ROOYEN: Ek werk hard vandag. [I am working hard today.]

Members will recall that the Sectional Titles Act, Act 95 of 1986, is a
piece of legislation governing apartments, flats, townhouses, office
blocks, shopping centres and other developments where multiple owners hold
property ownership known as a sectional title on common property.

A sectional title is made up of individual ownership of a defined section,
such as an apartment or a flat held under a sectional mortgage bond,
exclusive use areas, and shared ownership with other owners of areas such
as parking and recreational areas, lobbies, etc.

Currently the definition of a sectional mortgage bond does not provide for
the registration of a sectional mortgage bond over exclusive use areas,
which are part of the common property and for the exclusive use of the
owners of the relevant section of the scheme.

The proposed amendments provide for amending the definition of a sectional
mortgage bond and for mortgage bonds to be also allowed to be registered
over exclusive-use areas, and to eliminate the perception of a short-term
lease for those areas, as under the current definition; secondly, to
empower the body corporate to extend the common property of the body
corporate, other than only through the purchase of land, but also through
any other manner, for example by donations.

The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs agreed to the
proposed amendments and, therefore, requests this House to support the
amendments as proposed in the Sectional Titles Amendment Bill.

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): I shall now put the question. The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63 I shall
first allow political parties the opportunity to make their declaration of
vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to the voting on the question.
Those in favour say “Aye.”

Hon MEMBERS: Aye.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Those against say “No.” All
members voted in favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms of
section 75 of the Constitution.

 REPEAL OF BLACK ADMINISTRATION ACT AND AMENDMENT OF CERTAIN LAWS AMENDMENT
                                    BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, we are dealing with the Repeal of Black
Administration Act and Amendment of Certain Laws Amendment Bill. The
committee invited the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development,
on 9 November 2005, to come and tell the committee as to what laws in the
Statute Book still had to be repealed.

During the meeting it was realised that this affected not only the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, but also other
departments, for example, the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs
and the Department for Provincial and Local Government. Now, during that
interaction with the department we discovered, when you look into the
question of traditional courts, for example, that they are still using the
old Acts that are contained in the Black Administration Act.

What we wanted was for them to repeal all those laws that are offensive,
derogatory and are not in keeping with our Constitution. As a committee, we
agreed that that must be done expeditiously.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development promised the
committee that they were going to repeal all the laws that you can think
of, on or before 31 July 2006, that are derogatory and offensive - you know
them. Those are laws in which we were called names; were told where to stay
or not to stay; in which it was outlined who you were supposed to marry;
and in which it was stated at what time you had to go to bed with your
partner.

Now, when the department continued to check all the laws, it was discovered
that unfortunately some laws are such that if you repeal them they are
going to leave a vacuum, and that would be suicidal and cause chaos.

When the three departments did their own investigations they discovered
that it might not be possible for them to repeal all those laws on 31 July
this year. They need some time because, for example, when you look at the
traditional courts, some powers were conferred on traditional leaders to
try cases. In some provinces some powers were conferred on the traditional
courts, not the traditional leader, to hear cases. It differs from area to
area.

Please remember that this Black Administration Act was only aimed at
governing black people.

In order to enable all the departments to rectify or repeal al those laws
or to come up with proper legislation to deal with what I am saying, they
requested some time so that they could do a thorough job and come back to
Parliament. When they reported this to us we said, “It’s fine. When can you
do this?”

They said they could only do it if we gave them another period of grace of
about six months or so. But because we are such a dynamic committee, we
said, “It is fine, we are flexible. We allow you that, but please come back
to us.” Instead of August, as they had requested, we told them to come back
to us on 30 September 2007. For that to happen, you need legislation. That
legislation I am talking about is the Bill before this House now.

Regarding what we are proposing here, the previous Bill mentioned 31 July
2006, but because of the request the department made, we are now changing
this timeframe to say we are giving the department until 30 September 2007
to come back to Parliament. That is all the Bill is about.

Let me humbly submit to this House that we should enable the departments to
go and do all these things that they promised us as Parliament – that is,
to stagger the dates from 31 July this year to 30 September 2007.

On behalf of the committee, I request the House to agree to and pass this
Bill as it is, without any amendments. I rest my case, Chair. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): I shall now put the question. The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63 I shall
first allow political parties the opportunity to make their declaration of
vote if they so wish.

We shall now proceed to voting on the question. Those in favour say “Aye.”

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): Those against say “No.” All
members voted in favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in

                       OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign
Affairs was briefed by the Department of Minerals and Energy and considered
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.

The objective of the joint convention is to make sure that management and
maintenance is achieved worldwide. It seeks to ensure that management of
radioactive waste is effective and that there is defence against potential
hazards. It encourages the prevention of accidents and the mitigation of
their consequences, should they occur. It also reinforces the
implementation of the basic safety criteria and standards currently used in
the regulation of nuclear activities in South Africa, thus ensuring the
continued protection of all South Africans as required by the Constitution.

The legal obligations of the convention are provided for in the Nuclear Act
and through the National Nuclear Regulator, under the supervision of the
Departments of Minerals and Energy, and Health. The two departments will be
responsible for the implementation of all provisions of the incentive
convention. If the House agrees to the accession, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs will sign and South Africa will be party to the convention.

On behalf of the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs, I move
that the House adopts the report. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Ms M N Oliphant): That concludes the debate. I shall
now put the question. The question is that the report be agreed to. As the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I shall
first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present in the Chamber
to cast their provinces’ votes. Are all delegation heads present?

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces an opportunity to
make their declarations of vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to
the voting on the question. I shall do this in alphabetical order per
province. Delegation heads must please indicate to the Chair whether they

  on Hearings on the Implications and Approval of the  Proposed  New  Salary
  Scales for the Magistracy, in particular the introduction of a  New  Motor

  by the Independent  Commission  for  the  Remuneration  of  Public  Office
  Bearers, dated 19 June 2006:


   The  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development
   (Portfolio  Committee)  and  the  Select  Committee  on   Security   and
   Constitutional Affairs (Select Committee) having jointly  held  hearings
   to consider the implications of the proposed new salary scales  for  the
   magistracy, in particular  the  introduction  of  a  new  motor  vehicle
   allowance for magistrates and  senior  magistrates,  as  recommended  in
   Notice 46 of 2005 in the Government  Gazette  of  24  August  2005,  and
   tabled in the House on 7 September 2005, report as follows:


A.    INTRODUCTION


   1. On 18 October 2005, the Portfolio Committee together with the  Select
   Committee convened hearings with representatives from the Department  of
   Justice  and  Constitutional  Development   (DOJ),   National   Treasury
   (Treasury) and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to  discuss  and
   consider  the  implications  of  the  proposed  new  salary  scales  for
   magistrates, as  recommended  by  the  Independent  Commission  for  the
   Remuneration of Office Bearers (The  Commission).   The  Commission  was
   asked to submit a written account of the factors, issues and conclusions
   arrived at, that gave rise to the salary proposals, in  particular,  the
   proposed  new  motor  vehicle  allowances  for  magistrates  and  senior
   magistrates.  The submissions of the institutions that  appeared  before
   the Committees, as well as the written submission of the Commission, are
   available for perusal in the office  of  the  Committee  Secretary.  All
   documents sourced by the  Committees  are  similarly  available  (marked
   Annexures 05 Mag Rem 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,12,13,14, 15, 16).

   2. The aim of the hearings was threefold.  Firstly, to inquire into  the
   details of the proposed implementation plan  and  its  consequences  for
   government, in particular the availability of a budgetary allocation  of
   approximately  R157  million  to  defray  the  cost  of  such   proposed
   allowance.  Secondly, to determine the effects and implications  of  the
   proposed new salary scales for magistrates  and  senior  magistrates  in
   relation to the  broader  issue  of  disparate  salaries  for  similarly
   qualified lawyers within the criminal justice system in  particular,  as
   well as within the public sector as a whole, including relevant  Chapter
   9 bodies.  Thirdly, to identify problems that currently pertain  in  the
   implementation  of  the  procedure  for   the   determination   of   the
   remuneration of magistrates by the Commission,  in  an  effort  to  make
   recommendations on steps needed to be taken at all levels to ensure that
   the process will in future take place in accordance with the legislation
   governing it.

B.    LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK

   1. Prior to 1995, magistrates formed part of the public service  and  as
   such their salaries were determined through  the  collective  bargaining
   process applicable to members of the public service.   From  1995,  they
   were de-linked from the collective bargaining process and together  with
   judges the Minister for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  (the
   Minister) determined their salary increases after consultation with  the
   Minister of Finance.

   In 2003, the Judicial Officers Amendment Act (Act No 28  of  2003),  was
   enacted as part of an ongoing process of judicial  reform  aimed,  inter
   alia, at strengthening judicial independence  in  our  young  democracy.
   The Act amended the  Independent  Commission  for  the  Remuneration  of
   Public Office-Bearers Act (Act No 92 of 1997) (the Commission  Act),  so
   as to extend the definition of “office-bearer”  to  include  judges  and
   magistrates and to  make  further  consequential  amendments.   The  Act
   further amended the Magistrates Act (Act No 90 of 1993) (the Magistrates
   Act) to provide  for  this  new  system  to  regulate  the  remuneration
   determination for magistrates.  The new system for the regulation of the
   remuneration of magistrates was aimed at ensuring  that  magistrates  do
   not participate in activities associated with the collective  bargaining
   system  and  as  such  gives  effect  to  the  views  expressed  by  the
   Constitutional Court in the Van Rooyen judgment, where the
   Court held as follows:[1]
      “Judicial officers ought not to be put in a position of  having  to  …
      engage in negotiations with the executive over their  salaries.   They
      are judicial officers, not employees, and cannot and should not resort
      to industrial action to advance their interests in their conditions of
      service.  That makes them vulnerable to having less attention paid  to
      their legitimate concerns in relation to such matters, than others who
      can advance their interests through normal bargaining  processes  open
      to them”.

   2. When determining the remuneration of magistrates, the procedures  set
   out in section 12 of the Magistrates Act must be read together with  the
   provisions of the  Commission  Act  that  governs  the  composition  and
   functioning of the Commission.  The procedures that must be followed  in
   determining the remuneration of magistrates can  briefly  be  summarised
   into the following steps:
    •  The  Commission  must  in  order  to  investigate  and  consider  the
      remuneration of magistrates consult with the Minister, the Minister of
      Finance and the Chief Justice or a  person  designated  by  the  Chief
      Justice (section 12(1)(c) of the Magistrates Act).
    • When the Commission is deliberating the matter of the remuneration  of
      judges or magistrates and if the Chairperson of the  Commission  is  a
      Constitutional Court judge or a judge, then he  or  she  must  refrain
      from participating in any of the Commission’s  deliberations  relating
      to such remuneration (section  8(3B)(a)  read  together  with  section
      1(d)(i) and (ii) of the Commission Act).



   3. [Publication of the Recommendations of the Commission]

    • Section 8(6) of the Commission Act stipulates that in arriving at  its
      recommendations the Commission must take the  following  factors  into
      account:
           “(6)(i)       The   role,   status,   duties,   functions    and
           responsibilities of the office-bearers concerned;
       ii) the affordability of different levels of remuneration of  public
           office bearers;
      iii) current principles and levels of remuneration,  particularly  in
           respect of organs of state, and in society generally;
       iv) inflationary increases;
        v) the availability of resources of the State; and
       vi) any other factor which, in the opinion of the  said  Commission,
           is relevant”.
    • The recommendations of the Commission must be published in the Gazette
      at least once a year in respect of each category of office-bearers and
      must be submitted to Parliament before publication  (section  8(5)  of
      the Commission Act).
    • In this  regard,  the  Commission’s  annual  recommendations  must  be
      submitted to Parliament before the publication thereof in the Gazette.
       In other words  Parliament  only  needs  to  be  informed  about  the
      Commission’s recommendations and  does  not  at  this  stage  have  to
      approve or disapprove thereof.  However, it  is  at  this  point  that
      Parliament  has,  through  the  Select  Committee  and  the  Portfolio
      Committee, an opportunity to formulate  a  view  on  the  Commission’s
      recommendations, which in turn must be relayed to the Executive before
      the President constructs the notice referred to in section 12(1)(a).
    • In this regard it should be  noted  that  while  Parliament  may  have
      received the Commission’s recommendations before they  were  published
      in 2005 (and this we, to date, have not been able to  establish),  the
      Commission’s proposals were not referred by the Presiding Officers  to
      the relevant Committees for consideration  and  report.  This  may  be
      simply because the Commission’s recommendations  were  not  officially
      relayed to Parliament.
    • The publication of the Commission’s recommendations in the Gazette  is
      done in addition with the  intention  to  publicise  its  findings  as
      widely as possible for public  information.  The  publication  of  the
      recommendations of  the  Commission  in  the  Gazette  should  not  be
      confused with the publication of the President’s notice in the Gazette
      to determine the salaries, allowances or benefits of magistrates.
    • The Commission then makes recommendations to the President for his  or
      her  consideration  as  to  the  salaries,  allowances  and   benefits
      magistrates are entitled to following the  Commission’s  investigation
      (section 12(1)(a)(i) of the Magistrates Act).


  4.  Publication of section 12(1)(a) notice
    • Section 12(1)(a)(i) and (ii) read together with subsection (3) of  the
      Magistrates Act provide that the President  determines  the  salaries,
      allowances or benefits that magistrates are entitled to from  time  to
      time by notice in the Gazette, after  taking  into  consideration  the
      recommendations of the Commission, and  after  such  notice  has  been
      submitted to Parliament for approval ( i.e. before publication thereof
      in the Gazette).
    • Parliament must by resolution either approve the  notice,  whether  in
      whole or in part, or disapprove the notice  (section  12(3)(b)(i)  and
      (ii) of the Magistrates Act).  The  notice  has  to  be  submitted  to
      Parliament to afford Parliament an opportunity to comment  before  any
      determination may be published in the Gazette.
    • The President may  determine  different  categories  of  salaries  and
      salary scales  in  respect  of  different  categories  of  magistrates
      (section 12(1)(b) of the Magistrates Act).
    • The remuneration payable to magistrates  shall  be  paid  out  of  the
      National  Revenue  Fund  as  contemplated  in  section  213   of   the
      Constitution read with section 12(4) of the Magistrates Act.

C.    Absence of budgetary allocation to defray proposed new  motor  vehicle
      allowances for magistrates and senior magistrates

1.    Any reservations the Committees may have had,  with  the  introduction
      of the proposed new  motor  vehicle  allowances  for  magistrates  and
      senior magistrates, were outweighed by the individual  and  collective
      weight afforded three factors that  are  relevant  in  regard  to  the
      approval of such allowances.  Firstly, the President of  the  Republic
      of South Africa indicated in  Notice  46  of  2005  and  the  attached
      Schedule that he  favoured  the  granting  of  such  an  allowance  to
      magistrates and senior magistrates.  Secondly, the Minister of Finance
       indicated his preparedness to appropriate the  budget  allocation  of
      approximately R157million to defray the  expenditure  related  to  the
      proposed new motor  vehicle  allowances  for  magistrates  and  senior
      magistrates, in terms of section 213(2)(b) of the Constitution of  the
      Republic of South Africa, read with section 12(4) of  the  Magistrates
      Act.  Thirdly, the relevant government departments are in the  process
      of developing a remunerative structure based on parity and synergy  to
      negate the adverse consequences of magistrates’ salaries and  benefits
      being raised to disparate levels, with  the  consequent  destabilising
      effects this has on other  institutions  of  justice,  especially  the
      National Prosecuting Authority.

2.    All factors, especially the above three, having been  considered,  the
      Committees accordingly recommended  that  both  Houses  of  Parliament
      approve the proposed new motor vehicle allowances for magistrates  and
      senior magistrates, as contained in Notice 46 of 2005, as  it  appears
      in the Government Gazette of  24  August  2005,  and  that  the  costs
      thereof be defrayed in terms of section 213(2)(b) of the  Constitution
      of the Republic of South  Africa,  read  with  section  12(4)  of  the
      Magistrates Act .
3.    All other proposals  recommended  in  Notice  46  of  2002  have  been
      properly budgeted for and the adoption thereof presented  no  problem,
      and was accordingly recommended.

4.    On Wednesday,  7  September  2005,  the  National  Assembly  passed  a
      resolution, which read:
           That the House  approves  the  draft  notice  and  the  schedule
           received from the  Presidency  determining  the  rate  at  which
           salaries and allowances are payable to the magistrates annually,
           with effect from 1 April 2005, in terms of section  12(1)(a)  of
           the Magistrates Act (act No 90 of 1993) as amended by section  3
           of the Judicial Officers (Amendment of  Conditions  of  Service)
           Act (Act No 28 of 2003).


      Notice 46 of 2005 appeared in the Government Gazette dated  24  August
      2005 and is attached hereto for ease of reference (Marked Annexure  05
      Mag Rem 5).

5.    The National Council of Provinces however referred the matter  to  the
      Select  Committee  on  Security   and   Constitutional   Affairs   for
      deliberation. Joint hearings were held on 18 October 2005, and interim
      reports were tabled  in  both  houses  on  16 November  2005.  (Marked
      Annexture 05 Mag Rem 17 and 19).  The Houses  required  that  a  final
      report  be  tabled  detailing  the  outcomes  and  recommendations  in
      relation  to  legislative  and  procedural  matters  relating  to  the
      determination of salary levels  for  magistrates;  the  absence  of  a
      budgetary  allocation  to  defray  the  proposed  new  motor   vehicle
      allowances for senior magistrates and magistrates; the development  of
      policy measures  to  deal  with  the  implications  arising  from  the
      extension of  motor  vehicle  allowances  to  senior  magistrates  and
      magistrates; and any other matter relevent to or  emanating  from  the
      said hearings.

D.    CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In making our  recommendations  the  Committees  have  considered  that  the
determination of recommendations  relating  to  magistrates’  (and  judges’)
salaries is a relatively new exercise for  the  Commission.   Like  all  new
institutions and processes, there are opportunities  to  develop  and  learn
collectively   from   short-comings   and   challenges.    Most   developing
democracies have at some time or another  faced  such  and  sometimes  worse
institutional challenges, and it is out of corrective  measures  implemented
within constitutional mechanisms that strong and enduring practices of  good
governance and institutions  have  developed.  Consequently,  after  careful
consideration of all the written and  oral  submissions  placed  before  the
Portfolio  Committee  and  the  Select  Committee,  on  the  recommendations
contained in Notice 46 of 2005, including the implications of  the  proposed
new motor vehicle allowance  for  magistrates  and  senior  magistrates,  as
recommended by the Commission;  and -
(i)   despite  any  procedural  shortcomings  that  may  have  occurred   in
      relation to the Commissions work;
(ii)  the  absence  of  a  budgetary  allocation  of  R157  million  to  the
      Department of Justice and Constitutional Development,  to  defray  the
      new proposed motor  vehicle  allowance  to  entry  level  magistrates,
      magistrates and senior magistrates;  and
(iii) because the relevant Government Departments are considering  proposals
      to create a salary regime which ensures parity and synergy between the
      salary packages of legally qualified  professionals  working  for  the
      State,
the Committees  make  the  recommendations  hereunder  to  ensure  that  the
problems pertaining to the work of the Commission do not recur.


RECOMMENDATIONS


1.    The Independent Commission  for  the  Remuneration  of  Public  Office
Bearers:
      1.1   The Commission must strictly comply with the letter  and  spirit
           of  the  legislation  and  regulations  applicable  to  it  when
           considering recommendations  relating  to  the  remuneration  of
           judges and magistrates.  The  following  legal  prescripts  must
           strictly be complied with in future:

           Commission Act replicated below, must be strictly adhered to and
           complied with by the Commission and its Chairperson:
      “If the Chairperson of the Commission is an office bearer  as  defined
      in para (d)(i) of the definition of “office-bearer” in section 1, that

      defined in paragraph(d) of the said definition
      (b) Any member of the Commission who may directly or indirectly derive
      any  benefit  from  the   acceptance   by   the   President   of   any
      recommendations by the Commission, must refrain from participating  in
      any   of   the   Commissions   deliberations    relating    to    such
      recommendations.”


      1.3   When the Commission considers recommendations  relating  to  the
           remuneration of:
              i) judges, it must have regard to the provisions of the Judges
                 Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act (Act  no.  47
                 of 2001);  and
             ii) magistrates, it must have regard to the provisions  of  the
                 Magistrates Act and  the  Commission’s  Act  in  particular
                 section 8;


        4.  In  formulating  recommendations   on   the   remuneration   of
           magistrates, the Commission must have regard to  the  levels  of
           remuneration of similarly qualified individuals  in  the  public
           and private sectors in accordance with  the  provisions  of  the
           Commission  Act,  particularly   the   prescripts   of   section
           8(6)(iii);


        5. In terms of section  8(5)  of  the  Commission  Act,  read  with
           sections    12(1)(a)(ii) and 12(3) of the Magistrates  Act,  the
           recommendations of the Commission relating to  the  remuneration
           of  magistrates  must  be   submitted   to   Parliament   before
           publication thereof.


      1.6    The Commission must in future make recommendations  bearing  in
           the  mind  the  availability  of  resources  within  the  budget
           framework,  as  provided  for  in  the  Estimate   of   National
           Expenditure; (i.e: see section 8(6)(v) )


      1.7    The Commission should receive a single submission on behalf  of
           the magistracy from the Chief Justice or a person designated  by
           the Chief Justice relating to recommendations in respect of  the
           remuneration  of  magistrates,  in   accordance   with   section
           12(1)(c)(ii), read with section 8(3)of the Magistrates Act,  and
           should not consult with or receive submissions  from  individual
           or  groups  of  magistrates  relating  to  the  remuneration  of
           magistrates,  as  seems    to    have   become   the   practice;
           considering  the  injunction  of   the  Van  Rooyen  case   that
           collective bargaining practices should be  discouraged  at  this
           level;


      1.8   The Commission must meaningfully consult with the  Ministers  of
           Finance  and Justice and Constitutional Development in terms  of
           section 12 (1)(c)(i) of the Magistrates  Act,  when  considering
           recommendations in respect of the  remuneration of  magistrates.
           The process of consultation should be made more formal  and  all
           substantive   interactions    should    be    through    written
           communications ;


      1.9   When consulting the Ministers as referred to  in  paragraph  1.8
           above, the Commission  must  do  so  with  a  view  to  reaching
           consensus on the recommendations relating to  the  determination
           of the remuneration of  magistrates;


      1.10  The Commission’s recommendations to the President should reflect
           all the relevant  views/submissions  received  relating  to  the
           recommendations in respect  of the remuneration of  magistrates,
           especially when any or both of the above Ministers disagree with
           any aspect of the recommendations made by the Commission;


      1.11    The  Commission  must  construct  a  system  for   formulating
           recommendations on  the  remuneration  of  magistrates  that  is
           objectively understood within an overall matrix    or  framework
           of remuneration and benefits applicable to other members of  the
           Judiciary and other similarly  qualified  professionals  in  the
           employ of the State.



      2.    THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE


      It is recommended that the office of the Chief Justice must devise  an
      internal forum within the Judiciary aimed  at  facilitating  a  single
      submission to the Commission relating to the  remuneration  of  judges
      and magistrates, as indicated in paragraph 2  of  the  recommendations
      pertaining to the Commission, above.


      3.    PARLIAMENT


      It is also recommended that any proposal in terms of section  8(5)  of
      the Commission Act and any notice referred to in  Section  12(1)(a)(i)
      of the Magistrates Act, submitted to Parliament, must be  referred  by
      the Presiding Officers to  the  Portfolio  Committee  and  the  Select
      Committee jointly, for  consideration  and  report.   The  report  and
      recommendations of  the  Committees  must  thereafter  be  tabled  for
      adoption   in   the   relevant   Houses.    Thereafter,   Parliament’s
      recommendations or comments  must  immediately  be  forwarded  to  the
      President.  Only after these processes have been  followed,  and  upon
      approval by both Houses of Parliament, should the final  determination
      be published in the Government Gazette.





      4.    GENERAL


      Although  not  relevant  to  this  enquiry,  any  of  the   procedural
      shortcomings that are pertinent to the development of  recommendations
      relating to the remuneration of judges should be immediately  reviewed
      by the relevant institutions.


      5.    Policy Measures: The development or adoption of policy measures
           arising from the expansion of travel allowances to magistrates
           previously excluded




      Magistrates are appointed  generally  at  the  point  that  they  have
      acquired at  least  5  years  post-university  experience.   In  their
      submission to the Committees the NPA pointed  out  that  a  prosecutor
      with at least five years post-university experience  currently  earned
      R139 383 compared to the R313 738 per annum for a similarly  qualified
      magistrate (i.e. a trainee magistrate, without  the  present  proposed
      salary packages having been taken into account).  This  amounts  to  a
      differential of R174 355, in salaries  for  lawyers  who  are  equally
      qualified and experienced. The  newly  approved  allowance  for  entry
      level magistrates will increase the  already  significant  salary  gap
      between entry level magistrates and senior prosecutors with five years
      and more years experience, by approximately  R70  000.00.   This  will
      have the  likely  effect  of  further  significantly  exacerbating  an
      already   existing   atmosphere   of   instability   in   institutions
      administering justice.  In fact,  according  to  the  NPA,  they  lose
      between 30  and  40  such  experienced  prosecutors  annually  to  the
      magistracy.  Considering the further 40 new magistrates posts  created
      in 2005, the prosecuting  authority  stands  to  loose  a  significant
      number of experienced prosecutors during this period.

      The Commission in its written submission reported that “it is  in  the
      process  of  conducting  a  major  review  of  public  office   bearer
      remuneration,   and   intends   making   recommendations    for    the
      implementation of an integrated fair and  transparent  total  cost  to
      employer remuneration structure  for  all  office  bearers”  (page  2,
      paragraph 2). The Department of Justice  reported  that  it  has  just
      completed a framework for an integrated remuneration dispensation  for
      its  legally  qualified  professionals.  This  process  is  aimed   at
      addressing the historical inequities existing in the  current  system,
      and introducing parity and synergy. It was  further  reported  that  a
      similar exercise is currently being undertaken by the DPSA  in  regard
      to personnel performing legal functions throughout the public  sector.
      While these developments are to be welcomed, it is clear that if these
      processes are not integrated or synergized, we will once again face  a
      situation where disparate salary packages have to be  implemented  for
      similarly qualified legal professionals in the public domain.


      The Committees thus recommend that:


      5.1    The  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,
           Treasury and Department of  Public  Service  and  Administration
           (and where necessary, the Commission) should  work  together  to
           design a remuneration framework/  or  matrix  that  will  ensure
           parity and synergy between  the  salary  packages  of  similarly
           qualified legal professionals working for the  State.   In  this
           manner, eradicating or at the very least minimising the  further
           destabilisation of institutions  administering  justice  through
           personnel movements chasing  after  higher  salaries,  sometimes
           even in the same Department.

      5.2   The Department of Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  and
           Treasury having been engaged in  a  process  that  is  aimed  at
           developing  a  comprehensive  remunerative  structure  based  on
           parity for legal professionals in the Justice sector, must table
           their proposals and implementation plan, with Parliament,  by  1
           September 2006.

      5.3   The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development must,
           urgently, table in Parliament amendments to the regulations for
           the official travel of all magistrates operating within
           clusters, in order to prevent potential abuse of claims relating
           to S&T’s, accommodation and travel allowances of the nature that
           was disclosed to the Committees during the hearings.  In
           particular, to examine the legality and amend the regulations,
           if necessary, of the further payments of allowances or benefits
           to magistrates, for travel purposes, after 1 April 2005, outside
           the motor vehicle allowances, which are now being approved for
           all magistrates, backdated to 1 April 2005.   Such regulations
           must be tabled in Parliament, by 1 September  2006.


      5.4   Review present legislation
           It is  recommended  that  the  relevant  pieces  of  legislation
           considered in this report should be reviewed in accordance  with
           the findings  and  recommendations  of  this  report,  with  the
           objective of simplifying  and  clarifying  the  procedure.   The
           review should include a mechanism allowing the proposals of  the
           President to be revised and  resubmitted  to  Parliament  should
           Parliament  disapprove  the  notice   in   terms   of    section
           12(3)(b)(ii) of the Magistrates Act.

  6.  Engendering professionalism in the Magistracy

      During the time  that  it  has  taken  to  convene  the  parliamentary
      hearings the Committees have been disturbed at the behaviour  of  some
      magistrates who have in written and oral form criticised  Parliament’s
      processes and even questioned the  constitutionality  of  Parliament’s
      role.  Generally, Parliament should not be above  reproach,  but  when
      these criticisms are voiced by magistrates in  an  effort  to  enhance
      their personal circumstances by  advocating  for  higher  salaries  in
      stark contrast to the prescripts laid down by the Constitutional Court
      in the Van Rooyen judgment, these reproaches have the distinct flavour
      of unabashed avarice.

      Taken to its extreme the media covered stories of certain  magistrates
      absenting themselves from  their  courts  during  this  time,  on  the
      pretext of being under stress due to the possibility of the new  motor
      vehicle allowances not being approved.  This, if true  was  a  lightly
      veiled  attempt  to  pressurise  MPs  to  approve   the   new   salary
      dispensation.   The  Committees  were  also  made  aware  of  meetings
      convened in court buildings ostensibly to organise in protest  against
      any potential negative outcome of the Parliamentary process.

      In matters concerning the Judiciary, the Committees remain  guided  by
      the principles and guidelines determined by the Constitutional  Court,
      especially in the Van Rooyen case.

      The actions of some magistrates, in contravention of the principles in
      the Van Rooyen judgment, are unbecoming of judicial officers and  have
      brought the Judiciary into disrepute.
      The Committees accordingly recommend that the Magistrates’ Commission:


1. Conducts a full investigation into:


      (i)    absenteeism  from  work   without   valid   reason;   including
           absenteeism due to alleged stress (particularly in the  area  of
           the Eastern Cape) or any “go slow” or related action on the part
           of any affected magistrate or senior magistrate; and


      (ii)  any other type of conduct or action by any magistrate or  senior
           magistrate,  which  ostensibly  relates  to  the   approval   by
           Parliament of the  new  salary  regime  amounting  to  behaviour
           unbecoming of a judicial officer,


      between the period 13 September 2005 and 17 November 2005.

   2. Submits a Report by 01 December 2006  on  the  individual  magistrates
      concerned, identifying the disciplinary measures adopted  or  proposed
      to  be  adopted  in  each   instance,   including   relevant   medical
      certificates for each magistrate absent from work for stress or stress-
      related illnesses during the period 13 September to 17 November 2005.

Conclusion

The Committees express the  hope  that  the  report  provides  guidance  and
assistance to all the  role-players  concerned  in  our  mutual  efforts  to
develop and build our State Institutions.  It is hoped  that  all  criticism
levelled  are  received  in  this  spirit  and  that  our  democratic  state
continues to flourish in the wake  of  the  constructive  deliberations  and
engagement.

    (a)     Report of the South African delegation to the 114th Inter-
        Parliamentary Union (IPU) Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya 7-14 May 2006.


COMMITTEE REPORTS



National Assembly and National Council of Provinces



   1. Report of the Constitutional Review Committee on Public Submission,
      dated 9 June 2006:


      During the  2005  Constitutional  review  period,  the  Constitutional
      Review Committee received a submission concerning the  convergence  of
      the  electronic  media  and  its  relevance  to  section  192  of  the
      Constitution.

      Section 192 of the Constitution states that legislation must establish
      an independent  authority  to  regulate  broadcasting  in  the  public
      interest and to ensure fairness  and  a  diversity  of  views  broadly
      representing South African society.  In pursuance of this instruction,
      the Independent Broadcasting Authority was established.


      Due to technological  developments,  the  differentiation  within  the
      electronic media has not only become  blurred,  but  has  in  practice
      disappeared.  This fact has  been  recognized  and  consequently,  the
      Electronic Communication Act (36 of 2005) and the ICASA Bill (B32F  of
      2005) were introduced and approved by Parliament.


      In its report to Parliament, the Committee acknowledged that the issue
      of  electronic  convergence  and  the  implication  thereof   on   the
      Constitution, was deserving  and  needed  further  investigation  (ATC
      Report, 1 November 2005, pg 2418).


      Having received submissions from both academics and the Department  of
      Communication, the Committee recommends that:


      (a)   Section 192 of the Constitution (Act 108 of 1996) be amended.


      (b)   Possible consequential amendments be  made  to  Section  181(1),
         Section 193(1), Section 193(4), Sections 194(1) and 194(2)(b)


      (c)   The Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  be
         requested to introduce the relevant Constitutional amendments.

Report to be considered.

6.  Report of the Select Committee on Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs
 on  the  Provisional  Suspension  from  Office  and  the  withholding   of
 remuneration: Mr M S Makamu, Senior  Magistrate  and  Head  of  Office  at
 Benoni, dated 21 June 2006:

    The Select Committee on Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,  having
    considered the reports on the provisional  suspension  from  office  of
    Senior Magistrate M S Makamu, and the withholding of his  remuneration,
    tabled by the Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development  in
    terms of sections 13(3)(b) and 13(4A)(b) of the Magistrates  Act,  1993
    (Act 90 of 1993), reports as follows:

    1)      The Select Committee noted from the reports that  the  Minister
        provisionally suspended Mr Makamu from office on 23  November  2005
        in terms of section 13(3)(a) of the Magistrates Act, 1993 and that,
        on 31 March 2006, the Magistrates Commission, in terms  of  section
        13(4A)(a) of the Act, determined to withhold his remuneration.  The
        reports  indicating  the  reasons  for  Mr   Makamu’s   provisional
        suspension and the withholding of his remuneration were  tabled  in
        Parliament on 24 November 2005 and 7 April 2006,  respectively,  in
        compliance with sections 13(3)(b) and 13(4A)(b) of the  Magistrates
        Act, 1993.

    2)      The Select Committee invited Mr Makamu  on  10  April  2006  to
        submit written  representations  to  the  Committee  regarding  the
        recommendation  by  the  Magistrates  Commission  to  provisionally
        suspend him from office  and  its  determination  to  withhold  his
        remuneration.  The Committee did not receive any response  from  Mr
        Makamu by the due date, 26 April 2006.


    3)      The Select Committee noted that Mr Makamu had been convicted by
        the Johannesburg Regional Court on a charge of  fraud  on  21  June
        2005 and that he was sentenced to a fine of R10 000  (ten  thousand
        rand) or in default of payment to 6 (six) months imprisonment,  all
        of which were suspended for a period of 4 (four) years  on  certain
        conditions. He was charged for inducing an  Administration  Officer
        at the Benoni Magistrate’s Court to sign an official letter stating
        that he was entitled to an official motor vehicle  allowance  which
        letter was presented to Bankfin for the purpose of  an  installment
        sale agreement.


    4)      The Select Committee noted that it  has  taken  a  considerable
        period of time to finalise the criminal case against Mr Makamu  and
        to finalise his application for leave to appeal (which also has had
        a delaying effect in respect of the inquiry  into  his  fitness  to
        hold office as a Magistrate) and that the  Magistrates’  Commission
        attributes this to an effort on the part of Mr. Makamu to delay the
        process.


    5)      In terms of section  13(3)(c)  of  the  Magistrates  Act,  1993
        Parliament must as soon as is reasonably possible pass a resolution
        as to whether or not the provisional suspension of a magistrate  is
        confirmed. Parliament must also, in terms of section  13(4A)(c)  of
        the Act, as soon as is reasonably possible, consider a  report  and
        pass a resolution as to whether or not  the  determination  by  the
        Magistrates Commission to withhold a Magistrate’s  remuneration  is
        confirmed, either with or without amendment, or set aside.


    6)      The Select Committee considers the  matter  to  be  of  such  a
        serious nature so as to make it  inappropriate  for  Mr  Makamu  to
        perform his functions as a magistrate, whilst the inquiry  referred
        to in section 13(3)(e) of the Magistrates  Act,  1993  is  pending.
        Furthermore, the Committee is of  the  view  that  the  Magistrates
        Commission’s determination to withhold Mr Makamu’s remuneration  is
        appropriate in the circumstances
    7)      The Committee therefore recommends that the Council resolves to
        confirm -


        (a)      the provisional  suspension  of  Mr  Makamu  in  terms  of
             section 13(3)(c) of the Magistrates Act, 1993; and
        (b)       the  determination  by  the  Magistrates  Commission   to
             withhold Mr Makamu’s remuneration in terms of section 13(4A)(c)
             of the Magistrates Act, 1993.

 Report to be considered.
