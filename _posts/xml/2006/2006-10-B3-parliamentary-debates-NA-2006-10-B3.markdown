                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

                                    ____

silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS – see col 000.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, Mr President, we are honoured to have amongst us
today His Excellency, President Mahmoud Abbas, of the State of Palestine,
whom we have invited to address this sitting of the National Assembly, on
the occasion of his visit to South Africa.

I take this opportunity to welcome you to Parliament, Mr President.

I now call on the hon Imaam Gassan Solomon to introduce His Excellency, the
President of the State of Palestine. [Applause.]

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, Your Excellency Mr Abbas, President of the
State of Palestine, Mr President, your Excellencies, distinguished guests,
today our government and the people of our country are very honoured indeed
to have President Abbas in the Parliament of South Africa.

The people of South Africa share many common historical experiences with
the people of Palestine. We are mindful that Palestine is no ordinary
country. It is the Holy Land, and the shared sacred space of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam. It is from Palestine that the universal salutations
of ``As-salaamu-alaikum’’ [peace be upon you], and ``Shalom’’ [peace]
originate. The crucial message desperately needed today in the Middle East,
of peace and goodwill towards men and women, emanates from the history of
Palestine.

Your Excellency, Mr President, you visit our country at a time when
critical challenges confront the Middle East region and the people of
Palestine who, for many years, many decades, have been subjected to
conditions of conflict, political instability and insecurity.

The experiences of the people of Palestine are no different to those which
the masses of South African people were subjected to under the apartheid
regime. Therefore, your visit affords us an opportunity to share common
experiences of the masses of the people of South Africa and Palestine.
These common experiences must inform our commitment to peace and unity
across the political, ideological, racial and cultural divide.

Your Excellency, our painful experiences under the apartheid system only
strengthened our commitment to working for reconciliation, unity, peace and
co-existence for all in South Africa. Mr President, we are succeeding
because we firmly believe in the historical principle of our Freedom
Charter that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, both black and
white.

(Translation of Arabic paragraph follows.)

[Your Excellency Mr President, Abu Maazin, Mahmood Abbas, the President of
Palestine,

May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you.

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

On behalf of the people and the government of South Africa, I welcome you
to the National Assembly. I invoke the Protector, the Most Generous, to
make your visit to our country successful and blessed.

Indeed, here in South Africa, we salute the striving and struggle of the
Palestinian people towards their freedom, dignity and independence.

Indeed, we are sure that the courageous Palestinian people will achieve
their hope in the near future, if Allah wills.

We hope good health, happiness for your Excellency, and improvement and
prosperity for the Palestinian people.

Your Excellency Mr President, Abu Maazin, indeed your honourable visit to
our country reminds us of the noble verse:

   Glory to (Allah) Who did take His servant for a Journey by night from the
   Sacred Mosque to the farthest Mosque, whose precincts We did bless, in
   order that We might show him some of Our Signs: for He is the One Who
   heareth and seeth (all things).
Allah the Most Great has spoken the truth.

May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon you.]

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Before I call upon the hon the President, I wish to just
briefly explain that we normally receive people like the President in the
form of a joint sitting. However, in view of the fact that the other House,
the National Council of Provinces, is presently visiting one of the
provinces of South Africa, we were unable to have a joint sitting.

So, presently, hon President, you are going to be addressing the National
Assembly. His Excellency, the President of the State of Palestine will now
address the House. [Applause.]

    ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE STATE OF PALESTINE, HIS EXCELLENCY DR
                                MAHMOUD ABBAS

The PRESIDENT OF PALESTINE (Hon M Abbas):

                           بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

معالي السيدة رئيسة الجمعية الوطنية
السيد الرئيس تابو مبيكى
سيداتي سادتي

      أشكركم على دعوتكم الكريمة للتحدث اليوم أمام  ممثلي  شعب  جنوب  أفريقيا
الصديق، هذا البلد العظيم الذي يمثل نموذجاً لكل شعوب العالم في الكفاح  من  أجل
المساواة بين جميع مواطنيه، البلد الذي قضى على نظام التفرقة  العنصرية،  والذي
يواصل دعمه لقضايا الحرية في كل مكان، البلد الذي تربطه بنا  نحن  أبناء  الشعب
الفلسطيني أقوى وأوثق الروابط والعلاقات، ونتطلع إليه كنموذج نستمد  منه  العزم
رغم كل الصعوبات، لنواصل مسيرتنا حتى يتحقق السلام العادل  في  منطقتنا،  ونحصل
على حقنا في تقرير مصيرنا بحرية، وتقوم دولتنا  الفلسطينية  المستقلة  وعاصمتها
القدس الشرقية.

      أنقل إليكم اليوم، أيها الأصدقاء والصديقات أعضاء البرلمان، تحيات  شعبنا
الفلسطيني، تحيات أعضاء مجلسنا الوطني، ومجلسنا التشريعي المنتخب حديثاً،  وأؤكد
لكم مجدداً اعتزازنا بعمق ومتانة  العلاقات  النضالية  والتاريخية  بين  شعبينا،
والتي أرسى دعائمها الرئيس والصديق العزيز، المناضل الأفريقي  والعالمي  نيلسون
مانديلا، والرئيس الشهيد ياسر عرفات، والتي تتواصل بكل حميمية مع الأخ  والصديق
العزيز الرئيس تابو مبيكى وحكومته، حيث  نحرص  على  الاستماع  لنصائحه،  ونواصل
تنسيق مواقفنا بشأن مختلف القضايا الثنائية والعالمية.

      إن مواقف وسياسات حكومة جنوب أفريقيا بشأن قضايا حقوق الإنسان، ومناهضتها
لكل الأساليب التي تخالف الحقوق الأساسية للشعوب، ودور  جنوب  أفريقيا  في  دعم
وتعزيز الاستقرار السياسي والاقتصادي، وحل النزاعات في  القارة  الإفريقية،  كل
هذا وغيره، يمثل دوراً ريادياً لجنوب إفريقيا وقيادتها.

      كما أن إنجازاتكم العظيمة والواضحة برفع  الظلم  عن  الملايين  من  أبناء
شعبكم منذ التغيير التاريخي، الذي حصل بالقضاء على الأبارتهيد هو  مثال  يحتذى،
حيث أدى إلى تحقيق استقرار اقتصادي وسياسي في ظل نظام ديمقراطي، يتمتع  فيه  كل
مواطن بحريته، دون أي تمييز على أساس الدين أو اللون أو العرق.

السيدات والسادة
      تعلمون، أيها الأصدقاء، أن شعبنا الفلسطيني قدم  ولا  يزال  يقدم  تضحيات
جسيمة من أجل حريته، وهو يعيش الآن مرحلة  صعبة  وخطيرة  جداً،  حيث  يتعرض  لكل
أشكال التعذيب  والتنكيل  والخنق  والحصار  والاستيطان  من  قبل  إسرائيل،  قوة
الاحتلال، التي تسعى من وراء كل ممارساتها العدوانية اللاشرعية  ضد  شعبنا  إلى
تكريس احتلالها واستيطانها لأرضنا ومقدساتنا وتدمير عملية  السلام،  وتقويض  كل
الفرص والجهود والمبادرات الدولية والإقليمية الرامية لإحيائها، وإنهاء  سلطتنا
الوطنية، وإن ما جرى مؤخراً في  مدينة  أريحا  والجريمة  التي  ارتكبتها  القوات
الإسرائيلية هناك من اختطاف لكل من كانوا في سجن أريحا لهو خير دليل على  نوايا
إسرائيل وضربها عرض الحائط بكل الاتفاقات الدولية الموقعة.

      إن مشاركتكم الرأي والمشورة،  أيها  الأصدقاء  الأعزاء،  في  هذه  الظروف
المعقدة في منطقتنا، هو شيء أساسي وهام جداً، ونحن على  يقين  تام،  بأننا  سنصل
خلال لقاءنا الذي جرى اليوم  مع  فخامة  الرئيس  والصديق  العزيز  تابو  مبيكى،
وأعضاء حكومته الموقرة، إلى نقاط وقواسم مشتركة، نستطيع معها  الدفع  في  اتجاه
إحياء عملية السلام في منطقتنا، ومن جانبنا، فنحن معنيون بالتعرف  على  تجربتكم
الرائدة بشكل يساعد في دفع العملية  السياسية  في  الشرق  الأوسط  إلى  الأمام،
ونرحب بأي جهد يمكن أن تقوم به حكومتكم الموقرة، ونؤكد لكم بأننا  ورغم  كل  ما
نعانيه، سنظل كما كنا دعاة سلام حقيقي، نتعامل بمسئولية  كاملة  مع  كل  الجهود
والمبادرات الدولية  والإقليمية  لإحياء  مسيرة  السلام  وحمايتها،  رغم  تعطيل
المسار التفاوضي من قبل إسرائيل، واستبداله بسياسة القبضة الحديدية،  والسياسات
أحادية الجانب التي نرفضها بقوة، ونطالب بوقفها فوراً كونها  تسعى  لرسم  وتحديد
خريطة الحل النهائي من جانب واحد.

      لقد وافقنا على خارطة الطريق التي أقرتها  اللجنة  الرباعية  المشكلة  من
الأمم المتحدة وروسيا والاتحاد الأوروبي والولايات  المتحدة  الأمريكية،  والتي
أصبحت قراراً في مجلس الأمن الدولي رقم 1515، ولكن  حكومة  إسرائيل  وضعت  أربعة
عشر تحفظاً على هذه الخطة، واعتمدت على قوتها ونفوذها لتواصل سياساتها  التوسعية
واضطهادها لشعبنا، وحاولت أن تروج في العالم مفهوم أنه لا وجود لشريك  فلسطيني،
للتفاوض معه، وأقول وأكرر  أمامكم،  نحن  على  استعداد  لبدء  المفاوضات  فوراً،
ولتنفيذ قرارات الأمم المتحدة والاتفاقيات التي وقعناها، وأن  العقبة  الحقيقية
هي التعنت الإسرائيلي من جهة، وإحجام المجتمع الدولي  عن  التدخل  بفاعلية  حتى
الآن من جهة أخرى.

      لا يمكن، أيها السادة، القبول باستخدام التغيير  الذي  حدث  عندنا  نتيجة
الانتخابات التشريعية الثانية، وفوز حركة حماس بأغلبية فيها، كذريعة، لمزيد  من
العدوان ضد شعبنا، ومعاقبته على  خياره  الديمقراطي،  ومن  هنا  فإننا  ندعوكم،
وندعو كل محبي الحرية والسلام في العالم، لبذل كل جهد ممكن  مع  القوى  الدولية
المؤثرة، لحمل إسرائيل على  وقف  عدوانها،  وتنفيذ  الاتفاقات  المبرمة،  وكذلك
قرارات الشرعية الدولية ذات الصلة، على نحو يؤدي إلى إقامة  دولتنا  الفلسطينية
المستقلة في كامل الأراضي التي تم احتلالها  من  قبل  إسرائيل  في  حزيران  عام
1967، وهي الضفة الغربية بما فيها القدس الشرقية وقطاع غزة، ليتسنى لنا  الوصول
إلى السلام المنشود، الذي وحده يضمن الاستقرار لكافة  شعوب  المنطقة  بما  فيها
إسرائيل، ويكفل لشعبنا التمتع بالعيش بحرية وكرامة وسيادة واستقلال  على  ترابه
الوطني الفلسطيني.

معالي السيدة رئيسة الجمعية الوطنية
أصحاب السعادة

      تُعلمنا تجربتكم بأن السلام ممكن عندما  تتحقق  العدالة  والمساواة،  وبأن
القوة مهما عظمت واستبدت لا تستطيع أن تقضي على إرادة شعب، وعلى حقه في  الحياة
الحرة  الكريمة  في  أرضه،  ولذلك  وبمقدار  رغبتنا  في  السلام   مع   جيراننا
الإسرائيليين، ومد اليد لهم، فإننا متمسكون بحقوقنا  في  وطننا،  حتى  نصل  إلى
اليوم الذي تكون لنا فيه  دولتنا  الحرة  والمستقلة  والديمقراطية،  التي  تعيش
بسلام مع كل جيرانها بما فيها إسرائيل، وتسهم في استقرار وازدهار  منطقة  الشرق
الأوسط، تحقيقاً لرؤية الرئيس الأمريكي جورج بوش.

      إننا بحاجة في ظل أوضاعنا الصعبة إلى دعمكم، وإلى  دعم  المجتمع  الدولي،
فحجم المعاناة لا يوصف سواء على المستوى الاقتصادي أم على مستوى حركة  الأفراد،
حيث يفرض ما يشبه المعازل على الفلسطينيين الذين يعيشون الآن  في  جزر  تحاصرها
المستوطنات  أو  قوات  الجيش  الإسرائيلي،  وتُخصص  شوارع  للمستوطنين  يمنع  من
استعمالها الفلسطيني، وأعتقد أن من  زار  فلسطين  منكم،  وشاهد  حجم  المعاناة،
والتمييز والظلم والاضطهاد، قد تذكر أسوأ أيام التمييز العنصري التي  كانت  هنا
في الماضي.

      وقبل أن أختم كلمتي، أقول أنه قد أجريت الانتخابات  الإسرائيلية،  ونتمنى
على الإسرائيليين أن يشكلوا حكومتهم بسرعة وأن نجلس إلى طاولة المفاوضات  بسرعة
وألا نضيع الوقت.

      أيها الأصدقاء، هنيئاً  لكم  بكل  ما  حققتموه،  أيها  الأشقاء،  في  جنوب
أفريقيا، وعلى طريقكم نحن سائرون من أجل الحرية  والسيادة  والاستقلال،  وسنبقى
معاً حتى يبزغ فجر الحرية والسيادة على كل ركن  من  أركان  عالمنا،  وسندافع  عن
حرية غيرنا كما ندافع عن حريتنا.

      عاشت جمهورية جنوب أفريقيا  ،  وعاشت  الصداقة  بين  شعبي  جنوب  أفريقيا
وفلسطين.


[Applause.]


(Translation of Arabic speech follows.)

[In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful:

Honourable Madam Speaker of the National Assembly, Your Excellency,
President Thabo Mbeki, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for
your kind invitation to speak today in front of the representatives of the
people of South Africa, this great country which represents a model of the
struggle to achieve equality between all its citizens, to all nations
around the world. The country which abolished the apartheid regime, and
continues to give its support to all freedom issues everywhere. The country
which has with us, the people of Palestine, the strongest and closest
relationships and ties; the country which we look at as an example to gain
determination, in spite of all difficulties, to continue our journey until
we achieve a just peace in our region, obtain freely our right to self-
determination, and establish an independent Palestinian State with its
capital, Eastern Jerusalem.

Our dearest friends, members of Parliament, today, I  pass  on  to  you  the
greetings of our Palestinian people and greetings from the  members  of  our
National Assembly and our recently elected Legislative Council. I  reiterate
our appreciation for the depth and strength of the historical  relationships
between our two nations, which were founded and established by  our  dearest
friend, the international and African struggler, President  Nelson  Mandela,
and the martyr, President Yasser Arafat. These relationships are  continuing
now strongly with our brother and  dearest  friend,  Thabo  Mbeki,  and  his
Government, whose advice we listen to, as we  continue  to  co-ordinate  our
stances towards the various bilateral and international issues.

Indeed, the stance and policy of the Government of South  Africa  concerning
human rights issues, its resistance to all ways which contradict  the  basic
rights of all the people, besides the role of  South  Africa  in  supporting
and  consolidating  political  and  economic  stability,  in   addition   to
resolving the conflicts on the African continent - all of this represents  a
pioneering role for South Africa and its leadership.

Likewise, your clearly  great  accomplishments  in  lifting  injustice  from
millions of  your  people  since  the  historic  change  of  abolishing  the
apartheid regime is a great  example.  This  leads  to  the  achievement  of
political and economic stability in light  of  a  democratic  regime,  where
every citizen enjoys  his  freedom,  without  any  discrimination  based  on
religion, colour or race.

Ladies and gentlemen, you know my friends, that the Palestinian people have
made, and are still making great sacrifices for their freedom, and they now
live in a difficult and serious stage; they are exposed to all forms of
torture, suffocation, siege and resettlement by Israel. Israel is an
occupation force, which seeks through all its illegal, aggressive practices
against our people to confirm its occupation of and settling in our land,
with its Holy places; to destroy the peace process and undermine all
opportunities, efforts and regional and international initiatives seeking
to revive the peace process; and to end our National Authority. Indeed,
what happened recently in the City of Jericho, the crime committed by the
Israeli forces there by abducting everyone inside the Jericho Prison, is a
true and prime example of Israeli intentions and its breach of all signed
international agreements.

Indeed, dear friends, to share with you opinions and  consultation  is  very
important and  essential  during  these  complicated  circumstances  in  the
region, and we are completely certain that we will have  arrived  at  mutual
points of agreement during the meeting which was held today  with  President
Thabo Mbeki and the members of his honourable government, and that  we  will
be able, through these points of agreement, to  push  in  the  direction  of
reviving the peace process in the region. From our  side,  we  are  keen  to
study your pioneering experience in such a way  as  to  push  the  political
process in the Middle East forward; we also welcome any effort presented  by
your honourable government. We confirm, in spite of all we suffer,  that  we
will continue to call for real peace, to deal with full responsibility  with
all international  and  regional  efforts  and  initiatives  to  revive  and
protect the peace  process,  in  spite  of  the  negotiation  process  being
disabled by Israel and replaced  with  the  policy  of  the  iron  hand  and
unilateral policies which we strongly refuse; we demand that this be  ceased
immediately,  as  it  seeks  to  draw  and  determine  a  unilateral   final
resolution map.

We have agreed to the Road Map, which was endorsed by the quartet  including
the United Nations, Russia, the European Union  and  the  United  States  of
America, and which became resolution number 1515 in  the  Security  Council.
However, the Israeli Government has  presented  fourteen  reservations  with
regard to this plan, and depended on its strength and influence to  continue
its expansionist policy and its oppression against our people, and has  even
tried to promote internationally the notion that  there  is  no  Palestinian
partner to negotiate with. I confirm and repeat in front of you that we  are
ready to start the negotiations immediately and to apply the UN  resolutions
and signed agreements. The real obstacle, on the one hand,  is  the  Israeli
stubbornness, and,  on  the  other,  the  reluctance  of  the  international
community to date to intervene effectively.

It is not possible, ladies and gentlemen, to accept the use  of  the  change
that happened in Palestine as a result of the second legislative  elections,
and the majority victory of the  Hamas  movement,  as  a  means,  for  extra
aggression against our people, and as a  means  to  punish  them  for  their
democratic choice. From here, we call on you, and we  call  on  all  freedom
and peace-loving people in the world, to exert every  possible  effort  with
the  influential  international  powers,  to  force  Israel  to   stop   its
aggression and apply the adopted agreements and all  relevant  international
legitimate resolutions in a way that leads towards the establishment of  our
independent Palestinian state in all lands occupied by Israel in June  1967,
which is the West Bank including eastern Jerusalem and the  Gaza  Strip,  in
order to achieve the desired peace, which can guarantee  stability  for  all
people in the region, including the Israelis, and guarantee  to  our  people
the enjoyment of living freely, with dignity, sovereignty and  independently
on the Palestinian national land.

Hon Madam Speaker of the National Assembly, hon Members of Parliament, your
experience has taught us that peace is possible when justice and equality
are achieved, and that force cannot destroy the will of the people or its
right to a generous, free life on its land, regardless of strength and
tyranny, However, as much as we desire to achieve peace with our Israeli
neighbours, and extend our hands to them, we are sticking to our rights in
our country, until we reach the day when we establish our democratic, free
and independent country, which lives in peace with all its neighbours,
including Israel, and contributes to the stability and prosperity of the
Middle East region, to achieve the vision of the American President George
W Bush.

Indeed, in the light of our difficult situations, we need your support,  and
the support of the  international  community.  The  magnitude  of  suffering
cannot be  described,  whether  on  the  economic  level  or  the  level  of
individual movement, where Israel imposes procedures on the Palestinians  to
make them live in enclaves surrounded by the settlements  or  Israeli  Armed
Forces.  They  assign  special  streets  to  the  settlers,  preventing  the
Palestinians from using them. I believe that whoever  of  you  have  visited
Palestine,  and  witnessed  the  magnitude  of  suffering,   discrimination,
injustice and oppression, will have remembered the worst days of  apartheid,
which dominated here in the past.

Before I end my speech, I would like to say that the Israeli elections  were
held recently. We hope the Israelis will be able to  form  their  government
quickly, then we can sit together quickly at the negotiating table  and  not
waste any time.

Dear friends, congratulations on everything you have achieved. Our  brothers
in South Africa, we will walk the same route  towards  freedom,  sovereignty
and independence. We will stay together until freedom and  sovereignty  rule
over every corner of our world; we will defend the freedom of others  as  we
defend our freedom.

Viva South Africa, Viva! Viva the friendship between the people of South
Africa and Palestine, Viva!]

Mrs N B GXOWA: Madam Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency
President Abbas, and Mr President, I am honoured to extend a vote of thanks
to the esteemed leader of the people of Palestine, His Excellency President
Abbas.

Your address in this august House has evoked memories of the enduring
relationship between the people of Palestine and South Africa. We are
united by common bonds of solidarity in pursuit of national sovereignty and
international peace.

We wish to assure His Excellency President Abbas of our unwavering support
in pursuit of a just resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on the
basis of the UN resolutions. In our humble opinion, nothing should stand in
the way of the peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The democratic government of South Africa unilaterally dismantled nuclear
weapons. From the rostrum of the tribune of our people, we reiterate our
call to make the Middle East a nuclear-free zone.

In the words of the Freedom Charter, we embrace ``peace, friendship amongst
the people of the world’’. Shukran. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

The House adjourned at 12:28.
