                              NOTICES OF MOTION


Mr M A MZIZI: Thank you, Chairperson. I hereby give notice that on the  next
sitting day of this House, I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

   That this House -

   (1)      expresses its disappointment to learn that a pregnant seventeen-
        year-old girl who had been stabbed by  her  boyfriend  was  released
        from Mmanapo Hospital even though she was still carrying a dead five-
        month-old foetus;
     2) applauds the action of the local police who insisted that  the  girl
        be re-admitted to hospital for further treatment, and  congratulates
        the police who swiftly arrested  the  girl’s  alleged  attacker  and
        urges the police to speed up the  forensic  investigation  into  the
        cause of the baby’s death so that a proper and accurate  charge  can
        be preferred on the suspect.

So shall I move.


Mnr J W LE ROUX: Agb Voorsitter,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag van die Raad sal voorstel:

   Dat die Raad –

      1) kennis neem dat -


        (a)      wetgehoorsame burgers weer eens geskok is oor die
             barbaarse moorde wat daagliks in ons land gepleeg word;


        (b)      hierdie vlakke van geweld net nie langer geduld kan word
             nie;


        (c)      die tyd aangebreek het dat die Regering iets drasties sal
             moet doen om hierdie gewetenlose barbare te stuit; en




   (2)      ‘n ernstige beroep op president Mbeki en die betrokke Ministers
         doen om hul plig teenoor die burgers van die land na te kom.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J W LE ROUX: Hon Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of this House, I shall move:

   That the Council –

      1) notes that -


        (a)      law-abiding citizens are shocked anew by the barbaric
             murders committed daily in our country;


        (b)      these levels of violence cannot be tolerated any longer;


        (c)      the time has come for the government to do something
             drastic to stop these unscrupulous barbarians; and


   (2)      urgently calls upon President Mbeki and the Ministers concerned
         to fulfil their duty towards the citizens of the country.]




                             APPROPRIATION BILL


                               (Policy debate)

Debate on Vote No 34: Water Affairs and Forestry

The MINISTER OF  WATER  AFFAIRS  AND  FORESTRY:  They  are  saying  it’s  my
farewell  speech,  Chairperson.  Chairperson,  Premiers  present  here,  hon
members,  members  of  the  executive  council,  dignitaries,   ladies   and
gentlemen, it is indeed an honour and my pleasure once again to - maybe  for
the last time in this capacity - address the National Council  of  Provinces
on what has been keeping our department busy over the  last  twelve  months,
if the President does not change his mind on Friday.

Chairperson, let me start by saying that whilst our department is  a  sector
leader in the forestry and water sectors, our achievements  in  the  targets
set by government depends on how well we co-ordinate the  implementation  of
our legislation in  collaboration  with  provinces  and  municipalities,  as
provided  for  by  the  Constitution  and  the  Intergovernmental  Relations
Framework Act, Act 13 of 2005.

I am happy to say that in addition to  progress  made  in  the  delivery  of
water and sanitation we have also made progress in our core  function  as  a
sector leader, a regulator and a supporter. In the context of our theme  for
this year, which is “Water  and  Forest:  For  shared  growth  and  economic
development”, our department has seriously interrogated  its  relevance  and
role in supporting the objective of Asgisa.

We have always emphasised that water is  not  only  life  itself,  but  also
central to growth and economic development  that  our  Deputy  President  is
passionately driving. Our department  also  contributes  to  this  important
programme. It may be necessary to remind the members that  the  delivery  of
water and sanitation is now the responsibility of  municipalities.  However,
as a leader, our department remains accountable for progress  made  in  this
regard.

I am sure you will  agree  with  me  when  I  say  the  challenge  of  being
accountable for activities that take place in another sphere  of  government
requires not only strong leadership  but  also  effective  intergovernmental
relations. The Intergovernmental Relations Act  therefore  becomes  critical
to our department.

We have successfully spearheaded  a  number  of  collaborative  initiatives,
such as the establishment of provincial water sector forums in  all  of  the
provinces.  We  have  functional  collaborative  structures  in   all   nine
provinces,  where  all  water  and  provincial   issues   are   deliberated.
Internally we are also looking at establishing a stronger  intergovernmental
relations unit that will ensure that collaboration  between  our  department
and other partners in the sectors are strengthened.
Most  provinces  have  succeeded  in  developing  provincial  water   sector
development plans  with  our  support.  These  are  to  be  aligned  to  the
provincial growth and development strategies. What we thought was  important
is that when the province is planning for  development,  it  should  include
the availability of water in that particular  province.  If  you  take,  for
example, the Northern Cape and the Housing  department’s  plans  to  develop
houses in that particular province, you will find that  a  certain  type  of
technology for sanitation may not  be  appropriate  for  the  Northern  Cape
given the water situation there. That is why we thought that we needed  this
central planning.

One of the highlights of our achievements is the water summits held  in  all
nine provinces last year. This culminated  in  a  very  successful  National
Water Summit. I want to take this opportunity to sincerely apologise to  the
NCOP. I do not know how  we  missed  inviting  you  to  the  National  Water
Summit. I plead guilty.

The primary objective of the summit was to understand the unique  challenges
facing each province when it comes to water  and  sanitation  delivery.  The
summits were another mechanism to seek ways of supporting the  provinces  in
their provincial growth and development plans. I can mention  that  lack  of
capacity  to  deliver,  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure  and
challenges of meeting our targets came out prominently and  consistently  in
each and every province. It is from these summits that today we  can  safely
say that  we  fully  comprehend  the  challenges  and  opportunities  facing
service delivery in each province and in the country as a whole. We  have  a
national picture of what the problems of water are, but with  the  specifics
of each province.

The outcome of  these  summits  complemented  Project  Consolidate  and  the
izimbizo  that  our  President,  as  well  as  our  Deputy  President,  held
throughout the country. We have listened attentively  to  issues  raised  by
municipalities at the izimbizo, at water summits  and  as  part  of  Project
Consolidate’s initiatives. This has led to the department  formulating  what
we call a water services sector support strategy,  which  will  be  launched
this year.

There is less than 24 months and 48 months  before  meeting  our  water  and
sanitation targets  respectively  because  as  you  will  remember  we  have
selected 2007 for eliminating bucket system toilets. The year  2010  is  our
target year for sanitation in general.

Our focus in the last year has been on intensifying our support function  to
the  municipalities.  This  has  led  to  the  department  engaging  in  the
following activities: the development  of  a  sector-wide  capacity-building
strategy, which we plan to launch by August this year;  the  secondment  and
deployment of DWAF engineers and technicians to  municipalities  to  provide
hands-on support in line with Project Consolidate. If I had the time  I  was
going  to  demonstrate  this.  We  have  monitored   the   spending   within
municipalities and  observed  that  some  municipalities  are  underspending
because of their  technical  capacity  problem.  Some  municipalities  under
Project Consolidate  have  no  engineers  and  others  have  no  technically
skilled people.

We were practical in terms of  getting  engineers  and  literally  deploying
them to those municipalities where the backlog is  the  highest  because  we
appreciate that we  don’t  have  time,  and  the  deadlines  are  tight.  We
deployed 21 engineers to support  the  process  of  eradicating  the  bucket
system by  2007.  We  have  11  engineers  and  water  resource  specialists
deployed by the Republic of Cuba to Limpopo, North West,  Eastern  Cape  and
KwaZulu-Natal provinces respectively. They have  given  on-the-job  training
to a 1 000 artisans.

We are exploring options of getting more expertise from Cuba  in  the  areas
of hydrological services, engineering and  forestry  sectors.  We  are  also
exploring the option of sending our young learners to  Cuba  to  bring  back
the technical skills that our country desperately needs. I want  to  confirm
that Cuba has agreed to do this with us.

We have leveraged and mobilised capacity that exists in our boards  for  the
benefit of struggling  municipalities.  Furthermore,  like  most  government
departments, we are interrogating  the  suitability  of  our  organisational
structure in relation to our legislative mandate.  It  is  in  this  context
that we are embarking on a strategy that will  lead  to  stronger  and  more
efficient regional offices, which will be in a better position  to  take  up
their leadership role on all water-related matters.

Chairperson, we need to emphasise that more work  is  needed  to  accelerate
the pace of delivery to meet  the  targets  of  the  Millennium  Development
Goals. The delivery of water remains constant at approximately  one  million
people per annum. We are happy  to  have  seen  a  steady  increase  in  the
delivery of sanitation services.       A lot is happening in the  provinces,
which is very exciting in terms  of  the  delivery  of  the  sanitation  and
provinces need to be commended for this.

As a sector leader we are also guarding jealously  against  our  hard-earned
progress  being  jeopardised.  Last  year  a  financial  modelling  exercise
undertaken on behalf of the Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government
by DPSA found that the  delivery  rate  in  some  major  municipalities  may
result in municipalities acquiring infrastructure at such a pace  that  over
the next  few  years  they  would  increasingly  be  unable  to  afford  its
operations and maintenance costs.

Studies also show that there is a lack of  sufficient  investment  in  asset
maintenance. In the longer term this will result in negative health  impacts
and expensive refurbishment projects. We appeal to you to help us as far  as
this is concerned.

About  the  following  problems  that  were  experienced  in   Delmas,   our
department  has  embarked  on  a  comprehensive  drinking  water  management
programme to support municipalities in ensuring that the  water  that  comes
out of the tap remains of good quality. As a country we are not prepared  to
compromise  the  quality  of  our  drinking  water,  which  is  acknowledged
internationally.

It is in this context that we are embarking on a strategy that will lead to
stronger and more efficient regional offices, which will be in a better
position to take up their leadership role in all water related matters.

It is in this context that we have embarked on a robust support and
monitoring programme for all municipalities. Municipalities are now
submitting monthly drinking water quality reports to our department where
it is stored as part of our national data. I am sure people saw in our
exhibition that we have a database that captures information which tells
you that in the Free State, Welkom, Lejalebutswa, there is a problem with
the quality of the water. There is more fluoride in it than is required by
our own standards for quality. If, for example, there is supposed to be 20%
fluoride in the water that is acceptable, then at Lejalebutswa it is 23%,
and then you know that an intervention has to be made because Lejalebutswa
is off by 3% in terms of the fluoride that exists in the water.

If you go to the exhibition, the ladies who are operating the computer will
show you that. That information is outside. I think this is a very, very
big achievement which one is really quite happy about. We have already
collected that information for four provinces, but we are expanding this
project to the other five provinces as well.

Lastly, the allegations on maggots found in our drinking water were
thoroughly investigated by our department and external parties. I wish to
say once again, these investigations confirm that our water is safe to
drink.

I just want to say this, from a layperson’s point of view, say house number
15, or number 79, reports that there are maggots coming out of the tap.
Strangely, the media knows that there will be maggots that will come out of
the tap at number 79, which is getting its water from the same source as
other houses in that locality. But, none of the other 499 taps have
maggots. For me, I still want to understand scientifically how it happens,
because the purification system itself could not allow those big maggots to
go through. There are filters there and so on. The DA is on our side on
this one. [Laughter.] But, I am saying, it is very dangerous for whoever is
trying to pull this, it is dangerous, especially for tourism. We are one of
the few countries where you could drink water from the tap in any part of
this world.
In the process of making more water available for basic needs as well as to
support the envisaged mining development, we are building a number of dams.
The De Hoop Dam is going to be built and the De Berg is in the process of
being built and should be completed by next year. We have a programme
called Umzimvubu that has been approved in the Eastern Cape. We think that
all of the above are going to help to intervene in social and economic
development.

We have also ensured that water is used for poverty alleviation and in the
Free State there is a project called Matangwane, where there is technology
that is used to ensure that people irrigate the crop that they are growing
there. And, we are going to contribute R25 million to that project because
we believe that it will go a long way in terms of contributing to poverty
alleviation.

We also have a responsibility to contribute to Asgisa, and we are
contributing to it. We have ensured that we come up with a plan to
accelerate the delivery of sanitation in rural areas and we have done that
under operation Gijima. Our Deputy President leads this. I am also glad to
announce that we are the first country to come up with sanitation week
because we wanted to profile sanitation. We launched sanitation week in
Tarkastad in the Eastern Cape.

We also have the water allocation reform programme, which is part of the
transformation that is happening in the water sector. The national Water
Act requires us to ensure that there is equitable distribution of water
amongst all users, especially the farmers. This is the programme that is
going to help us take excess water, and I am saying excess water, I am not
talking about the water that farmers are using for their production.

If they are using what they have optimally, we won’t take anything, but we
will take if they have excess. Again, there would be consensus, we won’t
just go and grab. We as this government are very responsible. That is why
this programme is out for consultation; because we need input from
everybody.

Working For Water is a project that really is important for poverty
alleviation, but it needs to be transformed and we are trying to look at
transforming it in such a way that it will give us more jobs. It has
potential and we think that there is something that we can do to make it
better and to ensure that it contributes to more jobs.

The charter on forestry is going to be completed by the end of May this
year. We are also looking at calling a summit where we will discuss the
outcome with the stakeholders, but also report to them.

I have one minute left and it is important that I make my thank you speech.
I thank the members of the NCOP for the support, but also especially the
chairperson for the exposure to your outreach programmes. I did enjoy all
those experiences from you. Thank you very much for the support and the
exposure. My gratitude and appreciation to my very, very frustrated
director-general, Jabulani Sindane, for his leadership and commitment and
to all the officials in the department, for their hard work and dedication.
We were becoming one big, very happy, family. [Laughter.] Now, I am going
to be their aunt, and not their mother. [Laughter.]

But, I think, most importantly, I want to thank every member of the staff,
up to the people who clean our offices. We always forget them. I want to
dedicate this speech to those people, those that we always take for
granted. The Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, as well
the entire water and forestry sectors, including municipalities Salga is
here Saawu, TCTA, water boards, the Water Research Commission, advisory
councils and all the stakeholders and partners, for their co-operation,
thank you very much!

Lastly, I just want to close by saying that combating poverty means acting
now, not later. My department will not rest until the last person has been
served with water and sanitation. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon members, hon Minister, representatives of
the department, permanent delegates and MECs present here, I think I must
thank the Minister now because, probably, at the end of my speech I might
be told that my time has expired. [Laughter.]

We really enjoyed working with the Minister. Some of us know the Minister
from 1994, when she was a backbencher. The good side of it is that status
never changed her. She remained grounded, working with the people on the
ground and was quite accessible. We want to express our gratitude and
appreciation for having had this privilege of working with you. At the same
time, we wish you a very good and prosperous time in your new field.

When the ANC took power in 1994, it inherited an economy shaped by colonial
dispossession and apartheid, which resulted in enormous inequalities and
increasingly devastating poverty, rising unemployment and unsustainable
government debt. Indeed, despite this legacy, the ANC-led government has
made great strides and progress in addressing these imbalances of the past.

Great challenges still remain, however. Continued mass poverty and deep
inequalities based on class, race and gender are still very much visible in
many regions of our country. To address these challenges requires a choice
in favour of a broadly accepted developmental approach that will underpin
sustainable reform and transformation of the major sectors.

Our choice of approach must involve focused state–led intervention to
ensure the integration of the two economies, poverty alleviation, and job
creation and, most importantly, sustained economic growth. This means
creating the capacity at every level of the state to mobilise and direct
social, economic and political resources to where they are needed most.
This budget before this House tries to address exactly that, so that the
lives of South Africans will be transformed and change for the better,
through reversal of this devastating legacy of our past.

But, government alone cannot resolve these challenges. Rather, they require
that we unite South Africans in a people’s contract to create work, fight
poverty and supply clean drinking water even to the most marginalised
people pushed to the periphery of our country. With specific attention to
the government’s plan of action as stated in the state of the nation
address, the department is assisting with the improvement of access to
basic water supply as well as sanitation services, so that we are able to
meet government’s targets.

The main challenges in implementation include funding capacity to implement
sustainable management by water services authorities. The direct
responsibility for infrastructure and the daily operation has moved from
the national department to water services authorities at local government
level. Funds will in future come from the municipal infrastructure grant,
the local government equitable share and the capacity-building grants.

According to the department’s strategic plan and its estimated national
expenditure, the free basic water supply programme is well established and
coverage is progressively improving. The key focus now is to extend this to
free basic sanitation. However, linked to the rolling out of free basic
water supply is the aspect mentioned earlier, that is ensuring appropriate
infrastructure support. In order to supply free basic water to those who
qualify, we need properly installed and serviced water meters in all
settlements across our country.

The Departments of Water Affairs and Forestry, Provincial and Local
Government, Public Works and local government structures remain busy,
strategising how to ensure that such systems are installed, implemented and
properly maintained. This means that there must be interdepartmental
deliberation aimed at strengthening service delivery. We cannot
underestimate the importance of clean running water in the lives of our
people.

How do we meet the international water-sharing agreements to protect the
scarce water resources in our country? Water is of critical importance, in
particular fresh water, for all aspects regarding sustainable development,
including poverty and hunger eradication, reduction of water-related
disasters, health, agriculture and rural development, hydropower, food
security, gender equality, as well as the achievement of environmental
sustainability and protection.

We are committed to achieving the internationally agreed goals on
integrated water resources management, access to safe drinking water and
basic sanitation, agreed upon in Agenda 21, the UN Millennium Declaration
and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. We reiterate the continued and
urgent need to achieve these goals and keep track of progress towards their
implementation, including the goal to reduce by half, by year 2015, the
proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe drinking water.

We are committed to the decisions adopted by the 13th session of the United
Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in April 2005 concerning
policy options and practical measures to expedite implementation of
strategies to deal with water, sanitation and human settlements. We note
with interest the importance of enhancing the sustainability of ecosystems.
We acknowledge the implementation and importance of rainwater management
and the development of hydropower projects.

We must recognise the importance of domestic and international policies
that foster and assist capacity building and co-operation at all levels to
mitigate water-related disasters, including strategies that focus on
prevention, preparedness, risk assessment, community awareness, resilience
and response. We recognise the important role that parliamentarians and
local authorities are playing in various countries to increase sustainable
access to water and sanitation services as well as to support integrated
water resources management. Efficient collaboration with and between these
sectors is a key factor to meeting our water-related changes and goals.

However, we have dams throughout this country and we must try to be careful
because sanitation pollutes them. I once invited the Minister to come to my
constituency at the Hartebeespoortdam and she was informed that the Jukskei
River, from Alexandra and the suburbs around it, is flowing into the
Hartebeespoortdam. As a result of that the Hartebeespoortdam is highly
polluted. Its water is used for multiple purposes – for drinking,
irrigation, etc.

My constituency and I are still waiting for a response from the side of the
department. What is going to be done in as far as trying to curb the
consistent flowing of the Jukskei River into the dam, because it is
polluted with sanitation water? Therefore, for those dams that are not yet
polluted, it is also important that we see to it that we don’t allow any
pollution or whatsoever, because we are starting to get limitations in as
far as clean drinking water is concerned. Therefore, we should remain
vigilant at all times so that we safeguard the clean drinking water for the
people of South Africa.

Let me thank the members of the committee that I chair for their hard work
and vigilance in doing their oversight work.

Lastly, let me thank the Minister and the department. We urge even the new
Minister who will be coming in to work together with us in a co-operative
manner so that we can really fulfil the provisions stated in the Freedom
Charter and do as much as we can to deliver to the people out there who are
looking up to us. Their hopes and wishes are with this Parliament. We want
to thank everybody and the provinces ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): Lungu elihloniphekile, isikhathi
sakho sesiphelile. [Hon member, your time has expired.]

Rev P MOATSHE: We do support this Budget Vote, even if we believe it could
be tripled so that we can speed up ...

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): Hon member, your time has
expired.

Rev P MOATSHE: Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen ...

Siyambulela umaMtolo ngokusizalela umaRhadebe. MaRhadebe, siwubonile umzila
wakho. Sithi uze wenze njalo nakule uyinikiweyo indima. Ubuququzela kuwo
onke amaphondo wade wafikelela nakula ndawo ndithunyelwe kuyo. Usanda kuya
kutsho phaya eMzimvubu emaBhaceni kuloSogoni. Ufikile naphaya e-O R Tambo,
siyakubulela ngaloo nto. Inga ungenza njalo, uphinde phaya emaBhaceni,-
kuthiwa kukho izimbiwa phaya, kwaye kusithiwa phaya e-Mount Ayliff kukho
amalahle. Sikuthembile, ukuba uza kufika uyenze loo nto. (Translation of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[We are grateful to maMtolo for giving birth to maRhadebe. MaRhadebe, we
have seen your strides. We say: Do the same with the other responsibilities
given to you. You visited all the provinces and ended up in my
constituency. You recently went to Mzimvubu, Bhacaland, and the home of
Sogoni. You also reached O R Tambo, and we are grateful. I wish you could
do the same and revisit Bhacaland as it has been reported that some mining
resources have been found there. In Mount Ayliff, it is said that there is
coal. I trust that you are going to visit these places.]

Let me start again. I was still talking to my outgoing Minister in this
Ministry, not outgoing in Parliament. Throughout its years of existence,
the ANC has fought for the voice of the people to prevail. It has fought
for the principle that the people shall govern. Today we also have the
opportunity to give meaning to this principle.
We have the opportunity to put the people at the centre of development, not
only as beneficiaries, but also as drivers of transformation. Water,
sanitation and hygiene are vital components of sustainable development and
the alleviation of poverty.

Water as a resource is the backbone to economic development and is,
thereby, critical to the Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South
Africa. Water provides the platform without which services cannot be
delivered in a sustainable manner.

Our government has been confronted with a situation in which not only has
the majority of South Africa’s people been excluded from the land, but they
have been denied direct access to water and sanitation for productive use
of this benefit.

Our President, in his state of the nation address, indicated that we needed
to eradicate the bucket system between 2006 and 2007, and that all
households should have clean water by 2010. It is very important that this
is achieved, because over one million children die every year from
waterborne diseases.

We have achieved a great deal already in the area of water and sanitation
but much more needs to be done. In the feedback we got from the programme
we have undertaken as the NCOP of Taking Parliament to the People, some
people mentioned that they had to travel long distances to get water.
Beye kukha emithonjeni. Azikabikho ke neempompo. [They fetch water from the
spring. Water on tap is not yet accessible and there is ...]

... loss of lives resulting from waterborne diseases and cholera in places
like KwaZulu-Natal, but as we have just said ...

Sele siwathathile amanyathelo ... [... steps have been taken ...]

... to address those problems which we heard about from those different
visits of the NCOP when Taking Parliament to the People.

To respond to some of these challenges, hon Minister Sonjica mentioned in
her speech that there is a need to ensure optimal use of water resources
and to achieve the alignment of existing and future regional
infrastructure, while, and at the same time, ensuring equitable access to
water services between developed and undeveloped areas.

Her department has necessitated that the budget for water resource
management be increased from R1,6 billion in 2005-06 to R2,2 billion in
2006-07. According to the hon Minister, this allocation is expected to
increase from R2,4 billion in 2007-08 to R2,96 billion in 2008-09.
Minister, we are thinking that your vision will be fulfilled by another
energetic Minister who is going to take over. Surely, the department will
be taking up this budget with the incoming Minister?

We have just been talking about this role that was given to municipalities.
If municipalities, together with ourselves as the national government ...
singayeka ukucingela ukuba kukho ooNdimkhulu ... [... could stop thinking
about the big guns ...]

... we can improve this problem of capacity. We have been saying that there
is no capacity in local government, but you’ve just said that they have
tried their level best. So, I’m hoping that with this budget, we will see
that we are assisting them to build capacity. Your department must transfer
their skills back to this local government, which is an arm of government.

Building on the principles of the Freedom Charter and building on our
achievements based on these principles and drawing on the lessons derived
from our collective experience, we can move even faster to realise the
goals of a better life for all. Minister Sonjica, you were also pleased to
announce to us that your department has taken over rehabilitation work at
Shiloh Irrigation Scheme where they spent R13,2 million during 2005-06 to
provide a reliable water supply to the resource-poor farmers in the scheme.
We want to commend the Minister for her work.

At the Stellenbosch ANC national conference, it was noted that South Africa
was far in advance of the target on water and sanitation adopted by the
World Summit on Sustainable Development. But surely today we can reflect on
your contribution as to whether we are still far in advance. I hope we’ll
do that review.

The conference resolved to call on the government to continue the good work
it has done and to keep on removing all the obstacles to the delivery of
basic services, such as water and sanitation, in the shortest possible
time, particularly by the municipalities that are servicing the rural poor.
The challenge then is that some of these municipalities do not have the
capacity, as we have just said, to lead economic development, but we have
just heard from you that they are doing their best.

To build on this progress made, the ANC has improved interaction with
communities to ensure better communication with government. In our 2006 ANC
local government election manifesto, we pledged ourselves to the vision of
2014, of building a better South Africa during the second decade of
freedom. We understand that water, sanitation and hygiene are vital
components of sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty.

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chairperson, I am delivering this speech on behalf of the
hon Watson, who you know is indisposed. The DA is supporting the Water
Affairs and Forestry Budget Vote. There are, however, three concerns that
we would like to raise which impact upon the performance of the department
and its ability to meet its stated goals.

Firstly, it is worrying that a culture of equality and transparency does
not yet appear to have been firmly established in the department. Recently,
a departmental official was on record for singling out a particular race
group for their supposed wastage of water. The absurdity of such a
statement deserves the same kind of ridicule as some of the utterances that
characterised debates in these Chambers before 1994 – not thereafter – and
does the sincere efforts of the department in other respects immeasurable
damage.

There is also the unfortunate case of Komatiland in Mpumalanga, and
Limpopo, where allegations of the lack of transparency in the tender
procedures for timber continues unabated. Unfortunately, this area is no
stranger to controversy, previously having 2 500 jobs threatened due to
interruptions in the supply of timber because of the flawed transfer of
state-owned forest land to BEE interests.

The second concern entails the attainment of the service delivery goals
that the department has set for itself vis-à-vis the devolution of service
delivery responsibilities to the local government sphere. These delivery
goals include the supply of clean water to all by 2008, basic sanitation
for all by 2010, and the eradication of the bucket system by 2010 as well.

These issues are of immense importance given their continued prominence
during the debates waged at the regular izimbizo held in the poorest parts
of our country throughout the year. The importance of access to clean water
is undisputed, while access to proper basic sanitation makes a life-
changing difference to the most marginalised of our people.

Sadly, the eradication of the bucket system, which is a relatively easy
target to attain, seems to be beyond the capacity of many of our local
municipalities. Shortly before the elections, it was reported that 203 of
our 284 municipalities could still not provide sanitation for 60% of their
residents, an indication of just how far the reality is from the goal.

Problems identified by the DA in this regard relate to the following: the
prioritisation and management of municipal budgets, the correct application
of conditional and municipal infrastructure grants, successful project
management, the maintenance of existing infrastructure, and the non-payment
of services.

The implications of these problems do not only affect the rural poor, but
all South Africans. Does it really have to take an outside organisation
such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to have
to sound the warning bells with regard to the consequences of our crumbling
rural infrastructure for economic growth?

This brings us to the final issue regarding the activities of local
government, that is, the pursuit of political and economic self-interest at
the expense of the South African citizen.

The 284 municipalities and 15 water boards all play a critical role in the
roll-out of services and the maintenance of service infrastructure. Yet,
South Africans have to be subjected to countless stories of the devastating
effects of politicking by local government politicians from the ruling
party, and the politics of patronage.

With regard to the former, what has been done to prevent the reoccurrence
of a situation such as in Mopani, Limpopo, where the implementation of
improved credit control measures were delayed because it did not auger well
for the ruling party’s chances in the local government elections?

With regard to the latter, what has the department done to prevent the
continual wastage of resources by the inept officials at the helm of the
Bushbuckridge water board? Inept by their own admission, as it was nobody
less than the chairperson of the Bushbuckridge water board that
acknowledged the incompetence of the CEO, and the complete dysfunctional
state in which its board of directors found itself when questioned by an
ANC MP at the same Scopa hearing at which DWAF was interrogated last year.

The DA wishes the Minister well in her endeavours in her new department,
but hopes that the changing of the guard at Water Affairs and Forestry will
see the concerns being mentioned here today being dealt with swiftly and
judiciously. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY (Western Cape): Hon Chair, hon Minister and members of this
Council, let me, at the outset, congratulate the hon Minister on her new
appointment in Cabinet. We know that Water Affairs and Forestry has made
huge strides under her leadership and we know that she will also do the
same kind of job in the new portfolio. However, from an agricultural point
of view we will miss her in this portfolio, but we also know that her
successor will be a very good Minister.

In his state of the nation address at the beginning of the year, President
Thabo Mbeki placed the emphasis on the season of hope that is beckoning all
South Africans in the second decade of our democracy. The Freedom Charter
spells out explicitly that the land belongs to the people and this means
that we shall be entitled to possessing the land and the benefits that
accompany that equality.
Ownership also means responsibility and, with regard to land,
responsibility means that we are obligated to take care of the land and our
natural resources. Out of our natural resources flows many streams and when
they are eventually put together, it should become a river of hope that
will flow forever.

Daar gaan egter van ons almal, wat op die een of ander wyse gebruik maak
van ons natuurlike hulpbronne, vereis word om opnuut te kyk na metodes om
dié hulpbronne te spaar en te bewaar. Ontledings het aangetoon dat die
waterverbruik van die Kaapse metropool binnekort die voorsiening vanuit die
beskikbare waterbronne gaan oortref. Die kompetisie tussen die verskillende
verbruikersektore om die beskikbare water gaan dus toeneem. Die
besproeiingsektor is verantwoordelik vir ongeveer 50% van die totale
huidige verbruik en moet dus betrokke raak by die vind van gebalanseerde
oplossings.

In die lig van bogenoemde faktore het die Departement van Landbou hier in
die Wes-Kaap proaktief opgetree en 'n program geloods om die werklike
waterverbruik deur besproeiing in die belangrikste sektore in die Wes-Kaap
te bepaal en vas te stel hoe die waterverbruiksdoeltreffendheid, dit wil sê
'n kilogram vrugte geproduseer per kubieke meter water, verbeter kan word.
Die program is tans in ses gebiede aan die gang, naamlik De Doorns met
tafeldruiwe, Worcester met wyndruiwe, Ceres met pere, Stellenbosch met
pruime, in die Sandveld met aartappels, en in Vredendal ook met wyndruiwe.

Die optimale waterbehoefte word in die program vir die verskillende gebiede
bepaal en produsente word bygestaan om hul waterverbruik te optimiseer, en
foute in hul besproeiingstelsels en skedulering uit te skakel. Die
bevindings gaan saamgevat word om aan produsente oor die hele provinsie
dieselfde ondersteuning te gee. Die resultate van die projek tot dusver dui
daarop dat water in die algemeen redelik effektief benut word, maar dat
daar wel geleentheid vir verbetering by sekere produsente is. Die
gemiddelde verbetering in die waterverbruiksdoeltreffendheid het met tussen
12% en 15% gestyg waar die program geïmplementeer is. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[However, all of us who make use of our natural resources in some or other
way will be required to continue looking for new methods to save and
conserve these natural resources. Analyses have indicated that the water
consumption of the Cape Metropole will soon exceed the supply from the
available water sources. The competition between the various consumer
sectors for the available water will therefore increase. The irrigation
sector is responsible for approximately 50% of the total present
consumption and should therefore become involved in finding balanced
solutions.

In view of the above-mentioned factors the department of agriculture here
in the Western Cape has taken proactive steps and launched a programme to
determine the actual water consumption by irrigation in the most important
sectors in the Western Cape and to ascertain how the water consumption
efficiency, that is a kilogram of fruit produced per cubic meter of water,
can be improved. The programme is at present being implemented in six
areas, namely De Doorns with table grapes, Worcester with wine-grapes,
Ceres with pears, Stellenbosch with plums, the Sandveld with potatoes, and
Vredendal also with wine-grapes.

The optimal water requirement is determined in the programme for the
different areas and producers are being assisted with optimising their
water consumption and eliminating mistakes in their irrigation systems and
scheduling. The findings will be summarised to give producers across the
entire province the same support. The results of the project to date
indicate that water is generally utilised effectively, but that there is in
fact an opportunity for improvement in the case of certain producers. The
average improvement has risen by between 12% and 15% where the programme
has been implemented.]

As indicated, the Western Cape department of agriculture investigated the
dynamics of an increased long-term water scarcity situation in the Berg
water management area. Associated with this research, a public survey by
which 7 000 questionnaires were sent to water users in the Berg water
management area, including the Cape Metropole, was also conducted. The
results indicated a public willingness to pay for environmentally
friendlier, but more expensive, water.

The outcome motivates serious consideration of bulk-supply options such as
desalination of seawater and the recycling to potable standard despite a
higher direct cost and potentially increased water tariffs. To this end,
the Western Cape department supports the development of pilot desalination
projects by working together with service providers, consultants, as well
as the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, and also district and
local municipalities to engage in discussions on co-financing a pilot
desalination project.

The Western Cape is currently busy with further research to qualify the
impact of increased water tariffs on the Western Cape economy. Preliminary
results are expected towards the end of the current financial year, and we
trust that we can come knocking on your door for assistance for such a
project.

Die oorhoofse doel ook van die studie wat tans onderneem word by die
Oudtshoorn Landbou-waterondersoek is om te bepaal hoe die beskikbare
waterbronne in die Oudtshoorn-gebied beter benut kan word tot voordeel van
die gemeenskap en wel op so 'n manier dat die houvas van armoede op
voorheen benadeelde mense spesifiek aangepak en verlig word. Die
hoofaspekte wat ondersoek word, is die volgende: Hoeveel water kan moontlik
bespaar word? Waar, in die bestaande stelsel, kan dié besparing gemaak
word? En, wat gaan dit kos om die besparing te realiseer?

Wat die Olifants-Doringrivierstudie betref, is die eerste fase van dié
studie verlede jaar afgehandel teen 'n koste van R6 miljoen, en ‘n verdere
R1,5 miljoen word vanjaar geraam om die beskikbaarheid van grondwater in
die gebied vas te stel, en is primêr daarop ingestel om water aan klein,
opkomende boere te lewer.

Groot kompetisie vir die beperkte waterbronne in die George-gebied heers
tussen die stedelike, landbou- en ontspanningsektore. Die gebied is baie
gewild en talle gholflandgoedere is reeds ontwikkel, en die belangstelling
het nog nie eens daar afgeneem nie. 'n Ondersoek ten bedrae van R2,5
miljoen om die omvang van die beskikbare water in daardie gedeelte te
bepaal en 'n proaktiewe verdeling tussen die sektore voor te stel, word in
samewerking met Waterwese gedoen.

'n Studie om die beskikbare waterbronne en ontwikkelinsopsies vir die
gemeenskap van Zoar te bepaal, is tans ook aan die gang. Die gemeenskap het
geen opgaardamme vir besproeiingswater wat in die somer tydens donderstorms
voorkom nie, en kan nie volhoubaar boer sonder besproeiingswater nie. As
regering is dit ons plig om te sorg dat ons mense wat voorheen nie gelyke
geleenthede gehad het nie, nou daardie geleenthede kry.

Op die Koebeeberg naby Vanrhynsdorp is daar agt plase wat geen drinkwater
het nie, en water moet oor lang afstande vir hulle aangery word. Hulle het
self oor die afgelope aantal jare ongeveer 60 droë boorgate geboor. 'n
Ondersoek is deur die program by ons gedoen en 'n waterbron aan die voet
van die berg is geïdentifiseer. 'n Pypleiding gaan opgerig word en die
koste van daardie projek beloop reeds so R900 000. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The overall purpose of the study at present being undertaken by the
Oudtshoorn agricultural water investigation is aimed at determining how the
available water sources in the Oudtshoorn area can be better utilised to
the advantage of the community and in such a way that the grip of poverty
on formerly disadvantaged people is specifically addressed and relieved.
The main aspects that are being investigated are the following: How much
water can possibly be saved? Where, in the existing system, can this saving
be made? And, what is it going to cost to realise the saving?

As far as the Olifants/Doring River study is concerned, the first phase of
this study was completed last year at a cost of R6 million and a further
R1,5 million is being estimated this year to determine the availability of
underground water in the area, and is primarily aimed at providing water to
small, emerging farmers.

There is great competition for the limited water resources in the George
area between the urban, agricultural and recreational sectors. The area is
very popular and numerous golf estates have already been developed, and the
interest there has not even begun to dwindle. An investigation amounting to
R2,5 million to determine the scope of the available water in that area and
to represent a proactive division between the sectors is being done in
collaboration with Water Affairs.

A study to determine the available water sources and developmental options
for the community of Zoar is also being done at present. The community has
no reservoirs for irrigation water that occurs in the summer during
thunderstorms and cannot farm sustainably without irrigation water. As the
government it is our duty to ensure that our people who previously did not
have equal opportunities now receive those opportunities.

On the Koebee Mountain near Vanrhynsdorp there are eight farms that do not
have any potable water, and water has to be carted to them over long
distances. They themselves have dug approximately 60 dry boreholes over the
past few years. An investigation was done here by the programme and a water
source at the foot of the mountain was identified. A pipeline will be
installed and the cost of that project already amounts to approximately
R900 000.]

It is important that our youth should be educated to respect and love our
environment and natural resources. It is with this in mind that 50 junior
LandCare camps will be held in this province during this year, which will
accommodate about 4 500 historically disadvantaged students, training them
in sustainable resource use, for example, efficient water use, biodiversity
education, climate change, as well as social skills.

It is important that we protect our indigenous vegetation. To this end we
will be conducting 20 projects during the year to eradicate alien
vegetation with the aim of re-establishing indigenous vegetation.

Some of our river systems were destroyed by fire and flooding during the
course of last year and have resulted in extensive damage to the river
course. In some cases river basin peat that took 10 000 years to form has
been eroded to bedrock, destroying the natural wetland and sponge of the
system. Three infrastructure projects will be implemented to protect the
river course from eroding agricultural land. There we will also spend some
money, and this money will be used for labour to erect these structures.

In conclusion, I need to point out that we are embarking on these projects
not only to empower our people, to eradicate poverty and to address the
injustices of the past, but also to ensure that we provide in the needs
from our natural resources in an effort to take them over the threshold of
hope into the fullness of the second decade of freedom. Thank you, Chair.
[Applause.]

Mnu M A MZIZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekile, Ngqongqoshe, ozakwethu nezivakashi
ezikhona lapha, ake ngiqale ngibonge enkosazaneni ebesinayo, umama
uSonjica. Uma eseza kweminye iminyango, kuzosithokozisa uma engasebenza
ngale ndlela abesebenza ngayo nangapha ngoba akakalahleki emehlweni ethu,
uzophinda abe khona. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Hon Chairperson, Minister, colleagues and visitors present
here, let me start by thanking Mrs Sonjica. As she is going to the other
department, we would be grateful if she could carry on in the way she was
doing here, because she has not disappeared in our eyes. She will be
omnipresent.]

We all know that the aim of the department is to ensure the availability
and supply of water at national level. We also note that the department
promotes sustainable management of forests. The IFP welcomes the 2006
budget allocation of about R4,4 billion to the department.

Let me dwell a little on water. We are aware that the government is engaged
in giving poor households free basic water. The question is: At what speed
are we moving to reach all corners of the nine provinces?

It is a known fact that there are about 80 million South Africans who do
not have basic sanitation. Do we have any mechanism to close the gap? Can
we say that with the current Water Affairs budget the target date of 2010
to provide clean tap water and basic sanitation to all our people will be
reached?

It is vital that these basic services reach the rural areas and the areas
controlled by traditional leaders. Regarding forestry, what is the
government’s contingency plan to make sure that wood commodities are not
destroyed wholescale by drought and veld fires? These commodities play a
vital role in the daily lives of many rural communities.

We must also ask what role traditional leaders are playing in the black
economic empowerment deals that are being made with our forests. Are they
being sidelined, or will they also benefit? This is important, as benefits
should trickle down to the rural areas.

Kule mizuzwana esele, mangiphindele laphaya enkosazaneni. Uma ngithi
sizomkhumbula, ngiyakhumbula ukuthi konke lapho besihlangana khona naye uma
sithatha iPhalamende silisa kubantu, ubema ngezwi elilodwa athi akekho
umuntu oyovalelwa amanzi, amanzi ayimpilo. Ngakuvuma lokho kodwa-ke
mangisho ukuthi kusekhona omasipala abasawavala amanzi uma umuntu
engayikhokhelanga imisebenzi umasipala ayiletha kuye. Khona endaweni
engihlala kuyo sebebaningi abafikile kimi, ngaze ngaya kumasipala ngiyothi,
nazi izincwadi nizibhalile nithi nizovala amanzi, nebala seniwavalile.
Ngiyethemaba-ke ukuthi uzakwenu uma efika uyokuphakamela lokho, akunqande.

Siyakwazi ngegalelo lakho, naphambili-ke nkosazana, ushaye zephuke ngoba
nalapho phela usaya kwezimbiwayo. Ake sizibone nathi sihlomula thina
abampisholo, sizibone nathi singena ezimayini siyohlomula. Igolide leli
asingaliboni ngoba limbiwa nje kuphela, kodwa sifuna ukuliphatha
nangezandla, into esingazange-ke siyiphathe empilweni yethu.
Siyakuthokozela mama. Uma ufika kuleyo ndawo usikhumbule, ungasishiyi
ngemuva ufulathele.

Okumhlophe kodwa. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[In these few minutes that are left, let me go back and talk about Mrs
Sonjica. When I am saying we will miss her, I remember when we were
together, with Taking Parliament to the People. She was always saying one
thing: “No one will cut off the water of our people, water is health”. I
agreed with her on that, but let me say that there are still municipalities
that are cutting off the water if a person doesn’t pay for the services. In
the place where I am residing, there are a lot of people who come to me. I
went to the municipality to say here are the letters confirming that you
are going to cut off the water, and indeed you have cut it off. I hope that
our new colleagues will address that and stop it.

We know you in your role; do the same where you are going, as you are going
to join Minerals and Energy. We, the poor, also want to benefit and play a
role in mining. We don’t want to see gold only when it is dug, we want to
touch it with our hands, something that we have never touched in our lives.
Remember us, don’t turn your backs on us and leave us behind. All the best.
[Applause.]]

The HOUSE CHAIRPERSON (Mrs M N Oliphant): I just hope you are not asking
the Minister to give you gold, because that would be dangerous. [Laughter.]

Mr C JOHNSON (Salga): Hon Chairperson of the NCOP, hon Deputy Chairperson
in absentia, Minister of Water Affairs and hon members, Salga applauds the
Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, Ms Bulelwa Sonjica, on her budget
speech.

Let me also take the opportunity to wish you success in your recent
appointment to the Ministry of Minerals and Energy and welcome the hon
Minister Lindiwe Hendricks to this sector. Maybe the President has
something like the Minister of scarce resource management, in mind.

The legacy you have set is firmly entrenched and we need to build on the
past successes in order to address our challenges. That legacy you have
left behind is indeed delivering on time, delivering on budget and ensuring
satisfied citizens, especially on the delivery on water.

The provincial and national water summits have set an excellent basis to
proceed with meeting the presidential targets. Water is indeed an integral
part of life both to our citizens and the economy. In managing the
increasingly scarce resources, we must take into account the need to
address the past imbalances and stimulate the Asgisa programme in a
sustainable manner.

As municipalities, we say Asgisa starts here. Masibambane, the theme
adopted in your Budget Vote, signals the approach towards managing the
utilisation of a complex and scarce resource. Indeed we all need to work
together to realise our common goal set by President Mbeki.

The need to strengthen intergovernmental relations to give effect to the
Masibambane Programme is critical and we should establish a joint task team
to develop and strengthen these intergovernmental relations, especially
since water passes across municipal boundaries, river systems and
biospheres, which does mean that we have to work together as
municipalities.

Every single drop of effort counts in this regard. We have noted the
restructuring of the Water Services Transfer Programme. A number of
challenges have been identified in the joint meeting of all stakeholders
and this includes the transfer of staff and the finance to refurbish and
effectively operate and maintain the water schemes.

The financial framework should also include a tariff policy that ensures
the long-term sustainability of delivering water in the most effective and
efficient manner without eroding the financial viability of municipalities.

A key component of ensuring sustainability is the establishment of the
water catchment agencies. This is devolution of powers from national to
local and citizen-based agency and the national water resource
infrastructure agency.

The role of these institutions become more acute as current, long-term
weather forecasts predict increasing drought periods, thus recurring supply
and effective demand management is critical, especially in the context of a
growing economy and the right to water enshrined in our Constitution. Since
we are celebrating the 10 years of our Constitution, we have to assess
access to water and access to safe sanitation in this context.

Furthermore, the development of new technology such as desalination should
be advanced to ensure the security of the supply of clean, affordable
drinking water to rural communities.

The role of local government in ensuring that every household has clean and
safe drinking water as well as providing water to agriculture and the
industry for economic growth is paramount. Your commitment to support local
government in this endeavour is highly appreciated, noting our double-
decker bus of the economy - a first and second economy.

The steps taken by your department to support municipalities in this regard
is a step in the right direction, as I have said. The joint programme with
the Swiss government to build the capacity of municipalities, the Local
Government Capacity-building through Knowledge-sharing programme, is
valued.

The high levels of skills required to ensure safe drinking water, managing
and maintaining the infrastructure to reduce leaks, developing effective
demand management systems and maintaining a revenue stream that will
finance this requirement, is highly sought- after globally. We therefore
need to manage existing skills more effectively and rapidly develop new,
skilled people who will staff the 284 municipalities across the urban and
rural areas of our country.

Again, the question that is uppermost in Salga’s mind is: How do we address
the skills gaps given the current skills pool we have in the country?
Secondly, there is the question of how we develop the urgently needed water
engineers to sustain and manage our water resources in the next decade.
Minister, we appeal that we urgently set aside some time to assess the
current skills gaps, and develop a programme to provide these skills in a
sustainable manner.

The current level of poor sanitation is unacceptable. In addition, the poor
management of sanitation in some areas is contaminating the aquatic system
and poses great health risks. We all know that access to sanitation
restores human dignity. The President has challenged us to eradicate the
bucket system by 2007 but the question that we have is where the buckets
are located. If we have to base our data on 2001, this means that we have
to make a joint effort around the correct data to ensure that we have
enough money and that it is not based on 2001 data.

Co-ordinated national programmes with respect to fiscal capacity support
measures to meet the presidential targets are needed. The efforts by your
department to find appropriate technology to increase the effectiveness of
sanitation management are equally urgent and investigations in this regard
are appreciated.

The provision of water and sanitation given the inequalities of the past is
a difficult task. The need, as I have said, for joint stakeholders, as
indicated by Minister Sonjica in the budget speech to address the current
challenges, are in fact quintessential. More importantly, we need to
galvanise the will and the determination to make it work throughout the
length and breadth of our country and should be embarked upon.

The Minister outlined the national priorities and programmes and my appeal
is that we jointly get on with the task ahead without wasting time. We, as
the South African local government, support the Budget Vote on Water
Affairs and Forestry. I thank you.

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, let me also
firstly congratulate the Minister her new appointment and wish her
everything of the best. We in the select committee will surely miss her
leadership.

As we are going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the women’s march to
the Union Buildings later this year, we should remind ourselves that the
purpose of this historical march by these brave women was not only to
demonstrate their objection to the carrying of passes, but it was also a
fundamental protest to ensure a better life for everybody, which also
includes the access to clean water and sanitation. It is important that we
remind ourselves of how far we have come since 1994, when a massive backlog
existed in the provision of basic services in the country.

Out of a total population of just over 40 million, a total of
15,5 million people lack access to basic water supply and a total of 20,5
million people lack basic sanitation. The situation at the end of the 2004-
05 financial year was reduced to only 3,6 million without access to safe
water and approximately 16 million people without access to any hygienic
sanitation.

It is clear that the current ANC-led government keeps to its promises of
providing a better life for everybody.

Voorsitter, dit is in teenstelling met die DA, wat nie geglo kan  word  nie.
’n Duidelike bewys hiervoor kan gevind word gedurende die  aanloop  tot  die
pas  afgelope  plaaslike   verkiesing,   waartydens   die   DA   met   groot
trompetgeskal bekend gemaak het dat  hulle  geen  munisipale  bestuurder  of
senior personeellid sou afbetaal in die munisipaliteit waaroor hulle  beheer
sou verkry nie. Wat ons egter nou in Kaapstad en Stellenbosch  sien  gebeur,
is direk in teenstelling met hierdie belofte. Wat het  dan  nou  geword  van
die beginsel wat deur die DA tydens hul verkiesingsveldtogte  verkondig  is,
naamlik  dat  alle  persone  na  meriete  en  nie  na  politieke  affiliasie
beoordeel sal word nie? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, this is in contrast to the DA, which cannot be believed.
Clear evidence for this could be found during the run-up to the recent
local elections, during which the DA, with a big sound of trumpets, made it
known that they would not pay off any municipal manager or senior staff
member in any municipality of which they might get control. But what we see
now in Cape Town and in Stellenbosch is in direct contrast with this
promise. What has happened to the principle that the DA pronounced during
their election campaigns, namely that all people will be judged on merit
and not on political affiliation?]

Chairperson, I therefore submit that they cannot be trusted.

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: On a point of order, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order, Mr Van Rooyen. Hon Terblanche?

Ms J F TERBLANCHE: Chairperson, I just want to know whether it is correct
to speak out against the judgment made in one of the courts of our country,
because this is exactly what Mr van Rooyen has just done.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I didn’t hear the member speaking against the
judgment. There was nothing about that or the merits of that. The member is
contributing to the debate and nothing is out of order. Continue, hon
member.

Mr C J VAN ROOYEN: In 2003 the department adopted a new vision for
forestry, which brought forestry in alignment with the department’s overall
vision of promoting socioeconomic development, social justice and equity
through the sustainable use of the country’s forest and water resources.
The new vision puts people and their development at the heart of forestry.
It is interesting to note that forestry makes a major contribution to South
Africa’s economy. The formal commercial forestry sector contributes 2% of
annual GDP and accounts for 9% of agriculture output.
It also provides 4% of South Africa’s total annual export and contributes
R6 billion per annum to the country’s foreign exchange earnings. To
illustrate the job creation potential further, the commercial forests
industry directly employs about 120 000 people. The conservation and
related sector directly employs a further
250 000 people. In addition, an estimated 275 000 are involved in the
harvesting, processing and selling of non-timber products.

The trade in medicinal plants has an estimated annual value of R60 million.
Forestry also brings other benefits into people’s lives. The commercial
forest industry invests over R80 million per year in local roads, schools,
health clinics and other community-based initiatives.

During the briefing by the department on its 2006-07 budget it became clear
that an element of underbudgeting exists in the allocation through the MIG
for the provision of basic water supply and sanitation to local authorities
over the MTEF period. The projected shortfall is based on the targets for
dealing with the backlogs in the water supply and sanitation, as well as
the eradication of the bucket system.

Budget shortfalls were also further highlighted during the NCOP’s recent
visit to the Northern Cape, where it was reported that to eradicate
approximately 24 000 buckets by 2007, a sum of         R187 million will be
required. However, the combined MIG and the provincial infrastructure grant
for the period 2005-07 only amounts to R137 million, resulting in a
shortfall of R50 million. It is therefore clear that the set targets in
this case will not be met. This is a matter of planning, which requires
urgent attention.

In the Free State, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry has been
able to halve the backlog on basic water supply during the last ten years,
from an initial 15% of the population in 1994 down to 8% of the population
in 2005.

On the sanitation backlog, the Free State department was able to reduce the
backlog by 30% over a period of 10 years. Chairperson, you will agree that
this is a remarkable achievement and the department should be
congratulated.

Currently the Bloem Water Board is in the process of developing plans for
alleviating the water supply problems in the towns of Jagersfontein and
Fauresmith in the southern Free State. These towns have experienced water-
related problems over the last few years. The project will be in excess of
R150 million and will improve the water supply in this poor rural area.
What is of concern, however, is the fact that 4 out of 10 current board
members of the Bloem Water Board, including the chairperson, do not reside
in the area of service. The questions that do arise are: do these
nonresident board members know the specific needs of their area effectively
to prioritise on their behalf? Do their priorities coincide with those of
the inhabitants of the region? Surely this situation cannot be correct and
therefore needs to be looked at again.

The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry deserves our gratitude for the
way in which they are working towards delivering on their promise of access
to clean water and sanitation for everybody. They deserve our support and
also our assistance, such as with strategic planning to enable them to
obtain their intended targets. We have indeed entered a season of hope and
the people can be assured that the ANC will deliver on its promise for a
better life for all. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Chairperson, I just want to
make a comment on Mr Krumbock’s speech. It is a recycled product. I heard
that same story in the National Assembly. That’s how uncreative the DA is.
[Interjections.]

I responded to the issues. It looks as if the hon member did not even
listen to or consult with other members from his party. There are many
issues that you could raise on water and forestry; you don’t need to
recycle what was said in the National Assembly.

On the Komatiland issue that you are raising, we did make available 40 000
logs and we followed the necessary procurement procedures. We were
transparent. All of those principles brought about by this government were
not known before 1994, and we are very committed to ensuring that we
implement our own policy.

With regard to Safcol procurement processes, your queries could be directed
to the Department of Public Enterprises. They are the ones who have
responsibility over Safcol.

About Bushbuckridge, we are intervening continuously with regard to the
water boards and the problems that they are encountering. We have just
appointed a new board which is the legal body that would advise the
Minister to act in one way or another when there are problems at any water
board.

Problems that we need to appreciate are that you may be driving to a point
where we disestablish the board. We cannot disestablish in the absence of a
service provider that would assist in terms of service delivery in that
particular area. So, you have to find a way of ensuring that all the
problems encountered by Bushbuckridge are attended to, rather than looking
at the quick answer of disestablishing.

So, it is a work in progress. We are on top of the issue. Yes, we agree
that there are problems, but they are problems that are being attended to.

In terms of Hartebeest, a task team was established. It includes the
Department of Water Affairs, Environmental Affairs, the private sector,
Rand Water and the province. The report is available, hon member. We can
make it available to you. We apologise. It is difficult to put in
everything here.

On the question of skills, we have entered into an agreement with Tswane
University of Technology, UCT, the University of the Western Cape, the
University of Pretoria and of KwaZulu-Natal. They are going to train our
engineers and technicians. That adds on to what I said about Cuba and the
offer that we get from them.

On the pollution of dams by sewage, I would rather say it is the pollution
of the rivers instead of the pollution of the dams. I am going to recycle
as well now. In the National Assembly, members pledged to adopt a river. I
adopted the Seekoei, which means therefore that you will be responsible for
monitoring that people are not polluting the river. If you need assistance,
you come to Water Affairs and we will gladly assist you.

So, that’s one way in which we can also reduce the rate of pollution of our
rivers. But, as already said, with regard to the Hartebeest, there is a
report available. You would be able to get a copy. Whoever needs a copy can
contact my department. We can make it available by tomorrow.

On the question of capacity, there is intervention from the Accelerated and
Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa that is looking at all the
blockages and problems that are not making it easy for municipalities to
deliver, and it is under the leadership of the Deputy President. We are
looking at capacity and funding, and National Treasury is involved and has
committed itself to making funds available when they are needed.

So, again, there is something happening. About the pollution by sewage
water, we are working with municipalities. We are also giving them some
money to develop their own capacity. The European Union also gave us money.
So, we are using that money to make sure that municipalities have capacity
to manage these things on their own. Eli xesha liyakhawuleza. [Time is
moving fast.]

Regarding the question by hon Goldberg, I think the context is maybe
conveniently being ignored, because the context within which the issue was
raised was in relation to the legacy of apartheid. I think it is on record
and it is our history that clean, potable water was a priority for the
white people in this country; that is a fact of life before 1994. It is a
fact of life and there is evidence of that.

So, I don’t know why must we cry to such an extent because it is a fact of
life. It is there; it is our history. So, this is the reference that is
being made. It was making reference to the legacy of apartheid. It is
unfortunate that some people are reacting in the manner in which they are
reacting.

But I do indeed want us to deracialise the debate of water and unite behind
the programme of this government that ensures that all our people get a
better life through the delivery of basic services. We owe it to all those
people who died for this democratic government. On the question of Lepele,
Phalaborwa needs to pass on to them what they collect from water. So, the
local municipality owes the water board about R80 million. So, this is the
issue and not all of those issues that the hon member raised.

I do want to take this opportunity to thank each and every participant. My
papers are all over. It looks like I am leaving other issues unanswered,
but because of the time allocations, it is very difficult to respond to
everything.

Thank you very much for participating in the debate and for your support,
although I don’t know whether the DA said they supported or do not. It
would be typical of them if they did not support this debate. They have
never been committed to the plight of the poor. It is about politics and
getting political mileage, and not sincerely seeing our people getting out
of poverty. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I thank you, hon Minister. That concludes the
debate on this Vote.

Just before I go on to another Order, on behalf of the Council, Minister,
thank you very much for the work you have done in this current portfolio.
We wish you all the best in the new portfolio you have been promoted to.

The Council will work together with you, with all the oversight function
work that we will be doing, to assist your department to achieve its
objectives. So, we wish you the best, and I hope you will support the
Council as you used to support when you were the Minister of Water Affairs.
We want to thank you very much. [Applause.]

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
    ENTERPRISES - FINAL ACTS OF PLENIPOTENTIARY CONFERENCE IN MARRAKESH,
          MOROCCO IN 2002 OF INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNION

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon members, the final acts of the
Plenipotentiary Conference of Marrakesh are also referred to as the
instruments amending the Constitution and Convention of the International
Telecommunications Union, as amended by the Plenipotentiary Conference in
Kyoto in 1994, and the Plenipotentiary Conference in Minneapolis in 1998.

Noting that the Constitution and Convention of the International
Telecommunications Union signed on 22 December 1992 in Geneva has treaty
status, we also note the critical importance of the work of the
International Telecommunications Union in building and shaping tomorrow’s
networks and services; setting standards that facilitate seamless
interworking of equipment and system on a global basis; adopting
operational procedures for the vast and growing array of wireless services
and designing programmes to improve telecommunications and infrastructure
in the developing world. The International Telecommunications Union’s work
has enabled telecommunications to grow into a one trillion US dollar
industry worldwide.

We furthermore note that since 1994 South Africa has participated actively
in the work of the International Telecommunications Union when South Africa
was elected as a member of the executive council. Since its readmission to
the ITU, South Africa hosted the ITU Africa Telecom in 1998 and Africa
Telecom 2001 regional conferences, where leading representatives from the
ICT sector focused on the communications challenges facing Africa in
building the information society.

South Africa also chaired the working group on ITU reform established by
the ITU council in line with Resolution 74 of the Minneapolis
Plenipotentiary of 1998.

Membership of the International Telecommunications Union is open to
governments, which may join the union as member states. In addition, a
special category was established for private sector organisations, funding
bodies, research and development organisations, international and regional
telecommunication organisations, which can join the ITU as sector members.

The following South African state-owned enterprises and private sector
organisations are sector members of the International Telecommunications
Union. They are: Vodacom, MTN, Orbicom, Sentech, Telkom, Transtel and Cell
C. The final acts of Marrakesh contain the articles, declaration and
reservations, general rules of conferences, assemblies and meetings of the
union, decisions, resolutions and recommendations of the plenipotentiary
conference, and the articles of the final acts address the functioning of
the union and includes matters such as elections, members of the radio
regulation report, the executive council, the radio communication
standardisation development sectors, as well as credentials and admission
to the plenipotentiary conferences.

Declarations and reservations are made at the end of plenipotentiary
conferences and state that plenipotentiaries that sign the final acts
confirm that they have taken note of the declarations and reservations made
by various countries at the end of the plenipotentiary conferences.

The general provision regarding conferences and assemblies includes issues
ranging from invitations to radio communication conferences, time limits
and conditions for submission of proposals and reports to conferences to
matters relating to relations with the press and the public, franking
privileges and procedures for voting. Decisions, resolutions and
recommendations of the conference are made at the conferences by member
states.

A key part of the plenipotentiary conference is to endorse strategic
direction of the three sectors of the ITU through which most of the work of
the ITU is undertaken. These sectors are radio communication, ITUR;
telecommunications standardisation, ITUT; and telecommunication
development, ITUD. Each of the ITU sectors works through conferences and
meetings where agreements are negotiated to facilitate the operation of
global telecommunication services. Of these, only the decisions of the
World Radiocommunication Conference from an international binding agreement
would require a separate ratification by Parliament.

The final acts also set the membership fees. Member states account for
66,1% of the overall budget of the sector members. We’re asking the House
to ratify this. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I shall now put the question in respect of the
second Order. The question is that the report be adopted. As the decision
is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I need to
ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast
their provinces’ votes. Are all delegation heads present? Yes.

I shall now allow provinces the opportunity to make their declaration in
terms of Rule 71, if they so wish. Is there any province wishing to make
any declaration of vote? There is obviously none.

We shall now proceed to voting on the question. I shall do this in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to
the Chair whether they vote in favour of or against or abstain from voting.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SERVICES -
  CONVENTION FOR UNIFICATION OF CERTAIN RULES FOR INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE BY
                                     AIR


Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairperson, members, colleagues and comrades, the Carriage
by Air Act, Act 17 of 1946, was promulgated to give effect to the
Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International
Carriage by Air, signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929, also known as the
Warsaw Convention. The Warsaw Convention was subsequently amended by the
Haiti Protocol of 1955, the Guatemala City Protocol of 1971 and Montreal
Protocol 14 of 1975. These international instruments of law are jointly
referred to as the Warsaw system.

The high mobility of passengers and the globalisation of the air transport
industry have resulted in the high level of complexity and fragmentation of
the Warsaw system. The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for
International Carriage by Air of 1999, aimed at modernising the Warsaw
system, was adopted at a diplomatic conference of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation in 1999.

The Republic of South Africa is a signatory to the Montreal Convention. The
Montreal Convention of 1999, modernised and consolidated, has changed the
70-year-old system of international instruments of private international
law into one legal instrument that provides an adequate level.

Chairperson, the Montreal Convention of 1999 provides for better protection
to victims of international air accidents as adequate levels of
compensation is provided. The Warsaw Convention had set a very low
compensation level for victims of air accidents as well as liability for
damage, delay or loss of baggage and cargo in accidents. It introduces the
concept of unlimited liability in case of death or injury to passengers.

The Montreal Convention introduces a two-year system where the first year
includes liability up to 100 000 Special Drawing Rights. Irrespective of a
carrier’s fall, the second year is based on the presumption of fault of a
carrier and has no limit of liability.

In cases of aircraft accidents, air carriers are called upon to provide
advanced payments without delay to assist indebted persons in meeting
immediate economic needs. Air carriers must submit proof of insurance,
thereby ensuring the availability of financial resources in cases of
automatic payments or litigation. Legal action or damage resulting from
death or injury of a passenger may be filed at the permanent place of
residence of the passenger subject to the conditions. There is facilitation
in the recovery of damages without the need for lengthy litigation, and
simplification and modernisation of documentation relating to passengers
baggage and cargo.

Chairperson, the Select Committee on Public Services having considered the
request for approval by Parliament of the convention, recommends that the
Council, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution approve the said
convention. I thank you.

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I shall now put the
question and the question is that the report be adopted. As the decision is
dealt with in terms of section 65 of the constitution, I shall first
ascertain whether the delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast
their provinces’ vote. Are you all present? Yes. In terms of the Rule 71, I
will then allow those provinces that want to make a declaration of vote to
do so if they so wish. Is there any province that wishes to do so? None. We
shall go to the voting. I shall do so in alphabetical order and the
provinces’ heads of delegations will have to indicate to the Chair whether
they vote in favour, against or abstain. Eastern Cape?
