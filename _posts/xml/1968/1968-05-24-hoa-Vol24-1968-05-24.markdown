<speech by="#grobler">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to bore the Committee by dealing with matters pertaining to my constituency. I have already discussed these with the hon. the Deputy Minister and shall discuss them further. In these few minutes I should like to submit a few thoughts in regard to our country&#x2019;s water position, water requirements, and suggestions in that regard, to the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>As point of departure I want to use the fitting slogan of the Festival of the Soil, i.e. &#x201C;Soil is Life&#x201D;. I just want to elaborate slightly on this and state that soil with water is life, soil without water is dead, dry, useless and lifeless. &#x201C;Next to air, man needs water more than anything else&#x201D;, are the words in which Charles Schroth, science correspondent to the 80 nations conference on water in America, strikingly defined this truth. On one occasion Professor Midgley of the University of the Witwatersrand said that 600 gallons of water was needed to produce enough food for one person for one day. He also calculated that by the year 2000. when the population of South Africa would have reached a total of approximately 40 million, 6,000 million gallons of water per day would be necessary for their daily requirements. It is clear therefore that available water supplies will have to be developed in such a way that these will be able to keep pace with the population growth and the general economic and industrial demands which will in future be made on our water supplies. It is also calculated that South Africa&#x2019;s water consumption increases twofold every 30 years. The following questions occur to one. Firstly, what are the water sources of our country; secondly, does South Africa have adequate water sources; and thirdly, what can be done to protect, develop and possibly supplement the existing water supplies?</p>

<p>My lay opinion is that basically we have only two sources. These are rain-water falling from the clouds, and secondly, subterranean water, namely dolomitic and fossil water out of the ground. The average rainfall in South Africa is 18.7 inches per year, of which 8.6 inches reaches our rivers, and by this means an average river flow of 31,000 million gallons of water per day becomes available. Approximately 2 per cent of the rain-water penetrates to our subterranean sources and represents 40,000 million gallons of water. Altogether, this amounts to a total of 35,000 million gallons of water available per day for South Africa, if these figures calculated by Mr. Stander of the C.S.I.R. are correct, and I take it that they are. Of this amount 12,000 million gallons per day is capable of distribution for agricultural, urban and industrial purposes, but up to the present only 50 per cent of that total is being effectively utilized in South Africa. These figures furnish the reply to the second question, i.e. whether we have sufficient water. I think that this will take us a long way, provided the hon. the Deputy Minister and his advisers can succeed in formulating a very <span class="col_5899-5900" refersTo="page_0154"/>realistic water plan and carrying it out in practice. To do so what will be necessary in the first place is that a South African nation which has been made water conscious will have to make millions more rands available to the Department of Water Affairs, and secondly, that the manpower position will have to be evaluated and drastically expanded so that the Minister will, by means of adequate clerical staff, engineers, technicians, hydrologists, etc., have an efficient, dynamic and streamlined organization at his disposal to implement his policy and his plans in regard to water. To expedite this essential staff supplementation, the Minister must spare no expense or trouble. He must, by means of attractive bursaries and realistic salary scales and conditions of service, draw young men to the Department of Water Affairs. I know he is dealing with this matter, and I hope that the Government, in particular by making funds more readily available, and universities will, in regard to the recruitment of students and our young people as well, react favourably to bis attempt. I wish him every success.</p>

<p>But there is still a wide field lying fallow for intensive study and research in regard to our water problems in South Africa. What I have in mind is the division of our country into water development regions, which will require intensive advance study, and additional staff. One thinks of the subterranean mineral salt waters in the North Western Cape, South West Africa, and particularly of the Free State gold fields where 50 million to 60 million gallons of water which can be purified, are daily going to waste. One thinks of the purification and re-use of sewerage and industrial water. One thinks of further research into the restriction of the high evaporation rate of our water which has already been stored. These are only a few of the fields which are lying fallow. Personally I am particularly interested in an intensive study and research into our diminishing water table, with our diminishing supplies of subterranean fossil water, and a way of protecting and possibly of. supplementing this. I am also particularly interested in the character and nature of our wonderful subterranean rivers. The question arises as to whether subterranean rivers really exist in our country, and if they do in fact exist, whether they should be protected, and how they can be utilized to the service of the population. Are the Malamane and the Malopo Rivers in the Western Transvaal and Northern Cape really subterranean rivers?</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to ask the Minister to give attention to the storage of water underground. In this regard I find myself in the good company of Mr. G. J. Stander of the C.S.I.R. He states in &#x201C;Handhaaf&#x201D; of April 1967 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subterranean storage of water is probably one of the most efficient and most I economic techniques with which to combat evaporational losses which in many regions exceed the rainfall. In America an intensive inquiry in this regard has been set in motion &#x2026;</block>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to avail myself of the opportunity of bringing a matter, which is of major importance to my constituency as well as to the constituency of the hon. member for Kuruman, to the attention of the Minister. This matter relates to the circumstances in which a small group of farmers on the Hartz River have found themselves. The Deputy Minister is aware of this; he has already paid a personal visit to that region. I want to tell him straight away that the farmers in that vicinity appreciate it very much that he went there, so soon after he was appointed, in order to acquaint himself personally with the circumstances in which that small group of farmers had found themselves. The farms of these farmers are situated along the Hartz River. Each year at some time or other the Hartz River comes down in flood. There is sufficient water to fill a dam. Since the completion of the Vaal Hartz settlement scheme, there has always been a certain amount of water flowing down from that scheme, on which the farmers during the course of years came to rely, and they pumped up that water and established farming activities below those pumps. But recently, it has happened that the water supply and the flow steadily diminished, and each time these people were faced with the problem of having no water to pump, and consequently they had to watch their crops shrivelling up. From time to time in the past water has been kindly allowed to flow out of the Vaal River via the Vaal Hartz canal into the Hartz River with the result that they could pump again. Years ago a survey was made for the so-called Spitzkop Dam. Everybody felt that when that dam was established then that dam would, each year when the river was in flood, have enough water to meet the requirements of the farmers. There has been a long delay with the construction of that dam and we are overjoyed to see that the construction of that dam has now been placed on the building programme and that the intended dam will now at last become a reality. We would like to convey the sincere thanks and appreciation of that community to the Minister for this step forward. We should like to plead for two things: In the first place, that the construction of that dam should be expedited; that there should be no delay. In the second place, we want to plead that until such time as that dam is being built, if there are times when there is not adequate water in the Hartz River&#x2014;-in the dry periods&#x2014;the Minister and his Department should keep a merciful eye on those people and, until such time as the dam has been completed, allow water to be sent down to them out of the Vaal River so that they can carry on with their <span class="col_5901-5902" refersTo="page_0155"/>farming. If this does not happen and there should be a few dry years, then nothing will remain of those people&#x2019;s farms. We know very well that it is regarded as technically wrong to take water out of one river and lead it into another, but this has been done in the past, and our plea is that only until such time as the dam has been constructed, this procedure should be followed. We believe that the Minister will lend a sympathetic ear to our request.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when the debate was adjourned on Wednesday night, I was focusing attention on the question of the seriousness of soil erosion along certain of our river systems in the dry areas of the Republic. Sir, I do not wish to follow on the hon. member for Kimberley (South) who dealt with a problem in his own constituency, but I would like to say a word or two about the remarks of the hon. member for Marico, who focused attention on an extremely important matter in respect of the water resources of the Republic. The hon. member drew attention to the depletion which is taking place in our underground water supplies. I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s predecessor and he himself have often focused attention on this important feature in our country, and in the course of my speech I propose to try to show how we can approach this matter and plan to augment the supply of our underground water in the Republic. I want to make a special plea to the Deputy Minister of Water Affairs that in considering the over-all water problems in the Republic, the river systems which flow through our country be planned as whole units; that they be tackled at the upper reaches in the mountain ranges and that they be planned along their entire route to the sea. I believe that any other approach will be patchwork planning which will not have the desired effect. I visualize that if this problem is tackled properly we will establish authorities such as the Sundays River Water Conservation and Utilization Plan; we would have the Fish River Water Conservation and Utilization Plan that takes into account the whole of those particular river systems. You see, Sir, many of our rivers on their course to the sea flow not only across farm boundaries but district boundaries and in many cases provincial boundaries, and as the policy of this Government is implemented many of our rivers will also flow through international boundaries. In the course of time this may present problems, and therefore I think it is essential that in considering our rivers we must consider them as whole units from their very start to where they eventually flow out into the sea. Sir, each river obviously is going to have its own peculiar problems. For instance, in Natal where you have permanent flowing streams, the question of afforestation or no afforestation in the upper reaches is a matter that must receive serious consideration. The pollution of the water in those rivers as they flow through industrial areas is another problem. The question of the control of bilharzia in those particular rivers where the water flows more slowly is a very serious problem. Then there is the question of the establishment of health resorts, and in the case of permanent flowing streams there is also the question of the apportionment of water between agricultural needs and industrial needs. Sir, I do not want to speak so much about those river systems because I know very little about it.</p>

<p>I want to focus attention on the river systems in the dry areas which are so often subjected to periodic and devastating floods. Sir, these rivers traverse what are known as vast flood plains. Hon. members who represent rural constituencies in the platteland will know that these rivers traverse what we call in Afrikaans the &#x201C;vlei&#x201D; lands of the platteland. These vleis represent some of our most valuable grazing ground. These vleis constitute many thousands of morgen. These vlei lands are the sponges which, before soil erosion set in, absorbed many millions of gallons of water annually, and they were the sources that replenished the underground waters of the interior. But unfortunately these vlei lands have been desecrated; soil erosion has taken place, and these vlei lands are now merely skeletons of their former verdant state. My plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister is that in looking into this problem he should seriously consider looking at our river systems as one whole unit, so that in the recovery of these vleis, the job can be systematically tackled, starting at the very start of these rivers and their early tributaries and then working down. I believe that in this country at the present time there is far too much patchwork in this respect, and I think a great deal can be done if a unit is planned much in the same way as the hon. the Deputy Minister is now doing in the upper reaches of the Orange River where they have appointed an authority to deal with the problem of soil erosion in the rivers which flow into the Orange River above the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam. You see, Sir, there are certain conflicting interests to-day in our Water Act and our Soil Conservation Act. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to the fact that my farm is situated perhaps some 150 miles away from Lake Menz, which is a big State work on the Sundays River. Because that dam must be replenished with water, certain restrictions are placed on my property, restrictions which are not in the best interests of soil conservation. There are obviously certain conflicting interests between these two Acts, and it makes me think that we are fast approaching the point where the interests of soil conservation and the interests of water conservation are so closely allied that it is almost impossible to separate the two. It seems to me that a merging of these two Departments. the Department of Water Affairs and the Department of Soil Conservation is something which we might contemplate in the future, if we wish to get our planning on a sound footing. Sir, it is impossible to deal with this subject, which is a very big one, within the sort space of ten minutes. I hope to be able on a later occasion to discuss this proposition <span class="col_5903-5904" refersTo="page_0156"/>which I have put up with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Water Affairs, but I do make a strong appeal this morning that this matter receive the very serious attention of his Department. I feel very strongly that one of the most serious developments in our country is this denudation of our erstwhile vleis. I believe, as the hon. member for Marico has said, that the best place to conserve our water is not on the surface but underground where you get the best storage. If we are not going to tackle this problem seriously, then in the future we will find that our underground water supplies will be depleted to such an extent that many of our Karoo farms will go out of production for the simple reason that there is not sufficient water available to provide water for the stock during the dry season.</p>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not follow up what the previous speaker said. He mentioned very important and cardinal points. As the representative of a constituency where water plays a very important role, where I have dealings with 18 irrigation boards and where an average of more than one million morgen feet of water runs down to the sea each year, and where, in the past, very little real water conservation has taken place on a large scale, I want in the first place to address a special word of gratitude to the Department of Water Affairs for having been able under such difficult circumstances to do so much in these areas as far as irrigation is concerned, particularly for the irrigation boards. Many problems still remain to be solved, but I hope, and I know that with the co-operation of the Deputy Minister, who has tackled his new task with such dedication, we can look forward to a period in which the Department is going to take even more vital steps than it has in the past.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why special attention has, during the past few years, been given to water in this country, and why we have had such a lot to say about and have devoted so much thought to water. The first is rhe drought, which fortunately came to an end last year throughout most of the Republic. A second important factor is the industrial development and the general development in the country since we became a Republic. This development, apart from the drought, has made new demands on our water resources, and this has also, in particular, been emphasized by Act 54 of 1956, in terms of which the control of water was placed in the hands of the State. I do not think we all realized what the implications of that legislation were to be and what a tremendous burden would be placed on the Department of Water Affairs as a result. That is why I now want to express a few ideas in regard to this Department. Some hon. members, such as the hon. member for Piketberg, for example, have already expressed the opinion that this Department ought to be strengthened. I want to associate myself with these representations. Let us look at the annual report of this Department, and we shall see how much work they are doing &#x2014;research, planning, construction, in addition to the major burden of administration of legislation, since the principle has been laid down that the State must control our water. In this regard considerable difficulty is being experienced as a result of the fact that we have done away with the principle of riparian rights, and by placing the general control over water in the hands of the State. It is the duty of the Department to see to it that this control is applied both efficiently and justly. That is why it is gratifying to see that the Department, in spite of all its activities, still finds an opportunity of undertaking research, <i>inter alia,</i> into methods of stimulating rain. This is something which I particularly welcome. I think all of us would agree when I state that the stimulation of rain can be of great value to us. I read recently that Russian scientists had progressed so far that they were able to establish, by means of radar, precisely where in the clouds hail was formed, so that effective steps could be taken against it. This is a matter which offers us great scope. We are spending millions of rands on storing water, and we are still saddled with the problem of periods in which the rainfall is low, and what our future potential is going to be depends to a large measure upon how these periods of low rainfall are going to be bridged. I foresee that methods of stimulating rain are going to be of great value to us in this respect. Here in the vicinity of Cape Town there is even now a dispute about the consumption of water, among the farmers, the industrialists and the urban-dwellers. If we can therefore cause artificial precipitation on a significant scale, we can to a large extent solve the problem.</p>

<p>A few other aspects remain to which attention must be given. One of these is when existing irrigation areas suffer hardships in times of drought, and experience shortages. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister, since we are busy with so many new developments, not to neglect these areas. In point of fact they should receive preference in the planning of our water sources. It does not make any sense to me to spend large amounts on the development of new irrigation areas while existing irrigation areas do not yet have a regular supply of waiter. I feel that we must plan on a regional basis. I am aware that this will require large sums of money. We already have this here in the Western Cape, but then we are also confronted with the problem of administration and control, because there will be pipelines through which farmers, factories and urban dwellers will have to be supplied with water. I wonder therefore whether the hon. the Deputy Minister could not perhaps throw a little light on these problems.</p>

<p>As regards irrigation boards and farmers, I would like to suggest that attention should be given to the revision of section 162 of the Act, the section relating to subsidies. I feel <span class="col_5905-5906" refersTo="page_0157"/>that the cheaper schemes have to a large extent been completed, and that we are now facing the task of laying out more expensive schemes. In this way the burden on irrigation will become considerably heavier. But investment in water is the best investment one can make in this country. The costs are high, and that is why it is necessary that we should give our attention to this aspect, namely increased subsidies.</p>

<p>Various hon. members pleaded for the protection of our catchment areas. I want to associate myself with their representations. However, I would like to point out that in accordance with section 58 the Minister can declare areas to be catchment areas, over which control can subsequently be exercised. I want to make an appeal to the hon. Minister to apply section 59 to a greater extent. If there appear to be loopholes, then we can, in due course, eliminate these.</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to refer to briefly, is a matter which was also touched upon by the hon. member for Gordonia when he referred to the lower reaches of the Orange River. What he wanted to know was where and how water should be used. What he wanted to know in particular was where water should be used, whereas what I want to know is how water should be used. We do not have an abundance of water. On the contrary, our supplies are limited. This entails that the State will have to choose the land to which water can be laid on in order to prevent salination. The State will also have to determine according to which method the water will have to be applied. The method of flood irrigation, for example, is obsolete. We cannot allow over-irrigation to take place on land with a high salt content, and that those salts should subsequently make the water lower down to a large extent useless. We have already had the case of the Hartebeespoort Dam where, in times of major drought when there was little water in the dam, the chlorine content was so high that it constituted a threat for the farmers lower down, who were entirely dependent upon that water. When tobacco, for example, is irrigated with this water, the chlorine content of the tobacco leaves becomes so high that it is not acceptable to the manufacturers of cigarettes and tobacco. This is only one of many complications.</p>

<p>It is the task of the Department to pay attention to all these matters. That is why I want to emphasize again what I said at the beginning, that it is very important that the technical staff as well as the administrative staff of the Department of Water Affairs should be expanded in order to carry out the tremendous task which has been entrusted to it in an efficient way.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>During Wednesday&#x2019;s debate I made mention of the overlapping of Departments, something which has been emphasized again to-day by certain hon. members who took part in the debate so far. It is this point which I want to follow up for the moment, and I hope the hon. member for Nelspruit will, therefore, excuse me for not following his line of thought. I want to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that in view of this overlapping which is taking place the Government should now seriously consider whether or not to estabish an institute for water affairs so as to be able to deal adequately with this kind of thing which is taking place. The hon. member for Walmer pointed out that the interests of water conservation and soil conservation were inextricably interwoven. The other day I pointed out that we had a Department of Agricultural Technical Services, a Department for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, and a Department of Water Affairs. All these Departments are dealing with kindred matters, matters which should as a matter of right be dealt with as one portfolio. But that is not all. Other Ministers are interested as well.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. He has an enormous interest in Water Affairs. Then there is the Minister of Forestry, who also has an enormous interest in Water Affairs. As a matter of fact, his activities impinge and sometimes completely overlap with those of the Department of Water Affairs. Wherever in our mountains they lay on plantations or keep the veld in its natural condition, they do so with the avowed intention of preserving our water resources. That is the reason why the Forestry Department does it. In the Forestry Act provision is made specifically for that purpose. But it is the function of the Department of Water Affairs to care for our water resources. Similarly, we have to-day another Minister, namely the Minister of Planning. So, the Minister of Water Affairs and of Agriculture, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture the Deputy Minister of Water Affairs, the Minister of Forestry, the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development are all vitally interested in this one matter. How do we now deal with the question of Water Affairs in South Africa?</p>

<p>I submit again, and I suggest, the Government should consider the establishment of an Institute of Water Affairs for South Africa. Even the Minister of Planning cannot handle these matters adequately. Unfortunately, he is not here to-day. I am not suggesting that there is a good reason why he should be here. He is probably engaged on some official business. I am not reproaching him, but I simply say that I have discussed with him certain aspects of planning, and it is quite clear that there are aspects of this matter which fall entirely outside of his influence and ability to condition events. We know what is taking place with regard to desalination, the movement of underground waters, pollution, which involves the retreatment of effluent from our major cities, with the view not only to the re-use of the water, but to the use of the solids which originate as a result of the purification <span class="col_5907-5908" refersTo="page_0158"/>of the effluent, so that we can return organic elements to our fields and our lands; those matters are all part and parcel of the big problem.</p>

<p>I was very interested to listen to the S.A.B.C. broadcast this morning. I am not usually so interested in listening, but I was this morning, to the 8 o&#x2019;clock news. Because on Wednesday, in speaking in this House on this very Vote, I referred to the position in regard to the Indus waters between Pakistan and India, and the Nile, with regard to Uganda, Egypt and the Sudan. Over the news this morning a statement by the Government of Uganda was actually broadcast, that apropos their quarrel with the Sudan, they did not intend to pollute the water of the Nile, which leaves them to go down into the Sudan, unless they were compelled to do so.</p>

<p>Here I had a witness out of the blue, within two days of me making the statement here on Wednesday. Because of the danger of international conflict arising from the use of international water, it is one of the most x dangerous facets to-day, because all over the continent of Africa, at any rate, and in India, water is becoming that key resource on which the whole of our future development will depend, and with it our future population. In the case of the Indus, the population to-day in the valley of the river is limited by the amount of water that is available. Something has to be done with the surplus population. It cannot just go on increasing. It reminds me of the time when I first saw the Ganges. I was looking forward, after what I had read in my school books in my early school days, to seeing a wonderful great river. I found a little river that was not as wide as this chamber. But when I went 500 or 600 miles further up towards the mountains, I found the Ganges was nearly half a mile wide. That water is all taken out on its way to the sea. Where it is running into the sea, it is a little stream, as I say, about as wide as this chamber. The water is simply being taken out in such vast quantities that they have nearly reached the end of it.</p>

<p>This is the point I made the other day, namely the question of our rivers that run through the Bantu areas, areas which will be Bantustans. Let us read the lesson of the Nile, going from Uganda through foreign countries, the Sudan and Egypt. When an international row flares up between two countries, one actually has the Government of a country like Uganda to-day publicizing to the world: &#x201C;We will not pollute the water of this river that is going into that other country, unless they force us to do so.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, just think of the implications of that kind of thing. I say quite frankly that I do not believe it is fair to our Department of Water Affairs to have to handle all the manifold facets of this vital question, and that an Institute of Water Affairs for South Africa should be established which for preference should be very closely under the hand of the Prime Minister&#x2014;it warrants it because of its importance&#x2014;so that major developments that are taking place shall be brought continually before his notice. One can easily make a tenminute speech to-day in regard to pollution and the re-use of water. One can easily make a ten-minute speech in regard to the desalination of water. Some of the more recent developments in that regard are really quite revolutionary.</p>

<p>But they are as nothing when compared to the future developments and the technical advances which will be made in regard to desalination and the clarification and purification of effluent, over the next ten, 15 or 20 years. This development will simply leave completely in the shade what has been developed up to now. And what is ten or 20 years in the life of a nation? This is just to-morrow I am talking about. It will be commonplace. But how are we to keep up with it? Are we to put the whole of this burden on the Department of Water Affairs? We have seen the development in regard to the Orange River and the enormous cost that is arising. We are now at the first stage in regard to the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam.</p>

<p>The last estimate that we have heard, was up to R240 million. This Department has to handle the lot. They have to check all the figures and go through the whole matter, to see whether we are getting value for our money, when we start talking in terms of money like that. We discuss from time to time here matters of R20,000 or R30,000. This is not only a question of money. It is not a question of R240 million. R240 million is one small facet of a huge problem that we have. I would ask the Deputy Minister to take this to his Minister, and if necessary, to the Cabinet to get the Prime Minister to establish an Institute of Water Affairs, to have the matter closely under his hand and to bring every facet of water conservation under the direct control of the Head of the State.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. F. SWANEPOEL</person>:</from>

<p>Since there are many hon. members on this side of the House who would still like a turn to speak, and our time is almost up, I want to be very brief. In the last part of my speech I would just like to address a request to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Water Affairs. Quickly, then, I also want to associate myself with all the congratulations and good wishes which have deservedly been conveyed to him. I should like to address a personal word of thanks to him for the concession of additional water at the end of our water year at Vaal Hartz, namely during March of last year. I want to say that this is no exception; we receive it every year. But it is nevertheless necessary to ask for it, and the Minister must append his approval to it. This time the Minister once again saw his way clear to doing this for us. On behalf of my constituency in Vaal Hartz I want to convey to him a special word of thanks for this concession.</p>

<p><span class="col_5909-5910" refersTo="page_0159"/>But this brings me to the point which was also made by the hon. member for Winburg, namely that our water concessions on these schemes are inadequate. That is why additional water has to be purchased at the end of each water year. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Nelspruit said, i.e. that we must know how to use the water. It amounts to this: When the water is used and the water year is coming to an end, one&#x2019;s crop is almost 90 per cent fully grown, and then there is no water. If one cannot obtain that additional water, one loses all the benefits of the water which has been used to cultivate the crop to that extent of 90 per cent. That is why I say we must know how to use that water. Now I am not going to ask for increased scheduling, because I know that that will not be granted to us, but I want to tell the Minister that although he concedes this water to us each year after the water year has almost elapsed and the water quota is used up, a &#x201C;deterrent&#x201D; is being applied. The water is made so expensive that almost nobody is able to purchase it. With the first purchase of a few inches it is made twice as expensive as the last purchase. The second purchase is three times and the third purchase four times the original price. I think that that discouraging measure, which is being applied at all schemes, is quite adequate. But the question which is hampering us there is that when that water is allotted to us the Minister&#x2019;s consent has to be obtained before this can be done. It happens that a period of three weeks to a month elapses. During that time the crop shrivels up to such an extent that despite the additional water, it is impossible to save it. All I am now asking from the Minister is that when that concession is made each year he should simply make it easier to acquire the water. Where we have this allocation of ten extra inches at a greatly increased price, we are simply asking the Minister to lay down in his regulation that it can in fact be purchased without consulting him, that an official can do so, except&#x2014;I want to add this qualification&#x2014; when there is no water. We are not asking for this to be done when or if there is no water available. We are asking that additional water should in future be sold to us, under normal circumstances. I should like to give the hon. the Minister a little information in regard to this matter. The Van Der Merwe commission investigated the question of purchasing water very thoroughly and found that the people purchasing water were the occupants of the smaller plots. If there is one thing that is beyond my comprehension then it is this. The Government cut up economic units into 30 morgen, and other units into 20 morgen. They are on the same level, in the same area, and within the boundaries of the scheme. It was then stated that these smaller units were also economic. However, they are there and I should like the officials to furnish me with a reply to the following question. The commission decided that the people with 20 morgen plots doubled their cultivation to as much as 150 per cent. Does that mean that that man is also irrigating 30 morgen? A doubling of 150 per cent means that he is also irrigating his 30 morgen, but he is only receiving water for 20 morgen. He purchases additional water for the remaining ten morgen. However, the Minister&#x2019;s approval has to be obtained for that purpose, and as I have said, it takes so long that in the meantime the man&#x2019;s crop shrivels up. We are asking that people with fewer than 30 morgen be allowed to purchase the quantity of water which is equivalent to the 30 morgen. In other words, one receives 30 inches per morgen per year, 30 morgen therefore gives you 900 inches, the 20 morgen plot consequently receives only 600 inches of water. And now we are asking that the man with a 20 morgen plot should be granted the right to purchase additional water to as much as 900 inches, so that all irrigators can fall into the same category, and subsequently water restrictions can then be applied. They do not mind paying the increased price; they are prepared to do that, as long as they can obtain the water in order to see their crops through.</p>

<p>I hope I have made this matter clear. To sum up: we are asking that people with 20 morgen plots, or people with plots which are less than 30 morgen in extent be allowed to purchase the full 900 inches, after which they can subsequently be treated on the same basis as the others.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes at my disposal I should like to say a few words as the representative of the grass veld regions, that is to say those regions which lie to the south of the Langeberge. On the southern part of those mountains the Department of Water Affairs has, during the last few years, built a few fine irrigation dams, and I can give you the assurance that those dams mean a tremendous amount to those farmers and to the inhabitants of the towns. The dams are stimulating local economy there, and I would not like to imagine what the position would have been if it had not been for those dams. I want to mention a few of these dams. We have the Korente Vet River Dam at Riversdale, the Duivenhoks River Dam at Heidelberg and the Buffeljachts River Dam at Swellendam. We know that other dams are at present being planned. These dams are in the first instance irrigation dams. However, I now want to advocate that the cattle farmers should also be able to benefit from those dams. Those farmers who are far away from the irrigation land, are experiencing difficulties, and I think the only way in which we can accommodate them, is to bring the water to their farms by means of a pipeline. This water will be used in the first instance for watering stock, and in the second instance for household purposes. This is by no means a new idea, and I am also aware of the fact that such a system is being planned. The region I am now talking about has winter rainfall and dry summer, and in the dry summers&#x2014;and this is actually where <span class="col_5911-5912" refersTo="page_0160"/>the difficulty lies&#x2014;we have to get along without rain for five to six months. During the past season this period was as long as seven to eight months. That is what makes matters so difficult for the cattle farmer. In such a long dry period he does not have enough drinking-water for his stock. The soil in those regions is, for the most part, not suitable for dams, and even if it were suitable, dams would be of no avail if the rainfall is not adequate or if the rainfall is so mild that the water cannot flow into the dams.</p>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member is rather far from the subject of water affairs now. He is dealing with agricultural matters.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall return to water affairs immediately, Mr. Chairman. The position is that the farmers make provision for their own water requirements as far as possible out of boreholes or wells, or by means of windmills. However, that water is of such a nature that it is not suited to use by animals. If the farmer cannot give his stock enough water during that dry period, he is compelled to convey his water over long distances to fill the dams. Anybody who has had practical experience of farming knows that it is an impossible task to convey water for one&#x2019;s cattle over a long distance.</p>

<p>I am now dealing with water affairs again, and I want to allege that the reply to that lies with the Department of Water Affairs. We believe that if we can have a pipeline system which brings the water from the dams to the farmers, then that problem will have been solved. The Department has already introduced that system along the West Coast, and it is achieving wonderful things for those farmers, and that region. Once the system is in operation the farmers will be in a much better position because his cattle will then, during the dry periods, and also when there is not much grazing, be able to maintain their condition because there will be good water available to them. When there is no winter grazing. 80 per cent of the sheeps&#x2019; nutrients consists of water. For household purposes the people there have only the water which runs off the roofs of the farm houses and the barns. The system which I am advocating will also bring about a great improvement in that respect. I thank you, Sir, for the few moments which you placed at my disposal.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the debate has lasted for almost four hours now, and I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for taking part in it and also for the way in which they presented their cases. Some matters related to certain principles, while others were of a more local nature. In the time at my disposal I shall now try to reply to all the points which have been raised here.</p>

<p>This is the first opportunity which presents itself to address a few words from this side of the House and on behalf of this Department to the State President, who used to be the Minister in charge of this Department. He had hardly been Minister of Water Affairs for two years when he was called to a higher office. It fell to his share to perform an important task in that period. He took over this Department in the midst of the most serious drought crisis which this country has ever experienced. He did not have the good fortune to be Minister during a reasonably prosperous period as far as the country&#x2019;s water affairs were concerned, and I think we should note with appreciation what inspiration he provided when he made it his task during the drought to keep up the courage of our people.</p>

<p>This Department has to administer the Water Act of 1956. The administration of the Water Act means, in point of fact, that the Department must supervise and control the storage, regulation and conservation of water. It also means that it must make a fair apportionment of the water supply of South Africa to all bodies and persons concerned. This applies not only to surface supplies, but to subterranean supplies as well. This is the task to be performed by the Department of Water Affairs, and this task is becoming ever greater. In the performance of its task, i.e. the conservation, control and apportionment of water in South Africa, the Department is in fact controlling the most important commodity upon which man and plant and animal are dependent in South Africa. But more than that, it is also controlling the main limiting factor as far as the economic growth of the country is concerned. That is why it is so important, when discussing water, that we should be very careful and that we should know that the keynote of all our thinking about water should be &#x201C;proper planning and proper control&#x201D;; and when we speak of proper planning, we also have to realize that we will have to plan in such a way that we take into account the importance of the factor of water. Having said this, I will be permitted by the Committee to try to give some idea of what the water situation in South Africa is. That is what is concerned here.</p>

<p>We have to accept that South Africa is a country that is not endowed with a plentiful supply of water, and that we are in fact one of the countries in the world having the ereatest scarcity of water. What are the facts? The facts are that, in contrast with other comparable countries, only 8.6 per cent of the water falling on our soil finds its way into our rivers or is absorbed as ground-water, as we call it, which flows back into the subterranean basins from which we are continually abstracting water. It is also a fact that the rivers of South Africa are so situated, and that the effects which droughts have on our country and that the extent of the areas in which the water falls are such, that only 50 per cent of <span class="col_5913-5914" refersTo="page_0161"/>the water falling on our soil can ever be utilized economically. This is an important factor. This 50 per cent only amounts to 10 million morgen feet of water, which is not much. But the fact remains that if our dams, those which have been built and those which we can still build, can catch up this water, only 55 per cent of this water is in fact available to us as a gross run-off, owing to the uncertainty of our rainfall. However, we must also take into account that 23 per cent of all the water that we catch up is lost through evaporation. So, if this fact is taken into account, it means that only 42.3 per cent of this 10 million morgen feet of water that we can ever dam up economically could be utilized effectively.</p>

<p>What is the present position? We have already dammed up 2.5 million morgen feet of water, and the dams which are at present under construction or being planned, and which will be under construction in the near future, will store up 6.8 million to 7 million morgen feet of water. If we apply the formula I mentioned a moment ago to this quantity of water, it means that for the present generation in South Africa we can already make available for use three million of this 4.2 million morgen feet which we shall ultimately have at our disposal. As far as the present generation is concerned, the position is therefore that we have already dammed up this quantity of water, and if we consider what the future consumption will be, we find the following position: At the present moment we are consuming approximately 3.8 million morgen feet of water, but if we maintain the present rate of growth, we shall already require 6.1 million morgen feet of water by the year 2000. By the year 2000 we shall already have exceeded the total potential of South Africa. This is the hard fact that we are faced with.</p>

<p>The second important fact with which we are concerned and which we must also realize is that we have drawn upon our subterranean reserves so rapidly that in many parts of the country we cannot even reach them with an ordinary jumper drill any more. That is why in some areas the Department has to drill down more than 500 feet to reach our last reserves. It is only the artesian and dolomitic sources which are reasonably stable. These are the hard facts we have to accept and in terms of which we must view the water position in South Africa and in terms of which hon. members must view the representations which they made here.</p>

<p>If we accept these facts, it means that planning in our case means efficient distribution. Efficient distribution means, in point of fact, that in South Africa we must take into account and keep in mind the balance of consumption and of demand between our urban areas and our rural areas, as well as existing development and any future development which is planned. These factors must be taken into account. Planning in respect of water also means that we must pay attention to the useful application, the saving and the more sensible use of water. This applies to agriculture as well and, if I may just make the observation here, I do not know whether we always make judicious use of the available supply of water. We must also pay attention to the pollution of water and the conservation of the sources, so that they remain unpolluted for our use. But this also means that we must give careful consideration to preferential rights. Hon. members have touched upon this matter from various sides and angles. It means the preferential right of people living in a catchment area as against the possible better utilization of the water by people living outside that catchment area. I want to mention examples. I want to mention the example of the determination of a preferential right between, for example, the rural consumption in the Boland as against that of Cape Town; the preferential right, for example, in respect of the consumption on the Rand of water that has to be taken from the Tugela. But, Sir, let me immediately say to you and to this House that our predecessors passed a Water Act which established this very important principle, a principle which springs from South Africa&#x2019;s particular circumstances, i.e. the circumstances that rain falls mainly in one area, but that South Africa necessarily has to develop in another area as well; that the water falls in our mountainous regions and perhaps runs down to Natal, but that we know that our gold has to be exploited on the Rand and not in Natal, and that our iron deposits are at certain places, and not necessarily where the water is. Hence the fact that the State reserves to itself the right always to decide about the preferential right of a person within a catchment area, but over against that also has the right to take into account the right of developing South Africa in other areas where it must necessarily develop.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, against this background you will permit me just to mention to you, furthermore, what the recent phenomena in this country are, phenomena which are now becoming of more urgent importance to us, because we must bear in mind that South Africa has experienced an economic development over the past 20 years which has virtually increased its gross national product fourfold and will lead to a further increase in the years that lie ahead. As far as water is concerned, these developments have served to stress the fact that we have rapidly become industrialized in recent times and that we have become industrialized in directions which have brought into prominence the importance of preventing pollution. That is why we now have to deal with this problem of pollution, which we have always had, as the whole world has had it, and as America has had it, but which has suddenly become more serious in other countries and in this country as well. It has coincided with the industrialization of our country. The fact that we have experienced such tremendous economic growth in our urban areas in recent times and that the rate of <span class="col_5915-5916" refersTo="page_0162"/>consumption has increased so tremendously, has also brought into prominence the question of the re-use of water. This is a world problem, but it is becoming more serious in this country now. There is also the fact that at present we are virtually experiencing an assault on our mountainous areas and our sponge areas, and a competition for the use of water. These have been caused not only by the broad economic development of South Africa, but also by the demand which has arisen in our country in recent times for timber and timber products. This is also a new situation that has been created in South Africa.</p>

<p>The fact that we are developing, and have to develop, rapidly in the economic field and have to supply water quickly to the development areas entails our having to accept that the easy and nearby sources of supply to our great complexes have already been tapped. It is simply no longer possible to supply more cheap water near any city in South Africa or near any point of development. All water which is taken there must be conveyed over long distances by means of expensive systems &#x2014;expensive tunnels, expensive pipe-lines or expensive dams. Our predecessors took the easy first steps; the difficult ones are coming now. Mr. Chairman, against this background we must decide what our general attitude is to be in regard to these fundamental matters, and we must also decide what the policy of South Africa is to be in respect thereof.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the question of pollution. In recent years we have given a great deal of attention to the control of pollution. This control is exercised by a division in the Department. We also work in the closest co-operation with various quarters. The C.S.I.R. is paying attention to this problem, and has its own national water research institute. The Bureau of Standards also concerns itself with certain aspects of this matter; the universities are concerned about this matter, and it is also becoming an academic question for the people who train others to handle the situation. On account of what I have seen recently, I am satisfied that South Africa has become sufficiently aware of this problem. I am satisfied that our Department is also fully alert to it. We are also receiving good cooperation from industry an this regard. I must say, however, that in certain cases we are having difficulties with industrialists who are not co-operating with us properly, but I do not want to express myself too strongly about this now. I just want to say that in the circumstances of South Africa&#x2019;s water position we will have to obtain the co-operation of all bodies and persons in order to be able to meet this problem, because it is not a problem of the Government alone, but a problem of the entire country, and we must view it in that light.</p>

<p>As far as the re-use of water is concerned, I want to say at once that it is my conviction that one of the untapped sources of water in the country is the polluted water at our disposal. If I may express any criticism, I want to say that this is one of the sections of our activities in which the Department finds it difficult to obtain co-operation. With the scarcity of water that there is, we are not satisfied that we are receiving the co-operation of particularly our municipalities in connection with the re-use of water. As a matter of fact, one of the largest municipalities in South Africa has not even installed meters as yet. It is more and more becoming the idea to ask the Government to supply water to industrial development areas, and to make the Government responsible for supplying water to such areas. As yet, too little is being done in connection with the re-use of water. In other countries in which there is a greater scarcity of water than in South Africa, much more is being done in this connection than in our country, and there is better co-operation as well. However, I want to add that great interest has been displayed in the matter of late, and I want to express the hope that we shall have greater interest and co-operation on the part of all bodies and persons in the future. As far as the policy of the Department is concerned, we must make it quite clear that we are making an appeal to all bodies and persons to co-operate with us in taking the necessary re-use measures, and to obtain the necessary guidance from us in this regard. We are geared to being able to provide the necessary technical advice. We also have to warn that we will have to receive co-operation, otherwise the Department will simply have to take drastic action in the future. This matter must be considered as being as important as preventing the water in our rivers from being polluted.</p>

<p>As regards the third point I mentioned, i.e. the phenomenon we have been meeting with of late that water is also being used by forest planters in mountainous areas, I want to say that we find it a pity that many prospective forest planters apparently have the idea that they have the right to enter mountainous areas and to destroy our sponge areas by planting trees. We made provision for such an eventuality in our water legislation. The Act has not yet been applied very strictly in the past, probably because the problem did not come to the fore as strongly as it has done recently. I want to issue a very serious warning that the Act does provide for us to take action. I also want to say that we have recently been compelled to proclaim quite a number of these areas as water catchment areas, neither shall we hesitate to proclaim further areas in the future.</p>

<p>†The hon. member for South Coast was perturbed about this position and he spoke about the intrusion of these people into our catchment areas. I wish to assure the hon. member that I fully agree with him and that we will not hesitate to prevent intrusion into our cachment areas. May this be a warning to all interested parties that we are bent on <span class="col_5917-5918" refersTo="page_0163"/>doing what is necessary for the protection of our catchment areas.</p>

<p>Have you the power to proclaim those areas?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We have the power. We have proclaimed four areas during the past few weeks and next week we will be proclaiming another two areas.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I just want to make this further observation in regard to the supply of water to remote areas and to our urban areas. I trust that before we start a dispute in South Africa about the necessity of protecting water for any particular area, we shall have regard to the fact that we have an obligation as regards the economic development of South Africa as a whole. I want to take the Tugela as an example. It would be a pity if, in dealing with the large water complexes such as the Tugela, we should quarrel with one another as to what is in the best interests of South Africa. As far as the Tugela is concerned, I just want to tell hon. members that when the dam we intend to build shortly has been completed, it will catch up only 5 per cent of all the water of the Tugela River, and the portion nat will be taken to the Rand will only be approximately 3 per cent of the total quantity. In other words, if I again have to apply the principle of the proper utilization of water with due regard to the interests of any particular catchment area, then, surely, it is also the responsibility of the Government not to do anything which would upset the balance between the interests of the local community and the broader interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will also permit me to say a few words on this occasion about what was said here in regard to our staff and the importance of developing our Department. Various quarters have recently come to take an interest in the activities of the Department, actually because we have taken trouble to bring these activities to notice. We are confident that in the near future we shall probably find greater interest being displayed by our universities in the training of students, also for service in this Department. But I also want to say to hon. members that it seems to me as though a very great deal of talent is being lost along the way because we perhaps do not give sufficient publicity to South Africa as a future engineers&#x2019; paradise. We see this Department, with the task lying in store for it, as a co-builder of the future of South Africa, not only as the builder of large dams and large schemes, but in the future also as the builder of the national economy which has to be developed. I want to say that in this process South Africa is going to become an engineers&#x2019; paradise, and to any student who wants to qualify himself, I want to extend an invitation to make his services available to this Department, not only because it will afford him an opportunity of taking part in the great work of creating an engineers&#x2019; paradise in South Africa, but also because he will receive the opportunity of helping to make South Africa the economic giant which it should become.</p>

<p>On this occasion I have to express my thanks to the officials of my Department for having undertaken in so loyal a manner what has had to be done in South Africa in recent years. We must not forget that we are experiencing keen competition from the private sector. We have to compete for the services of engineers in order to be able to do what has to be done. In the meantime the activities of the Department are expanding more and more. I recently had t)he opportunity of visiting quite a number of schemes and of seeing how the work was being tackled there. I am therefore in a position to testify to the enthusiasm and loyalty displayed by our people who are engaged in these projects. I am satisfied that the people who build our dams, those who exercise supervision over that and those who have to undertake the planning, do so with devotion and without sparing themselves and without looking to their own advantage. With the few people we have, we have already performed a gigantic task for South Africa; on behalf of the Government I therefore want to express my gratitude to these people.</p>

<p>Hon. members raised quite a number of points here in connection with specific matters, and I should like to reply to these.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for South Coast wanted to know what the long-term planning was for the development of the Tugela. He wanted to know how many dams were going to be built, where and when, and what the intentions were about development of the Tugela within Bantu areas. I dealt with this question in a broader sense. I wish to assure the hon. member for South Coast that the Tugela will be planned within this broader concept. The Tugela, like many of our larger rivers, shall have to be planned thoroughly for the future. Once we have the broad blueprint for the development of the Tugela, we shall be in a position to indicate when and how the various projects will be tackled. We must, however, not see the Tugela as a river which shall have to be harnessed within a year or ten. The Tugela is one of our reserves. Therefore we should have a broad plan and not try to harness the Tugela within a period of 10 or 15 years or even before the end of the century.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the Makatini Flats and the vleis round about those flats. He pointed out that fish were being bred in these vleis as a source of food for the Bantu there. He pointed out that these vleis were filled by overflows from the Pongola but when this river was under the control of the J. G. Strijdom Dam this overflow would be cut off and the fish would die. As to the planning and design of this area it was recommended in a report, dated 20th March, 1968, that effect should be given to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the <span class="col_5919-5920" refersTo="page_0164"/>St. Lucia Lake System by supplying fresh water to the St. Lucia Lake via the J. G. Strijdom Dam, rather than from a dam in the Mkuze River. I should like to go into this matter thoroughly first before dealing with it in detail. This is an important matter and, as the hon. member will appreciate, I have not had the time yet to study it in detail. It is my intention to visit the area to see for myself what should be done.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<p>Yes. The hon. member also pointed out that tourist development was being held up because the Natal Parks Board and the Provincial Administration of Natal were unable to supply water. Following representations by the Natal Parks Board earlier this year, preliminary investigations were carried out, in March, 1968, to determine the feasibility and cost of supplying the Natal Parks Board and other consumers with purified water. The design of the basic scheme up to Hluhluwe in accordance with the White Paper Report, has been given priority with due cognizance of the possibility of having to supply purified water and of providing extensions to various consumers, including the Natal Parks Board at the False Bay Arm of the St. Lucia. Should it be decided to extend the scheme to cover these features at a later date, a further White Paper will be required.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast also wanted to know what the immediate, intermediate and long-term plans were for supplying water to Richard&#x2019;s Bay. This is a matter which has already been investigated by the Department and it has been recommended that for the interim Richard&#x2019;s Bay should get water locally from the fresh water lakes and that this be augmented later by the dam to be built on the Imhlatuzi. Further augmentation of the supplies to this area is being investigated and both the Umfolozi and Tugela Rivers are being considered. But this question of the need and the supply of water must be considered against the background, as I have said, of regional planning.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Winburg made quite a few points to which I should like to reply. In the first place he expressed his thanks and appreciation for the services rendered by the Department, and then he asked whether there was any co-operation with foreign agencies and also how we set about obtaining cooperation from agencies within the country itself. There are two international organizations with which the Department is cooperating. One of these organizations is concerned with the planning of large dams and the other with the purification of water. As far as these bodies are concerned, South Africa occupies a high status. The president of the first-mentioned organization wrote the following in a letter to Mr. Kriel, our representative&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee was impressed with the thoroughness of your review, which indicated that your committee did substantial work in studying the terms contained in the glossary. In view of your valuable contributions, I have consulted with the president of ICOLD, Mr. Gerald McCarthy, recommending that to facilitate the work of the committee on the world register of dams, it would be highly beneficial for us to have you or a representative of your national committee joining us during our committee deliberations on June 5th.</block>

<p>This, then, is what they think of South Africa. The hon. member referred to the importance of the re-use of water and said that it was essential that the Department should cooperate with other domestic agencies in this regard. Well, as I have said, we are cooperating with the C.S.I.R. and with our universities, and it is the intention to continue and to expand this co-operation in the future. I want to express the hope that it will be possible for us to bring about better co-ordination among all the parties concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the water supply position of Hertzogville. He asked that something be done to relieve this town of its problems. When I visited the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency recently, I received representations from representatives of Hertzogville. It is clear to me that Hertzogville is the one small place in South Africa&#x2014;there may be others as well, but Hertzogville is the only one I know of&#x2014;where there is no water in the vicinity, nor any subterranean water. There is only one single borehole, and if that gives in, the whole of Hertzogville will be permanently without water. Mr. Chairman, I want to reassure the hon. member and tell him that we have already discussed the matter with the Department. We shall investigate the matter and try to supply water at Government cost by means of a Government water scheme, and the water will then be sold to Hertzogville at the price which they can afford. I hope and trust that we shall soon have very good news for the hon. member in this regard.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Albany stated that last year the matter of reuse of water by coastal towns had been raised under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote. He said that water had to be brought over great distances at State expense. It was essential that the Department should pay attention to the re-use of water by coastal cities, and thereby boost the national water resources. I think that I dealt with this in my general statement, and I do <span class="col_5921-5922" refersTo="page_0165"/>not think there is any further comment on this point raised by the hon. member for Albany.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wishes to know what progress had been made in implementing the recommendations of the report of the Institute of Hydrology, including the establishment of chairs of hydrology at different universities. There is no Institute of Hydrology, and the hon. member is probably referring to certain recommendations contained in the Straszacken report. This aspect has ¡been supported by the Scientific Advisory Council, and it is understood that certain universities are following up the recommendations.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Piketberg asked that we should take special steps to attract more engineers. I think I furnished the hon. member with a reply in this regard a few moments ago. The hon. member also felt that in the Western Cape we should pay more attention to agricultural needs as far as water affairs are concerned. Against the background which I have outlined, i.e. that we should also take into account the needs concerned in the catchment and control area of a dam, it is very clear that the agricultural needs of the Western Cape must also be weighed up very thoroughly against the other needs. I want to say to the hon. member that, if there is any doubt to the effect that, in the development of these rivers in the Boland, this water will be given away and that the agricultural needs will not receive proper attention, I want to give him the assurance that we shall see to it that agriculture is not neglected. I want to say to the hon. member that, over and above what is already in prospect, there is still a tremendous potential remaining. We trust that ample provision will also be made for the maintenance of agriculture in the Western Cape. After all, this is one of the main reasons why we are looking forward to major development in this area as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Standerton also spoke about co-ordination and guidance in regard to what we should produce under irrigation. That is quite correct. If the hon. member had been here, he would have known that this in fact confirms what I said earlier in my speech about the careful utilization of water, also by agriculture. The hon. member also asked that we improve the legislation for the protection of our sponges. As yet we do not know whether we have to improve the legislation. We are going to try to make use of existing legislation. If we get into difficulties and we see that we need an improved Act, we shall amend it until it is good enough to cope with this problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member also complained about water which was being used by a certain industry and three cusecs of which was running away all the time without being re-used. I just want to say to the hon. member that, if he would tell me personally what the name of the concern is, we shall have the matter investigated.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked a question on behalf of the hon. member for Waterberg about the position in regard to the Loskop Dam. I have tried to ascertain what happened in the past in the case of the Loskop Dam. It seems to me as though there is a possibility after all of raising the dam wall at some stage or another. However, this would mean that the present camping site of the province would be submerged. This is an implication we will have to face. I also understand that the dam wall will have to be examined once again, because there is a possibility that it may not be able to withstand further pressure. This would also mean that the dam wall would have to be reinforced. In any case, it is a technical matter. There is no lack of willingness to investigate the matter, and in due course we shall pay the necessary attention to this as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for East London (North) stated that he had visited the towns, which were equipped with all facilities, but that at Midshaft and the tunnel exit there were ghost towns. My reply to the point raised by the hon. member is that we have to build the big canal and need to house very many people, black and white. Naturally, before commencing the construction of the canal, one must have facilities to house these people. That is why we are completing the housing scheme first before we start the work; otherwise nobody will be interested in starting work in the veld without there being facilities to live in.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River stated that a pulp mill is to be situated on the Umzimkulu, a major river, 100 miles from the coast. The river is on the border of Natal and the pollution of the river would constitute a tragedy. I agree. It could constitute a tragedy. There is no pulp mill on the Umzimkulu River at the moment. A large industrial concern wishes to establish a pulp mill near Creighton, but it is uncertain whether the department&#x2019;s requirements regarding pollution control can be met. No final decision on the siting of the mill has as yet been made. Unless the department can be assured that no pollution will take place, no permit in terms of section 12 of the Water Act allowing the concern to extract water from the Umzimkulu River will be issued.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is definite. We will not issue a permit unless we are satisfied that our requirements will be met. The hon. member asked a question in connection with the Umvoti-Karkloof and Ixopo catchment areas. As I have said, those areas will be declared within a week or two. The reason why we were held up is that there is much work involved before an area can be declared.</p>

<p><span class="col_5923-5924" refersTo="page_0166"/>*I should like to make an observation in regard to the tapping of clouds. The hon. member for Nelspruit as well as the hon. member for Mooi River referred to this. This is of course a quite recent development in the scientific world and one does not know how far one should go. I do not want to go any further than saying that the Department is studying this aspect as well, and that it will carry out the necessary experiments in the future and will assist other people who are engaged in the matter to do so. This is a very delicate matter. Personally I do not know much about it, and accordingly I want to be very careful in saying anything about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl made certain remarks which we appreciate a great deal, and he also told us why pure water had to be used or ought to be used in the Boland. I agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s reasons as to why the development of certain areas has to be promoted. I think the hon. member is right and I do not want to repeat them. The hon. member quite rightly asked what would become of the water of such a dam and how it would be conveyed to the irrigators. I want to say to the hon. member that in future we will have to adopt a different approach in regard to the allocation of water from the one we adopted in the past. I said on a previous occasion, and I want to repeat now, that I think it is wrong to build a dam wall and then to take the view that the needs of the area concerned have been taken care of. I believe that we should not build a dam wall unless we are prepared to see to it that the water behind the dam wall is distributed to the consumers in the most efficient and best way. This also applies to Paarl. Although no announcement has been made as yet, I cannot see how we can omit completing canal systems to distribute water to the farmers who need it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gordonia said that he was concerned about the position of the Orange River below the confluence of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. I can understand the hon. member&#x2019;s concern. Anybody would be concerned if he saw that a large quantity was being stored in a few dams and he did not know what portion would come his way. Once again against the background of the profitable and proper use of water and the proper apportionment thereof to all who are entitled to it, as I stated at the outset, I want to tell the hon. member this. A good deal of research still has to be done, particularly as far as the availability of land is concerned, in order to be able to make the final apportionment. I want to tell the hon. member that he may rest assured that, as far as the industrial consumption is concerned, as regards both the present and the potential, the parts below the point will have to get their rightful share of the water, otherwise, surely, it would be unfair. I can give the hon. member the assurance that, as regards the further investigations which are taking place, his area will also receive priority. I cannot reply to him in greater detail in this regard at this stage. I can only reply to him in principle. The investigation of this matter has been entrusted to a special technical committee. I want to assure him that, as regards the protection that will flow from this, his area will be protected as far as possible and that all the rights mentioned by him will be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) said that water should not be taken from one area to another at the expense of the first-mentioned area. I think the hon. member will be satisfied with the statement which I made earlier to the effect that we must weigh up these matters against each other.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia made two points. The one related to spray irrigation. I want to tell the hon. member that I agree with him. I think the hon. member for Winburg also spoke in this connection. I think we are also on the eve of developments as regards the use of water for agricultural purposes. I think we still know too little about this. To my mind we must do much more research. We must adopt the approach that where it can be done and where the elements and other factors influencing it allow us to do so, we must make as much use as possibls of the spray irrigation system in South Africa. The factors which influence it are the following: Wind direction, soil depth, quality, gradients, and comparative costs as regards the production and the supplying of the water. I hope that in the coming years we shall be able to do a good deal more and learn a good deal more about this problem. The Department, of course, finances spraying systems in the sense that it grants subsidies. The Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure also grants loans for this purpose. It is actually a matter which should fall under that Department, because the loan is greater than the subsidy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia also referred to the fact that there had been an investigation in connection with the 40 million gallons of subterranean water abstracted by the mines every day. They developed a system by means of which they tried to purify the water. This was done by the Anglo American group, and at a certain stage it was discontinued. The cost at which this purified water could be supplied was higher than that at which water could be purchased. I understand that defects also occurred in their plant and that they were unable to purify the water to the required degree. In other words, technical problems were also experienced. The Department did not have a great deal to do with the matter. Naturally we were interested, and we shall most certainly take a further interest in the matter. It is inherent in the principle we apply in respect of the future purification of water that the purification of mine water will also be a very important factor. If the water can be purified cheaply, this must be done rather than to bring in water from outside. However, I am only making this as a general statement.</p>

<p><span class="col_5925-5926" refersTo="page_0167"/>A few other hon. members also made certain observations this morning. The hon. member for Marico asked for a more extensive study to be made of our subterranean sources. This is of course an important matter. I want to say to the hon. member that our hydrological section is in tact working on this matter, and I am satisfied that they know more about it than we think. However, I agree that the subject should be studied further. The hon. member also asked whether the Maiemane and Malopo Rivers were subterranean ones. I tried to find out on a previous occasion whether it could be established whether there was such a thing as a subterranean river, and it would seem to me as though what we call subterranean rivers are nothing but overflows in dolomitic areas where great pressure forces the stream to the surface, where it then flows along a bed on the surface. It flows along the surface and then again disappears beneath the surface until such a water source disappears altogether. I therefore have to inform the hon. member that I do not know of such a thing as a subterranean river. It is either a river which flows along the surface or not a river at all. But I think what the hon. member has in mind is this. If water is derived from these artesian sources in these dolomotic areas, can you make lavish use of such water? My attitude is: No, of course you must not make lavish use of it. This is the only source of subterranean water in South Africa which is still reasonably safe, and we must make very careful use of it. We must see to it that we do not destroy it in the same way as other subterranean sources have been destroyed.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (South) asked whether it was not possible, before the dam at Spitskop in the Harts River was completed and if the farmers in that water area got into difficulties, to supply some water from the Vaal Dam to assist them to some extent. This is prohibited by law. The water used in that area is in actual fact run-off water from the Vaalharts Scheme. Before the farmers on that scheme used their water so carefully, there was a large run-off. The runoff was so consistently large that many farmers began farming along the lower reaches of the run-off. However, as the water came to be used more efficiently higher up, this runoff disappeared in due course. But the communities are still there and now they are asking whether the water cannot be replaced. They never had any water to replace; they were using run-off water. Consequently the hon. member&#x2019;s request cannot be complied with: it is legally impossible. If water is supplied to these people, it can only be taken from one source, and that is the Vaal Dam. That water cannot be taken out of the dam. They already have a shortage there. Now it is to be given to an area which never had any claim to that water. I think it would only give rise to serious difficulties. In addition it would involve us in serious legal problems. I want to say to the hon. member that we hope the dam will be completed fairly soon. I also want to give him the assurance that the work at the dam will be expedited as much as possible. But in the meantime both he and I must hope for good rains.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Walmer spoke about the river systems in our dry areas, rivers traversing our vleilands. Of course, it is very important that we maintain our sponge or vlei areas. I also agree that soil conservation and water conservation are closely allied. The two dapartments will continue to closely cooperate in future in connection with the conservation of soil and water. I agree with the hon. gentleman that soil and water conservation should be viewed as allied subjects, and I hope that in future the two departments will continue to co-operate as closely as they have done in the past. I wish to assure the hon. gentleman that the two departments try to cooperate as regards the combating of these great problems. Our activities will further increase and we will co-operate as closely as we can and certainly try to conserve these areas as far as possible.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Nelspruit also raised a few points. He asked that our existing rivers should receive priority as far as planning was concerned. I think what the hon. member also meant was that we should first complete and round off existing works before starting on new ones. I think the hon. member has a valid point and I want to give him the assurance that this will be our policy in the future. There are a large number of dams in existence. and then there are heavy transmission losses in conveying the water from the dam to the point where it is used. I therefore believe that we should give much more attention to the completion of complexes than to the building of new dams. It is quite correct that we will have to build new dams as well in the future, because we cannot have the whole country standing still, but I think the hon. member made a valid point in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the protection of our catchment areas and asked that more attention be paid to the conservation of our catchment areas. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that the conservation of our catchment areas will become the Department&#x2019;s number one priority in the future, because it is a known fact, and the latest hydrological figures prove to us, that the flow of some of these streams from our high rainfall areas has diminished by up to 80 per cent of their normal flow, and this is a situation which we simply cannot tolerate any longer. We will have to create the necessary machinery and carry out the necessary planning, and I can give him the assurance that the necessary encouragement to do so will not be lacking either.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for South Coast said that in view of the overlapping of various <span class="col_5927-5928" refersTo="page_0168"/>interests his suggestion was that we have an institute of water affairs. We know that water touches practically every walk of life, and we also know that in future we should view with great concern this intricate overlapping in this regard in South Africa. But whether we should create another institute adjacent to all the other institutes and parties interested, as well as the Government, I do not know. From our part, I should like to assure the hon. member that we will try to co-ordinate our activities as far as possible and perhaps by next year we will be able to give a greater measure of assurance to the hon. member.</p>

<p>I shall be happy to remind you of it.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley (North) said that the water allocations were too small. He said that a certain quantity of water was allocated each year and that in the past allocations had been made to irrigators particularly in times of emergency. The hon. member asked whether we could not lay it down as a principle that, if the people on the scheme said that their water was finished, the Department could automatically grant permission for them to buy extra water. Unfortunately we cannot do that, because if you say to a man that he can automatically obtain more water once his water is finished, you may just as well increase his quota. The fact of the matter is that in the past it was only by way of great exception that we granted permission for extra water to be made available. For example, when people had used up their quota for the year in order to produce a beautiful crop and that crop was totally destroyed by hail, we considered the matter and if there was water available, we allocated extra water. But we cannot agree to lay it down as a principle, so that a man would know that he could always purchase additional water whenever he felt like it.</p>

<p>There is another point which I just want to touch upon and which has not been mentioned in the debate, but which I want to mention myself. This concerns a matter that was submitted to me in connection with the storage area of the Verwoerd Dam, the area which is not being used as yet because it has not yet been submerged. Some time will elapse before the dam is completed and the first water is caught up. Representations have been made for this area, which provides good grazing in the meantime, to be used by people who need it. It is an area which falls in the constituency of the hon. member for Colesberg, and therefore I should like to mention it here as well. I just want to say that the Department is very sympathetically disposed towards the request that land in the basin of the Verwoerd Dam be made available for this purpose on a short-term basis, but the leasing of this land is a matter which falls under the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. They are responsible for making arrangements in this regard. The wire fences and farm improvements have already been removed, and it would be impossible to control stock which is admitted there. Minister Uys and the Department of Agricultural Credit were very firm in their attitude that the land had to be vacated permanently. I am adopting a careful approach in this matter, because I do not know how Minister Uys decided about it in the past. But we shall take another look at the matter, and if I can be instrumental in discussing it with the Minister and there is no objection on the part of the Department of Water Affairs, I can give the assurance that we shall consider the matter. However, I also want to make it quite clear that I nave not had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister beforehand, but if the hon. member is satisfied with the reply I am giving him now, we can regard the matter as settled.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) raised a very important question here. In view of the difficulty being experienced by the entire area of East London and King William&#x2019;s Town as far as water is concerned, and in view of the fact that there is only one stream, the Buffalo River, on which a number of dams have already been built, and the fact that great development is taking place in that area, the hon. member asked how we saw the position in the years that lie ahead; how were we going to supply water to that area in order to maintain that activity? I think this is a very fair question. I visited the area some time ago and I had a look at all the dams in order to acquaint myself with the position. The area is a very risky one; it does not have a regular rainfall, and the river can quite easily dry up for a number of years. I may tell the hon. member that I have made inquiries in the meantime and it seems to me that what has to be done is that the next step must be to supply water perhaps from the Kabusi and the Kei and other rivers in that area, but there will be long distances involved and it will be an expensive undertaking. It is one of the cases I mentioned in which we will perhaps have to convey water over long distances. As regards the question of the possibility of bringing water there from the Orange River, the hon. member will pardon me if I tell him that he has caught me on the wrong foot in this regard, in the sense that I have not yet had an opportunity of considering the matter from that angle. But one thing is certain, and that is that it is one of the risky areas of South Africa. It does not have sufficient water and we want to develop the area, and therefore I think that it is an area which must be considered on a broad basis. I believe that after the present provision we will have to make provision for bringing water to that area, and it will be expensive, but it seems to me as though it will be able to take us through to the end of the century. I do not know what will happen after that, but we will have to go into the whole situation.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, you will allow me. before I resume my seat, to say, with reference to all <span class="col_5929-5930" refersTo="page_0169"/>the questions that were raised here and the observations that were made, also the matter mentioned by this hon. member and to which I have now replied, that I should like to announce on this occasion that we are going to lay it down as our policy in the future to divide South Africa into its water complexes, and that we are in fact going to carry out that policy. It will be the policy to instutute a proper investigation into the water complexes of South Africa and then to try to see the water plans, which will be smaller plans that must fit into the greater water plan for South Africa like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, as the next step pursuant to the present Water Plan Commission which is working on the broad guiding principles. We believe that it has become essential to do this, because we can no longer view the water of South Africa as the water of various rivers, but must view it as the water of complexes which affects the entire area from the time when the first drop falls until the last drop flows into the sea. We must see it as a complex and as a whole in order to try to draw up a blueprint for South Africa. We will have to do this in future, and I think it will also give hon. members the satisfaction that as regards the important rivers and the important water complexes in regard to which there is concern at the moment as to the way in which we envisage the various stages of development, we shall as a result of this be able to give a better reply to this question in future when we ourselves have seen to it that a better overall picture of South Africa&#x2019;s water position is drawn up. In this process we shall make use not only of the officials of the Department, but also of private initiative and persons that can assist us in this field. I think that with this I have dealt with all the matters raised by hon. members.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The time when the Government regarded immigration as an evil is fortunately past, and I must say that it is rather interesting to see how hon. members opposite, and I am thinking particularly of the hon. member for Primrose, are going around enthusiastically to-day to convince their supporters of the necessity of immigration. It has this advantage, that it is now no longer necessary for us to quibble over the floor of the House about the desirability of an active immigration policy, but we can calmly consider the results produced by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s labours.</p>

<p>If I am correct, immigration is actually directed at two things. The first is the strengthening of the white population and the second is the strengthening of trained manpower. For the purpose of achieving these objectives the Government spent R6,700,000 last year and is requesting an amount of R5.8 million this year. This is a net decrease of R840 000. However, I notice that there are certain items in respect of which there is an increase. An increase is being requested in respect of publicity, up to an amount of R49,500, and financial assistance to immigrant organizations is being increased by R 16,000. The most interesting item is in fact that the item &#x201C;Assistance to Immigrants&#x201D; shows a decrease of R936,000, nearly R1 million. There are two questions which I should like to put to the hon. the Minister in this connection. The first is: What is the nature and the extent of the publicity which is being undertaken abroad and which entails that the term &#x201C;Publicity&#x201D; is being increased by about one third? I should particularly like to know from the hon. the Minister how the total amount of R 177,000 is spent on publicity; in other words, how it is divided up between the various publicity media abroad.</p>

<p>The second question which I want to put to the hon. the Minister, is what has brought about the drastic reduction of nearly R1 million in respect of assistance to immigrants. Is it a case of greater thrift on the part of the Government, or is it a case of domestic pressure being exercised on the Government to slow down the pace somewhat as far as immigration is concerned, or is it because it is being more selective in its policy; or is it because it is no longer obtaining the number of immigrants which it would like, and therefore is not achieving sufficient success with its white population programme? I should like the hon. the Minister to inform us fully of the reasons for the decrease in this important item. You see, Sir, we are already faced with the problem that if. for example, an immigrant wants to emigrate from the Netherlands, the journey to Canada or the U.S.A, is much cheaper for him because it is much shorter. For this very reason Australia, which is also keen to attract immigrants, especially from the Netherlands, increased its assistance to such an extent last year that it costs the Dutch immigrant only R20 to-day to make the entire journey from the Netherlands to Australia. This immediately had the result that the number of Dutch immigrants who applied to go to Australia, doubled. As far as the journey here is concerned, we are at present, if I am correct, one of the most expensive immigration countries, especially for persons from our countries of origin, and one wonders what we must expect in the future if it is now necessary for this item to be reduced so drastically. Last year the hon. the Minister of Defence was particularly concerned about the increasing employment of Bantu labour in the Western Province, and on that occasion he suggested that &#x201C;the Government should make greater efforts to bring semi-skilled white families to South Africa from our countries of origin&#x201D;. Incidentally. I should like to know how the hon. the Minister reacted to this appeal from his colleague. I should bike to put two questions to him and I would be glad if he could reply to them. If he responded to this appeal, how many white semi-skilled immigrants were brought into South Africa in the past year, and how many of these white semi-skilled <span class="col_5931-5932" refersTo="page_0170"/>immigrants were settled in the Western Cape to assist in replacing Bantu labourers? Sir, it was not only the hon. the Minister of Defence who expressed concern about the &#x201C;darkening&#x201D; of &#x201C;White South Africa&#x201D;; in the course of a speech which the Administrator of Natal, Mr. Theo Gerdener made a few months ago, he became quite alarmed at what he called &#x201C;the increasing numerical preponderance&#x201D; of the non-Whites in South Africa. He pointed out that over a period of five years the Bantu had increased by one million more than the Whites. Mr. Gerdener felt that the Government&#x2019;s programme of importing immigrants was simply not helping sufficiently, and he went so far as to suggest that the Government should introduce a system of cash amounts for children. I am just mentioning this to indicate the concern existing on the Government side about this matter. Mr. J. M. Hattingh, the chairman of the &#x201C;Maatskappy vir Europese Immigrasie&#x201D;, complained as seriously about the declining birth rate of the Whites, despite the fact that there is only one other country in which fewer women work. He pointed out that in South Africa only 16.9 per cent of the women worked, in contrast with, for example, nearly 50 per cent in Russia. In a recent public address in Stellenbosch the Secretary for Immigration also expressed deep concern at the decreasing numerical strength of the Whites in relation to the non-Whites in South Africa. In the light of these statements by persons on the Government side, one finds it strange that the provision for immigration is less this year than last year. The amount being appropriated this year is nearly R1 million less. From the point of view of strengthening the white population, it therefore appears to me as if the Minister has not had as fruitful a year as last year and that he perhaps expects the coming year to be even less fruitful. It goes without saying that if that aspect of the immigration policy is not quite as successful as it can be. it will equally affect the programme for the importation of trained manpower. I think this is a prospect which will certainly not be welcomed by the industrialists and I should like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view on this aspect of South Africa&#x2019;s needs.</p>

<p>Then there are a few other questions which I want to put to the hon. the Minister. I wondered whether the Minister would not consider issuing an annual report for his Department, on more or less the same lines as the report of the Department of Information. If the Department of Information can do it. then I think it would also be a good thing if the Department of Immigration could furnish the necessary particulars to Parliament in that way in order to keep us regularly informed about the Department&#x2019;s programme.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have a total of 13 immigration offices in 10 countries abroad. The names appear in the Estimates and I need not read them out. but I do want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he can tell us how many immigrants entered South Africa last year from each of those countries in which we have offices. The hon. the Minister once said in a speech that the success of immigration lay not necessarily in numbers, but in the extent to which the newcomers became full-blooded South Africans.

<p>In the first instance I want to convey my thanks to the hon. the Minister and his Department for their consistent attempt to recruit suitable immigrants overseas. We are aware of the fact that there was a decrease in the immigrant figure last year as compared to the figure for the previous year, but we are grateful for the fact that the figure of immigrants from our countries of origin has remained constant. The greatest decrease was to be seen in the number of immigrants from the countries immediately to the north of South Africa. Of course, it was only to be expected that that source should dry up.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout pleaded here for more white immigrants. I do not think that we will quarrel with him in that regard. It is also our desire that more white immigrants should be brought to South Africa. Mr. Chairman, it amazes me that Whites in South Africa, who call themselves Nationalists, are still complaining about the Government&#x2019;s immigration policy, and that they are still trying to incite people against immigration. These people must realize&#x2014;and I think they do in fact realize it&#x2014;that we are going through a process of industrial development in South Africa, and that we have a very great shortage of white workers, not only men, but women as well. That shortage exists in trade, in industry and in other sectors of our economy. We have a shortage of medical practitioners and nurses. The Public Service, the Provincial Administrations and the Railways are all complaining about a shortage of staff. We cannot supply the deficiency of white manpower by means of the natural increase of our population alone. I am afraid that the position in this respect is not a very happy one either. If we take the past three years we find that the birth rate has declined from 32 to 30 to 28 per 1,000 last year. That means that we cannot rely on the natural increase in the population to supply the needs of trade and industry. If we want to find white employees, we are dependent upon immigrants. I should like those South African citizens, who at this stage are still jibbing at the immigration policy in spite of the fact that the hon. the Minister and other members of the Cabinet, the hon. member for Primrose and others, have stated their case so clearly, to realize that if we are unable to obtain White immigrants to fill the vacant posts, we will have to make use of non-Whites in this country, and will to an increasing extent have to integrate the non-Whites into our economy. Since it is the oolicy of the National Party to remove the Bantu from the white homeland gradually and send them to their own homelands, it should now be accepted by all Whites that it is in our <span class="col_5933-5934" refersTo="page_0171"/>interests to encourage immigration from our mother countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a few complaints, which one could perhaps go into, which are being used by the opponents of immigration to make immigration unpopular amongst the population. The one is that immigration will plough the Afrikaner under. Yet it has been proved that that danger does not exist. I want to suggest that the Minister should perhaps come to an agreement with the Minister of National Education to establish nursery schools and crèches so that the children of immigrants of pre-school age can be sent there to learn both official languages. I should also like to see the children of immigrants being admitted to schools other than the English schools, in cases where they are unable to speak either Afrikaans or English. The Afrikaans schools are not accepting these children because they cannot speak Afrikaans. I should like to see the Afrikaans schools taking the trouble of admitting the children of immigrants and training them through the medium of Afrikaans. I know of immigrant children here in Cape Town who would like to attend Afrikaans schools. The parents have made application, but their applications have been refused. Those children are in fact being taken up in English schools. This is the pattern which one finds throughout the country, and I feel that this must be terminated. I should like to see more encouragement being given to adult immigrants to attend the classes which have been introduced for their benefit at technical colleges so that they can in this way become bilingual.</p>

<p>Then there is another bugbear with which our people are being intimidated, and that is the allegation that the immigrants will deprive them of work. I am not aware of one South African who has been deprived of his work by an immigrant. In fact, we do not have enough manpower to fill all the vacancies. Thus there is no justification for that fear. Perhaps it would be a good thing if the Government would concentrate to a greater extent on the provision of more vocational schools such as technical high schools and commercial high schools. Then there are also people who are trying to intimidate South Africans with the so-called threat which immigrants supposedly present to our religious pattern. They are trying to create the impression that the Protestant nature of our country will be undermined by Catholic immigrants, but we have the assurance of the Minister and the Department that the balance between Protestants and Catholics in the country will not be upset by immigrants. In any case I feel that we can do nothing else but to give our full support to the immigration policy of the Government. We hope and trust that more immigrants will come to South Africa this year than in the past year, and that the numbers of immigrants will be steadily increased. We will support any steps which the Government takes in this regard gladly.</p>

<p>It is not often that I find myself in a position where I am able to support every word uttered by an hon. member on the Government side, but this time I find that I can support everything that has been said here by the hon. member for Geduld. Indeed, I could enlarge on the arguments that he used so profitably but I will not pursue the matter except to say that I am in full agreement with the hon. member for Geduld. It always amazes me that Whites in this country can be opposed to selected immigration, and yet we find that over and over again. The hon. member has already dealt with this matter most effectively and I leave it at that. Sir, I would like to say that the immigration figures for 1967 are extremely disturbing. In 1966, according to the departmental figures, we had 48,000 immigrants and in 1967 only 38,900. Of the 38,900 immigrants who entered the country in 1967, 10,000 came from the African continent. I think we must accept that this foutainhead of white immigrants from other countries in Africa, mainly Rhodesia and Zambia, is on the point of drying up or has dried up already. When we look at the Rhodesian statistics which were published in the newspapers a couple of days ago, we find that during the first quarter of 1968, Rhodesia had 3.800 immigrants, Which is actually 1,000 more than she had over the same period in 1967. One must presume that these are emigrants from the Republic of South Africa, by and large. I could not imagine too many British going there at the moment.</p>

<p>There are other disturbing features as far as our immigrants for 1967 are concerned. About 10,000 emanated from the African territories, and 26,000 came from Europe, and of the 26,000 12,990 still came from the United Kingdom. I have the figures in front of me. When I think in terms of the representatives we have in foreign countries, and of the success of their compaigns, it appears as if we are spending too much money on our offices in some countries and too little in others. I have already mentioned the figure for the U.K., namely 12,990. The figure for Germany is 3,300, for Holland 1,600, for Italy 1,500 and for Portugal 2,670. I have a feeling that we can do a lot more to attract immigrants from the countries from which our forebears emanated. Apart from subsidization maybe we can put forward a better effort. I am going to suggest ways and means towards the end of my few minutes, whereby this position could be improved.</p>

<p>Before getting there, I would like to deal with the position, and this also relates to the point made by the hon. member for Geduld, of What the census figures for the five-year period 1961-&#x2019;66 indicate. The white population increased from 3,117,000 to 3,480,000. <span class="col_5935-5936" refersTo="page_0172"/>The Coloured population over the same period increased from 1,540,000 to 1,805,000. The position is that over the five-year period the Whites in this country only increased by 364,000, including the immigrants. One must accept that over the five-year period we had a substantial number of immigrants. I could guess even as low as 100,000, which is their contribution to the increase in the population. This is a shockingly low figure for the white population to increase by. Obviously, we have been losing people over the same period as a result of emigration. It is appalling to think that the white population in this country increased over a five-year period by 364,000 and the Coloured population&#x2014;a population half the size of the Whites&#x2014;which in 1961 amounted to 1,548 million, increased by natural means alone to 1,800,000, in other words, an increase of 240,000. If they were to be 3,100,000, the obvious increase would have been 500,000, whereas we could only increase by 360,000, including immigrants.</p>

<p>This is my point, namely that anybody who is concerned about the continued existence of white civilization at the southern point of Africa, must be concerned at the slow tempo at which we are succeeding to get immigrants into this country. To me it is a major problem. Major contributions should be made and major schemes should be undertaken whereby we can get more immigrants. I put this point of view before, and I now want to put it to the Minister again. This applies in quite a number of the countries that have been so successful in attracting immigrants, and then consequently had inflation, as the result of the people who came in. This is the case with Canada as well as Australia. But now that inflation has decreased, they still want immigrants badly because of the same shortage of manpower that we have. If foreign capital wants to establish an industry in Australia&#x2014;even capital in conjunction with Australian capital, if it is motivated by foreign enterprise&#x2014;the condition applies that the industry must import a certain percentage of their technical personnel.</p>

<p>When I visited the assembly plant of the Chrysler Company manufacturing Valiant cars in Victoria Australia only last year, I found to my surprise the condition applied that they had to import 75 per cent of their technical personnel. In the case of an assembly plant, I would suggest that the majority of the personnel are technical people. In the painting department of this particular plant they had as many as 92 per cent of Italian immigrants to do the painting. If we had the same sort of conditions applying in this country five years ago and also to-day. I suggest that with the industrialization of this country and the end of anti-inflationary measures&#x2014;and I hope they cease before long&#x2014;and if the same sort of regulations were to apply here so that foreign capital, in conjunction with South African capital, had to import a certain percentage of technical people, this would be an enormous boost to immigration. I am aware of the problems that will be brought up by hon. members on the other side of the House, and that people would say, for example: If this is Japanese capital, what do we do? Do we bring all their technical people here? I want to suggest for the consideration of the hon. Minister that this is a very important method, an instrument, a lever, whereby one can force people who want to spend their money here and make money out of the country&#x2014;or else they would not put up their plants here&#x2014;to adopt the same sort of attitude. They should also be compelled to import a certain percentage of their technical people. I am saying this, because if you are in the technical sphere, you are obviously dealing with white people only. There can, therefore, then be no argument that we are trying to do away with job reservation, or some other stupid argument that might come from that side of the House. I hope that the hon. the Minister will have time to give some consideration to this aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, up to now we have had an interesting debate on this important matter of immigration. One thing is very certain, i.e. that the policy of the hon. the Minister and the Government, as well as the implementation thereof, is so fundamentally sound that the United Party is in reality finding it very difficult to level any criticism at it. We are very grateful for that &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We are very grateful that that is the attitude which the United Party is adopting here to-day. You will remember that last year under this Vote that is what I pleaded for, and we are grateful that they have heeded this request.</p>

<p>A political opponent is never more dangerous than when he begins to stalk you on his stockinged feet. Now, that is what is happening here. Although one must be grateful for the support of the United Party, and although this matter is, in their opinion as well, a very important one, there are, however, aspects which one has to face up to squarely. I want to point out that a week ago, on 19th May, 1968, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, according to a statement which he made in the <i>Sunday Times</i> stated that-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Have you noticed how often the Government has had to adopt stated United Party policy as its own? In 1948 we were told that our immigration policy would plough the Afrikaner under. Now the Government is scouring Europe for large numbers of immigrants and is spending more money to obtain them than at any time before.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that is not correct. We must first thrash out this matter, and rectify it so <span class="col_5937-5938" refersTo="page_0173"/>that it is cleared up once and for all. The National Party has never taken over the policy of the United Party as far as immigration is concerned. Do you know what the policy was which the United Party followed in those years? It was such a bad policy that even today we are picking the bitter fruits of it. The hon. member for East London (City) advocated, and asked for more immigrants from our countries of origin. Do you know what the United Party did in 1947-&#x2019;48 when they were still in power? 91 Per cent of the immigrants which came to South Africa during those years, when the United Party was following their policy of letting this take their course, and threw open the gates of South Africa, originated from one country only, namely Great Britain.

<p>Less than 10.5 per cent of the immigrants originated from the other Western countries of origin. During the years 1946 to 1948 the United Party brought as many as 55,000 immigrants from one country, Britain. Do you know what number they brought out from the rest of Europe? Only 5,500. This caused the Afrikaners to say to them, &#x201C;You are bringing out people to plough the Afrikaner under&#x201D;. And that is where our resistance to immigration was born. That is why I say that the United Party only had itself to blame for this opposition. It is a pity that this opposition was built up amongst our people. However, it is owing to the shortsighted policy which the United Party followed. Just look at how the United Party has changed. The hon. member for East London (City) is asking for more immigrants to be brought out from the countries of origin, but when they were in power, almost no immigrants were brought out from the actual countries of origin.</p>

<p>Let me tell you what the National Party has done in regard to immigration. One must face up squarely to the fact that it has taken almost 10 years to break down the opposition which arose amongst our people as a result of the short-sighted policy of the United Party. Only after that was done could the Government come forward with a properly planned immigration scheme. In contrast to the policy which the United Party followed, which was totally wrong, the National Party came forward in 1961 with its immigration scheme. Now the hon. the Leader is stating, and the same thing was insinuated here during this debate, that we have taken over their policy. Nothing can be further from the truth than this same insinuation. In contrast to the policy of the United Party, the Government came forward with a planned and balanced immigration scheme. That is the difference between our policy and the policy of that side, and it is a very important difference. This balanced immigration scheme stands in shrill contrast to the one the United Party applied. Let me quote a few figures in this regard. In 1947 the United Party brought out 25,513 people from Great Britain, and in 1964 the National Party allowed 12,807 in. In 1946 the United Party brought out only 1,000 people from Holland, whereas in 1967 we brought out almost 2,000. We doubled the figure. In 1946 they brought out one person from Germany whereas in 1965 the National Party Government allowed a total of 3,591 to enter. In this way we have applied a balanced pattern of immigration from our countries of origin. We have introduced such a balance in this situation that where they obtained more than 90 per cent from one country only, something which led to opposition here, we have up to the present obtained 50 per cent from that country&#x2014; and we regard it as a friendly country&#x2014;while we have brought 31 per cent of our immigrants out from our other countries of origin. They were not even able to obtain 9 per cent from that source. Even a child could see which one of these two schemes is the more balanced one.</p>

<p>I have now indicated that the United Party cannot say that we have taken over their policy in this respect. I want to add the following. In 1946-&#x2019;47 the United Party had a nett gain of 49,019 immigrants, but owing to the short-sighted policy which they followed at that time, because there were not enough houses and other facilities here, no fewer than 49,000 and the odd hundred people left South Africa again permanently during the following four years, i.e. 1948 to 1951. That is why I maintain that that side should be careful and should not merely try to make political capital out of this matter because it is not true that the National Party took over the immigration policy of the United Party. Consequently I hope that this will now be the end of that story.</p>

<p>I also want to raise a second matter, a matter which has recently been unfairly exploited by some Opposition members and by some newspapers. I am referring to the particularly remarkable change which has taken place in the immigration pattern of the National Party in respect of certain countries, and I am referring now to the Mediterranean countries. This decrease has been exploited to the utmost by certain Opposition members and certain newspapers. I definitely think that they are doing this to the detriment of our country. I want to tell them that they must put a stop to this as well, and that is why I am now dealing with it here. What are the facts of this matter? This changing tendency is not attributable to any discriminating measures on the part of South Africa or on the part of this Government. I want to state with the greatest emphasis that the stated policy of our Government is that it does not discriminate: It does not discriminate on the basis of nationality or on the basis of religion. For us there are only acceptable or unacceptable persons or families in terms of the Aliens Act, and there is absolutely no reference in this Act to the nationality or to the religion of a person. Let there not be the <span class="col_5939-5940" refersTo="page_0174"/>least doubt about this. Now the United Party and certain newspapers are exploiting these matters in order to play off one faith against another, and that is of course a great pity. The facts of the matter are as follows. Steps taken by the relevant Mediterranean area governments themselves to discourage largescale immigration of skilled workers from their countries because they were themselves in need of skilled workers, have resulted in a diminished exodus of such people to South Africa. Some of these countries, such as Portugal, even went so far as to place a restriction on the number of skilled workers which were allowed to leave the country. That is the first factor. {Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House listened with a great deal of interest to the hon. member who has just sat down. He said most of our immigrants had come from the United Kingdom when the United Party was in power, and to-day, so he said, they are getting a larger number of immigrants from the Continent. It would he interesting to hear whether the hon. member finds any fault with the immigrants from the United Kingdom. Can he point a finger at any one of them and say he has not been a good and loyal South African since his arrival in this country? As I said, the hon. member said the United Party government brought a lot of immigrants from the United Kingdom. That may be so. He also said we only brought one immigrant from Germany in 1946 whereas the Government has brought several thousand. But he did not mention the number of immigrants this Government has brought from Portugal. Perhaps we have some affinity with Portugal, as the hon. member claims we have with Britain and the Continent.</p>

<p>I want to deal with something the hon. member said in a previous speech, when he said we must either have immigration or else integration. I find that remark most interesting. It would appear now that the Whites of South Africa cannot be saved by apartheid any longer. However, it can be saved by means of immigration. I thought this a most curious statement to make. I think the hon. member is being most illogical and most stupid if he thinks the white people of this country will be saved by immigration. Have hon. members opposite lost faith in their own policy? Do they now say the Whites here will not be saved by apartheid but by immigration? If the choice is between immigration and integration, what happened during those 12 years when the Nationalist Party stopped immigration? Were they prepared to have integration at that stage? Is it only now that they realize immigration may save their skins? I want to tell that hon. member that, we on this side of the House have never been frightened of the future of the white man in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned for lunch I had a few remarks I wanted to direct to the hon. member for Primrose who has turned out to be the &#x201C;champion&#x201D; of immigration. I noticed that he spoke on the radio in the programme &#x201C;Top Level&#x201D;. [Interjections.] The question is, as my colleagues say, how &#x201C;top&#x201D; can you get? I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is not a little nervous about the verkramptes from that side taking over his job, because I would have thought that the hon. the Minister himself would have dealt with this question if it was to be done at top level. In the talk of the hon. member for Primrose he said that the Government had always welcomed immigrants to this oountry. I want to say that the time is not far distant when I, as an immigrant, was called a third-class citizen in South Africa. I was a person who fought in the South African forces but I was, according to that Government, only a third-class citizen. [Interjections.] I should also like to say to the hon. the Chief Whip, if he believes the hon. member for Primrose, that it was not so long ago that this Government for instance discriminated against religious workers coming to South Africa. A school was established in Port Elizabeth to treat the Bantu deaf and dumb, but after four or five years they had to abandon the scheme because this very Government would not allow them to bring their teachers into this country. This is a Government which says that it has always welcomed immigrants. I would say that that is a downright lie. This is a Government that has always &#x201C;welcomed&#x201D; immigrants, but in &#x201C;welcoming&#x201D; immigrants we have lost one million white South Africans during the period that they stopped immigration altogether.

<p>Because I have as much right as you have and more to be here. We need immigrants in South Africa. We on this side of the House have said so for many years. The only way the white man in South Africa can be saved is by the intelligent use of our labour resources which are already here. To make intelligent use of our labour resources we have to have a far more intelligent Government than that of which we have had evidence over the past 20 years. I believe that we should put the whole question of immigration in its proper perspective.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a good idea. I can tell the House for instance that since the Nationalist Party has been in power they have averaged no more than 4,000 immigrants per year. That is the average for the 20 years they have been in power. When the United Party was in power our average was 17,000 immigrants a year. Now let us hear all this talk about the Nationalist Party welcoming immigrants. Before they boast too much about immigration I should like to tell them that in Australia they exceed our figure for immigration by more than 100,000 immigrants each year. I should like to ask hon. members opposite, and particularly the hon. the Minister, how many of the immigrants that have come to South Africa during the past 20 years have become South African citizens? The figure I have here is that no more than 36,000 immigrants out of the 200,000 that came to South Africa have adopted South African citizenship. Perhaps there are many reasons for this. I would suggest that one of the reasons is the contents of a report that appeared in this morning&#x2019;s newspaper which said that it took no fewer than six European policemen to interfere with a game of soccer played by children. This report appeared in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times.</i> If an immigrant comes to this country and sees this kind of thing, what encouragement is there for him to take out South African citizenship?</p>

<p>I should also like to say to the hon. the Minister that in 1963 he stated that immigration to South Africa had saved South Africa R15 million in technical schools, training, etc. I think that that is a very interesting statement, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would be kind enough to tell me how much it has cost South Africa in respect of the 138,000 people who have left South Africa since this Government came into power. What has the cost to South Africa been since this Government came into power? I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister why it cost three times as much to bring an immigrant from Germany&#x2014;the favourite hunting ground of the hon. member for Primrose&#x2014; as it does to bring out an immigrant from the United Kingdom, because that is what the figures reveal.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the nickname given to the hon. member for Port Natal is the &#x201C;orphan lamb&#x201D; of this House. Through his veiled reference to the report in this morning&#x2019;s newspaper on the soccer players he once again showed that the United Party, as we are always telling them, is in reality an integrationistic party, and that they advocate a policy of integration. We are grateful to him for making this so apparent. Secondly, I want to tell him that if he wants to get onto the &#x201C;Top Level&#x201D; programme, all he has to do is work very hard and do his level best, and it will not be necessary for him to stand up and make jealous comments in this House in regard to the &#x201C;Top Level&#x201D; programme.</p>

<p>Every speech which we have had from that side up to now in this debate, indicates one thing, i.e. that the United Party can be characterized by saying that they have become a &#x201C;band-wagon party&#x201D;. There they sit. They are a band-wagon party because they are now trying to climb onto the National Party bandwagon every time. To-day they tried to climb onto the immigration band-wagon. I indicated to them that they did not dare try to do this because their policy in the past was a totally bad policy. We have paid very dearly in this country for that short-sighted, unplanned and bad policy of theirs. In this way they also tried to climb onto the band-wagon of the National Party in regard to Bantu affairs and other matters. Then they still have the temerity to. accuse us of talking over their policy. I think the people outside are slightly amused at the United Party because of this manoeuvre of theirs.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Port Natal also discussed citizenship. I want to tell him that last year during this same debate I predicted that as soon as the time was ripe, since our immigration scheme only came into operation in 1962, the position would be more favourable. If that hon. member knows anything about immigration, he would know that it takes five years before immigrants can apply for citizenship. It was only possible for them to apply for citizenship for the first time towards the end of 1967. I made the prediction last year that when the time came we would be able to indicate that our citizenship figures were very sound. This I shall now do. In 1961 the nett gain was 7,672 immigrants of foreign nationalises. Five years later 4,505 applied for naturalization, i.e. 38.2 per cent of the nett gain acquired citizenship. The figures for 1962 are the last figures we had in regard to citizenship. Next year I shall come to this House again and inform those hon. members what progress has been made with this matter. We are making progress, because we are getting good immigrants. We have a planned immigration scheme, and not merely a &#x201C;let things take their course&#x201D; scheme such as the United Party always had. We are not making a mess of our policy, such as the United Party made. That is why the nett gain in 1962 was 11,797 immigrants, of which 6,958 immigrants acquired citizenship, that is to say 68.9 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="col_5943-5944" refersTo="page_0176"/>That is an increase of 20 per cent in one year. Now I can predict again what I predicted last year, i.e. that next year under this Vote we will again be able to show how our immigrants are, to an increasing extent, acquiring South African citizenship.</p>

<p>But I want to return to a matter which I raised earlier on and I want to state with the greatest emphasis that we are not opposed to immigrants from the United Kingdom, as the figures of our immigration scheme indicate, namely that 50 per cent of the immigrants to-day originated from thence. I also want to state clearly that I am not personally opposed to that, but the point is&#x2014;and I am saying this because I do not want to have it exploited again&#x2014;that under the United Party rule they brought out people almost exclusively from Britain and that it was at that time the stated policy of the United Party Government to try and plough the National vote under in that way. [Interjections.] That is what gave rise to the opposition, that is what caused the lack of confidence, and that is what brought about the rejection of the United Party at that time, so that they now present the aspect that they do. And then they have the temerity to speak about a million white immigrants whom we have lost. As far as that matter is concerned, I want to state that if they had not been so short-sighted, we need not have lost them. But in contrast with that short-sighted policy, it is the stated immigration policy of the National Party, and that of the Government to consolidate the white man here by means of four very explicit assurances which it is giving to the nation, and I am now going to repeat them. The first is that this Government will see to it that immigrants do not deprive our people of their work; secondly, that the Protestant denominational ratio in this country will not be upset by immigration; thirdly, that unassimilable elements will be excluded from this country; and fourthly, that care will be taken to ensure that immigration does not become a threat to the language, culture or religion of any white ethnic group in South Africa, or endanger the future of any population group here. More explicit than that I cannot be. But I have stated that during the past two or three years one particular characteristic of our immigration policy was clearly discernible. This was that we were not obtaining skilled workers to an increasing extent from the Mediterranean areas because those countries themselves had imposed restrictions on that. Now I want to mention very interesting figures in this regard. In 1966 we had 6,162 applications from prospective immigrants in Portugal for permanent residence in South Africa. Do you know how that has diminished? In 1967 only 1,900 persons from Portugal applied for permanent residence here. The number of applications from Greece was 1,200 in 1966, and this diminished to 800 in 1967. From Italy there were 2,600 applications in 1966, and this diminished to 1,900 in 1967. [Interjections.] Yes, it is in reply to a question put by the hon. member for Green Point that I am quoting these figures. You see therefore, Sir, that the facts show that the position was as a result of action taken by those counries, and that here was no discriminaion on our part against specific nationalities or on the basis of religion. I hope that with this I have nullified any arguments with which the hon. member for Green Point or any other member wanted to come forward here this afternoon.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would just like to read the following report published in <i>The Star</i> of 17 November, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Portuguese immigration to South Africa this year is likely to be 60 per cent down on the figure for 1966, according to preliminary official estimates in Lisbon</block>

<p>It simply proves that you must not exploit the situation by saying that we are discriminating against nationalities, which is what you do, and this also proves that newspapers should refrain from doing the same thing. [Interjection.] I never said that: I denied it.</p>

<p>But in contrast to this immigration pattern which I have just mentioned, it is interesting to note, as a result of the brilliant work of the officials or our Immigration Department&#x2014;and I want to pay the greatest tribute to them this afternoon&#x2014;and the brilliant work of our hon. the Minister, Mr. Trollip, who is an excellent Minister of Immigration and for whom I also have the greatest praise, what progress we have made with immigration from our countries of origin. In 1966 we received 1,300 applications from the Netherlands for permanent residence in South Africa, and that increased to almost 2,000 in 1967. From Germany this figure was 3,000 in 1966, and it increased to 4,500 in 1967. From Austria this figure was 600 in 1966, and this has increased to more than 1,000 in 1967. From France this figure was 400 in 1966, and it increased to almost 600 in 1967, and so I can continue. But the following figures, particularly for the year 1968, indicate that the tendency is still to obtain more immigrants from our mother countries, and by so doing to establish a balanced, planned pattern of immigration in this country. What I want to mention is that in the first two months of this year, in contrast to the first two months of last year, our percentage of immigrants from the following countries increased as follows. This presents a fine picture, and is a wonderful compliment to our Minister of Immigration. From Austria there was an increase if 88 per cent, from Belgium an increase of 90 per cent, from Germany an increase of 46 per cent, from the Netherlands an increase of 73.7 per cent, and from the United Kingdom an increase of 20.9 per cent. Now I maintain that thanks to this National Party Government of ours we have, in contrast to the mess made by the United Party, a brilliant, balanced immigration <span class="col_5945-5946" refersTo="page_0177"/>pattern to-day, with a steadily increasing predominance of immigrants from our mother countries, on which the whole of South Africa can rightly be proud, particularly if one takes into consideration the major problem which had to be overcome.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It surprises me that a man who is preparing to become Minister of Immigration, can stand here so open-eyed and contradict himself. In the same ten minute speech he says in one breath that there is no discrimination as far as religious convictions are concerned; in other words, no notice is taken of what a man&#x2019;s religious conviction is when he applies to become an immigrant. But just a little later he says that it is the policy, and these are his words, not to upset the religious balance in South Africa. How does he reconcile those two points? How can one avoid upsetting the religious balance if one takes no notice of and therefore does not discriminate upon the grounds of religion as far as the admission of immigrants is concerned? Let him now reconcile those two points for us. But I shall return to this shortly.</p>

<p>What astounds me&#x2014;and I had hoped that to-day we could avoid this type of debate which we have had so often in the past&#x2014;is this. It cannot be denied, and the hon. member for Primrose can dance around as much as he likes, that the Government has undergone a change of policy as far as the principle of immigration is concerned. I can quote <i>ad nauseum</i> from the propaganda which was made in 1948. I can read out articles written against immigration by its previous leader, in which its leader said that immigrants only came to South Africa to eat one&#x2019;s food, to displace one from one&#x2019;s home and to deprive one of one&#x2019;s work. He wrote this in the <i>Transvaler,</i> and I can quote numerous similar articles and speeches. This was the attitude of the Government, and we did1 not get up to-day to attack the Government on that again. Those are old stories, and who wants to rake up old stories over and over again? But now that hon. member comes along and denies it, and all that we say is that we are not interested in whether they have taken over the policy of the United Party, but we are interested in the fact that the Government has undergone a drastic change in its attitude to immigration, and this is to the good. It has suddenly changed front, and it will still do so in connection with many other things as well. The fact of the matter is that the Government has changed its view, and the difficulty which the hon. member for Geduld sketched and which the party is to-day faced with in regard to certain of its own people, is because it created its own Frankenstein. It propagated the idea that immigrants come here to eat our food and deprive us of our homes and jobs; that idea was implanted by the propagandists of that party, and now they sit with the results. Now they are having difficulties with their own people. Just as in the case of many other matters of policy, they incited people in a certain direction and that is why the verkramptes are there to-day. What is the whole struggle between the <i>verligtes</i> and the <i>verkramptes</i> about? It is because they incited people in one direction, and now that they have to follow another direction, they are left holding the baby.</p>

<p>But where the hon. member is totally wrong is in his interpretation of the immigration policy of the United Party. Not a word of what he said is correct. Let me now say this to the hon. member. He says every time that under the United Party 91 per cent of the immigrants were &#x201C;brought in&#x201D; from England. Let me just put the facts to him. There was no policy of State-aided immigration after the war. The hon. member can look up the Constitution of the United Party, as drawn up by Generals Hertzog and Smuts, and he will find that it contained a section which prohibited State-aided immigration. The pre-war policy of the party, and also of the Nationalist Party at the time, was against State-aided immigration. But after the war, when England and also large parts of Europe had been devastated, there was an influx of the best type of immigrant, a natural immigration. We undertook no recruitment in Britain. It is quite wrong to say that the immigrants were &#x201C;brought in&#x201D;. There was an influx of immigrants to South Africa, and I shall explain why it happened that so many came from Britain. Apart from the connection which South Africa had with England, we had&#x2014;and this was the major factor&#x2014;a contract with the Union-Castle Line. Most ships had been destroyed and many immigrants from Europe could not get out because there was no transport. But as a result of a contract which we had with Union-Castle, free shipping was at that time made available for immigrants with the assistance of the Government. It is therefore quite wrong for any member to say that immigrants were &#x201C;brought in&#x201D;, because it was not necessary to do so. This Government governed so well at that time, and South Africa&#x2019;s standing was so high in the world, that it was not necessary for us to send beggars to Europe to obtain immigrants. They came of their own accord. The Government now has to go begging. The hon. member now says that only one came from Germany, but at that time we had just been at war with Germany, rightly or wrongly, and surely it goes without saying that immediately after a war, when one country has fought against another, you are not going to have an influx of immigrants from that country. But even to-day they are obtaining fewer than 3,000 from Germany. Surely this is chicken-feed. But now I want to say this. Here is a man sitting next to me who was a Minister in a former Cabinet. He was Minister of Economic Affairs. With the object of achieving a balance in immigration, he personally went to the Netherlands and held disoussions with the Dutch Government and negotiated with them for more Dutchmen to come here. The Dutch Government said to him that they themselves were in difficulties <span class="col_5947-5948" refersTo="page_0178"/>because they had to build up the Netherlands again and could not give him artisans; but they were prepared, if South Africa would finance it, to allow a few thousand farmers to come out, and those negotiations were in progress when the change of government came about. There had therefore been a positive endeavour on the part of the then Government to maintain the balance by obtaining as many Dutchmen as possible. The immigration plan was stopped by this Government immediately after the change of government. I want to state very clearly here that that old story of the hon. member for Primrose which we hear in this House from time to time is totally unfounded, and I hope that he will not use the term &#x201C;brought in&#x201D; again, because South Africa had a natural influx of immigrants, and there were no immigration recruiting offices. The hon. member made another incorrect statement and that is that it was the declared policy to &#x201C;plough the Nationalist vote under&#x201D;. Where is that declared policy stated? I can quote their declared policy in regard to immigration to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now that I have disposed of this matter, I should like to put a question or two to the hon. the Minister before my time expires. I was asked to make inquiries about a matter of policy, and this concerns the case of a woman who was refused permission for permanent residence by the Immigrants Selection Board on the grounds&#x2014;I quote from a letter from the Secretary for Immigration in English&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board is not prepared to issue immigration permits to religious workers in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is an official letter, an official statement by the Government, and I would be glad if the hon. the Minister, in view of the statement that there is no religious discrimination, would explain to us precisely what the background to this standpoint is and what the official policy in this connection is.</p>

<p>I wish to agree with what the hon. member for Geduld said in his speech.

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout and a previous speaker on that side said here that it was not the policy of the United Party Government to bring in immigrants to plough Afrikanerdom under.

<p>Whether he was at that time a Minister of the Crown or whether he was High Commissioner is beside the point; the fact remains that he was appointed by the United Party Government and spoke on their behalf. He said: &#x201C;We will bring immigrants in to plough the Afrikaners under&#x201D;. Last year the hon. member for Welkom or another hon. member on this side proved with chapter and verse that General Smuts also said: &#x201C;Bring them in, the good and the bad, in their thousands, in their tens of thousands&#x201D;. Sir, hon. members of the Opposition cannot get away from this part of history; they are firmly bound to that part of our history. Sir, at the beginning of this debate a fairly calm atmosphere prevailed here, but then the hon. member for Port Natal came along and made a political issue of the question of immigration. Well then, if the Opposition wants to do that, we can do it too. Sir, as far as the National Party is concerned, there has been no change of policy. The hon. member for Primrose explained here what the basis of the National Party&#x2019;s policy in regard to immigration was. I declare categorically that the National Party Government still adheres fully to the policy which was announced by the National Party in 1936, when it was still in opposition. That policy was again expounded in 1946 by Dr. Malan in a debate about immigration which was conducted here in the House of Assembly while the National Party was still in opposition. Hon. members may look it up in Hansard. The Government&#x2019;s immigration policy is still based on that to-day. Sir, the hon. member for Port Natal said that we had lost one million immigrants as a result of our policy. He should rather say that the United Party lost a million votes, potential votes, because that is actually what it boils down to, and it is for that reason that the Opposition is dissatisfied.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred, in his first speech, to Dutch immigrants who could emigrate to Australia at little expense to themselves. I want to point out to the hon. member that Australia acceps any immigrant. Australia does not have a selective immigration pattern. South Africa, on the other hand, does have a selective immigration pattern. Australia accepts unskilled immigrants while we only want skilled ones. The hon. member is quite right, but he must remember what line Australia takes with its immigration pattern and what line we take with our immigration pattern.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, to continue in a somewhat calmer atmosphere:pleas are continually being made&#x2014;and I am glad that the hon. member for East London (City) also did so to-day&#x2014;for immigrants from our countries of origin, and for the immigration stream from our countries of origin to be intensified, and then special mention is made of the recruitment of immigrants from the Netherlands. We know that the Dutch immigrants are the most easily assimilated group of people here in South Africa, for understandable reasons. The greater part of our own nation consists of descendants of the Dutch. Since requests are now being made in this House of Assembly and outside for immigrants from the Netherlands, our immigration offices in the Netherlands and our immigration offices here&#x2014;the Department of Immigration&#x2014;are assiduously engaged in recruiting larger numbers for us from the Netherlands. I just want to make the statement here that as a result of the intensive effors being made we are succeeding in diverting an ever greater stream of Dutch immigrants to South Africa. I should like to illustrate this to you by means of the following informative statistics: In 1963 the Republic drew only 9.3 per cent of the total number of Dutch immigrants who emigrated to all parts of the world. In 1964 it drew 11.08 per cent; in 1965 it drew 12.85 per cent; in 1966 it drew 12.29 per cent and in 1967, last year, it drew 15.25 per cent. The number of immigrants which the Republic drew from the Netherlands was as follows: In 1963, 705; in 1964, 998; in 1965, 1,322; in 1966, 1,286; a small decrease as compared with the previous year, and in 1967 there was a large increase, and the number was 1,695. In January and February of this year we drew 316 immigrants, which indicates that 1968 will be a successful year as far as the drawing of immigrants from the Netherlands is concerned. To sum up, in 1967 2½ times as many immigrants were drawn from the Netherlands as in 1963. In 1967 five times as many immigrants	were drawn from the Netherlands as in 1961. I should like the hon. member for East London (City) to take note of these statistics. This success, this increase in numbers, is attributable to improved recruiting methods, to successful advertisements and also to the good relationships being built up as a result of immigration. Sir, we know that material considerations are the decisive factor for all immigrants, and we may accept that it is also the decisive factor in the case of Dutch immigrants; this is perfectly normal, but we are glad to know that a large number of the immigrants that come from the Netherlands are Deople who believe in the future of South Africa; that they are immigrants emigrating here specifically because they know in advance what the race policy of this Government, of the Republic of South Africa, is, and because they endorse it. Those people enter the country despite the advice of some of their countrymen who advise them against moving to South Africa. They come here despite what certain newspapers in the Netherlands have to say about our policy, despite the slandering of our policy and despite the slandering of the Republic on television. I just want to say in passing that we in South Africa have no room for immigrants who come here for material gain alone. For those who are disinterested in the future of South Africa, we have no room, because we know that in times of crisis those persons will not co-operate with us, that they will be the first to leave, but we have room for those immigrants who believe in the future of white civilization and the future of South Africa. We want them and their children in South Africa to strengthen our numbers and to ensure our future, and it is to these persons that the Government is directing its efforts, persons who do not only come here for economic gain, but who can also strengthen us spiritually as a nation. I do not have the slightest doubt that within the framework of our policy we shall draw still more of this type of immigrant. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not want to enter at any length into the dispute about immigrants from Holland, but I think the hon. member who has just sat down and the previous speaker on the other side of the House should look back into history and realize what really happened to Holland in 1948 when this Government came into power. They will find that that time coincided with the loss by Holland of her Indonesian colonies and the return to Holland of large numbers of Hollanders accustomed to what one might call a colonial type of life. Holland was extremely anxious to get these emigrants to emigrate almost anywhere but certainly to this country with whose people they had so much in common. I know this because I am concerned with the Medical Council and I know what difficulties we had at that time to get reciprocity through the Foreign Office of this country in order to get Holland doctors who were breaking stones on the roads in Holland into the country so that they could come to practise here.</p>

<p>Sir. I have nothing more to say on that aspect. I want to speak to the hon. the Minister on the question of the treatment which foreign doctors are receiving at the hands of his Department or, at any rate, at the hands of the Government. I am not sure whether his Department is responsible. Sir, the Medical Council has made great efforts to open our door to foreign doctors. The Medical Council went so far as to send a deputation consisting of the President, the Registrar, the Vice-President and a senior dentist to tour Europe at the expense of the Council to see what arrangements they could make with the countries of Europe for reciprocity. They had some limited success. The truth of the matter is that all the countries of Europe are short of doctors. <span class="col_5951-5952" refersTo="page_0180"/>Their populations are increasing, and unless more medical schools are established in those countries they cannot cope with the demand for medical services for their own people. The hon. the Minister has not had great success in recruiting doctors for this country, and it is not the fault of the Medical Council. There are immigrants who have come into this country under a special regulation which the Government agreed to promulgate some time back, in terms of which approved doctors could obtain restricted registration. The Department of Immigration is refusing to admit these gentlemen and women as immigrants so that they have no assured right to permanent residence. The Department&#x2019;s argument is that because the registration is limited these people are restricted to the point that they are not suitable people to become citizens. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the policy adopted by the veterinary department under the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. They admit approved veterinary surgeons only on the condition that they obtain citizenship within five years. That shows how keen they are to get them. They tell those people they must become citizens otherwise they will withdraw their recognition.</p>

<p>In this country the Medical Council has been able to give restricted registration to a large number of doctors. Each doctor must be approved by the council because the council has a duty to the public to supervise the quality of the doctors working among them, and to control the drugs, etc., which are under the control entirely in their use of doctors or veterinary surgeons. The limitation does not affect the practice of the doctor. These people have the same rights as far as the practice of medicine is concerned. They practise in exactly the same way as any other medical man can practise.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Within certain posts. The Minister knows if the universities or the research institutions want them they get them on restricted registration. There are several of them in the universities and in the Institute of Research. To my knowledge medical missionaries have been coming here for about 25 years now under this restriction. If the Minister were to obtain unrestricted registration for these medical missionaries they would immediately register and leave the Native areas, and in that respect we would be faced with a worse crisis than we have to-day in the Bantu areas. The restricted registration allows free practice in any Government post and it also allows unrestricted practice in any provincial post. Therefore there is a wide range of posts available to these people without any restriction, and many of them are occupied.</p>

<p>My point is this. The people who are already here in many instances wish to become citizens. I wish to quote from a letter which was sent out by the Department. Let me read a sentence: &#x201C;On receipt of proof that you have obtained unrestricted registration as a medical practitioner you will be given citizenship&#x201D;. That is the Department&#x2019;s policy. Let me continue: &#x201C;Government policy is to consider as immigrants only those persons who will be allowed to practise in South Africa without any restrictions.&#x201D; The restrictions only apply to posts, not to quality of practice. These people all have the same rights that any other doctor has, except that they are confined to certain posts, to certain types of posts where for certain reasons the Medical Council feels it is right they should be. It has given a wide opening. What is the effect now of the Minister&#x2019;s policy? Those who are here are trying to get out. They write to their colleagues abroad advising them not to come here. If these people go to America, for instance, and if they pass a certain examination and comply with certain other requirements they can practise in the normal way and they are welcomed as citizens. I say we are turning away potential citizens.</p>

<p>The Minister states, and it is true, that registration is restricted to five years. Except on one occasion, where a man was found guilty of unethical conduct, the Medical Council has never refused to renew the registration when asked for it. In other words, these people will be here for five, ten, 15, 20, 25 years and longer if they wish to remain on this same registration. There are people among them who do not want to do anything else than work for the Government; they like doing it. I have a letter here from a white immigrant from Tanzania. He would have been a citizen in one year if the Minister&#x2019;s Department had allowed that. Now he is practically a stateless person because he says in Italy where he comes from he is regarded as a tourist, he cannot give up his Italian passport and he cannot obtain a South A rican passport. I am sure the Minister is not doing it intentionally but at the moment he is turning away doctors who are allowed to practise in this country and encouraging them to tell their friends not to come here. I hope the policy will be changed now so that these people who have the right to practise and who will go on having the right to practise shall be allowed to become citizens of the Republic. As I say. some of these people are stateless and they must be given the right to become citizens.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now that the debate has moved into calmer water, I do not want to stir things up again. I nevertheless want to indicate that the debate has thus far indicated the following things. The first is that the United Party, through the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, has actually conceded that their immigration policy is one without any direction.</p>

<p>In the second place the United Party requests the reference upon which we hase our accusation. As a result of a speech of that side, the accusation was made by this side. I shall tell the hon. member where it comes from. Col. Deneys Reitz said at the time that under the circumstances which then prevailed it would be quite in order for &#x201C;the good, the bad and the indifferent&#x201D; to come from Great Britain to South Africa to act as a counterbalance because the census of 1941 had indicated how a certain population group, the Afrikaner, had increased in numbers here. But I do not want to elaborate on that point now. I want to proceed to something more positive.</p>

<p>I believe that the white man in South Africa, specially in view of the increasing numbers of non-Whites, will have to strengthen his numbers in the next 30 years if he wants to maintain his position here. I think that this fact is so obvious that it does in fact require no arguments. There are only two ways in which any nation, and therefore also our nation, can increase its numbers, namely by an increase in the birth rate and by immigration. There is no other method. I now want to make it very clear that in the National Party&#x2019;s population policy national growth via the cradle occupies a much more important place than any other aspect of the Government&#x2019;s population policy. We therefore place the greater emphasis and the highest premium on the population increase of the Whites via the cradle. We lay greater emphasis on that than on the other leg of our population policy, namely that of immigration. Thus it happened that Minister M. C. Botha has on occasion asked for more white babies. If I had any <i>locus standi</i> in this matter, I would have repeated that request here this afternoon; I would again ask for more white babies in South Africa because this is such a vital and such an extremely important matter. Because if we look at what the birth rate of our Whites in South Africa is, we find a very interesting picture. In 1960 it was 24.8 per thousand Whites. But 40 years ago the increase of Whites in South Africa was 32.8. It had decreased to 24.8 in 1960. But in 1965 the birth rate figure had decreased to 22.8 per thousand. According to estimates it will decrease to approximately 18 by the year 2000, that is within 32 years. Therefore in the year 2000 there will be 17 Whites for every 100 non-Whites, while there were 26.3 per 100 non-Whites in 1951, and 24 per 100 in 1960. If we take a serious look at this matter, and I think that it is the duty of every South African to do just that, it becomes very dear that immigration has become of vital importance to each white person in South Africa. That is why this Government is giving so much attention, and rightfully so, to this vitally important matter, and the Government would be failing in its duty if it was not giving that measure of attention to immigration.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to another point. The Government can follow a wise, balanced, planned immigration policy, as it is doing, and as I think has been proved in this debate. But there is one thing that a government cannot do. That the nation must do. And that is to absorb into the nation those immigrants who are in fact here and to have them properly integrated with the existing, established population in South Africa as soon as possible. I want to ask the question very seriously here this afternoon: Is the nation doing enough in connection with the assimilation of the immigrants whom we get in South Africa? And then I want to make a statement. I want to make the statement that, as a result of the competent work of the officials and the competent selection by the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board, I personally do not have any doubt whatsoever that the quality and type of immigrant which we are getting under this National Government in South Africa, is generally of the highest and best skilled quality, in general persons of character who can in fact make a contribution in South Africa. Since this is so, and since the Government is very scrupulous to allow only good, selected immigrants into the country, I want to draw attention to the following. And while I am dealing with this point, I do not want to expose myself to any misunderstanding. Let me point out that a considerable degree of misunderstanding about immigration exists in the ranks of our nation because of a very obvious fact. Many strangers enter the Republic each year, something in the region of 300,000 per year. That number is continually increasing. They are people who merely visit South Africa with an ordinary passport as tourists, students and businessmen. But they are not immigrants, only visitors. Among them there are people who sometimes do things which are not permissible. Such a person&#x2019;s name and surname then appear in the newspapers, and in no time it is simply accepted that such a person is an immigrant.</p>

<p>There is a second group of strangers who enter South Africa. Each year a certain percentage of persons enter the country illegally because South Africa is such an attractive country economically. They are not immigrants. The Government is doing everything in its power to keep those illegal immigrants out of the country and to deport those who have already entered the country illegally. But there are no immigrants among them. Among these persons entering the country illegally, there are many persons&#x2014;one hesitates to say this, but it is the truth; it is a fact which one can state&#x2014;who do South Africa no credit. Most of the illegal immigrants, if they had to <span class="col_5955-5956" refersTo="page_0182"/>go through the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board, or even obtain entry on a passport, would never be allowed into the country. This is, however, one of the problems with which we are faced. About 300,000 strangers enter South Africa annually, not one of whom is an immigrant. All those to whom I have referred up to now, were strangers. There is also a third group. They are strangers who apply for a permit for temporary residence in South Africa and they are not persons who have been selected by the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board. There are quite a number of people who are in South Africa with a temporary residence permit. As we know the Government began to apply strict measures in this connection at the beginning of 1967 in that persons can no longer obtain temporary residence permits unnecessarily. Not one of the three groups I have mentioned, includes a single immigrant. Why I am going into and dwelling on this matter, is simply to indicate that we should not labour under any misunderstanding; that the legitimately selected immigrants in South Africa are good people generally. They are selected with great care. The number of people who do not go through the Immigrants&#x2019; Selection Board and who are not the responsibility of the Department of Immigration at all, is a very large number, and the numbers are increasing each year to a figure considerably in excess of 300,000. On the other hand, the annual number of legitimately selected immigrants comes to approximately 35,000 only. It is in respect of these legitimately selected immigrants that I am asking whether our nation is doing enough to absorb these people so that they may become good, well-bred South African citizens as soon as possible. To simplify this matter, the Government has certain organizations in South Africa which it subsidizes. The &#x201C;Maatskappy vir Europese Immigrasie&#x201D;, for example, is doing brilliant work.

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Primrose has got me into trouble already, because during the recess I looked at speeches which he made and I found myself in the middle as to what standard I should apply and I applied the wrong standard as far as the officials and the Department is concerned. I am referring to the approach he made again this afternoon. He said that there would be no religious discrimination and that the religion of a would-be immigrant would not be taken into account. At the same time he hastens to add that the religious balance in South Africa will be maintained. In other words, immigrants will not be allowed to upset the religious balance. Those two things do not go together. Either there is religious discrimination and the religion of an applicant is taken into account, or there is not. The hon. member went further and quoted a number of figures. I want to remind him of an expression I once heard from an accountant, namely that figures never lie, but that liars can figure. In other words, one can prove anything if one goes on quoting enough figures fast enough to an audience in front of one. He suggested that the Government had been able, by judicious handling, to shift the emphasis of immigrants from what might be known as Roman Catholic countries to our &#x201C;stamlande&#x201D;. He showed how there had been a reduction in immigrants from European countries which are not really countries of origin and that there was more emphasis on immigrants from countries of origin. The hon. member should know that that was not brought about by any action on the part of the Department of Immigration, but by a new approach in those countries towards whether they would allow emigrants to leave those countries. The change of emphasis is, therefore, shifted to those countries where people are allowed to leave and to emigrate to South Africa. This is no proof of an application of a policy of discrimination between people who come from different countries. The hon. member went further and made his case even worse by trying to prove that this was managed or controlled by Government agencies. He was quoting the figure of applications and not of acceptances. If he had quoted figures for approved immigrants and has shown how those had been reduced percentagewise against applicants, then we would say that the Government was controlling the position.</p>

<p>But I have actually risen this afternoon to clear up a matter with the hon. the Minister. As a result of a pamphlet by the hon. member for Primrose and also as a result of statements by him which were publicized in the Press that drastic steps had been taken to curb the inflow of Roman Catholics into this country purely on religious grounds, I made a public statement in Cape Town on a certain occasion in which I criticized the hon. the Minister very severely in the light of these statements. I criticized him because of the fact that through a Government Department discrimination on religious grounds was being practised and that that was foreign to the attitude which has been adopted by South Africans throughout the history of our country. The hon. the Minister indicated that my comments were not justified. I then entered into some correspondence with him. I want to say this afternoon that as a result of what he wrote to me&#x2014;and I use this correspondence with his permission this afternoon&#x2014;I am prepared to accept, and I hope it will be accepted and understood throughout the country, that we will have an end to this argument. The hon. the Minister said to me that it is abundantly clear that the Government does not discriminate on the grounds of nationality or religion. I hope that in those circles where for the pleasure of their listeners one has to hear people talk about making sure that we will not have too many of this or too many of that type of immigrant, there will now be an end to that talk as a result of this official <span class="col_5957-5958" refersTo="page_0183"/>statement, namely that as far as immigration is concerned the religious beliefs of an applicant are not taken into consideration in determining his suitability as a candidate to become a citizen of South Africa. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I regret having made this criticism which I have found to be unfounded in regard to the policy he applies to this aspect of immigration.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the atmosphere is so quiet now that I think that this is the opportunity I should take to reply to the debate so far. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is not here at the moment. I shall therefore deal with the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (Central) immediately, until the hon. member for Bezuidenhout returns, because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised a range of subjects which I think covers most matters raised by other hon. members as well. I have a comprehensive reply for the hon. member. The hon. member for Durban (Central) knows that my department has had a difference of opinion with the Medical Council of which he is a member for the past six years. I think that we have made our position abundantly clear, namely, that if a doctor wants to immigrate to South Africa and he has all the necessary qualifications, he should be registered here as a doctor. But the Medical Council does not take that view. As a result of this attitude the Medical Council under the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act promulgated an amendment to the existing regulations in terms of which doctors from overseas could get restrictive registration. What does restrictive registration mean? It means that that doctor is restricted in the practice of his profession. Although such doctors comply with all the qualifications laid down by the Medical Council, they still only get restrictive registration which means that they can only be employed in certain restrictive categories on a contract basis. That contract usually lasts for a period of five years. We take up the attitude that at the end of five years that doctor is out of work and that he has therefore no permanent employment in South Africa. Therefore initially he is not an immigrant. I want to ask the hon. member for Durban (Central) a question. Before I do so, let me just for a moment refer to the statement he made, namely that as far as veterinary surgeons are concerned, an amendment was passed two or three years ago giving them the right to come to South Africa and to get registration. They can go on to the register but they give un undertaking that at the end of five years they will apply for citizenship.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The fact is that they can apply for citizenship after five years and their registration is confirmed. I want to ask the hon. member whether his Medical Council will be satisfied if the Government adopts the same procedure in the case of doctors, as we do in the case of veterinary surgeons. This is a simple question. We look upon veterinary surgeons from overseas who have the right to come here and get registration and practise their profession as immigrants. We do not regard doctors from overseas who come here on a restrictive registration and who are restricted in the practice of their profession as immigrants. As a matter of fact they can only work for provincial councils and mission hospitals. That is the only work they can do.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I first want to get this matter absolutely clear. In putting his case the hon. member said: Why can you not do the same with doctors as was done a few years ago in the case of veterinary surgeons. I say that if the Medical Council is prepared to treat this matter on the same basis as the registration of veterinary surgeons we will allow medical doctors to come in as immigrants. That is the question. If the hon. member&#x2019;s Council is prepared to tell us that they are prepared to extend the same facilities to overseas doctors as are extended to veterinary surgeons, I will treat them as immigrants.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the points raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. In the first place the hon. member asks why there has been a decrease of over R800,000 on the Vote this year as compared with the Vote for 1967. I admit that the provision this year is considerably less than that for 1966-&#x2019;67 but it compares very well with the actual expenditure during 1966-&#x2019;67 when, of course, we had a record intake of immigrants. As hon. members know, 1966 was an extraordinary year; it was a record year. The actual expenditure for 1966-&#x2019;67 was R5,862,237 whereas our estimate for this year stands at R5,860,000 which is approximately R62,000 less. I want to tell hon. members that, with this estimate now before the Committee, we could still accommodate even more immigrants than we accommodated in 1966-&#x2019;67 because we have effected certain economies. I should like shortly to tell hon. members what those economies are. They were introduced towards the end of last year. In future persons who come to South Africa on holiday or as tourists and who then obtain permanent residence while they are still in South Africa will no longer be entitled to a contribution towards their passage costs. The hon. member for Primrose dealt with certain figures in regard to people who have come to South Africa as tourists and who liked the country so much that they decided to stay here. They then applied for permanent residence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<p>Do you not send them all back before they can apply?</p>

<from><span class="col_5959-5960" refersTo="page_0184"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is a difficult matter to deal with in a general way as I am only dealing with the financial aspect now. We do not now give them the State aid that we give to the ordinary immigrant.</p>

<p>Secondly, there were certain South Africans who left South Africa after December, 1961. Hon. members will remember that after Sharpeville a number of South Africans left South Africa for permanent residence abroad. They will now no longer qualify for financial assistance under the immigration scheme if they decide to return to South Africa. We did help them up to October last year, by means of financial assistance. But we think that those who left after December, 1961, and had not returned to South Africa and had not lodged their applications by the 1st October of last year should no longer be assisted. But we think that those who left after December 1961 and had not returned to South Africa and had not lodged their applications by the 1st October of last year should no longer be assisted. They have had plenty of time to make up their minds as to whether they want to return to South Africa or not. Thirdly, immigrants have been allowed to apply for financial benefits under our scheme without any time limit. They came to South Africa and did not avail themselves of the benefits of the scheme. They have acquired permanent residence here and thereafter they apply for financial aid under our scheme. We say now that unless they apply within 12 months, after they have arrived here, we are no longer prepared to assist them. All these particular alterations have had quite a good effect financially. That is why there has been this drop in the figure compared to last year&#x2019;s figure. First of all the 1966 figure was unusually high, but nevertheless the expenditure for that period was practically the same as the provision for this year, so that we do not anticipate that there will be any fewer immigrants this year than there were in 1967. On the contrary, we think that our figures are going to be higher this year than they were last year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. Does he not expect ever to do better than he did in 1966-&#x2019;67?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We are of course always optimistic. I need not stress the fact that conditions in Europe are difficult. As far as we can see at this stage the figures for the first four months of this year are considerably higher than those for the corresponding period last year. So that our efforts are good. But, as I say, on the Estimates there is quite enough money to make provision for a greater number than there was last year.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me what steps we had taken as regards publicity. He referred to this item in the Estimates of R174,000. Now publicity of course plays an extremely important part in the recruitment of immigrants overseas and our expenses are connected with certain publicity activities overseas. We send our immigration attaches to various places to address meetings. There are film shows and we have a distribution of propaganda material, and there is the placing of advertisements. Those are all reflected under this item. I can give the hon. member a breakdown of the expenses reflected under this item. Provision is made for an expenditure of R30,000 in the United Kingdom. Now in the U.K. there is no restriction on advertising. We can advertise as much as we like and in any form we like. In Holland the amount is R25,000. There there is a restriction on advertisement. We have to get the permission of the Dutch Government before we can advertise. In Germany the amount is R 10,000. There advertisement is also restricted. In Belgium it is R 11,000. In Austria it is R6,000, and in France it is also R6,000. In other countries no advertisement at all is permitted. But the aforementioned are the countries where we spend money on advertisements. Then, in addition in order effectively to maintain a publicity campaign with a view to attracting immigrants, the Department also makes use of suitable pamphlets. There are actually nine pamphlets dealing with matters which will interest intending immigrants. We have found that we have to reprint these pamphlets every year, because they become out of date very quickly.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to a speech which was made by my colleague, the Minister of Defence, where he referred to the question of the removal of Bantu from the Western Province, and he said that he hoped that we would be able to do something by way of attracting semi-skilled immigrants to South Africa. Well, it is perhaps a scheme which one might think of in the future, but at the moment I do not think it is practicable for various reasons, one of the chief being that there is not such a tremendous gap in Europe between the wages of skilled and semi-skilled men or unskilled men as there is in South Africa. If we had to bring semi-skilled immigrants to South Africa, we would find it very difficult to accommodate them in suitable employment, because their wages are very high. It may be a longterm project but we have not as yet given any attention to that proposition.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member and several other hon. members dealt with the question of the decrease in the birth-rate figures. The hon. member for Geduld, I think, also raised the matter. I think I should say that the purpose of our immigration policy and programme is not only to strengthen the Whites in South Africa. That is not our only object. By means of immigration we are supplementing and maintaining a labour force of skilled and trained workers which, of course is so essential for our economic upsurge and our industrial development. It is our white economically active population who to-day contribute the bulk of the supply of skilled manpower, and they create employment opportunities for our non-Whites. I think hon. members will agree <span class="col_5961-5962" refersTo="page_0185"/>with me that every skilled and trained worker who comes to South Africa as an immigrant creates employment opportunities for our unskilled workers. I think, therefore, that the immigration of skilled workers is as important, to us as it is to our non-Whites, because they create these opportunities. In other words, just to put it quite briefly, the object of our immigration scheme is twofold, firstly to ensure an adequate work corps of skilled and trained persons in order to maintain our economic progress and our industrial development, and secondly to create conditions which will ensure that all the inhabitants of the Republic of South Africa, irrespective of race or colour, will enjoy a decent standard of living. And of course, thirdly, and just as important it is to strengthen our white population. But I am trying to point out that there are other factors involved in this policy apart from strengthening our white population.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also asked me about the numbers of immigrants who came to South Africa last year and the various categories. I have the figures here. I am simply going to group them together because I do not want to bore the Committee. From Africa we got 10,452. from Europe 26,105. and from Asia 449. Those are white persons from Asian countries who came to South Africa. Persons from America numbered 987. That is from both South America and the U.S.A, and Canada. From Australasia, that is, Australia and New Zealand, we got 942, making a total of 38,937. That was the 1967 figure.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me whether it was not possible to have an annual report of the Department. Well, as hon. members know, each year I have given a comprehensive policy statement in the Other Place, in which I have covered the activities of the Department for the preceding year, but I agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I think the time has come when we should have an annual report of the Department, and I will see to it that one is issued in future.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member or Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for East London (City) expressed their concern that there had been this decrease in the intake of immigrants in 1967. As I have pointed out, in 1966 we had an exceptionally high intake from countries other than our &#x201C;stamlande&#x201D;, our countries of origin, and there were reasons for that. Firstly, there was an unprecedented demand for skilled workers in heavy industry, particularly the building industry. Hon. members will recall that in 1966. if it had not been for the immigrants absorbed in the building industry whom we were able to bring in, our building industry would have been in a parlous state. There is one particular firm in the Transvaal, one of the big building firms, which employs at least 800 to 900 immigrants. Secondly, the boom conditions in the country in 1966 attracted many visitors and workers to South Africa from all over the world, who on arrival here immediately obtained employment and thus qualified for permanent residence, provided of course they could comply with the other requirements of the Act.</p>

<p>Thirdly, skilled workers from the European countries to which I referred were actually available. That was in 1966, but in 1967 those same countries from whom we had received so many immigrants in 1966 began discouraging large-scale emigration of their skilled workers because they required them themselves, whilst it also became obvious that such skilled workers were no longer available as immigrants in large numbers, with the result that we had to step up our immigration recruitment. I think this fact is fully borne out by the figures I supplied to the hon. member for Green Point only a few weeks ago in reply to a question he put to me. I gave him all the figures, four or five pages of them and they can be found in Hansard, Col. 4783. On the other hand, 1966 was also marked by the unexpected increase of more than 4,000 immigrants from territories north of the Limpopo. If the trend revealed by the statistics for 1963, 1964 and 1965 had run true to form, we should have received 6,000 less immigrants from the north in 1966, than the 14,473 who actually came to South Africa. In other words, in 1966 we received 6,000 more immigrants from countries north of the Limpopo than we had anticipated. But I think it is of some significance to note that in 1967 the intake from our so-called countries of origin shows the following increases on the 1966 figures. In 1967 we had an increase of immigrants from our &#x201C;stamlande&#x201D; (countries of origin). From Austria we had an increase of 22 per cent; from Belgium 30 per cent; from Denmark 19 per cent; from France 47 per cent; from Germany 2 per cent; from Holland 29 per cent. It is to these countries that we are looking for an increase of immigrants.</p>

<p>As I have said, in 1967 there was a decrease of 5 per cent in the number <span class="col_5963-5964" refersTo="page_0186"/>of immigrants from the United Kingdom, but the figures that we have available so far for this year show an increasing trend, and it seems that that increase is going to be stepped up.

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) touched on the question of our industrial development and the desirability of industrialists bringing out their own industrial workers.

We have done it in the case of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think there are 14 countries represented in the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. All their skilled men are immigrants. If any industrial undertaking is short of skilled workers and are prepared to take immigrants we assist them to send recruiting teams over to Europe and the United Kingdom. We do the necessary publicity for them and we assist them to get immigrants from those countries. That is one phase of our policy. Then the hon. member made the point that in the case of an immigrant going from the United Kingdom to Australia it only cost him about R20. Let me tell him that more or less the same position applies to immigrants who come to South Africa. Our scheme is State-aided. The financial assistance we give amounts to R120 per person. A husband and wife would therefore get a grant of R240. A passage by plane costs them R150 each; so they are down R60, but if they have one child, that child also gets R120. The grant is also R120 for each child. If a family with any children come to South Africa, the grant that we give them covers the whole of their passage costs; it does not cost them anything. That is my answer to that particular point made by the hon. member. I think those are the only points made by the hon. member for East London (City).</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the further point made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in regard to religious workers. The position is that up to October, 1966, applications for permanent residence by clergy, and other religious workers, were granted by the Government in many cases. Unfortunately, as hon. members know, quite a number of these clergy did not confine themselves to the duties for which they were admitted to South Africa. On the contrary.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Government reviewed its policy in October, 1966, when it was decided that no religious workers would be granted permits for permanent residence, but that they would be admitted on temporary permits only. I think I should point out that this decision does not really create any hardship, nor need it limit such workers&#x2019; sojourn in the Republic provided they adhere to the conditions of their admission. When the permit expires it is renewed almost automatically. This policy as regards religious workers is strictly adhered to. It is applied without any exception to religious workers, irrespective of their denomination. It does not matter what their denomination is. In practice they are coming into South Africa on temporary permits for a period of three or five years, and at the end of that period, the permit is renewed. As I say, the renewal of the permit is almost automatic, but I can tell the Committee and the hon. member that the question of reviewing this policy will only be reviewed in the light of the manner in which these people conduct themselves in the Republic. It therefore depends entirely on them whether their activities and their behaviour justify a return to the previous policy.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think I have dealt with most of the points which have been raised here to-day.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the point made by the hon. member for Geduld regarding the language of immigrant children. It is an important matter and one which causes considerable concern to many people. As hon. members know, reeulations regarding the language medium in which children are to receive their schooling are made by the various provincial administrations, and as we all know they vary from province to province. However, the National Education Policy Act of 1967 which was passed by this House last year gives the Minister of National Education the power to determine policy regarding mother tongue instruction, be it English or Afrikaans. It, therefore, excludes such determination in resoect of immigrant school children whose mother tongue is not one of the two official languages. This is a question now for consideration by the National Advisory Education Council which, as we all know, is comprised of experts in the field of education. I think it can be safely accepted that in their deliberations and their recommendations they will not allow themselves to be influenced by political considerations or by expediency. As a matter of fact, my colleague, the Minister of National Education, when speaking in the Other Place about ten days ago, stated that he had called on the National Advisory Education Council for a recommendation in this respect, regarding the education of immigrant children. He then emphasized that such recommendation would be based on strictly educational considerations. It is a difficult matter, I admit, and it is something which requires the closest investigation.</p>

<p><span class="col_5967-5968" refersTo="page_0188"/>I know of English-speaking immigrants who want to send their children to Afrikaansmedium schools: They learn English in their own homes and they want to learn the other official language as well in school. Of course, it is Government policy that children must be educated in their mother tongue, but there are all sorts of difficulties in regard to this question as it affects immigrant children. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that the committee of this council will find a <i>via media</i> whereby the children can receive their education in one or the other official language and become fully bilingual. Our aim is to make immigrant children fully bilingual which is basic if they are to become good South Africans.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has attempted to reply to my request that he should reconsider the question of the treatment of immigrant doctors, and in doing so he has to some extent issued a challenge to me which I fear I cannot accept. I am quite sure the Minister does not really expect the Medical Council to relax its qualifications as to which doctors may practise in South Africa and to leave the discretion as to who shall and who shall not be a doctor in South Africa to the discretion of some distant official overseas or in some other continent. The Medical Council is charged with the duty of seeing that the people of South Africa have a well-trained and well-behaved medical profession, and that is a duty which they cannot delegate, least of all to some minor official in the Department of Immigration. Indeed, I am surprised that the Minister should have issued such a challenge, and in so doing he misquoted the position which obtains in the veterinary department. I voted against the veterinary department&#x2019;s recommendation in this House, and I went to great trouble to find out exactly what it was. That department said they would take anybody who is qualified, but if they did not become South African citizens within five years, they would take away their right to practise. They do not relate the right to practise to qualification as does the Medical Council; they relate the right to practise to citizenship. The Medical Council is unconcerned about citizenship. It is merely carrying out its duty and, as I say, it cannot delegate that duty.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_immigration">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to detain the Committee just for a few moments longer. I want to tell the Committee and the member for Durban (Central) that I personally cannot understand the attitude of the Medical Council as regards medical qualifications. Let me give an example. A South African goes overseas to Germany, Austria, France, Holland or Belgium and he goes to university there. If he takes a medical course it takes him seven years to qualify as a doctor. Sitting next to him in university is a German, an Austrian or a Frenchman who takes exactly the same course and the same degrees, and it also takes him seven years.</p>

<p>That South African can come back to South Africa, have his name put on the register, and he can practise, but as regards the Frenchman, the Austrian and the German, who have the identical qualifications, the Medical Council refuses to place them on the register, but gives them what they call restrictive registration.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have two or three questions which I want to put briefly to the Minister because I want to make certain representations which will take quite a while, and I only have a short time at my disposal. I should first like to ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to the debate whether he will give us the latest information concerning the formation of the Indian Council.</p>

<p>The second question is this. Will the Minister take into review the group areas which are being made available for Indians in terms of legislation administered by other departments. I am talking about those areas where they have a legal right to remain. From what I can see of it the group areas being established for the Indians are rapidly becoming crowded out. I put this point as one leading on to the next question. With the pressures building up in the group areas which have been established for the Indians, does the Minister foresee the possibility of Indian development taking place in what I would call a broad spectrum of industrial and commercial activity such as we might anticipate in a viable community? There are difficulties as far as the Indians are concerned, not only in regard to residence but in respect of other matters as well. I think for instance of the right to travel, and so forth. That being so, it seems to me that if there is to be any moral justification at all for the establishment of these group areas in the form and to the extent they are being established, some kind of viable community should be established there. I should like to have the Minister&#x2019;s reply on that in due course.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>May I just ask you whether you are tying this up with the question of representation on the Indian Council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No. The present position of the Indian Council, how far it has developed, is one question which is quite independent of anything else. When the new council is established it will be able to make representations itself to the Minister in regard to matters it may feel to be of importance, in the commercial or industrial sphere or what have you. The next question is that of the establishment of group areas where the Indians will live. I think here of Lenasia. That will be dealt with by a colleague of mine. In Natal <span class="col_5969-5970" refersTo="page_0189"/>we have for instance a place called Chatsworth where an enormous Indian population is building up. Not only are the Indians moving to that area but there is the question of the natural increase as well. Does the Minister see that ultimately as a viable community? Will there be room and adequate opportunity for commercial and industrial development to take place? If that is not the case, we will have vast groups of Indians in these areas which cannot become viable communities. Their opportunities are going to be limited, especially as their own population increases.</p>

<p>Now I come to the point I want to put to the hon. the Minister here. Because of the position the Minister formerly held in Natal, and I filled the same position some time before him, he will remember what the position is regarding the entry of Indians into Zululand. When he was Administrator there the hon. the Minister gave permits under certain conditions. I have no doubt that practice was followed previously as well. People who were commercial travellers, seeking orders from trading stations in Zululand, were given permits to be in that territory for a limited period of time. The powers conferred upon the Administrator of Natal, and still exercised by him, are powers which originated in the days of the Lieutenant-Governors in the old colonial days. They devolved upon the Administrator of Natal and not upon a department of state as such. The point I want to make is this. If one goes about Zululand today it is clear that an Asiatic population is growing up in Zululand which looks as if it is becoming established there. Some of them are associated with big industrial undertakings and factories, and to my mind that type of development in Zululand is on the brink of tremendous expansion. Probably we will see enormous industrial development in Zululand. Now it is argued, and with a great deal of truth, that often the Indians are much more adept with their hands and they are much more proficient as regards certain trades and certain types of work connected with big industrial undertakings than some of the Bantu. I want to ask the Minister what his policy is going to be in this regard. I say this trend should not be permitted to develop. The industrial undertakings in Zululand should be reserved for the Coloured people and the Bantu. I feel we are crossing the threshold and we are going to be in peril. I am not throwing bricks at the Minister in this regard. I assume the pressures are very considerable indeed. We have to meet these pressures to permit Indians to find employment in those factories. The Minister and his department will no doubt be told the Indians are there on a temporary basis only and will remain there only for so long as they are employed there; the moment they terminate their employment they will cross the border and go back to Natal. I hope the Minister is not going to accept that. I say, do not let them in. That is the best method to adopt.</p>

But that is not happening at the present time.

I would ask the hon. the Minister, as Minister of Indian Affairs, whether he would not make it his business with his colleagues to investigate this question, have a look at it, and find out in fact who is the authority that should be dealing with this matter.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast put a number of pointed questions to the hon. the Minister, questions to which he will probably give him <span class="col_5971-5972" refersTo="page_0190"/>a reply. In regard to the Indians in Natal he also made a few statements about which the Minister knows more than I do.</p>

<p>We all know that the Department of Indian Affairs was established in 1961, its objective being to undertake the economic, social and political development of the Indians in accordance with the pattern of the Government, namely the pattern of separate development. That was done because it was accepted that the Indians did not want to be repatriated, in spite of the many generously subsidized schemes that always existed. It was the National Apartheid Government which admitted that the Indians were inhabitants of this country and that their presence was the permanent responsibility of the Government. For more than 20 years now the Governments of Pakistan and India have continually been raising in U.N. the question of the Asiatics here in South Africa. This has always been the spearhead of their uninterrupted feud against the Republic. To this day India is the country which is launching hysterical attacks against South Africa in respect of this matter. India usually has the support of the Afro-Asian bloc, of which one country, i.e. Kenya, is in actual fact engaged in chasing out its Asiatics at the moment, and at present a panic-stricken exodus of Indians from Kenya is taking place. But India and Pakistan are not really willing to take those people back either. We can form an idea of what the consequences would have been if that had happened in South Africa, and the fuss that would have been kicked up and the emotions that would have been rampant in U.N. if South Africa had dared to do that to the Indians here. It is an indisputable fact that of the approximately I million Asiatics living along the East Coast of Africa, from Natal to Kenya, the approximately half a million living here are enjoying the highest measure of stability and security and are also being afforded the greatest opportunities for advancement, and that is so because the policy of separate development has made these things possible for them.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member ought to know that what I am saying here is correct. The fact that he criticizes it, is to my mind the greatest proof that it is correct. Sir, the Indians make a living and develop here without there being any friction between them and the other non-White groups or the Whites. It is in fact because they are developing according to their own pattern, and because they can develop according to their own identity, on the basis of their traditional way of life&#x2014;i.e. by maintaining their own language, religion and background&#x2014;that it is possible for them to make steady progress and to become an autonomous population group within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy. We all know, and I said so a moment ago. that the Indians do not want to return to their native country, nor did they want to do so in the past, because it is possible for them to make a decent living here in South Africa, whereas in their countries of origin they would be living from hand to mouth. But we know &#x2014;and I should like to emphasize this matter this afternoon&#x2014;that any Indian who feels frustrated and unhappy has always been free to return to his country of origin. Such a person is even free to emigrate elsewhere. In terms of the Indians Relief Act of 1914, which was amended in 1927, Indians have always been afforded every opportunity to emigrate elsewhere if they so desire. In addition there appears on page 204 of the Estimates an item entitled &#x201C;Assisted Emigration&#x201D;. There may perhaps be other countries in the world, apart from India and Pakistan, which would like to take these Indians who are dissatisfied. I believe that they can emigrate on the same conditions as those offered to Indians who wanted to be repatriated. But one knows beforehand that they would not do so, because of the fact that under this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development even more doors will be opened to them here.</p>

<p>We are all aware of the suspicion that existed originally when this Department was established, especially on the part of wealthy Indian traders and people who did not want to support the Government at all, and this was once again particularly evident when the Indian Council was established in 1964. There were Indians who did not want to offer their assistance. On the contrary, they were the people who incited others and stirred up suspicion in regard to the conduct of other Indians who did in fact come forward to offer their assistance. We know that in many cases this agitation was artificial, because it originated with members of the Indian Congress, particularly in the Transvaal and Natal. But in spite of that there were those amongst the Indians who did come forward and who began to co-operate, people who were willing to co-operate in spite of their being villified by members of their own race. It was through this Department that progress was made. This afternoon I feel obliged to mention the names of the two Ministers in this regard, namely the previous Minister of Indian Affairs, Minister Maree, and the present Minister, Minister Trollip. who had a good understanding of this situation. I must also mention the officials of the Department who have been carrying out their taask so judiciously. In addition I also want to mention the Indians who showed their goodwill, who noticed the good intentions of the Government and who displayed a favourable attitude and sound judgment in respect of the whole matter. These are the reoole who established the channel of contact: and that channel of contact is still in existence to-day and is functioning well.</p>

<p>We know that the Indian policy of the Government is succeeding. To my mind there are, in particular, three points of proof in this regard. The first is that the Indian Council has now become a status symbol amongst the Indians. <span class="col_5973-5974" refersTo="page_0191"/>There is such a long waiting list of Indians who would like to serve on this Indian Council that there is simply no room for all of them on the Council. Many of these people are the wealthy Indian traders and especially the businessmen who, as I have already said, were actually those who practised obstruction in the past.</p>

<p>In the second place we find that the agitation practised by Indians of the type who used to be the agitators in former days&#x2014;and who were in fact successful in their agitation at that time&#x2014;is no longer finding favour. Recently a pamphlet was published, apparently in England, under the name of Dr. A. M. Dadoo, This Dr. Dadoo is one of the persons who was formerly a listed communist here and emigrated to England, from where he is now trying to bombard the Indians here with pamphlets and attempting to make them dissatisfied with the situation in which they find themselves to-day. In that pamphlet entitled &#x201C;Freedom Fighters March&#x2014;a message from Dr. A. M. Dadoo&#x201D;, a venomous attack is made against the South African Government as well as the Whites in Rhodesia and all Whites in Southern Africa. In that pamphlet he encourages the Indians to suppprt the terrorists and to commit violence. I maintain that the proof that we have succeeded in our Indian policy lies in the fact that this agitation will not make any impression on the Indians.</p>

<p>In the third place, I want to measure the undoubted success of our Indian policy by the fact that visitors from other countries, prominent Indians as well, adopt a completely different attitude after they have visited South Africa. I am referring here to Sir Zafrulla Kahn, who visited the Republic last year. As we know, he is a Judge of the World Court, and he is the person who was the former leader of the Pakistani Delegation at U.N., a person who was at that time the most outspoken critic of the Government&#x2019;s policy in the General Assembly.

<p>But I want to deal with something entirely different. In all sincerity I want to put a few questions before the hon. the Minister; not individual cases, but a few problems of the Indians, because as long as I sit here, I know that hon. members on that side of the House will not put the case of the Indians, because the Indians have no vote, so they are not worth anything to them. So I find that if it is not done by us on this side of the House, it will not be done at all. I would be very interested in hearing what the hon. the Minister has to say when he replies to my friend, the hon. member for South Coast, in regard to the Indian Council.</p>

<p>But I would like to ask him one or two questions in this regard. If the new Indian Council was to ask the Minister to consider doing away with the provincial permit system the Indians at present have to comply with if they want to move from province to province, what would his attitude be? This Government after many years has accepted that the Indians of South Africa are in fact South Africans. Having accepted them as South Africans, I am very curious to know what the Government&#x2019;s attitude is in regard to the fact that the Indians now still require permits to travel from one province to another in the country in which they are accepted. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether he is going to insist on the continuation of this system, which I believe, does us absolutely no credit whatsoever.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what his attitude would be if the Indian Council were to say to him at their very first meeting that they feel that they should have a member appointed to the Group Areas Board. I asked that because the Group Areas Board very often deals with members of the Indian community. This board moves the Indians hither and yon. I want to know that if the Group Areas Board deals with the members of a particular community such as this, why a member of that particular race group cannot then be a member of the board?</p>

<p>If these hon. members are not so nervous they will find that the seats they are occupying are becoming more uncomfortable year by year. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether, when group areas are considered for particular race groups, <span class="col_5975-5976" refersTo="page_0192"/>and particularly for the Indian community which we are considering now, and following on what was said by the hon. member for South Coast, consideration is given to the health aspect, the medical aspects and the housing aspects. When one goes through an area like Chatsworth in Durban one feels that this is not so. Has the hon. the Minister and his Department, for instance, ever considered the social difficulties involved when members of one group are moved from one area to another? During the war about I million schoolchildren were moved from London for their own safety. It was not done before the position was studied very carefully to see what the different aspects would be and how these children would be affected. To my knowledge this Government has never even thought of this matter. We therefore get the position that an Indian family which usually consists of about 7.7 people per dwelling, as against the Whites of about 4.7 per dwelling, is uprooted and moved to another area and that no consideration is given to the difficulties involved with the children, housing, medical facilities, and so on. That is why I say it is so important that then when these moves take place a member of the Indian Council is consulted and, in fact, sits on the board that propagates these moves.</p>

<p>One finds that this sort of interjection is not only stupid, but is getting us nowhere. Indians in Durban occupy homes where whole families have moved in, namely sons in law, daughters in law, children and so on. These people are moved into new areas where prices are far too high for them to afford. I know that this is a matter for the Department of Community Development, but I am saying to the hon. the Minister as Minister of Indian Affairs that it is a matter with which he should concern himself. It so often happens in this House, since I have been here anyway, that not one member on the Government side cares twopence about what is happening to the Indian community. I ask the hon. the Minister in all sincerity whether the Indian Council will be able to use its influence to do away with things like these permits between provinces for people which we have accepted as South Africans.</p>

<p>Will he do something about the social difficulties involved when one group of people are moved to another area? What will the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view be when he finds that Chatsworth is too small to house the Indians which are there already? Where will he make the next group area? How long will we go on making group areas? Does the hon. the Minister believe that group areas will always be big enough to contain the number of people placed in it? I know that the hon. member for Umhlatuzana will probably follow me in my argument. I would be very pleased if he could tell me whether in fact the policy of making the group areas for different race groups watertight compartments will ever be able to contain the number of people that are put into them.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before the hon. member for Port Natal gets up in this House to take part in debates, he should rather have a private pow-wow with his leader in Natal, the hon. member for South Coast, first. If, after that little pow-wow, he comes out unscathed, he can take part in debates in this House. It is quite obvious that the views expressed by the hon. member for South Coast and the hon. member for Port Natal are diagonally opposed to one another.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>It does not worry me. It should worry him. The hon. member for South Coast, on the one hand, pleads that the Government should not allow the unrestricted movement of Indians into Zululand; in fact, he pleads that they should not be allowed to go there at all, whereas the hon. member for Port Natal, on the other hand, pleads that restrictions on the movement of Indians should be lifted altogether, because, he says, they are <span class="col_5977-5978" refersTo="page_0193"/>all now South Africans. There is absolutely no similarity between the speeches of the hon. member for South Coast and that of the hon. member for Port Natal.</p>

<p>I would like to reply to certain aspects raised by them. The hon. member for South Coast asked the hon. the Minister whether the Indian group areas, which are now being created, would in fact be able to support viable communities and provide for Indian expansion. The present development in Chatsworth is concentrated primarily on the development of housing, because that is where the greatest need exists. In the past, the vast majority of economically active Indians were traders. The situation is changing fast and many Indians are now turning towards industries, and, in fact, in the last year something like 53 new industries were started by Indians in the Durban area alone.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>When was the majority of Indians traders and not workers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I said the economically active ones. The nothern part of Durban also provides for a large future expansion potential for the Indians, and especially in the Verulam area. Many industrialists will be able to establish their industries in those areas, thus allowing for a vast expansion of Indian industrial development. Even in the Chatsworth Shallson area there is ample room for industrial expansion even though there are no industries in that area at the moment. As far as his plea is concerned that the Indian movement into Zululand should be restricted, I think that that plea should he directed at the United Party controlled Natal Executive Committee, because they are the people who have been granting these permits. I can assure the hon. member that members on this side feel equally strong on that issue, namely that there should be no movement of Indians to the Zululand area north of the Tugela.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal, however, pleads that there should be a lifting of all restrictions on travel permits. I cannot agree with that, because if there should be a total suspension of travel restrictions on Indians it would mean that there would be no control whatsoever as to where they should settle in future and where they should obtain employment. The Orange Free State will have to be opened to the Indian.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Permits are not withheld unduly and it merely means that there is some control on travel. I now want to deal with the question of housing. The hon. member for Port Natal objects to the movement of Indians again and says that no consideration is given to the social upheavals brought about by these movements. He, of all people, should know that a large number of especially the poorer Indians live under almost slum conditions and that where they were moved to better houses there was a far greater possibility that their social standards would improve through that movement than the other way round. He should also know that the houses which are being provided at the moment in the Chatsworth area&#x2014;two-bedroomed houses on a sub-economic basis&#x2014;are provided at a monthly rental of R6. Surely that is not beyond the income of most families? His plea that the hon. the Minister should provide for the inclusion of Indians on the Group Areas Board prompts me to ask him, in view of the fact that he claims to represent the Indians interest in this House, whether he included Indians in his election committee to advise him on the interests of the Indians? If he maintains that he wants to represent the interests of the Indians here, then surely he should also include Indians on his election committee.</p>

<p>I am now applying the same principle to the personal opportunities you had of including Indians on some board such as your election committees. Last year, and also this year, the hon. member for Port Natal had a lot to say about the school feeding system which was stopped in Indian schools. I have in front of me a report from a newspaper in London where a lot is being said against the system of school feeding. They say that the school meal subsidy was an absolute waste; that it was the most foolish and wasteful subsidy ever conceived. This was reported in the <i>Evening News</i> of the 30th March, 1967. It was stated that the money should rather be spent on the real education of children&#x2019;s minds instead of filling their stomachs and swill bins, referring to the wastage.</p>

<p>I should then like to refer to the change in the trend in employment amongst Indians in the past few years. Now that Indians have become a more settled community and a certain state of stability has come about in their residential areas and their employment opportunities, a tremendous amount of development has taken place. Mr. <span class="col_5979-5980" refersTo="page_0194"/>A. M. Moola, a leading Indian trader and industrialist, estimates that in the last two years Indian entrepreneurs have invested approximately R20 million in industrial development. In 1965 more than 1,400 Indians were employed in new industrial enterprises. Generally a large number of new industries have arisen in and around Durban. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to enter upon the terrain of Natal&#x2019;s problems. I rather want to come round to the Indians of Johannesburg, in respect of whom I think I know what I am talking about. The hon. the Minister occupies a very responsible position in South Africa today, because he has half a million people in his charge. It is not an easy task and we appreciate the problem which the hon. the Minister has, but he will realize that it is a matter of importance to every White person that this large population group be treated as fairly as possible. I also view the matter from the point of view of our own safety and security, and I feel that even within the policy which the Government is following, one can be reasonable or unreasonable. But within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy, I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister personally to take another look at the problems of the Indian population in Johannesburg. There is not the least doubt that there is a tremendously strong feeling of bitterness and dissatisfaction among the Indian community in Johannesburg. The Minister will know that the main reason for this is that all the Indians, who are to-day spread over about 20 residential areas, some of them places where they have lived for generations, are now being forced to go and live in one residential area, namely Lenasia, which is situated 18 miles from the centre of Johanesburg. Although in principle the Indians of Johannesburg are against apartheid&#x2014;and one can understand that&#x2014;they are prepared to accept a separate residential area. That is not what they are objecting to. But they seriously object to all of them being compelled to live in one residential area. We as Whites, like any other population group, have our class differences and our differences of taste. The Whites in Johannesburg have 250 different residential areas to choose from, but here all the various religious groups and classes are being lumped together in one residential area. Whether a man is poor, whether he can afford it or not, whether it is to his liking, whether he is a man who has to work late at night or start work early in the morning, he must nevertheless move and go to live 18 miles outside Johannesburg. There are Whites who also live far from Johannesburg, but then it is by their own choice. They chose to do so because it suited them to live in a certain place. Those for whom this is not suitable have a right to live near their places of employment. The feeling against this position is flaring up seriously. I think that it is in the interest of good relationships between the White man and the Indian that the Government should reconsider this question. I think the Johannesburg City Council suggested five alternative sites to the Government. The Indians themselves are now prepared to develop another community centre for the Indians at their own expense. Repeated representations have been made, not only by individual Indians and Indian organizations, but also by the Indian Council which the Minister appointed. I think the Minister knows what is going on. I think he knows that among the members of his own Indian Council there is tremendous frustration about the fact that, despite the continual representations to the Minister and even to the Prime Minister, the position still remains the same. They have already approached the Prime Minister and said to him, &#x201C; Please, listen to our problems as the man who stands at the head of the Government.&#x201D; But time and again the representations made to the Prime Minister are handed over to the Ministers concerned. I want to repeat that the hon. the Minister will know that the Indians are prepared to establish their own private township at their own expense. They will undertake the lay-out of the entire township if the Government will only agree that an area be granted to them which is reasonably near the centre of Johannesburg or which is within the Johannesburg complex. I do not know if the hon. the Minister is aware of it, but the feeling is so strong that it struck me that one of the members of the South African Indian Council, Mr. A. Habib, recently said in an interview with <i>The Star&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Indians in no other South African city or town have received such shabby treatment as those in Johannesburg.</block>

<p>I know that he is a moderate man. It might cost him his position in the new Indian Council. but it is out of sheer frustration that he said so. He feels: Here is a body which the Government itself appointed to give expression to the feelings of the Indians, and what is the use if the Government does not listen to it. No one expects the Government to accede to all the Council&#x2019;s requests, but surely this is a reasonable request, i.e. that regard should be had to the differences which exist among these people, and to the desire to have more than one residential area to choose from.</p>

<p>The Indians of course also feel very bitter about the fact that tremendous pressure is being exerted upon them day after day. There is one court case after another. Pressure is being exerted upon them before an absolutely final decision has been given about the possibility of a private residential area for Indians. I am once again making this request in the interests of good relationships between the two race groups. We should be very glad if the Minister would once again give his attention to this matter and to the representations which have been made to him from time to time.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that the Indians do not think so. If one were at present to make a thorough study of the overall living pattern distribution of the Indians and of what is being done for them in every sphere of their living pattern, then the hon. member is free to take a look at the circumstances of the Indians to-day in comparison with their circumstances under the old United Party Government. This debate up to now actually links up with the short time the hon. Opposition requested for it, as well as with the questions they have addressed to the hon. the Minister during the course of the year. One actually gains the impression that the Opposition does not really feel like participating in this debate. Their criticism is very vague and far-fetched. This is merely another way of thanking the Minister and his Department for the calm way in which they are handling Indian affairs. During the past five years there has been phenomenal growth in the policy of the National Party in respect of the Indians. Its officials have within a short period of time sorted out and cleared up the conglomerat the United Party had left behind. On the basis of the sound principles of the National Party it was possible for them to introduce departmental activities which are meaningful and attractive to everybody who is concerned with Indian Affairs. If one wants to look back at the policy of a governing United Party, then one has to look back to-day to a period 20 years ago, and when I listen to the hon. member for Port Natal it puts me in mind of a man who was slightly under the influence and who fell from the twentieth storey. When he struck the ground, he was immediately surrounded by a group of people. A huge police constable pushed the people out of the way and asked the chap who had fallen. &#x201C;What is going on here?&#x201D; Then the inebriate replied, &#x201C;No, constable, I do not know because I have only just arrived here myself.&#x201D; The hon. member for Port Natal puts me in mind of that. He simply falls into politics here and he does not really know what is going on&#x2014;that is the case with the entire United Party.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the hon. member for Berea. A few weeks ago he put a question to the Minister of Indian Affairs, and it read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(a) How many students enrolled in 1968 for (i) degree and (ii) diploma courses at the University College for Indians and (b) how many enrolled in the faculty of education for (i) degree and (ii) diploma courses?</block>

<p>He received an uncommon reply. So far there has not been anybody on the Opposition side who has tried to use that information, which they obtained from the hon. the Minister in respect of education in particular, in a meaningful way this afternoon. It seems to me as though the information the hon. the Minister furnished has put the hon. member for Berea completely off his stroke, for it is astonishing to look at this reply. In the first place, we find that in 1968 1,149 students enrolled for degree courses and 308 for diploma courses. Then we must refer back to 1961 when this College for Indians was established. At that stage the number of students merely totalled 114. We therefore see here, owing to the increase in the number of students enrolled over the past five years, into what a splendid institution the University College for Indians has developed. When we come to the courses offered there, we see that 95 courses were offered in 1961. Last year as many as 145 courses were offered there. I want to read out to you, Sir, an excerpt from the magazine &#x201C;Fiat Lux&#x201D; dated February, 1967, in which continual announcements are made as to the increases and developments that have taken place in respect of courses. This is what the rector, Professor S. P. Olivier, has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When they enrol for the new academic year at the University College, Durban, from the 18th to the 20th of this month, students will, if the number of applicants warrants it, have a number of new courses to choose from in addition to the more than 50 already available.<br/>One of these new courses is theology, a subject which has long been outstanding and will be offered in the form of the basic courses of systematic theology &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he goes on and refers to other new courses offered there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">History of music will also be offered for the first time, and it is felt that this subject will do a great deal to foster the overall cultural life of the student body. A three-year lower secondary school diploma is also provided while &#x201C;education&#x201D; will be available as a full degree course. To assist students in the Departments of Law and Commerce, it is hoped to provide most&#x2014;if not all&#x2014;of the LL.B courses, etc., extra-murally for a period of two to three years.</block>

<p>The development that was evident last year was continued this year. Two new courses were introduced this year: an honours course in speech and drama and an honours course in political science. This points to the steady growth experienced at this College for Indians, but the future possibilities are just as bright. Within the foreseeable future the old University College will be moved to a new site at <span class="col_5983-5984" refersTo="page_0196"/>Chiltem Hills, in the Indian group area. In addition an advisory board, composed of Indians only, was established for the University. This proves that the Indian community, too, will now have full participation in tertiary education. Furthermore, the hon. the Prime Minister has also announced that these universities will be granted full academic autonomy.</p>

<p>Another point I want to touch upon is the fact that we find to-day that there is unrest amongst student communities throughout the world, and I think it is a feather in the cap not only of the Department, but also of the staff and everybody who is concerned with the University College for Indians that, in spite of the unrest that one finds amongst students all over the world, they are experiencing no difficulties there. In spite of this, those students &#x2014;whose college was established amid major issues, while newspapers and the Opposition disparaged that college and many people staged agitations so that it might miscarry&#x2014;as well as the teaching staff are conducting themselves in a very responsible way and setting an example to many university communities in the rest of the world. The hon. member asked questions, and I think that it is a very good thing for the Opposition to ask questions, because the more questions the United Party asks, the more the National Party can reply, and from that it is apparent how great the National Party is in contrast with the smallness of the United Party. But I want to return to this question. What does the hon. member for Berea&#x2019;s question prove? In the first place, it proves that all is well as regards the university training of the Indians, and when one looks at the activities of a university and finds that all is well, it proves to one that all is well as regards primary and secondary education. I do not have the time to give attention to that matter this afternoon, but I want to make the statement and next year it can be taken further &#x2026;</p>

<p>I fear the hon. member will ask an unintelligent question, and I do not have the time to reply to it now. I say that the university community is successful, because primary and secondary education are being handled well. Secondly, it proves that the National Party has an understanding of the fundamentals, the nature and the peculiarities of the South African social structure; and further it proves that the National Party was honest towards the Indians when it formulated its policy in respect of the Indians and presented it to the Indians and the entire world, and that it is embroidering on that policy in all sincerity; thirdly, that the academic training offered at this college for Indians is by no manner of means inferior to any academic standards one might find anywhere in the world; and fourthly, that this Government is placing more and more responsibilities on the Indian community itself.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>The Indian, about whom I wish to speak, is the Indian in the Cape Province. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time has not come for him to intercede with his colleagues to see that these Indians, particularly in Kimberley, Vryburg and Mafeking, get a better deal than they have been getting. I also want to plead with him for consideration to be given to increased pensions, old-age pensions, disability grants and war veterans&#x2019; pensions, for Indians. The Indian community, as I know it, is a respectable and respected community with competent people in its midst, people who confine themselves to their business and who are honourable people in every respect. I believe that the Government has made a dead set at the Indian for reasons they know better than I do. During the debate on the Community Development Vote I raised the question with the Minister of Community Development, which I now wish to ventilate with this Minister, because I think this Minister must realize what is happening to the people whose welfare it is his duty to protect.</p>

<p>The Indians at Kimberley, for example, have more or less been directed to concentrate their efforts in regard to business in two areas. One area is already established, namely a shopping area, and the other is about to be established. Although the first shopping area was set aside with a great fanfare of trumpets and was opened by the Secretary for Cummunity Development, the Indians who were there, the general dealers, fruiterers and greengrocers, etc., are unable to make a living. The Minister of Community Development told me, in answer to points I raised in the debate, that they had built that particular shopping area in close proximity to the market. This market, for the information of the Minister, is a wholesale market and therefore there are no customers. I think it is tragic that the Indians who have lived in that community for many years should now be deprived of their business, which has been predominantly with white customers, and moved to places where they cannot make a living, and where they must go out of business. We have never had a straightforward enunciation of policy from the Government through the Minister of Indian Affairs as to what these people are expected to do. After all is said and done, when one spends one&#x2019;s life in a particular trade or calling it is not easy in one&#x2019;s declining years to start something else. I have one case on my desk, and although I concede that one swallow does not make a summer, it is a tragic story. It is the case of one woman in a small isolated town in the Karoo, the only Indian in the community, who was there for donkey&#x2019;s years, and who was directed by the local authority, although she was getting on for 70, to move. She was brought to Kimberley, where she was unknown and had no connections whatever, and no prospect of running the business which was conducted by her husband. Well, she just folded up. I believe that the Minister of Indian Affairs and the Minister of Coloured Affairs have duties <span class="col_5985-5986" refersTo="page_0197"/>to the people whose portfolio they handle, and that they should speak for them, when matters concerning them come before their colleagues. In the case in point, when I referred to these shopping centres, I drew the attention of the Minister of Coloured Affairs to it myself, when he was up there, and I pointed out the unfairness of this congregation of competition in that type of business, with the coloured community on the boundaries of the township, where the coloured people were housed. I then pointed out the impossibility of 16 Indians in one complex, not very much bigger than this Chamber, trying to eke out a living, competing each with the other, in the same line of business, and with the same group of people, who pass the door. I think the Government is extremely cruel. I am not impressed by arguments advanced that there is no difficulty in connection with this, that and the other thing, and that the Government is extremely generous. Those of us who come into contact with these people, face to face, hear the most heartrending cases of hardship, and I expect the Minister of Indian Affairs to raise his voice and say that although this is the policy of the Government, it should be a longterm thing; surely the existing owners should be allowed, at least, to die out, instead of being removed. Pressure is put upon them. Of course the Government denies that. The way it is done is quite simple. Officials turn up and suggest that it is in the Indian&#x2019;s interest to move, it will be made difficult for them. We have several people in the town itself, who own the property, in which they have traded for years. They are expected to uproot themselves and to rent a property from the Government, and do whatever they can, with the properties they have vacated. We have such a situation at Vryburg where there is a large Indian community in the middle of the town. Disputes have been going on as to where these people could be put. My latest information&#x2014;and I should like to hear from the Minister, what the correct story is&#x2014;is that the <i>status quo</i> will now apply for some considerable time. What I would like to know is, why could not the <i>status quo</i> have been applied long ago, instead of having a lot of argument and friction between the local authority, the Indian people concerned, and the Departments responsible, These are the things, which I believe cause more trouble than they are worth, and I think these are details of the Government&#x2019;s policy which could be avoided, thus making for a far happier and contented community. I believe these are the things which give us the tremendously bad image, which we have in the outside world, because we cannot suppress facts. These things are known. People talk about them, and persons correspond, letters pass between them and the people outside know, that this is the way we proceed in our affairs. I am not going to criticize the Government&#x2019;s policy, but I think the time has come, particularly in the case of the Indians, where some compassionate grounds must be introduced to slow down this increasing hardship on a community which has done nothing to earn the dislike of the party in power. It may be somewhat late, but I still think there is time in our affairs for us to plead, as I now do, on humanitarian grounds, because we are dealing with people. These are people with responsibilities, with loves, fears, hopes, anxieties and disappointments. They also have ambitions, and they also have children, who have to make their way in this country, hedged in with all the regulations and complications which enfold their daily lives. I would say that the Minister of Indian Affairs is the one man who should set a new pattern and try to resolve these problems in our relationships with the other races in this country. It is a good place to start, with the Indian community, and when one pleads for the Indian community, one realises that this is not the most popular community to plead for. I do so on humanitarian grounds. I have them in my constituency. I know them and I live among them and I have always found them to be decent, law-abiding citizens who do their job. Without exception, in my experience, they are people who deserve better treatment from the authorities than they have been getting from this Government. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to react to what was said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout this afternoon. I must say that the hon. member adopted a very different attitude this afternoon to that which he usually adopted in the past when this subject was under discussion. The hon. member made a very gentle plea to the hon. the Minister that he should once again attend to the position of and the problems experienced by the Indians of Johannesburg in particular. I think the hon. member should undoubtedly address his pleas to other quarters. The reason for the problems which exist in Johannesburg, for the degree of frustration which may exist amongst the Indians, is to be sought nowhere else than with the United Party City Council which administers the affairs of Johannesburg. The hon. member referred to the resettlement of the Indians. There is general agreement that the mixing of the races which one finds in Johannesburg, where Indians live in White areas right next door to White people, cannot be tolerated; that state of affairs is unhealthy and a solution must be found. I do not think there is on United Party member in this House who represents a Johannesburg constituency who would disagree about this being an unhealthy state of affairs to which a solution should be found. But unfortunately, what do we find? Since 1948, on every occasion when this Government has initiated steps to clear up those conditions, we have been meeting with nothing but stubborn opposition from the United Party and the City Council of Johannesburg. They have never been prepared to give us their co-operation as far as this matter is concerned. In order to illustrate this I can give you the example of the conditions which prevailed in Sophiatown <span class="col_5987-5988" refersTo="page_0198"/>town for a period of many years. When we started clearing up those conditions, we received no co-operation from the City Council or from the Indian community there. This is a story we know and we know its background. We know what factors played a role in that matter. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout will recall the protracted struggle which is being waged in Johannesburg in order to find a solution to the conditions prevailing in Pageview. The hon. member will know that throughout all these years we have been unable to obtain the co-operation of the United Party City Council in clearing up these conditions. Instead of co-operating, what have they been doing? Every time that matter is raised in the City Council of Johannesburg and in other councils, the United Party prompts the Indians and tells them, &#x201C;Oppose that move; organize protest meetings. Oppose that move because if we should get into power one day, we will maintain the <i>status quo</i> in Johannesburg&#x201D;. The hon. member cannot deny that. When we established Lenasia for the Indians, who were the people who opposed that tooth and nail? Who are the people who even to-day are still opposed to Lenasia as a group area and a resettlement area for Indians? The United Party, that is who.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that five areas have been designated by the City Council of Johannesburg as alternative areas in which the Indians may settle themselves. I should like to ask the hon. member where those areas are, and if he does not know where they are, I shall tell him where. One of those areas is Fordsburg. If Fordsburg is to be designated a residential area for the Indians, the opportunity will be created for the financially strong Indian group to exploit the poorer Indian group. The hon. member knows as well as I do that land in Fordsburg is of the most expensive land one can find in that area. If accommodation for Indians is to be provided in Fordsburg, it will be of the most expensive accommodation, and you can imagine, Sir, what rents those people will have to pay. I ask myself whether they are able to pay those rents? The other area which they want to make available to the Indians is situated between Baragwanath and Crown Gardens. They wanted to push the Indians into that area, but, Mr. Chairman, that is the direction in which the residential areas of the White population in those southern areas will naturally develop. To-day we can already see what development is taking place in that triangle, in the area to the northeast of Uncle Charlie. Fine White residential areas have already been established in that area. I want to ask the hon. member whether the United Party is in favour of our establishing another Indian area right next door to that White area. Sir, this is an old issue.</p>

<p>The Group Areas Board has rejected that suggestion on more than one occasion.

The only area which is suitable for the Indians is the Lenasia area.</p>

<p>It is only unsuitable because the United Party puts ideas into the heads of the Indians and tell them that it is unsuitable. For the Bantu it is not too far to travel exactly the same distance every day by train from the furthermost south-westernly comer of Soweto to the central part of the city where they are employed. For the Bantu that is not too far; for the Bantu it is not unsuitable, but the Indians who have to travel the same distance and who have exactly the same transport facilities are told by the United Party that is too far to travel and that they have to oppose that.</p>

<p>As regards the settlement of Indians in Lenasia, the position is not, like the hon. member tried to make out here to-day, that all of them will simply be thrown together in Lenasia. That is not so, and there is something wrong with the hon. member&#x2019;s education if he says that is so. Lenasia is a large area. Lenasia is approximately 3,000 acres in extent, and throughout, from the outset, the settlement of the Indians in Lenasia has been undertaken according to their religious beliefs and according to their castes. I have been concerned in this matter right from the start. We have co-operated with the various religious groups and the various castes in settling them in Lenasia. I think the hon. member should improve his education somewhat and should ascertain what the real facts are. The hon. member should not state here that those people feel frustrated. Only a small group of the Indians feel frustrated, <span class="col_5989-5990" refersTo="page_0199"/>and I want to go as far as to say that feeling of frustration is prevailing amongst the wealthy class who lived on and exploited the poorer Indians. They used to be the slum landlords of Johannesburg and those areas; they are the people who feel frustrated. There are many thousands of Indians who are grateful to the Government and who are praising the Government for what it has done for them there. We request the United Party to use its influence with the Johannesburg City Council to get the City Council to co-operate with us in order to develop this area into a model area for these people.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a small point which effects my own constituency. Benoni is becoming the resettlement area of all the Indians on the East Rand. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to the hon. the Minister for what he is already doing for certain Indian population groups as far as their technical training is concerned. It has been decided by the Department and the Minister to establish a technical training school at Lenasia, and for that we are grateful. I think this is a step in the right direction. Indians should realize that there are other occupations apart from being dealers. They should start to qualify themselves technically so that they may be absorbed into the field of employment; and in view of the fact that we are now going to have a very large Indian population on the East Rand, in Benoni, I also want to make a plea that we should consider at some later stage the establishment of technical training facilities for that large community, so that they may be absorbed into the entire industrial complex of Benoni. A large field of employment is awaiting those people. At present we have the position that those people are infiltrating into the White commercial spheres, and that is happening as a result of the fact that we are not creating employment opportunities for them in the industrial areas, but also as a result of the fact that the people do not have the necessary training facilities, and I am pleading for the establishment of those training facilities.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast raised the question of certain group areas being viable. I am sorry, that is not my Department, and however sympathetic I may be to the question of areas being proclaimed as group areas, I am sorry I cannot interfere in the affairs of two of my colleagues, the Minister of Community Development and the Minister of Planning. The hon. member will have an opportunity of putting those questions to the Minister of Planning whose vote still has to come up. Then the hon. member asked a question with regard to the Indian Council. In that regard I can tell him that the present Indian Council is being dissolved next month, and immediately thereafter I will give consideration to the appointment of members to the new Council. I think it will be quite a job sorting it out.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question of the Indian penetration into Zululand. I can tell the hon. member that Zululand is not a proclaimed area for any particular race. It is a controlled area. Some time ago&#x2014;I think last year&#x2014;the Government appointed an interdepartmental committee to investigate the question of Asiatic traffic north of the Tugela. That report was submitted to the Minister of Planning. I have not seen it, but the report has been submitted and we will see whether any action can be taken. We are in agreement with the hon. member that there should be some definite control of the situation. Then the hon. member, in dealing with the question of the movement of Indians into Zululand, stated that the issuing of permits remained with the Provincial Administration. That may be so, but Zululand, of course, is not a province, and therefore as far as I am concerned as Minister of Indian Affairs, I do not deal with the question of the issue of permits for any movement to Zululand; I only deal with inter-provincial movements. Sir, the hon. member for Port Natal wanted to know when we were going to abolish this policy of interprovincial permits. I want to know from the hon. member for South Coast, who is the leader of the party in Natal, whether it is the policy of the United Party that we should abolish these inter-provincial permits, as advocated by the hon. member for Port Natal. I put the question to the United Party leader in Natal, whether he is in favour of the abolition of these inter-provincial permits?</p>

<p>I think I should bring to the notice of the hon. member for Port Natal that the issuing of these permits has been the policy of all governments since 1913&#x2014;therefore also the policy of United Party governments. As I have said, as far as we are concerned, no changes are contemplated in this system. The hon. member for Port Natal went on to put certain hypothetical questions to me, questions which I am not prepared to answer because, as I have said, they are hypothetical. He asked me, for instance, whether I would agree to a member of the Indian community being appointed to the Group Areas Board. But that has got nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>I do not make appointments to the Group Areas Board. Consequently, the hon. member&#x2019;s question is purely hypothetical. What is more, it has never been raised. The S.A. Indian Council has never intimated that they would like representation on that board. But if they do want such representation, the Indian community can ask that through their council; they need not ask the hon. member for Port Natal. The hon. member asked other questions about what I shall do if this or that happens. Well, I do not propose to do anything&#x2014;these questions are purely hypothetical ones.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about two Indian students who, with 10 others, obtained a diploma in public health at the Sultan College and who could not get jobs. Apparently the local authorities in Natal have refused to employ them. The Department of Indian Affairs has made representations to get these two students employment, but so far without success. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised the question of Lenasia, which I think has been answered very fully by the hon. member for Benoni.</p>

<p>No, one of the troubles lies with the Johannesburg City Council. Now let me take the case of Laudium, just outside Pretoria. Laudium is a fully developed Indian township, and there are houses, roads and public amenities, and that has been achieved through the co-operation of the Pretoria City Council. The difficulty with Lenasia was, as the hon. member for Benoni explained, that Lenasia is not within the area of the Johannesburg Municipality.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>After it had been started, negotiations took place with the Johannesburg City Council and after years, the Johannesburg City Council has agreed in principle that it would incorporate Lenasia. Many of the troubles and difficulties that we experienced will be solved once the City Council takes over Lenasia. They have agreed in principle but they have done nothing so far. Now it is a problem. The three Ministers concerned went into this problem: The Minister of Community Development who is sitting here, the Minister of Planning and I. We spent the whole day in Lenasia, and there are all sorts of problems in regard to a second area in the Johannesburg Municipality. There is, for instance, the fact that there are certain vested rights which have been established in Lenasia. There is the local Consultative Indian Committee which functions in Lenasia. They are opposed to another area being set aside. They point to the fact that the Government has invested millions of rands in Lenasia, and that there are industrialists who invested money in Lenasia. It is not an easy problem. But I can tell the hon. member that representations have been made from time to time. They have been <span class="col_5993-5994" refersTo="page_0201"/>made again. It does not concern me directly, but I am always ready to intercede and to help which I have always done in the past. I regard it as my duty. If further representations are made, I am sure that my colleagues will consider them and, if they think it necessary, they will consult me. But it is a problem which primarily rests with the Minister of Planning and then with the Minister of Community Development. I must leave it at that. There is nothing more we can do at the moment. But I understand that the representations will be made, or are being made, and my colleagues will decide whether they will again consider the matter. I do not know. It is a matter for them to decide. I do not want to create any false impression or hopes but as far as I can see, this matter having been fully investigated we, the Government, is not prepared at this stage to investigate or to authorize the establishment of another Indian area within the Johannesburg Municipality.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Rissik for the speech he made on Indian education. I am glad that the speech is on record, because it sets out clearly what we have done in regard to the Indian education, and the results of the examinations which, I think, is a very good picture.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Karoo is concerned, I tell him the same as I have told the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. My services are available to the Indian community if they wish to make representations on certain aspects. They know that. I have taken deputations from the Indians to my collegaues and I have put their case as they saw it. I regard this as my duty and I will continue to do so. As regards the case the hon. member refers to, namely about a woman, I will make representations to the Minister concerned, if he can give me the particulars. I am just as concerned as he is and also wish to view these matters from a humanitarian point of view. I, in fact, do this.</p>

<p>As I have said, the hon. member for Benoni gave the hon. member for Bezuidenhout a complete reply. He speaks from first-hand knowledge.</p>

<p>Then you will have to try next year again. The hon. member for Benoni has first-hand knowledge of this problem and I accept his opinion. I now want to go on to the question asked by the hon. member for Benoni, namely that of a technical college for Indians in the Benoni district. He knows that we have made certain investigations, but there are all sorts of difficulties in regard to the site, buildings, and so on. The matter is, however, being considered. In the meantime we are now planning a technical college in Lenasia, which will take quite a number of pupils for technical training.</p>

<p>I think that I have now covered all the points that were raised. As I have said to the hon. member for Karoo, if he will give me the particulars about the woman, we will go into the matter. The other matters that he raised are, as he knows, matters concerning the Departments of Community Development and Planning, but certain petitions which have been sent to my colleagues have also been sent to me. They will be considered in due course and I am now speaking particularly about the petitions received from the Indians in Vryburg. I think that matter is still under consideration by the Department of Planning.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I intend to deal with a number of general matters this evening, and then to return when the debate is resumed on Monday to certain aspects of administration. I think it is at this hour best to try to divide the issues which I intend to raise.</p>

<p>During the Part Appropriation and Budget debates we had a number of discussions, and subsequently also on the two Armaments Bills in regard to broad defence policy. We dealt in some detail with the Simonstown Agreement and the vacuum in the Indian ocean, and with the general strategic situation of South Africa in regard to Southern Africa, and the question of the procurement of arms. We also warned of the danger of having all one&#x2019;s eggs in what may turn out to be a brittle or unstable basket. We dealt, in fact, with the broad picture of defence. We supported both the Armaments Board and the Armaments Corporation Bills. By now, therefore, it is absolutely clear where we as the Official Opposition stand in regard to defence and in regard to our support of measures deemed necessary in the defence of South Africa. There are one or two matters that have arisen since those debates which I think is necessary to refer to briefly in passing at this stage. The first matter is the speech by the hon. the Prime Minister recently when he stated that South Africa had to face the fact that we would defend our sea routes and our coastline alone. He referred, specifically, not just to the coastline, but to the sea routes around South Africa. He stated that South Africa would do this alone.</p>

<p>He said &#x201C;if necessary&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, he said that we would have to do it alone and he added &#x201C;en ons sal so maak&#x201D;. I do not want to argue about the wording, however. The implication of this is a very far-reaching one. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to deal in further detail with that situation and to give us an explanation of the implications that flow from it. It is not even a matter for debate that with the facilities at our command, namely frigates, three submarines, and squadron of Buccaneers,<span class="col_5995-5996" refersTo="page_0202"/> we cannot hope to patrol some 3,000 miles of sea lanes in addition to defending our own coast against a major force. I therefore think that we are entitled to ask the hon. the Minister whether this means that we are now going to expand into bigger craft and even consider capital ships and what the intentions are in regard to providing, staffing and maintaining the force that would be needed to go it alone in regard to coastal defence. This is a very wide field and we believe that it is not yet to late to reach agreement with those who should be, and we hope will be&#x2014;when they come to their senses&#x2014;the allies of South Africa. I do not intend to take it further than to ask the hon. the Minister to elaborate on that aspect.</p>

<p>There was one other aspect which was raised, but on which there was no reply from the hon. the Minister in previous debates. This matter will be referred to by other hon. members and, therefore, I only want to deal with it as a heading. This matter is the appreciation of the military significance of Government policy in regard to the Bantu homelands and their movement towards independence. We believe that this has a military significance to South Africa. We asked the hon. the Minister to indicate the degree to which an appreciation had been made of the consequences and the implications to defence of the creation of Bantu areas with less and less white control over them which will lead to ultimate total independence. These are the only two matters of broader policy which I wish to raise at this stage.</p>

<p>I would now like to turn to certain aspects of the departmental vote as such. I am dividing the subjects and will leave over for later discussion the question of the national service programme and the Permanent Force aspects of defence. I want to say at this stage that we regard it as our duty to raise in this debate certain criticisms. We have before us a vote of R252 million of which some R43.78 million was surrendered unspent last year. This is a high percentage which seems to indicate a degree of lack of planning of expenditure which we realize concerns the hon. the Minister, but which also concerns us. We realize that steps are being taken to evolve a new system of budgeting but we are concerned by the fact that R43 million out of the R256 million last year was not spent. We are concerned too about certain aspects of the control of the stores and equipment which are being purchased with this money.</p>

<p>I should like to take this opportunity of expressing formally the appreciation of the Opposition Defence Group and the Opposition as a whole for the opportunity we had to visit various defence installations towards the end of last year. I believe that type of tour is an extremely valuable one from the Parliamentary point of view. When I raise matters which might appear to have originated from that tour I do so because they are matters which in any case concern us, matters which are generally known. One that concerns me very much is the millions of rands worth of equipment lying out in the open unprotected from the weather, rain, sun and wind. In many cases it is valuable equipment and in other cases highly specialized equipment. I want to mention the example of radio installed jeeps, which are delicate technical machines, but which stand in the sun weathering. In store after store one finds millions of rands worth of equipment and the layman finds it difficult to appreciate how it could be necessary not only to buy that equipment but also to utilize available cover while other valuable equipment stands outside unprotected. I refer for instance to a simple example&#x2014;that of pick handles. Shelves and shelves of pick handles lay under cover in store. These are things which are available every day and manufactured locally in South Africa, something which is available at short notice at any time. These are bought in large quantities which cannot possibly be used in the normal course of operations. Yet other equipment stands outside unprotected. We believe that this question of the deterioration of stores is not receiving by any manner of means the attention it should be receiving. It is of vital concern that we should have essential equipment but when we think of what we are spending, I would like to be sure and have the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that a very careful study is being made of exactly what is being bought and just how necessary it is.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is the first discussion on the Defence Vote since the system of general conscription for the medically fit age group concerned has come into operation. I have always felt very strongly about this matter and I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his staff on the fact that they have succeeded, after many years of discussions on this aspect, in devising a system in terms of which everyone is called up for military training. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fact that this happened during his term of office and that the honour befell him to give this to the youth of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to an aspect which has become of special interest to me during the past few years, and particularly since last year. I am referring to the system of training of our young men who have attained the training age. I had the experience to see my eldest son off at Cape Town station on 9th January last year. On 27th September I went to meet him again when he returned as a young officer in charge of the train. This reminds me of a few years ago, of 1960, when an amendment to the Defence Act was discussed in this House. At that time I expressed my concern in this House as to what would happen in future under the Act, as amended, and as to what the prospects would be of our young men who were called <span class="col_5997-5998" refersTo="page_0203"/>up. I quoted the example of an officer whom I had seen at the opening of Parliament that year. At that time this officer was in charge of the Ysterplaat Air Force Station and 16 years prior to that, in 1944, he was serving in Italy with the same rank, namely the rank of colonel in charge of the 34th Liberator Squadron. I do not want to delve into the past, because it serves no purpose; let bygones be bygones. But the predecessor of the present Minister went to great pains to bring about a different spirit, a spirit of enthusiasm, of confidence and co-operation in our Defence Force. The particular officer whom I am speaking holds the rank of major-general to-day, and I am sorry to hear that he is not enjoying such good health at present because he is a soldier with a brilliant carer, apart from the fact that he himself was a crack pilot.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the present. Last year our son underwent his training. I want to put it on record here that during the nine months for which he was away he never expressed one word of complaint in a telephone conversation&#x2014;because he discussed very quickly, of course, that he could reverse the charges for his telephone calls&#x2014;or in the letters we received from him or when I visited him in person. He enjoyed his training and he took it seriously and he never had anything but praise for the officers and the approach of the men who had ben put in command of them. I questioned him in order to find out what such training involved since he was one of the members of my own family. I asked him about the language question. He is in the fortunate position that he took both Afrikaans and English higher at school. He assured me that the two languages enjoyed full equality and that there was not the slightest sign of discrimination because one would speak, for example, English on one occasion and Afrikaans on another. I am glad about this. He also told me that while he was serving in a regiment at first and while attending a signals school later on, the trainees freely discussed political matters but that this did not play any role in the prospects a man had and that he was satisfied that promotion was granted purely on merit. He assured me that history was dealt with objectively when it cropped up in the lectures they attended in the course of their training. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister, his Department and the officers concerned on the fact that parents have no reason to worry when their children leave home to undergo military training. When a child leaves home, the parents always ask themselves: &#x201C;Where is my child going to, what is his training going to be and to what dangers is he going to expose himself?&#x201D;. I am satisfied, also from what I learned from other trainees who spent the year with my son during their training, that particular attention is given to and that nothing is overlooked in making things convenient for these boys, with the stern discipline that is essential, and that they are judged by their merits and aptitude and the training which suits them best I cannot but express my personal appreciation in respect of the officers I met last year. I am thinking particularly of Commandant Boshoff, now Colonel Boshoff, of the Signalling School, the officer in charge of the Eastern Province Commland, now Brigadier Van Deventer, and Commandant Patterson of the Sixth South African Infantry at Grahamstown. These men deserve our praise and appreciation. If this is the position as I found it to be in the Signalling Corps and later in the Sixth South African Infantry, I am confident that, with few exceptions, this will be the position throughout the force. I hope that this spirit of co-operation and this feeling of confidence which developed in our armed forces and which I found were inspired in these young boys who are called up, will prevail under the present Minister and that he will build on the foundations laid by his predecessor. It is a major issue for parents when their children leave home, particularly when they join large organizations in which accidents may occur. They should be confident that accidents will not occur as a result of negligence.</p>

<p>There is one question I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister. I know of a young boy who returned after he had completed his training. In the Army he was taught to drive certain vehicles and it was endorsed on his licence that he could drive 30 different types of vehicles. On returning home with his licence, he had to go through a complicated process to obtain his civil licence. He first had to go to the local traffic depot, where he had to pay 50 cents to pass a test. Thereafter he went to the Revenue offices where he had to pay more money after he had furnished two photos of himself. He returned for a road test to the traffic department, where he had to pay more money and thereafter he had to go back to the Revenue offices where he had to pay R3 for his driver&#x2019;s licence. He had to comply with all these things after he had learned to drive all kinds of heavy vehicles in the Army.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to the military licence. The boys do not pass a road test to obtain that licence. They write an examination which is much more comprehensive than the road test. I shall be glad if the Minister will do something about this anomaly because I feel it <span class="col_5999-6000" refersTo="page_0204"/>is unjust towards the boys to have to take all those steps to obtain a licence after they have been trained so well to drive vehicles in the Army. I feel something may be done about this matter, but I shall not suggest anything because I know, Mr. Chairman, you will rule me out or order.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to something which has been discussed on previous occasions, something which is not approved of in the Army, and that is the titles of the ranks of junior officers. The young man who receives his commission does not feel happy about the fact that he will be called an &#x201C;asvel&#x201D;, an assistant field-cornet. The next rank is that of field-cornet. This was the title given to a civil post which existed in the olden days. The justice of peace of the district was usually known as the field-cornet. He was the person who performed the work at present being performed by a justice of the peace, and even the commissioner of oaths was referred to as a field-cornet in those days. This rank never really met with approval in the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one is quite baffled to find that during the discussion on this Vote the main speaker on the Opposition only gets up to complain because pick handles are being stored in stores, while there is allegedly no room for more valuable equipment. If this is the only complaint he can raise in regard to this Vote, South Africa&#x2019;s defence matters are in very good order. The hon. member wants the pick handles to be left outside and the jeeps to be placed inside, but he must remember that one can most probably store a couple of thousand pick handles in the space taken up by one jeep. What is more, I do not believe there is one store in the Army to-day which is empty as a result of a shortage of equipment. Not only were the stores empty in the days of the United Party Government, but in addition the equipment of the Defence Force was negelected and mishandled recklessly. But to-day all the stores are filled with useful and strategic equipment and we are ready to defend our country effectively. As a result of that, and not as a result of maladministration or anything of that nature, our stores are filled to overflowing. It is as a result of our country&#x2019;s preparedness in the military field that the stores are so full and that we do not have room to store everything. When the National Party took over in 1948, the Defence Force was in the process of disintegrating, because the United Party thought it was no longer necessary to be prepared.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I just want to touch on one or two matters. In the times in which we are living, we are becoming aware of how necessary it is for us to be ready to defend South Africa at all times and at all costs. The people look up to the Government, to the Minister and to the Supreme Command to ensure their safety. It is, however, not only the responsibility of the Government, the Minister and the Supreme Command. Defence is the duty of all of us and it is in the interests of all of us that our country should be defended. It is in the interests of the individual, it is in the interests of the family, it is in the interests of the industrialist, of the farmer, of the town council and of the city council, that South Africa&#x2019;s Defence Force should be one of the best. While the State has the duty and the responsibility to see to the basic training, the necessary equipment, the soldiers&#x2019; pay, etc., I, nevertheless want to say that it is the responsibility of the public at large to contribute to South Africa&#x2019;s being ready for action and ready to defend itself.</p>

<p>I therefore want to say something about the attitude of our non-active citizens in regard to defence. I want to say something about the attitude of our population towards those liable for military service. In recent times many pleas have been made and a good deal has been said in regard to the way in which our hearts and homes should be open to our Defence Force men, and I want to associate myself with that. Firstly, I want to repeat with emphasis that our young men are in need of some contact with the outside civilian world during their training. Often the young men are far from their homes, far from their family. All of a sudden their home ties have been drastically cut off. Often they find themselves in strange surroundings. Do the members of the public, who in winter sit safely round the fireplace and enjoy its pleasant warmth, and who in summer walk around outside and enjoy our green scenery, know how those men long to do a bit of sight-seeing, to enter a home on occasion, to sit at a table and enjoy a plate of food and the company of a family?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says they are not on holiday. I am not pleading for them to be treated as holiday-makers. But surely it will boost their morale if they can enjoy these things. It is interesting that the hon. member for Green Point says they are not on holiday. But this is not the attitude of the Capetonians as I see it reflected in their actions when warships visit South Africa. When the troop ships and warships of other countries visit us, the hearts and homes of the Capetonians are open to the troops and sailors from Britain, America and elsewhere. Therefore the hon. member&#x2019;s interjection is an unappropriate one in the light of what I said. <span class="col_6001-6002" refersTo="page_0205"/>I want to tell him that I believe that if the Capetonians think a bit further and think of the sons of South Africa, they will also open their hearts and homes to the men at Yster-plaat, Wingfield and elsewhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Just as the men of other countries go to sea for a year or longer, our men also go away from their homes for a year and also long for a little homely hospitality. Therefore I want to plead to-day that we in South Africa should make a point of receiving our young men in our homes. We have been talking about this matter for quite a few years already, but so many people have not yet suited their actions to their words.</p>

<p>I want to discuss another matter now. Our Active Citizen Force units and especially our commandos are stationed mainly in areas which are identifiable with a district, a town or a city. I myself was attached to an Active Citizen Force unit and I know from personal experience that the Citizen Force, and the commandos much more so, have very great problems as far as proper accommodation is concerned. I am referring to the obtaining of a suitable building to serve as headquarters of the unit from which the unit&#x2019;s administrative work can be done and which can serve as a meeting-point. Sometimes somebody&#x2019;s private home has to be used for this purpose. In his study an extra cupboard has to be fitted in which the commando&#x2019;s administrative documents are kept. It is a great sacrifice to that person and his family and sometimes heavy demands are made as regards, <i>inter alia,</i> the use of his private telephone. Sometimes he must make many calls in connection with the administration of his unit. Sometimes the unit&#x2019;s meeting-place is a football field or a shooting-range where there are no facilities in the form of buildings.</p>

<p>I know that there has recently been a favourable reaction on the part of local authorities. However, I want to appeal to the local authorities to-night to give serious consideration to providing proper headquarters for units stationed in their towns or areas. It is impossible for the State to meet all these needs, because there are other priorities for which the money is required. Our local authorities and other local bodies must bear in mind that these units, and especially the commandos, are there for the very purpose of providing local defence. But not only local authorities must consider doing something in this regard. Other bodies can help as well. For example, what I have in mind is that a local authority can make the land available for the headquarters of a unit, while other bodies can provide the building material and the furniture. Women&#x2019;s organizations and others can also be of assistance. Our industrialists can help too. As I say, what is involved here is the protection, the safety, the defence of all of us, and all of us are concerned in this matter. Not only the Minister, the Supreme Command, the Government, and the members of the commando are responsible for this.</p>

<p>I just want to touch on a last point. I am grateful that many local authorities are already making provision for their employees to be granted special paid leave to attend training camps or courses. But unfortunately all employers are not as co-operative as this. Many members of the Citizen Force and the commandos have to make use of their ordinary holiday leave to attend camps and courses in order to equip themselves better in the interests of the safety of all of us. I therefore want to express the hope and desire that all employers will make it possible for their employees to attend courses. [Time expired.]</p>

Before I do so, however, I wish to say to the hon. member who has just sat down that it is all very well to ask that trainees should be entertained during all the free time which they have when they are at these camps. I would prefer to see their social free time reduced so that they can get on with their training and then be sent back home where they belong.

<p>These are my views and I think the hon. member is off course.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred in somewhat sarcastic terms to the speech of the hon. member for Point. Let me say quite frankly it is never the intention of this side of the House to have an acrimonious debate over defence matters. This is a subject which I think everybody treats with circumspection, because most people realize the necessity for an efficient defence force. But when one says that, one must remember there are also other people, who are anxious to participate in training schemes and the defence of the country. I refer now to the Cape Coloured Corps. I should like the Minister to know that the Coloured community will be disappointed to hear, what the Minister wrote to me, namely that no further Coloured camps will be established other than the one which exists at Eersterivier. I think this decision is a mistake. The Minister should apply his mind to the need and necessity to make the maximum use of the Coloured community in defence matters. It has always been the policy in this country, that the Coloured people should fill non-combatant positions. There is no need to change that at this stage. I think the Minister should begin to integrate these people in to the country&#x2019;s defence system. I know the word &#x201C;integrate&#x201D; is not popular, on that side of the House, but it is the correct word to use in this connection. They should be integrated into the duties and occupations, which they could fill and would fill, if this country were unfortunately to become involved in an armed <span class="col_6003-6004" refersTo="page_0206"/>conflict. I remember how during the last war Coloured community, provided first-class soldiers, who did transport work in a capable and loyal manner, and who were first-class soldiers when they got up north. I want to ask the Minister whether he would not consider introducing a scheme whereby the Coloured men could take over these particular jobs.</p>

<p>I was one of those who toured the defence installations at Pretoria. I must say the treatment we received was very good indeed, for which I am very appreciative. We were able to see quite a number of things, and what that struck me most, was the many duties performed by young white man in the defence force, which could quite easily and successfully be done by Coloured youths and Coloured trainees. I believe the Minister could get a suitable type of Coloured recruit for this purpose, so that the white lads and men, could be released for duties which they consider they could do better than Coloured personnel. Naturally the Minister must make it attractive for these people to enter the forces. In this connection I wish to say I was very disappointed to hear in answer to a question that the Coloured P.F. members were not given any increases in 1966 and 1967, although all European men were given better salary grades and, scales and also pay increases. I do not know why the Government persists in discriminating between these scales, just because a man has a brown skin. Goods and commodities are just as expensive for the brown man as for the white one. He pays the same for a loaf of bread as his white fellow-countryman. It so often happens that white workers are given pay increases whilst the Coloured man is left entirely out of the picture. This applies to all fields of employment in this country. I want to ask the Minister whether he would not consider setting a good example by making the Coloured men&#x2019;s pay scales more reasonable than they are at the moment.</p>

<p>I also wish to ask the Minister whether any decision has been arrived at regarding the requests, which came from the Coloured Legion of the B.E.S.L. They asked whether the White instructors at the Coloured depot here in the Cape would gradually be replaced by Coloured men, if and when available. Will he consider giving these people the same rank? The police were faced with the same problem. They courageously decided to create ranks for Coloured policemen and I think they will get good results. I therefore put it to this hon. the Minister that the time has come for him to do the same thing in regard to Coloured personnel in the P.F.</p>

<p>I also wish to ask the Minister whether it is correct that he is to establish a camp or a training centre for Indians on the same basis as that for the Coloureds. My information is that the Minister of Indian Affiairs, and I speak subject to correction, has indicated his intention of doing that. Apparently the Minister of Defence has not yet committed himself to this undertaking. I believe the Indian community will do just as good a job as the Coloured community has done, and will do, in future. We know that during the war the Indian and Malay Corps was a most useful unit and able to shoulder responsibility and share in the activities in which they were engaged.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Coloured people is that they see very little future for themselves in the country&#x2019;s defence force. I have been told they are reluctant to join the armed forces as a career. Whether that be true or false, my information is that the salaries and wages paid to them, militate against them making the forces their career. I believe the nucleus of the Coloured Corps is so sound and solid that it could be extended to the advantage of the Coloured community in particular and of this country in general.</p>

<p>My final point is this. I wish to express my appreciation on behalf of the Coloured community for the change, which took place in the uniforms of the Cape Corps band. The change was a good thing and the community are very happy about it. The old uniform was a drab affair whilst the new one is much more attractive. I should like the Minister to know that, although we often criticize him, when improvements are effected for which the Minister should be given credit we are the first to admit he has done a good job.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have only a few minutes at my disposal, and I shall put my case as briefly as possible seeing that I shall not be here on Monday. Seventy years ago Voortrekkerhoogte was established, and in this time which is more or less equal to a person&#x2019;s lifespan, it has developed and reached out over the whole of the Republic of South Africa. It has gained a position of respect, strength and love in the hearts of the whites of South Africa. Over this period of 70 years an excellent tradition has been built up, and if posterity were one day to erect a hall of fame or of victory, many of the faces which would be seen there would be those of people who had been at Vortrekkerhoogte, people who had been there during the 70 years of its growth during which time Voortrekkerhoogte had been training people for our nation.</p>

<p>As back-bencher I should have liked to touch upon a few other matters, for example our relationship with the rest of Africa, new forces which have developed and which may give us enormous, new military possibilities and arms, but seeing that the time is so short, I shall not go into those things any further.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the half hour? On Friday when my time expired, I was dealing with our concern about the millions of rands&#x2019; worth of equipment which was lying unprotected, open to wind and weather and resultant deterioration. I was pleading that urgent attention be given to the care, maintenance and protection of this equipment. I had also sought an assurance that the purchases which we were making in large quantities were all in fact essential and that we were not purchasing items which were easily available locally at short notice. I had used, purely as an example, one item, and the hon. member for Waterkloof reacted to it. I thought it would have been an item which he would have understood from the military history of groups in South Africa, namely the item of pick handles, but I will use other examples, if he wishes me to do so. Take the example of &#x201C;draadknippers&#x201D; which are there in large numbers. The hon. member might find that more in line with his appreciation of military armaments. Sir, I was dealing with things which are easily available in South Africa. But I do not want to take it further.</p>

<p>We have sought opportunities and machinery to deal with these things in forums other than this House; they have been denied us and therefore we have no choice but to raise these matters here across the floor. It is our duty to do so now, and I intend to raise certain matters regarding administration, many of which I believe could better be discussed in other forums, but as the circumstances are, we must deal with them here.</p>

<p>The first matter is that of the national service scheme which was introduced last year and has started operating for the first time this year. I accept that it is too early to judge the effect of the changes we made last year, but there are some issues which must be raised immediately. The first I wish to refer to is the &#x201C;Guide to the Call-up&#x201D; which has been issued by the Department and on which I would like to congratulate them. This is an excellent publication which, I believe, gives the basic information which is necessary. It is only right that I should draw attention to it and commend it to those who are about to become liable for military duty. A study of this publication gives them a clear picture of their rights, their choices, the fields in which they can apply to be taken up into the service and the machinery for selection. I hope that the selection boards this year will be able to function as is envisaged in this document. Last year, the hon. the Minister will be the first to admit, the selection boards did not function as they should have done. The Minister himself in the debate last year said that it was his objective to have on those boards members of the services and civilians aware of local conditions. I hope he can tell us that this year that will be done and that allocation will be made by aptitude and according to planned careers. Despite the intentions and the assurances, people are still being allocated to units quite unsuitable to their aptitudes and to their studies. I have come across a number of student doctors recently who have been called up for infantry training, in direct conflict with the policy of the Department. I think steps must be taken to prevent this fitting of square pegs into round holes. I hope, too, that consideration will be given to those who are apprentices and who in the Army can do apprenticeship training, which will be recognized as being part of their apprenticeship training in civilian life. It seems silly for a man who is being trained as a fitter to do nine months&#x2019; training as a fitter and then to go out into civilian life without receiving any credit for that training. I hope that we can have some sort of consultation which will allow at least some of the military training to be placed to the credit of these trainees. I hope, too, that the Minister will give consideration to our suggestion from this side last year that university units be established to cover such subjects as engineering, signalling, the specialist sciences, so that people at a university taking specialist courses can in fact make use of their training in fields of value to the Army.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to the call-up. The hon. the Minister in reply to questions stated that he had called up 22,460 servicemen for the Citizen Force and 10,062 for the commandos. I suggest that the Defence Force has not got the facilities to deal with those numbers, and that the facilities are being strained beyond what is available in the way of resources, buildings, equipment and instructors. I call as my witness no less a person than the hon. the Minister himself, who a year ago said that it was his intention to call up no more <span class="col_6007-6008" refersTo="page_0208"/>than 17,000 for the Citizen Force and 7,000 for the commandos. I have the reference from Hansard here, but I do not want to bore the House with details. These, however, are the figures the Minister himself gave. In point of fact, he has called up 22,500, some 5,500 more for the Citizen Force than he himself last year said was the figure for which facilities were available. He has called up 3,000 more for the commandos than he himself said the forces were able to handle. The numbers are there, but the fact is that the facilities are not there to handle them, and in many of the camps the facilities are being stretched to breaking point. I believe we cannot afford today to waste our young men&#x2019;s time and efforts unless we are able to use that time effectively. I hope the hon. the Minister can tell the House to-day that he has taken steps to ensure that the shortfall in facilities, weapons and training instructors will not continue and that those steps are proving successful. We cannot afford to have men called up to spend their time in idleness. I accept immediately there have been improvements, but they have not been able to cope with the task which has been placed upon the department. We should like to see that all men called up can be handled properly, effectively and in the interests of the defence of South Africa.</p>

<p>Against this background of already having too many trainees I want to raise a matter which we raised last year. At the time we received what we understood was an assurance from the Minister. I am referring to the pre-August, 1967, ballotees. I raised the matter here myself and I think all of us gathered, that those men who had completed their full-time training for which they were liable, that is the men who did nine months continuous training and then two camps thereafter, would not have the new Act applied to them. But the Act technically lays down that those on the strength of units as at August last year would fall under the new Act. We have a surplus of men, and although technically in terms of the Act those who were still on unit strength are liable to do an extra 26-days camp, the spirit in which we discussed this matter last year here, and I believe in the Select Committee too, was that those who had completed their full-time requirements would be regarded as having completed their liability. I ask the Minister, where he has got a surplus of men, not to apply retrospectively an additional six years&#x2019; liability and an additional camp to those who have done all they were asked to do in the way of full-time training at the time they were called up. Those young men, having completed their full-time training as they thought, have planned their lives. They have planned to travel, they have planned to study, they have planned their lives ahead. They have done what they were asked to do by the legislature of South Africa. I ask the Minister to reconsider this and to call up new national servicemen, but not to apply the new provisions retrospectively to those who were still on unit strength but had no further liability for full-time training.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of payment. Last year the Minister gave a clear undertaking to the House. He promised that the question of the 26-day and the 12-day camps would be considered very sympathetically and, although he could make no commitments, he hoped to be able to announce an improvement. Since then we have had an improvement in regard to dependants&#x2019; allowances. That we welcomed; that had been long overdue. In fact, I had been writing to the Minister and his predecessor since 1963 about it. But now I ask that the 26-day and 12-day camps be placed on the permanent force pay scales and that the Minister institute an inquiry into the hardships caused to those whose civilian pay is not made up. By the time these lads get to their third camp they are 24, 25, and even 28 years of age. They have families and responsibilities. They have hire purchase payments to make as well as rent, electricity and water accounts. They had responsibilities to meet. I feel that an urgent inquiry is called for to try to level out the hardship which is being demanded of our youth. Some are receiving full pay from their employers and in some Government departments the difference is made up. I hope that the hon. the Minister can tell us that he is prepared to go into this matter and that he will give us some assurance that a very careful inquiry will be conducted into this situation.</p>

<p>As regards the training itself, it is again a little early to judge. I should, however, like to refer to one or two matters which I believe require immediate attention. On Friday the hon. member for Outeniqua referred to bilingualism in the armed forces. I regret to say that my information is that whilst in the Air Force and the Navy strict and scrupulous attention is paid to bilingualism, in certain Army camps this is not the case. Trainees go through their training virtually in a unilingual camp. I believe that this is something which is not the intention of the department. It is not in the normal spirit of the department. I have, however, heard this from a number of trainees and I believe that this is something which requires attention.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of motivation lectures. I think it is important that I should quote an extract from a letter I received in regard to quite another matter from a serviceman. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have motivation lectures which are violently anti-English and very childish. I guess you must know just the type of lecture. Anyway, I am sure that you would be as thrilled as I am when you see both the English and the Afrikaans chaps standing united against these lectures. One of the main reasons for the lectures seems to be to breed hatred for the Americans. Do you dislike the Americans? I have great admiration for them except for their race policy which seems to have backfired.</block>

<p><span class="col_6009-6010" refersTo="page_0209"/>This, therefore, is not a liberal or a crank, nor a person who is writing to complain, but a person saying how proud he is. I think it is a pity that this sort of thing should be possible in our forces. I want to make an appeal that the supervision by officers or these lectures and of training be intensified. I believe that too much is left in the hands of the N.C.O.s.</p>

<p>Having spoken on Friday I have to restrict my time now, but I should like to refer to one or two other matters in the Permanent Force. I want to say immediately that I believe that South Africa is fortunate in having so many outstanding leaders in our Defence Force. The morale of our leadership corps has been rebuilt and I believe it stands at a very high level. It is therefore more the pity, and I am sorry to have to raise this matter, that two recent appointments have shaken that spirit. They have been regarded&#x2014;and whether it is right or wrong is not the question&#x2014;as political appointments. [Interjections.] Hon. members can complain but it is my duty to raise these matters. Two appointments were made. In one case 18 officers were superseded. There was meteoric promotion of someone who had spent only a year or 15 months in some particular post. These are facts and I say as a fact that these two promotions have created resentment throughout the force&#x2014; right through to the lower ranks. People have said that if that can happen at the top it can happen to us here lower down.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members can say that I am talking nonsense but this is a fact. I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to shake the spirit which has been built up amongst our leadership corps by making appointments which lead to criticism of this nature and to a suspicion which I believe has been absent in the Defence Force in the past three or four years. I think that it is only our duty that we should raise this matter here.</p>

<p>The Permanent Force is suffering, as it has done for years, from a critical shortage of manpower. I believe that one of the things the Minister should do, is to reconsider the question of a Discharge Board, to try to get to the root of the reasons for people leaving the service. Last year eight graduates in one particular arm of the service, who had graduated at the end of 1966, started their careers in the forces. Within 15 months every one of those university graduates had left. In the Air Force we do not have the pilots to take all our planes up. We have not sufficient for our minimum needs, as we see it in the case of an emergency. This is due to people resigning from the forces. I asked questions. I do not have time to deal with the detail here. They are trained at tremendous cost. The estimate in one case is R500,000. And then they leave the forces to take up civilian occupations. I believe that apart from mere pay, the conditions of service must be considered. Housing will be dealt with by another member. That must be reconsidered. The whole question of recruitment must be considered. I believe that there are many grounds for improvement. Again I do not have time to quote them, but I know of one lad who actually went to sign up with the Navy. He went along with the intention of signing up. But through inability to get information, he left and he has now joined the Police Force, a man who wanted to join a specialist branch of the Navy. I believe the whole psychological approach to recruitment needs a radical consideration and review. I believe too that even those who have left&#x2014; the Minister knows of a case I took up with him of a technical officer&#x2014;often suffer from personality clashes. But I want to raise one case which I think is ridiculous enough to deserve attention. That is that an officer on the Reserve, who wanted to go back to the Permanent Force but who was refused, and who is now lecturing at a technical high school. He was needed for the cadet detachment of that high school. He applied in March of last year. In October the regulations were changed, and he re-applied. In April this year he was turned down as a cadet officer, because he was on the reserve of officers. Why on earth, when we are shouting for people to help us build up the force, does that sort of thing happen? There are other cases of people who are not being used when they could be used. There is lack of planning. I hope our intelligence forces are more subtle than our security section. The man wanting to join up is asked the following questions: &#x201C;Have you ever belonged to a Communist party?&#x201D; now what man who is joining the army is going to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;? Other questions are: &#x201C;If yes, give details. What are your views regarding Communism? Have you at any time belonged to any other organization?&#x201D; There seems to be a paper phobia. What is the point in filling in a form with this sort of ridiculous question. What Communist is going to give that sort of information by filling in a form and signing his name? &#x201C;Have you ever undergone psychiatric treatment? What is your religion?&#x201D; Whose business is it what a person&#x2019;s religion is when he is being screened for security?</p>

<p>And so it carries on. There are many administrative issues which also require attention. There are many details of administration which I believe could be streamlined. If this were done, then I believe that some of the top-heaviness in administration could be diverted to the training of our nationa servicemen. That could provide some of the facilities which are necessary in order to handle the number which must be handled. I can give other details, but I will only give one detail of lack of planning. I do this again, because I do not have an option. A beautiful, highly technical installation was established at a cost of millions of rands. Now that it is completed a hole is being dug to bury it underground. This lack of planning costs thousands of rands. <span class="col_6011-6012" refersTo="page_0210"/>There is no reason for spending money in this manner. If a secret installation is planned, surely it is known whether it should be built above the ground or underground? This is the sort of thing that cannot be thrown across the floor of the House in detail. It is, however, our duty to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister and of this Parliament, which is responsible for voting the R252 million which is asked of us this year. Finally, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to answer a question I have asked year after year. When is the Salisbury Island naval base going to be established in Durban and when is the Natal Command going to be moved? The whaling people have moved out of Salisbury Island and I feel that part of the overall plan requires the implementation of these two moves which have been on the board for so long.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret to say it, but when defence matters are discussed the hon. member for Durban (Point) apparently cannot resist speaking in the vein in which he spoke during the latter part of his speech. Older members of this House will remember the days when the United Party distinguished itself in defence debates through a previous hon. member for Simonstown. At that time the most terrible stories were told in this House about the Defence Force. That hon. member regarded this House as the place to say such things to the detriment of our Defence Force and our country. I want to tell the hon. member for Durban (Point) this afternoon that he is well on the way to equalling and upholding that very same tradition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What do you require of us? Do you want us to shut up and thank the hon. the Minister?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has been a member of this House for many years now. Before that he was also a member of the Other Place and he therefore knows what Parliament is there for. I refuse to believe that Parliament is there for the purpose of holding such discussions on this level. The people expect us to hold discussions of a high standard, particularly when a matter such as Defence is being discussed. The hon. member should not refer in this House to two officers and suggest that they undermined the morale of the Defence Force as a result of their promotion. Why did the hon. member not mention their names? One of the officers to whom he referred this afternoon is present here now. The hon. member alleged that this officer was promoted over the heads of 17 or 18 other officers. Is it not a fact that officer was promoted on merit and not for political reasons as the hon. member alleged? I want to tell him that he may ask any responsible person in the Defence Force whether there is any doubt in his mind as to the merits and capabilities of those two officers. The hon. member will not find one single person. What the hon. member said here this afternoon is a disgrace. The same applies to the suggestion he made that justice was not being done to bilingualism in the Defence Force under this Government. Is the memory of the hon. member so short? Should we tell him what happened in the days, 20 years ago, when his Party was in power? At that time the Defence Force was an extension of the British Defence Force and its information service was an extension of the propaganda machine of the United Party. If the hon. member for Durban (Point) wants to discuss defence matters in this vein, he will be paid back in his own coin. I want to warn the hon. member that he should not follow the course which was followed by a previous hon. member for Simonstown, because then his Party will deteriorate even further.</p>

<p>In contrast with what was said by the hon. member, I want to say that our country to-day feels proud of our Defence Force, of the people who are in charge of it and of what it means to our country. Something that particularly strikes me as far as our Defence Force is concerned, especially under the present circumstances, is the exceptional adaptability which it has displayed. This adaptability enables our Defence Force to cope with the threat with which we are faced and which confronts us in various forms. The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to the system of compulsory military service and expressed doubts about the operation of this system. I feel myself quite at liberty to say to-day that though the system of compulsory military service has been in operation or only a few months now, so that the real test will only be applied in a year&#x2019;s time, this system has not only eliminated a large number of anomalies, but has also helped to bring about a new approach towards the Defence Force among our population as a whole. I want to say a few words about this aspect this afternoon. The Defence Force should not be divorced from our people, but should form part of the people, because we are in fact building up a national defence force. I therefore want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Waterkloof and that is that local communities and authorities must do their share in providing facilities for our various Defence Force units. Our local communities must do their share in looking after our young men who sacrifice the best years of their lives for the defence of our country. Aslo in communities where local headquarters are situated, one sees an opportunity for the local authority and the community concerned to contribute financially in order to support such local headquarters, which are very often the joint headquarters of more than one unit. I can foresee that it will become necessary to provide headquarters for four different units, together with the commando, in my own constituency. I want to plead that the local communities should realize their duty in this respect and should make a contribution towards the provision of such facilities.</p>

<p>I have already said that our Defence Force is adaptable. The best proof of its adaptability<span class="col_6013-6014" refersTo="page_0211"/>I myself saw last year when various Citizen Force regiments arranged their training camps and carried out their manoeuvres in this area instead of going to their usual training bases. These manoeuvres proved that it was necessary for Defence units to get to know their own areas, and that it was possible for them to do so. It is a sound practice for units always to go to the same training camps which have the necessary facilities, but it is equally necessary for Defence Force units to be properly acquainted with their own areas. In this connection it is, of course, particularly our comandos which distinguish themselves as regards knowing their own areas. I know of a regiment which carried out manoeuvres in the immediate vicinity of the Western Cape, with one of the local commandos playing the part of the enemy. This regiment could not succeed in tracking down the commando, which acted as terrorists, by reason of the fact that the latter knew the terrain so well. We are dealing here once again with the adaptability of the Defence Force. The Defence Force did what the police are already doing, i.e. to make use of dogs. The so-called enemy was tracked down very quickly iby means of these dogs. This is proof of the fact that there is a great element of adaptability in our Defence Force and that it will not always train its members by means of conventional methods alone, but that it will train its members to enable them to act in such a manner that they can cope with the threats which exist to-day. For that reason one is glad to learn that our Defence Force is considering the possibility of developing this adaptability even further, and to re-introduce mounted units in some of our rural commandos and to give the horse its rightful place again in the Defence Force. I believe it is being contemplated to establish a cavalry school at the Military Academy. Mr. Chairman, this tradition is not only a fine one in our Defence Force, but I believe that the horse, particularly in our commandos, can play an important part in certain rural areas in order to enable those commandos to carry out their tasks properly. But I want to go further and I want to say that it will be useful for any member of the Defence Force, even if he is a Mirage pilot, to know the fundamental principles as far as handling a horse is concerned. It is the idea that some of our urban commandos may perhaps be equipped with motor cycles, that they will be motorized, and one also welcomes this idea, because it takes into account the requirements of the commandos in the particular task they have to fulfil in the urban areas. In the Other Place the hon. the Minister referred to the future division of commandos into rural and urban and also industrial commandos. The main task of the latter will be to protect large industrial areas. In this connection I should like to point out that under our new system of compulsory military service, there is another category of commandos to which particular attention will have to be given, namely the commandos which will act in the immediate vicinity of university centres. It so happens that a large number of prospective students who want to go to university immediately after they have left school receive their training in these commandos and are then assigned to the local commandos. It requires no imagination to see that the commandos in the immediate vicinity of university centres will have to carry a very large number of student members in future, students who will not remain members of those commandos for many years either [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the hon. member for Stellenbosch became so upset because my colleague had expressed some criticism. Does he expect all of us to sit here and do nothing but talk about the achievements of the Defence Force? We have candidly admitted that there has been a very great improvement, but this does not mean that all of us have to talk only about that all the time. I just want to remind the hon. member of the days when his party sat on this side of the House. Just consider how the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Defence carried on in this House in those days, during the war years. They expressed criticism in season and cut of season; sometimes they were right and sometimes they were wrong. But it was their right to criticize. The hon. member should therefore not become so annoyed when we express criticism.</p>

<p>Sir, there are a few matters I should like to discuss with the Minister in the few minutes at my disposal. The first concerns a point which has already been touched upon by the hon. member for Durban (Point) and that is the serious shortage of staff in the Permanent Force. Since I have been a member of this House we have drawn attention to this enormous staff shortage year after year. It seems to us as if the position is not really improving at all. The figures I received from the hon. the Minister at the beginning of this year indicated that at that time there was a shortage of plus-minus 20 per cent as regards officers in the Permanent Force and more than 33 per cent in the case of non-commissioned officers and other ranks. This shortage is continuing, in spite of the thorough and intensive training provided throughout the year. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can tell us whether he can foresee any improvement in the future. Are there any new plans his Department is contemplating in order to improve this position? We cannot get away from the fact that the Permanent Force is the cornerstone of the whole of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>This brings me to the following point, which was mentioned by my colleague, namely the safe-keeping and the maintenance of the large number of vehicles and other equipment we have bought in the past. I am convinced that the serious staff shortage in the Permanent Force is one of the reasons why this equipment<span class="col_6015-6016" refersTo="page_0212"/> cannot be maintained properly. In many cases these vehicles and specialized equipment stand out in the open. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not think the time has come for the greater part of that equipment to be brought under cover and not be concentrated in one place.</p>

<p>While discussing this matter, I am thinking at the same time of the large fuel depots which have been erected at various places in the country. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is responsible for them, but these depots are most definitely of great strategic importance, and I think this is a matter which does concern his Department to a large extent. I am thinking, for example, of the oil depot at the Milnerton complex not far from here. It forms an ideal target for a bomber, because it is there for all to see. It can be reached not only from the air, but also from the sea. Was the Minister&#x2019;s Department consulted when these depots were built? Can they not be dispersed over a larger area? It seems to me to be quite wrong to put so many eggs in one basket. I am only mentioning this one case near by; there are other places in our country where you have the same position.</p>

<p>There is another minor matter I should like to raise, a matter which the hon. member for Durban (Point) also touched upon, and that is the question of the payment of the members of our Citizen Force when they are sent away to the training camps for 26 days and 12 days. We find that in many cases these people are in fact paid by their employers for the period during which they undergo military training, but there are other cases where they are not paid anything by their employers. This question does not necessarily affect the men this year or next year, but it will definitely affect them as they become older and as their obligations increase. I want to make a very strong plea that the hon. the Minister should go into this matter to see whether some method cannot be found to meet these men.</p>

<p>Another point I feel very strongly about is the designations given to certain ranks in our Defence Force. I am thinking here of the rank of field-cornet, the rank of commandant and the rank of combat-general. I think we all agree that these designations are not very popular in the Defence Force. These designations of rank are simply not gaining acceptance. We introduced the rank of field-cornet a number of years ago: this rank dates back to the old Republican days, but it is not and has never been a military rank.</p>

<p>Before the Boer War a field-comet was somebody who was in charge of a ward. A field-cornet was a sort of justice of the peace; he was a sort of liaison officer between the public and the government. It was only when the war broke out that these people assumed a military rank. I feel that we should rather abolish this rank and revert to the rank of lieutenant, which is a more suitable one. The rank of &#x201C;commandant&#x201D; is quite wrong. &#x201C;Commandant&#x201D; is not a rank and has never been one. A commandant is the officer in command of any place or institution, and any person with any rank can be a commandant. You could get a commandant of a college, a commandant of a camp and a commandant of a base. It can be a person of any rank. I want to ask the Minister to go into this matter to see whether we cannot revert to the old rank of lieutenant-colonel. If we change those two ranks, we shall bring the position into line with that of the other Western nations with.whom we shall have to join forces in time of war.</p>

<p>The third rank is that of combat-general. I do not think this is a suitable designation. The rank of combat-general is also one which originated in the Anglo-Boer War when the commandant-general appointed men to lead the burghers in the field. These combat-generals actually took part in the combat. But very few of our combat-generals will still take part in actual combat to-day. All of them fall outside those spheres, and we would do well to abolish this rank and to revert to the rank of major-general. We have the ridiculous position to-day that a combat-general is in charge of Civil Defence. Surely his duties do not include actual combat. There are very few combat-generals in the Air Force who will be called upon to do combat duty. I hope the Minister will consider this question of reverting to the old designations of these ranks.</p>

<p>In the few moments left to me I want to say a few words about the Department of Civil Defence. We are here concerned with a matter which affects all of us, and it is no good the people in charge and their staff doing their utmost if the public as such is not interested and does not do its share, because then Civil Defence cannot be a success. The success of Civil Defence depends entirely on the public. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I have heard that the introduction of awards of honour and decorations is being investigated in South Africa. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that when a suitable occasion arises, he should have the hon. member for Durban (Point) decorated, and I want to suggest that he should choose as an emblem for that hon. member crossed pick handles and a bicycle chain, because I think that will be most apt. I have said this on a previous occasion and I have not yet had any reason to change my opinion. I do not want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for North Rand. Other hon. members on my side of the House will reply to that. But I want to deal with a few points raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point), <i>inter alia,</i> the question of bilingualism in the Naw and the Air Force and the lack thereof in the Army. Sir, it is just the other way round, and only now are things coming right gradually. We are still stuck with a unilingual Navy and Air Force because of their traditional<span class="col_6017-6018" refersTo="page_0213"/> background. We have a number of people in those arms of the Defence Force who can even now hardly speak any Afrikaans, and he talks to them and I talk to them and he knows to whom I am referring. There are people in positions of command who are not sufficiently bilingual to be able to speak proper Afrikaans, but now he is complaining about bilingualism in the Army.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The Army is the one unit of our forces which has achieved the degree of bilingualism which we should like to have, and in the other two arms of the Defence Force our problems are considerably bigger; we are still engaged in introducing bilingualism into those two arms. The hon. member referred to the political appointment of senior officers in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>Why was he not more specific? About what appointment was he complaining? Why does he, without being more specific, repeat malicious gossip here? Does he perhaps have any objection to the appointment of the chief of the Joint Combat Forces, which is a very high rank, that of lieutenant-general? This is an appointment which was made recently. Does he have any objection to that? Another very important appointment was made in the Defence Force, an extremely important appointment. We had the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff, a very senior post, which a lieutenant-general occupies at the moment. Does he have any objection to or misgivings about this appointment? Against whom are his accusations? And the public outside who read this malicious gossip, about whom are they to have their misgivings after the hon. member has fired his blank cartridge here? It is worthless. If he wants to make objections about some officer, he should discuss the merits of that officer here and should say on what grounds he is objecting, but it is worthless to make these farcical accusations. He is only wasting the time of the Committee with those accusations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) also referred to the lack of training facilities. He himself served in a Select Committe on which evidence of a confidential nature was led and lull particulars were given to that Select Committee. He himself had all those facts when we passed legislation here last year and the hon. member supported that legislation in this House. He had all the evidence of the officers concerned. What is his objection now? Why does he raise objections now after the hon. the Minister has announced the intake of ballotees? No, he should not think that he will get away with that. There are other people who also have some knowledge about what is happening in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>I want to come to three other matters which are of importance to us in South Africa. There have been three recent occurrences in the world which are of the utmost importance to the Republic of South Africa. Firstly, the flame of anarchy has flashed over Europe, and this is going to have implications for us in South Africa. I hope that our Defence Force will at the earliest possible opportunity make a full evaluation of the implications which that is going to. have for South Africa. Secondly, the world has come to a new realization of the value of South Africa, and to an increasing extent South Africa is being looked to as a bastion of white civilization in the world. The other day I met an American who is still corresponding with me, and he says that there are thousands of Americans who want to come here as immigrants. It is the task of our Defence Force to maintain South Africa in that position and as the attraction which it is to those people at the present time in order that state of affairs will not change. However, peace negotiations on Vietnam are in progress. The outcome of those negotiations seems to be that the U.S.A, is going to try for a peace settlement whereby they will emerge from that war retaining the highest degree of self-respect. That will mean that the entire South Eastern Asia is going to come under Chinese influence, and that makes us a first line of defence here on the edge of the Indian Ocean. This will mean that South Africa will have to obtain arms immediately if it wants to act as that line of first defence.</p>

<p>And now I think it should be stated very clearly here so that the West may realize this once and for all, that we simply cannot continue to be a first line of defence for them if they do not want to place the means at our disposal: and secondly, they should not simply count on us if their attitude towards us does not change. Then we will be committed merely to our own defence, and then we no longer are a wheel in the defence of the West. Because this is so, I should like to advocate that we should start cultivating the idea of a South Atlantic Treaty Organization, that we look for allies who have common strategic problems, and that we also look for those allies in the Indian Ocean where Australia and New Zealand are going to find themselves in the front line against the communists and the East, and let us cover those strategic areas for ourselves.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which I still have at my disposal I should like to discuss a few other matters which are more directly concerned with the organisation of our Defence Force. The most important of these is an independent service commission for our forces. I have advocated this matter before and you will find that in the 1964 Hansard, Col. 7231, and the arguments which I advanced at that time are equally valid to-day. We are comparing things to each other which cannot be compared. We are equating posts in the Defence Force to civil posts, by means of the determinations of the Public Service Commission, and this is a state of affairs which simply cannot continue. If we continue that process, we will be undermining the organisation of the Defence Force. I want to make a strong plea <span class="col_6019-6020" refersTo="page_0214"/>to the hon. the Minister to emphasize this matter very strongly once again on the committee of the Cabinet which is concerned in this matter. I just want to mention a few examples. Let us take a commander in the Navy who is at times absent from his home for a month or five weeks because he is serving on the ships. When he is back his hours of service are such that he spends very little time at home. We cannot compare him to someone who occupies a comparable post in the Public Service, for example a public servant in Pretoria who works a five-day week and who is at home with his family fairly early every day. I say this in all fairness to those people who are also rendering services.</p>

<p>There are numerous other posts, and I want to mention only one. Let us take the case of the pilot of a Buccaneer aircraft to-day. He is solely responsible, with his own skill, experience and efficiency, for equipment worth millions of rand while he is in the air. While the man may perhaps have the rank of a lieutenant, surely he cannot be placed on the same level as someone occupying a comparable post according to the present norms in the Public Service. This is the most unfair thing we can do.</p>

<p>I want to touch on a final point and that is the operational use of our commandos. In the first place I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the success which he has achieved with his military school for commandos. Here we have an organization which is going to build up a tradition of its own for us in the commandos. The temptation is very great in view of the large intake of ballotees to try to make a second citizen force of our commando units. Their task and their object must be very sharply defined. In the first place the emphasis in the commandos should fall on the training of the individual. We must make the commando a unit which can be mobilized immediately at the shortest possible notice, because in the event of trouble they have to occupy the first line of defence until such time as our regular forces can take over. Then their function changes to that of covering certain territories, and they are made responsible for communications, the defence of strategic points, etc. Now I am not thinking only of guards for bridges such as we had in the past.</p>

<p>Also on the part of the commandos there must be the closest liaison with civil defence. The commando actually is the unit which has to take upon itself the full implications of civil defence. Specific recommendations in regard to these matters will probably come from this side of the House. In the commandos we have a powerful weapon in South Africa and if we use them correctly and ensure that they will be used correctly operationally, then we have one of the best means of defence at our disposal.

<p>Mr. Chairman, this year a very large amount is being voted for Defence, i.e. R252,700,000, and this is the largest single Vote which this Committee has considered or will consider. In addition to this there is Vote No. 36&#x2014;Civil Defence&#x2014;of R1,100,000. In consequence of this we may therefore say with the highest degree of confidence that this Government is in earnest about placing the defence of this country on a very sound basis. I want to address a special word of thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister who is not only trying to make the Defence Force as streamlined as possible by co-ordinating it in such a way that the different arms and units of the Defence Force will be as effective as possible in the protection of our country, but who is also taking the initiative in awakening interest amongst the public in the defence of our country. Various things are being done in this connection. The commandos have been placed on a more effective basis and there is closer liaison between civil defence and defence as such because civil defence has now been placed under the supreme command of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>I want to make a special appeal to the employers of members of commandos who have to make use of their leave to undergo their training, to be accommodating towards such members as regards the matter of giving them leave I want to address a special word of appreciation to the wives of these men. We often speak of the sacrifices which men have to make for the sake of such matters, but we overlook the wives of those men. Many wives can never go anywhere on a short holiday as their husbands time and again have to use their leave for Defence Force purposes.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words in regard to civil defence. This is one of the most important subdivisions of our defence. I want to address a word of thanks and tribute to the retired director, Mr. Van der Walt, for the excellent work and the spade-work which he did. At the same time I want to congratulate Combat-General Pierre Retief on his appointment as Chief of Civil Defence. I want to thank the hon. the Minister for this appointment. In spite of the stories the United Party has been spreading lately, we can rest assured that this appointment has been made purely on merit. We shall still reap the fruits of this appointment. We shall see to what extent civil defence is going to be developed.</p>

<p>There is a problem as regards civil defence, and that is the reluctance of the public to co-operate. In the target areas there are many people who do not present themselves for the free training offered in fire-fighting, first aid and civil defence in general. Over-confidence is the natural enemy of vigilance. This training should be extended so as to include other emergency services as well, but when the public is reluctant to undergo this training, it is very difficult to make any progress. I am afraid that many people adopt the attitude that it is the task of the other man to protect them too and to provide this service for them. This <span class="col_6021-6022" refersTo="page_0215"/>service has a voluntary basis and I should like to see it remain so. I want to make an appeal to the Minister, however, that if it should become necessary for him to act in terms of section 9 of Act 39 of 1966, the Civil Defence Act, which provides that this training and service may be made compulsory, he should not hesitate to do so. Before this legislation was introduced in this House, I asked the present Prime Minister whether he intended making the training compulsory. His reply was, &#x201C;Optionally compulsory&#x201D;. These words have a much deeper meaning than that which becomes evident at first glance. In other words, it is for the public to realize that they have certain responsibilities in connectiin with civil defence. The State, the Minister and the three arms of the Defence Force are not the only ones who are responsible for civil defence. Every citizen of this country should do his or her share. If it should appear that the public does not show sufficient interest in these training schemes, the Minister would have to give consideration to making this training compulsory.</p>

<p>Now I also want to say a few words about the women&#x2019;s corps who applied to do military service. I am pleased to learn that such a large number of women are interested in this kind of training. It would be a very good thing if this women&#x2019;s corps can also receive training in first aid and other facets of civil defence. Thereafter they will be able to train members of the public who join the units concerned.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to address a word of appreciation to the Oosmoot High School in Pretoria for the establishment of a cadet platoon for girls. Even their uniform is something to be proud of. I hope that more schools will see their way clear to establish cadet platoons for girls.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I make the brief remarks I wish to make, I want to touch on one matter to which each of the previous speakers have referred. Firstly, as far as the hon. member for Hercules is concerned, the criticism that the hon. member for Durban (Point) made concerned two officers about whom a question was asked in this House during this Session. As far as the hon. member for Middelburg is concerned, he returned to the speech of the hon. member for Durban (Point) on bilingualism. The hon. member for Durban (Point) had criticized certain aspects of bilingualism in the Army. I personally have not really obtained sufficient evidence by any means to make a full statement on this topic. I have only had contact with quite a large number of trainees and such persons and the impression I get is that certainly in the Army there is a tendency&#x2014; I will not state it any more definitely at this stage&#x2014;for the languages not to be treated completely equally in the instruction of trainees. I do not wish to take the matter any further. As the hon. member for Durban (Point) has said, we believe that it is the intention of the department to avoid that. I believe that there is no need to take the matter any further at this stage.</p>

<p>This is the first opportunity I have had since we were the guests of the department last November, to express my appreciation for having been invited to visit the various defence installations and the Air Force units. I should like also to express appreciation for the very fine reception we had. Not only of course did we enjoy hospitality, but we often enjoyed it at the inconvenience of the units concerned. I know that I speak for every one on this side when I say how much we valued that. A very pleasant aspect&#x2014;and doubtless all these things were in the minds of our hosts, the hon. the Minister and the department&#x2014;was that we should come into contact with the men of the Force. I am very happy to say that I was uniformly impressed by their dedication to duty and by the quality of the men and their command of their subjects. One was very glad also to inform oneself about the various installations, the living conditions of the trainees. I should like to stress that the whole impression one got was one of considerable efficiency. It is very good indeed to be able to inform oneself in this way of the state of affairs in a department. I do not doubt that this was the basic reason for our invitation, and it is certainly a very good one. It is right that we should know what is the state of the Forces and so on. This undoubtedly helps us very greatly in discharging our duty.</p>

<p>I do, however, feel that there is another aspect necessary to enable us as members of Parliament to discharge our duty in regard to defence matters. And that is that we should know as much as possible of the assessment made of the defence position by the hon. the Minister and his department. I want to go further and say that we should know as far as possible the policy which is being applied to meet this situation. I fully realize that there are secret matters. I also fully realize that the view can be taken that the less the civilians know about these things the less damage they will do. But I also believe that unless we are informed about those matters as well, we can very easily give vent to ill-informed criticism and thereby harm the Force. When I speak of ill-informed criticism I am certainly not thinking only of comments we could make in this House, because the amount of speaking that can be done in this House on defence matters at the present time can be compressed into four hours. Speeches are also made outside and will be made more frequently outside on defence matters. I do not doubt that Members of Parliament will be expected to help in preparing the civilian population to have the right appreciation of what is at stake in these matters. Mr. Chairman, you will know only too well what an honoured part Members of Parliament have played in the past in helping their country to prepare in the right direction in regard to defence matters. One need only think of the sustained attitude of the late <span class="col_6023-6024" refersTo="page_0216"/>Sir Winston Churchill in regard to these matters in his own country.</p>

<p>I want to give just one illustration of the need to know something of the assessment of our defence chiefs of the defence position so that one&#x2019;s criticism will not be ill-informed. We have read in the Press that South Africa is getting a system of air raid warning sirens and that these will be introduced in the different centres. This was reported in our Press in October last year. In the absence of assessments one looks at what the department is doing and one tries to get at what its views are about certain matters. One would therefore conclude that the department is expecting to need these systems probably for the real thing. If furthermore one has seen those civil defence films which we were recently privileged to see, one has that impression strengthened. Those films showed scenes of considerable devastation following bombing and so forth. One is therefore further led to believe that this is very much in the minds of the defence authorities. That impression is again strengthened by the fact that it is common knowledge that we have certain radar screen defences. So on the strength of these factors one is inclined to conclude that we are preparing for air attacks on our cities. This could obviously be something that is in the minds of our defence authorities. But unless one knows the assessment they have made, one might be inclined if one finds imperfections in any of these matters, for instance any imperfections there may be in our radar defences, to be critical of our authorities on that basis whereas if a different assessment is made of the position one would be less critical. Again we know that while this air raid warning system is to be obtained, there is no suggestion of any air raid shelters at this stage.</p>

<p>When one adds that piece of evidence to the others, one can either take up the attitude that it is inefficiency not to have air raid shelters when apparently you are preparing for air raid attacks, or, if one knows that the assessment is that other threats are so much greater, one would not make that criticism. So in regard to the films one may see those civil defence films in the light that they are designed to shock people into waking up and doing something about the position while not being intended to show pictorially what really is an imminent threat to them. I therefore hope that this illustration will serve to make the point that if a way can be found by which Members of Parliament and perhaps other people who are concerned with these matters, can be given that defence assessment and be told as much as possible of the policy, such ill-informed criticisms will be obviated.</p>

<p>We are all aware&#x2014;and this is all part of the position&#x2014;that there is a growing threat to South Africa, and that this will continue to grow in the future. One has first of all only to listen to the utterances of certain people in regard to the states of Southern Africa, but above all one has only to see the developing guerilla war and terrorist infiltration in the states of Southern Africa to appreciate the position. Here again one is starved of information as to how that fight is going and one can easily get a wrong picture as a result. I am thinking for example of Angola. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>During the Budget debate the hon. member for Durban (Point) acted very sanctimoniously in regard to the question of politics in the Defence Force. On that occasion the hon. member criticized the fact that the hon. the Minister had addressed a political meeting at Voortrekkerhoogte, and to-day the hon. member again acted sanctimoniously about the appointment of two officers. The hon. member should not think that we on this side of the House hold that against him or against any of his colleagues who may want to follow him in that regard. But then we may expect of them that they will not, on the one hand, criticize others for allegedly introducing politics into the Defence Force, and, on the other hand, kick up a fuss as they did here this afternoon. As regards this side of the House, and if this does not apply to the opposite side of this House, that is their own affair, we have the fullest confidence in all the officers who have lately been appointed to the supreme command of our Defence Force, and we give the supreme command the assurance that they have the support of this side of the House as regards the major problems with which they are faced in the defence of our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member also dragged the question of bilingualism into this debate. I do not know for what reason he did so. If he wants to make a political affair of bilingualism, he should remember that when the United Party was in power, Afrikaans did not occupy the position which English occupies to-day under the National Party. The hon. member for Pinelands has just sat down. We have become accustomed to the fact that he usually makes responsible and well-considered speeches in this House. I just want to tell him that I do not think that we should be too sensitive about the fact that English and Afrikaans may perhaps not be used to an equal degree as a medium of instruction. Our Prime Minister and our other responsible leaders have given the assurance time and again that English and Afrikaans occupy an equal position in this country, and we stand by that. But if Afrikaans is being used more than English as a medium of instruction in the Defence Force, we should not be too sensitive about that, because we should have regard to the fact that the ratio between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking persons in the Defence Force already is approximately 60:40 at present. Therefore this does not mean the promotion of one language at the expense of the other. I think we have really passed the stage of having to insist on English and Afrikaans being used to an equal extent for every instruction issued in the Defence Force. We should have regard to the fact that there has been a change in the numerical <span class="col_6025-6026" refersTo="page_0217"/>ratio between Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking persons. That is all I want to say in passing.</p>

<p>There is another matter which is a cause of concern to me, and that is the skill of our people in the art of shooting. To-day we have to prepare ourselves more for unconventional warfare, for a guerrilla-type of warfare, and we have to concentrate more on the development of the individuality of each person than we do when he acts in the masses of conventional forces. From the nature of the case the citizen of to-day therefore has to be more skilled in the handling of arms as he will have to act more individually than he does in groups and will have to handle a weapon by himself instead of handling it as a member of a group as he does in the case of handling a canon. In what position do we find ourselves to-day? We shall have to act in very difficult terrain and against an enemy who is mobile, cunning, very well trained, and skilled in the handling of automatic arms. What do we have to counterbalance that? This brings me to something about which I am concerned. At present we bring approximately 30,000 young men for training to our camps annually. In that period they are given proper training in the handling of the fire-arm which they will have to use. For ten years subsequent to their training they are subject to compulsory military service, and during this period they are called back for further training on not more than three occasions. On the present basis they devote only one day of the three weeks for which they again have to attend camps, to shooting practice. In other words, over a period of nine years our young men receive training in the handling of the fire-arm which they will be expected to handle, on three occasions only. In addition there are no facilities for a member of the Citizen Force, for example, who is compelled to undergo training in fire-arms. The position of the members of commandos is somewhat different. If I am not mistaken, these people are obliged at present to attend approximately four compulsory practices per annum. But then they have a limited number of cartridges, i.e. 20 or so, which are made available at every practice, except at other shooting practices, such as disappearing targets, etc., which fall under the commandos. Each year every member is issued with a limited number of cartridges only. In addition we are also experiencing the problem that certain of the commando units have to make do with outmoded arms. With all due respect, I think that we should simply accept that the .303 rifle to-day no longer is the most desirable fire-arm for a rural commando to take action against other well-trained people with automatic fire-arms, especially when they have to do so in broken and woody terrain. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister to-day whether he will not give consideration to certain changes in the situation. Firstly, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not agree that the time has arrived for a sharp-shooters&#x2019; corps, consisting of the most outstanding and best marksmen, to be established from the large numbers of marksmen in South Africa, those trained by the Defence Force, those serving in the Citizen Force and the commandos, and even those who subsequently belong to private shooting clubs. I just want to mention in passing that with the exception of bowls-players, there is not a larger number of people in South Africa who participate in any organized sport than in target-shooting. A sharp-shooter, in my opinion, is not a person who can be taught to handle a fire-arm with that high degree of skill. He must have certain inborn qualities. If he does not have good eyesight, very fast reflexes and a sound co-ordination between eye, hand and brain, he cannot be a good sharp-shooter. I want to ask that these people be selected and formed into a very strong sharp-shooters&#x2019; corps, and that they be equipped with available sharp-shooting fire-arms and everything which goes with that. Then these people have to receive special training in the handling of those arms and under the circumstances in which it is necessary for them to handle those arms.</p>

<p>But I also want to ask the Minister to give consideration to a complete change in the attitude we adopt to the commandos in South Africa, as well as to the ordinary marksmen in all branches of the Defence Force, and those outside the Defence Force, who participate in .303 shooting practices in particular. It is well that we have regard to the fact that the members of the Defence Force who practise this art, do not practise it purely as a sport. They are also engaged in improving their skills as an able-bodied man of this country. I also think that it is our duty to enable these people, who sacrifice a great deal of time and money, to improve their skills in this respect and to provide them with all the necessary facilities while they are still doing their service. Therefore I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give consideration to the issue of cartridges free of charge to all members of the Defence Force, consisting of the Citizen Force and commandos, including the Permanent Force, in which this is already being done, for all shooting practices, for compulsory shooting practices, for Bisleys, for provincial Bisleys and for the South African Bisley at Bloemfontein. Here I should like to address a word of thanks to the Defence Force, the Minister and the Commander-in-Chief, as well as to the Chief of the Army, who provided the cartridges which members of the Citizen Force and the commandos required at the last national Bisley at Bloemfontein free of charge. Then I also want to ask that all members of the Citizen Force be enabled to participate in shooting practices in their home towns, in the vicinity where they live, at the ranges which are available at these places. Over a period of ten years these people return to camps on three occasions to receive training in the art of shooting for one day, and they can participate in shooting practices<span class="col_6027-6028" refersTo="page_0218"/>in their home towns if they have the opportunity to do so, but at present the facilities to do so do not exist because certain rules and regulations oblige those people to do so only at this club or at that quarters of the Defence Force. I want to ask that these facilities be made available more freely so that a member of the Citizen Force may participate in these practices along with the members of the commandos.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members will understand that if I do not reply at this juncture to some of the points raised, my reply will be so long that hon. members will not have the opportunity of raising further points. I want to begin by telling the hon. member for Potchefstroom that I agree with him that we should enable people to participate in shooting practices to the greatest extent possible. What is more, he is aware that this is in fact our approach today. I also want to tell him that there will be a free distribution of ammunition to members of the Citizen Force and commandos who are also members of provincial shooting associations for participation in provincial and national Bisleys. Free accommodation will be made available to such members in Defence Force gymnasiums and tents.</p>

<p>I shall perhaps refer to the other points raised by the hon. member later on. I shall begin by referring to what was said here on Friday by the hon. member for Durban (Point). I want to congratulate the hon. member on the high level which he maintained on Friday. It is a pity he did not remain on that level. The hon. member stated that the Opposition had warned against the danger of having all one&#x2019;s eggs in one basket. I agree wholeheartedly that it is a dangerous policy. That policy was followed for many years and South Africa had to undergo a rude awakening when it discovered, when boycotts were being applied against it, by Britain for example, that no more eggs were being put into that basket. This Government then began to take steps to purchase its military supplies from other sources as well. I think that in recent years, in the time of my predecessor as well as in my time, we have succeeded in strengthening the position of the Defence Force to a tremendous extent as a result of the fact that we are not putting all our eggs into that one basket which we found so disappointing. The hon. member will recall that this Government, even in the time of my predecessor, took steps to establish a munitions board which did very good work and which constituted the first step along the road to independence in this field as regards the provision of munitions. In that respect therefore the Government did its duty. We have just piloted legislation through this House for the establishment of an undertaking such as the Armaments Corporation and for the re-organization of the Munitions Board, precisely with a view to our not having to be dependent to the same extent upon that one basket upon which we were dependent for such a long time. I am therefore in full agreement with the statement which the hon. member made here on Friday. In addition the hon. member asked: &#x201C;Will the Minister inform us how he sees the implications that will flow from a policy to defend the sea routes alone&#x2014;to go it alone, as the Prime Minister said? What type of equipment will we need under such circumstances?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, nobody ever asserted &#x201C;that we want to go it alone&#x201D;. The hon. member knows that. He knows that nobody on this side, or anybody else for that matter, has ever adopted the attitude that we want to go it alone. The hon. the Prime Minister was referring to a situation which might arise, and the hon. member will agree with me that if other people do not want to agree and co-operate with us, we cannot simply capitulate. In the first place I want to refer him in this regard to my statement of 20th February in this House, when I tried to explain to the House and the country the strategic importance of the sea route around the Cape. It is not only since 20th February that we have been emphasizing this. We have, on military and on a diplomatic level, and in every possible way, tried by means of public statements to convince certain leading Western countries of the fact that they are following a disastrous policy in regard to South Africa. More than that one could not do. We did not drag in the Simonstown Agreement; we did not terminate it. We did not neglect to meet our obligations in regard to the Simonstown Treaty. In fact, I indicated in this House that South Africa was spending millions in order to meet its obligations. We complied with the agreement in the letter and the spirit. But in the second place I want to say that the entire question of the sea route around the Cape is a double-edged sword. A double-edged sword in this sense that we must expect that in any East-West conflict&#x2014;and one must also include here an East-West conflict even though it is not at the moment a direct conflict of military force&#x2014;the control of the sea-route around the Cape and around southern Africa will be a top priority military and strategic target, and that will not only apply to those who have controlled it up to now, it will also apply to those who have not controlled it up to now.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked: &#x201C;Do we want to go it alone?&#x201D;, and he asked how I interpreted that question. The prime responsibility of the Government is to take into consideration the security and the protection of the Republic, and if certain interested Western nations do not want to lend a hand in the protection of the Cape sea route, then the Republic will have to go it alone, firstly, for the sake of its own national interests and secondly, for the sake of what we believe to be the interests of the free world, because we have interests in common with the free world. Firstly, we have to do this to protect our own interests and secondly, on account of the role we want to <span class="col_6029-6030" refersTo="page_0219"/>play in the free world. This afternoon I should just like to refer emphatically but briefly to the value of the Republic and Southern Africa and the sea route around the Cape. I want to call this briefly to mind again because I think that in the world in which we are living to-day this cannot be emphasized enough. Firstly, we have the only developed naval base in Southern Africa, and here I want to emphasize that the Government has taken active steps to effect considerable improvements in the naval base at Simonstown, after it had been taken over from the United Kingdom. It is also appropriate to mention here that the Simonstown naval base is still, as a result of the Simonstown Agreement, providing facilities to visiting British warships.</p>

<p>It is also ironic to note that the closing of the Suez Canal, which was used as a political football, had the result that more British and other warships have been obliged to use the Simonstown naval base during the past year than during the more than 20 years since World War II. But secondly the Republic has other large, modern harbours where war-time cargoes can be loaded and where merchant vessels can enjoy protection and shelter, and be refuelled and repaired. The contribution of the Republic on an industrial and commercial level need not even be emphasized, but what must in fact be emphasized is the fact that if we afford protection to Western merchant vessels, we will be dragged into the conflict, whether we want to or not. Nevertheless we are, according to the spirit of the Simonstown Agreement, continuing with our plans for harbour defence in order to make it possible for us to afford protection to the fugitive ships of the Western nations in particular. But thirdly the Republic has modern airfields&#x2014;and I referred to that when I made a statement on Simonstown here&#x2014;from which the sea routes can be patrolled, and from which air raids against approaching forces can be launched. The hon. member asked me whether we envisaged purchasing aircraft carriers. My reply is &#x201C;No&#x201D;: owing to our strategic value South Africa is in itself an aircraft carrier from which that protection can be afforded.</p>

<p>Fourthly, we have the necessary command and communication systems which is indispensable to the control of operations of merchant shipping in the southern oceans. To this must also be added that we are already engaged in modernizing our maritime communication systems, at considerable expense. In the last instance, the Republic has the only real maritime defence forces in Southern Africa, which, coupled with the Republic&#x2019;s territorial and air defence forces, comprise a vitally important bastion for the defence of the free world in the Southern Hemisphere. Sir, when we talk about the defence of the sea routes, we must have a clear idea of what such a defence role embraces, and I should also like to refer to that briefly. I think that there is a great deal of misunderstanding in this regard. It does not mean an aimless patrolling of endless stretches of sea, but the active protection of terminal points, i.e. the harbours, the passive protection of convoys, namely by rerouting them, and of ships at sea by means of the application of security measures, and the active protection of convoys and ships at sea when a real threat to such convoys and ships arises.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) asked, on the basis of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement on the defence of our sea routes, whether the Government envisaged a considerable expansion of the maritime forces of the Republic. The purchase of aircraft carriers and other naval warships is not being envisaged, as I have already told the hon. member. In fact, for the purposes of our defence it is not necessary to acquire that type of ship. What is in fact being envisaged is to develop the maritime defence forces of the Republic into a more balanced defence force&#x2014;we are engaged in doing so&#x2014;in order by so doing to enable us to protect our national interests as well as to make a real contribution to Western defence requirements. The hon. member is aware of certain steps which have already been taken in this regard, and I do not want to refer to them unnecessarily now, but I am giving the assurance that the composition of the Defence Force is constantly being taken into consideration&#x2014;and this is also my reply to the hon. member for Pinelands&#x2014;in order to ensure that we will be able to acquit ourselves thoroughly of our maritime defence tasks.</p>

<p>In addition the Government is also aware of the vacuum which has arisen as a result of the British withdrawal east of Suez. If this situation is taken into account, along with the importance of the southern sea routes and the apparent pre-occupation of certain Western nations with their own political objectives, with which they are saddled, we must ask ourselves whether the time has not come to encourage greater co-operation among friendly nations in the southern ocean area. Our current maritime defence obligations towards foreign shipping are set out in the Simonstown Agreement and include the control of a South African maritime region which comprises part of a larger, British-controlled strategic zone. According to this treaty the South African maritime defence forces would have played a specific, though restricted, role in the joint defence of the Cape sea routes. We are now prepared to play a greater role in this connection. Recently this policy was discussed again at an international conference at service level, and it was decided to make very important recommendations to the various Governments in this regard. It will be interesting to learn whether the Governments in question will be prepared to accept the sensible recommendations which were made at this conference. I do not want to say more about this matter to-day.</p>

<p><span class="col_6031-6032" refersTo="page_0220"/>I now want to return to this single idea. South Africa is seeking the co-operation of others for the sake of world peace, and we are preparing ourselves for the protection of these sea routes for our own sake. But if others want to throw us to the wolves, they must themselves accept responsibility for the disaster which they will also be bringing upon themselves.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member referred to his speech on Friday to the Bantu homelands and the implications for defence connected with them. Now I want to tell the hon. member that there have, after all, always been homelands for the black people in South Africa, and since the matter became such an important point of discussion, surely nothing has changed in the defence situation which existed in respect of them. After all, defence has always been in the hands of this Parliament.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that self-government is being granted, has not affected the defence aspect in any way, and the hon. member knows that because, after all, he is a Member of this Parliament.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>But it can.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why drag this matter in here? The hon. member wants to achieve only one thing by doing that, and that is to burden our defence policies with questions in regard to which we have up to now been agreed that all sections of the white population must present a united front. Why drag it in here? There has been no change in the factual situation.</p>

<p>But in the third place the hon. member ought to know that in the combating of terrorism and the waging of guerrilla warfare, and in the combating of revolutionary warfare, one of the principle requirements to-day is that you must have the goodwill of the Native population of a specific area. And the hon. member knows that this Government is going out of its way to win the goodwill of the Native population groups in those homelands, and that it has to a large measure succeeded in doing so, so that they are to-day helping to resist the terrorists. But in the last instance I want to put a question to the member. Is the hon. member looking for other relations than those of goodwill between Lesotho and ourselves, and between Botswana and ourselves? After all, we have two independent States in our midst. What else could the hon. member be seeking but the good relations with them which the Government is trying to achieve?</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also referred to the question of the surrender of large amounts at the end of the financial year, but this is a matter in regard to which I have already furnished this Parliament with adequate information. In fact, it was one of the motives which I suggested here as to why I introduced certain legislation last year, when I said that each year we found ourselves in the position of having to surrender large amounts and that we now wanted to establish an Armaments Board and an Armaments Development Corporation so that we could deal with these situations. Why is this happening? It is happening simply because one is dependent for the implementation of one&#x2019;s contracts upon other people, often in overseas countries. That is why one does not know, when one begins to draw up estimates, when one will have to pay for that particular equipment. There are many influences affecting the delivery of equipment, and the very reason we passed this legislation here a few weeks ago was to overcome that difficulty. I have explained this at length, and when I did so the hon. member agreed with me.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to pick handles.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>As an example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I also want to refer to these pick handles as an example. Those pick handles which the hon. member used as an example, are exceptional pick handles. They are pick handles which are used in conjunction with a pick we use with the Panhard armoured car. The hon. member then went further and stated: &#x201C;Millions of rands of equipment lies outside in the rain.&#x201D; Well, it has lain outside all through the drought as well, and not only in the rain. But now I want to tell the hon. member that there was a time when South Africa had to purchase military equipment on a large scale when it was able to acquire it. I maintain that it is better to have military equipment available with no roof over it, than it is to have the roof without the equipment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But it would be even better to have the equipment as well as the roof.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member on that, and if he looks at the Estimates, he will see that during the past three financial years an amount of R5.7 million has been voted for accommodation for vehicles and supplies alone, and that on this year&#x2019;s Estimates, if the hon. member were to look at the Loan Estimates, he would see that there <span class="col_6033-6034" refersTo="page_0221"/>is more than R2.5 million for that purpose. And let me also tell the hon. member that we have negotiated an agreement, which has been approved by the Cabinet, whereby we are now establishing a special Fortification and Building Works Section, which will now exercise control over the Engineering Section and the construction works of the various other sections, which in the different sections of the Defence Force were separate from one another. It has now been consolidated under this section and we have reached an agreement whereby we shall accomplish what we are able to accomplish ourselves. If the hon. member were to look at the Estimates he would see, under several of the subheads, that a footnote has been appended: &#x201C;Will be accounted for by the Commandant-General.&#x201D; That means that it is work which we are doing ourselves. So, we are also engaged in this task. But I do want to say this to the hon. member. I also visited military units and airfields in Europe, and there I also saw many military vehicles and other equipment standing outside. This happens everywhere. We shall simply have to accept the fact that in South Africa we do not have a building industry which can supply all our needs. But as long as we have the will, it helps. I myself am dissatisfied about the lack of certain accommodation for equipment. All that we can say is that we are doing our best and: &#x201C;Do not shoot the man at the piano; he is doing his best.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>As long as he does not play false notes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. member came to the House of Assembly to-day in a different mood. I do not want to dwell on that mood for long, because there are other hon. members I should also like to reply to. In regard to the Selection Boards, I can say that 120 Selection Boards have already been appointed by me with a view to the current year. This was not possible last year, and I explained the reason for that here. This year we have already appointed 120 boards. They will also co-operate very closely with school principals. They consist of Citizen Force and commando officers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Consisting only of officers, no civilians?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, because one would not find more suitable civilians to serve on these Selection Boards than the people serving in the Citizen Force and the commandos. They are the people who must do this work. I think that is obvious.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member referred to the number of people who had been called up, and he asked why we were now following the policy of holding certain people who had already undergone their long-term training, and were still liable to two uninterrupted periods, responsible for the remaining ten years as well. All the hon. member must do is look at section 21 of the Act, for which he himself voted, and which he himself helped draft in the Select Committee. Then the hon. member must not pick a quarrel with me, but with himself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>I am talking about the spirit of the discussions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member laid down the letter of the law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<p>But there are many things in the law which are not being carried out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am strictly carrying out the law which the hon. member helped make. In addition the hon. member referred to the question of bilingualism. Really, this old horse is no longer in the running. Consequently I take it amiss of the hon. member for singling out the Army. What was his purpose in doing so?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Because that is where the complaints were coming from.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me tell the hon. member that I shall bring him more complaints which are just the reverse, in regard to the two other arms of the Defence Force. But I am not flogging this dead horse in public. I know with what problems the arms of the Defence Force are faced, and I accept that goodwill exists inside the Defence Force, and I am satisfied that everything possible is being done by the Defence Force to promote bilingualism. But I do not think it is right to single out one branch of the Defence Force here, and to create the impression, without proof, that bilingualism is not the policy there.</p>

<p>This brings me to an action on the part of the hon. member which I strongly resent, and that is that he referred to two officers, out of more than two appointments. I want to tell the hon. member that since I became Minister, I have adhered to the policy that the Defence Force represents both language groups in South Africa. In the second place I have adhered to the policy of appointments according to merit, which is sometimes difficult because there is often more than one good candidate. But when a particular officer is a suitable choice for one purpose, he may perhaps not be a suitable choice for another, and consequently he sometimes has to wait for promotion. Besides, there is more than one direction in which an officer can receive promotion. If one is looking for a person with qualities of leadership and drive, and the one man has these while the other one is perhaps a better planner, one uses one&#x2019;s sound judgment when one has to appoint one of the two to a specific post. But even then we still make an appointment which we can justify on merit. <span class="col_6035-6036" refersTo="page_0222"/>This is in fact what happened in these cases as well. I want to point out to the hon. member that the appointments made last year were favourably received by the whole of South Africa, including the Press. It was said of these appointments that we had allowed the emphasis to fall on efficiency and youth. This was said by all the newspapers in South Africa, and I appreciate this on the part of the Press. But now the hon. member for Durban (Point), one year later, has stated that the morale in the Defence Force has been prejudiced by these appointments. Surely that is not true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is true.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not true. After all, I keep in touch with my people in the Defence Force, to a greater extent than the hon. member does.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Would they discuss such a matter with you?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. If people in the Permanent Force, the Citizen Force, and the Commandos are not prepared to discuss things with their Minister, they will not be prepared to defend their country either.</p>

<p>In other words, I must deduce from what the hon. member for Durban (Point) is now saying that all the members of the Permanent Force, the Citizen Force and the Commandos are a lot of toadies; they are supposedly a lot of toadies who, if they are dissatisfied with a matter, are not prepared to discuss it with their Minister. But let me tell the hon. member this: The reflection he made here is also a reflection on the most senior officers in the Defence Force, because what the hon. member does not know, and I want to tell him this now, is that I consulted the most senior officers of the Defence Force before making each one of these appointments. Before recommending these appointments to the Cabinet I consulted all the most senior officers of the Defence Force, who had anything to do with this matter, in my office.</p>

<p>Not one of them protested against the proposed appointments. The advantages and disadvantages of each candidate were weighed up and discussed, and everybody was satisfied with the decisions I ultimately took. I challenge the hon. member to prove the reverse; I challenge him the brave hero from King William&#x2019;s Town. As regards the hon. member for Durban (Point), I want to tell him that I do not take it amiss of him if he wants to express criticism here. In fact, he is welcome to do so.

<p>&#x2026; a letter in which the writer states that lectures were supposedly being given to the young men. The hon. member brought that letter to this House, to come and read it out here, without having previously discussed the contents thereof either with me, or with the Commandant General, or with the commander concerned in order to make sure whether the facts contained in that letter were correct.

<p><span class="col_6037-6038" refersTo="page_0223"/>The hon. member for Stellenbosch referred to the commando organization. Arising from what the hon. members for Stellenbosch, Middelburg and Potchefstroom said here, I should just like to say the following. We are living in a period in which we can prepare ourselves not only for conventional warfare but also for unconventional methods of warfare. It is essential that our Defence Force with its Permanent Force, its Citizen Force and Commandos should play the role of an instrument by means of which a national army can in fact be established, and since national compulsory military service was introduced, this has become more and more of a possibility. A well-known writer who is serving in the Citizen Force recently referred in a very interesting article to the question of &#x201C;Total Defence&#x201D;. Although we do not perhaps agree with everything which is stated in that little book, there is a great deal in the statements which he makes which is worthwhile thinking about. Now, in the first place, I want to say that we do not want to make a second citizen force of our commandos. The commandos have their own task. They have a potential which has to be utilized. During the discussion of my policy motion in the Other Place I stated that the present A, B and C type commandos would fall away, and would make place for country, urban and industrial commandos. We attach value to the role of the commandos as part of our Defence Force, and proof of this is the fact that we have established our own Commando Military College at Kimberley, where outstanding training work has been done since the beginning of this year. The commando organization will gradually be cast into this new mould. These changes cannot take place overnight; they will have to take place gradually. It will be characterized by its flexibility. The strength will vary from one commando to another. Basically the headquarters of each commando will remain the same, but sub-units may fluctuate from five platoons per commando to five companies of four platoons each. The situation and the needs of an area will influence the commandos. Within the commando provision will be made for offensive and defensive elements. An offensive element will consist of the younger and fitter members, mostly those who are liable to compulsory military service and who, after their basic training at the commando military college will receive intensive training in a commando context. The older and more established members will be utilized for the protection of vulnerable and important points, as far as the protection of home and hearth, in conjunction with organizations for civil defence. The fitter group will form a specialist company or platoon, i.e. of scouts who will concentrate specifically on getting to know their areas both by day and by night so that they will be able to act as guides. Then there will be sharp shooters who will gradually be issued with sniper&#x2019;s rifles and telescopic sights. There will also be dog handlers, and the right breed of dogs will be kept and trained. There will also be a military engineer&#x2019;s section. These men will be trained in the disarming and use of unconventional weapons. There will also be a cavalry element. It is the intention to help provide certain commandos with horses to form a cavalry element. We have already held exercises in this regard, and the horse as an alternative means of transport in difficult and impassable terrain is essential. It is my personal desire that a mounted unit should in due course be established at the Academy so that every officer who is receiving his training there will learn how to ride a horse. As far as urban commandos are concerned, the idea is, and we are working on this possibility, to form units which will have mechanized means of transport, such as motor cycles. Our objective, in the last instance, is to provide even the most distant commandos with radio communications. The few hundred commandos in our country will in future be grouped into 27 commando groups with a Chief Commandant in charge. The Chief Commandant will be selected from the ranks from the present commanders of commandos according to ability and station, and will form a link between the commandos and the present Command Headquarters of the Defence Force. The intention is to convene a meeting of commando officers later this year to discuss this new dispensation for the commandos with them in detail. I take it that this new dispensation will not only infuse new life into the commandos, but will result in the kind of thing I have an example of here, which I should like to quote to the hon. member for Durban (Point) as proof of the high standard of morale which exists in the commandos as well. I am talking about a certain commando in Natal, the province from which the hon. member comes, where, according to hon. members opposite, the morale has supposedly declined as a result of the appointment made by this Minister. I met this commander recently and we had a long conversation. Recently this commando proceeded to build their own headquarters. This is a report I received&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With a great deal of enthusiasm the unit as a whole set about the task of developing his area. Funds were raised in various ways, including the sale of scrap metal, bags, old newspapers, bottles and bones. The proceeds from the unit&#x2019;s annual dance and various other fund-raising efforts&#x2026;</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member will listen now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; were used and donations in cash and kind were received from members themselves. In October, 1967, under the guidance and leadership of the Commandant, members of the commando laid the foundation of their new headquarters. This building will be completed and in use by 31st May, 1968. This headquarters building has been constructed entirely by members of the unit with no outside assistance. All building operations were carried out over week-ends and public holidays.</block>

<p><span class="col_6039-6040" refersTo="page_0224"/>That is the spirit which is prevailing in the Defence Force. That is the spirit which is prevailing amongst English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking units. At the Commando Military College the numbers of the Permanent Force, about the morale of whom the hon. member had such a lot to say, come together on Saturday afternoons and they paint and repair buildings themselves in order to get them ready as quickly as possible so that they can do their work. That is the spirit which is prevailing in the Defence Force.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North Rand referred to the question of the strength of the Permanent Force and the vacancies. There are a few ways in which one can solve this problem, if the necessary manpower is available. In South Africa we have a shortage of manpower. The hon. member knows that. This is nothing new, but personally I believe that if we can solve the housing problem for the Permanent Force, we are, to a large extent, going to succeed in bringing the Defence Force up to full strength and filling the vacancies. I think the hon. member will agree with me. If the hon. member were to look at the Estimates of last year, he would see to what extent we are trying, under the Department of Community Development, to provide the necessary housing. There are other fringe benefits which one can make available to the Permanent Force, but this is a matter which other people apart from myself are concerned about. We will of course solve certain of our problems by the utilization of those who are liable to military service, as the hon. member knows was explained last year to this House. I think that, once the first intakes of persons liable to military service have been disposed of and these young men are being trained, we will be in a position to solve a great many of our problems. The indications are there. We must see how this is going to work out.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the question of the oil storage depots. Of course the oil storage depots could all be built underground, but then only one-third would have been completed by this time. I think the hon. member will agree with me that it is better to have all the oil storage depots there, than to have one-third, or perhaps a quarter, under the ground. How does that old rhyme go about our studs which sometimes roll under the bed? &#x201C;A stud in the hand is worth two under the bed&#x201D;, not so? I think the oil storage depots, as they exist at present, are quite probably better than having no depots.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but there are other problems connected with that as well, which I do not want to go into too deeply now.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the question of military ranks. Recently I have given some attention to this matter, and I can now inform the hon. member that the Government has decided to re-introduce the ranks of Second Lieutenant, Lieutenant and Major-General in the rank structure of the Defence Force, instead of the present ranks of Assistant Field Cornet and Field Cornet in the South African Army, and Combat-General in the Army and Air Force and to introduce a new rank, namely Chief Commandant, between the ranks of Commandant and Colonel, as I said a moment ago. The use of the latter rank will be restricted to the commando organization. Owing to the historical value which the designation Field Cornet and Combat-General has for the Defence Force, it has been decided to retain them in our present military set-up, the designation Field Cornet as official title for the adjutants of commandos, and Combat-General as the official title for commandos of divisions, or similar combat formations, for example Combat-General, South African Division. I think that with this a further step has been taken to create a greater measure of satisfaction in the Defence Force. I think the hon. member would agree with me. But I think the hon. member is going too far if he wants to touch upon the question of Commandants as well. Let us preferably leave these alone. There are good reasons why this should be the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member and the hon. member for Hercules referred to civil defence. Hon. members emphasized that we should stimulate a new approach amongst the public in respect of the principle of civil defence. In this regard let me say that a publication by a well-known military authority recently appeared, in which he described the importance of civil defence as being closely bound up with the offensive forces. That person stated that there were three elements involved in a country’s resistance to the onslaughts of an enemy. The first is its offensive ability, its ability as a result of what it develops in the form of striking power, its military fist. In the second place it is the ability of the country to afford that military fist in the field of economics. But in the third place it is the will of the nation to display resistance by means of its civil defence, to such an extent that the potential enemy will flinch from coming to grips with that resistance which will have been called up, that ability in regard to civil defence to oppose the onslaughts by being able to act in an organized, calm and powerful way in times of emergency. The most important hope we are placing on the Civil Defence Section, which has now been joined to the Defence Force, is to establish it efficiently within a Defence Force context. I have no doubt that under the energetic leadership of the Head of the Civil Defence Section, i.e. General Retief, we will succeed in stimulating the interest of the public to a greater extent in the principles of civil defence.</p>

<p>Hon. members know that personally I am in favour of the training of young women, in this regard as well. I have said that that training should include self-defence, the ability to <span class="col_6041-6042" refersTo="page_0225"/>handle a weapon, the performance of essential services, first-aid and the replacement work they will have to do when an emergency arises and the men are called away. The reaction to that announcement was so overwhelming that the provisional planning we had for training the young women was hopelessly inadequate. We shall have to return to the Government with new proposals because too many young women want to receive training. The result is that this matter will be delayed, but I think that it is better for us to delay it and begin correctly, than to begin incorrectly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands referred to the question of sirens. This is not a decision which I took; it was taken when civil defence was being managed by the then Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister. It is a gradual programme which will be introduced in the main urban areas, and possibly in target areas later on. Sirens will not all be installed simultaneously. This must take place over a three to four-year period, so that we do not spend too much on it annually. But sirens are not only intended to be used in regard to air-raid shelters. Sirens have other purposes as well. They are to serve as a signal to the Civil Defence Services that they should perform their given tasks. Now I want to say at once that I do not think that the introduction of a programme of large-scale construction of air-raid shelters in South Africa is a practical one. In the second place, I do not think that we can provide ourselves with airraid shelters against nuclear attack—at least not at this stage, and not in the distant future either. There are existing buildings which have cellars. Gradually new buildings with cellars are also being built, which, under the careful guidance of and through co-operation with the Civil Defence Section, could perhaps be equipped in such a way that it would meet the needs to a large extent. That is the primary task as far as air-raid shelters are concerned, but it does not mean that the installation of sirens goes hand in hand with large-scale capital expenditure in regard to the construction of air-raid shelters which are to serve in the case of a nuclear war as well. It simply means that South Africa is also beginning to prepare itself in that field. But sirens are not only intended for war conditions; they are also intended to help in other emergencies. It is a handy thing to have sirens. We are going to carry out the first experiments in Pretoria. As we learn from these, they will also be installed elsewhere. I think the hon. member would agree that this is the correct approach. I just want to add that we should face the fact that South Africa has, in a conventional conflict, where we will be on the side of the free world, been brought within bombing range. We must recognize the fact that as a result of developments, we have been brought within bombing range. That is why it would be foolish not to make the necessary preparations in this field as well. I think that I have now replied to most of the matters which were raised.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What about the payment of persons liable to compulsory military service?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that in a moment. The hon. member for Middelburg referred to the question of an independent service commission. As the hon. member knows, the Groenewoud committee has already recommended that there should be an independent service commission. There are certain difficulties attached to appointing an independent service commission. I have told this House that I am in favour of the services acquiring a representative on the Public Service Commission so as to enable the services to put their case there in respect of the evaluation of posts and the creation of posts. As a first step, I think this is already a step forward. That is what I am concentrating on in the meantime. I shall recommend strongly to the Government that the services get a representative on the Public Service Commission. Whether the Government will accept this, is another matter. I just want to add that I think the solution lies more in a certain frame of mind in this country. I am not saying this because I am Minister of Defence. My time will pass, in the same way as that of any other person, but the Defence Force of South Africa will always have to be there. That is why I say this in the spirit evinced by the hon. member for Waterkloof recently when he spoke and used the following words: &#x201C;Defence is the duty of each one of us&#x201D;. I want to state this afternoon that for historic and other reasons the Defence Force and the security forces of South Africa have not up to now occupied the place which similar forces in other countries occupy. The position is gradually improving, and sometimes even rapidly in some cases, but the Defence Force is not simply a Government Department. This is the concept which has to be conveyed to the nation and to all our other Government Departments. Because it is a small Defence Force, the Defence Force is not simply a privileged group of people which wants these things on the basis of their super-human qualities; the Defence Force, as an institution, belongs to the entire country.</p>

<p>The security forces of our country are the final human guarantee of the survival of our State. But they are also far more; it is a force, the very existence of which wards off threats. The stronger and the more efficient the Defence Force, the greater the ability of a nation to maintain its way of life. The same applies here to the appeal which is being made to employers. According to the present Act consent must be granted to exempt their employees from undergoing this compulsory training. Therefore they need not undergo their compulsory training during their own vacations. It is prescribed that time should be made available to enable these people to undergo their compulsory training. But I think that the entire State as an employer, and all<span class="col_6043-6044" refersTo="page_0226"/> private employers, can display a spirit of greater goodwill towards these men who must be prepared to ensure our way of life. Whether we succeed in bringing home this attitude that the Defence Force is something more than an ordinary Government Department will depend upon this Parliament. It is the guarantee of our way of life, and the guarantee that in the final analysis the State will survive. That is why I hope that we will inculcate this attitude, which is already developing, throughout the country, i.e. that although people in the past made attempts to prevent their sons from receiving training, they will now be more willing to allow their sons to undergo this training. People whose sons could not undergo training owing to medical unfitness are now coming forward and insisting that we devise some plan which would ensure that those young men received training.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to talk about remuneration. The hon. member for Durban (Point) can himself see how much is being spent on operational buildings and on accommodation for our vehicles. The hon. member can himself see what amount is indicated under the Loan Vote for the Department of Community Development in respect of housing. The hon. member has the Estimates in front of him, and he can himself see what we have to pay to obtain armaments. Under the present circumstances, does the hon. member see any chance, in view of the economic difficulties with which South Africa has to struggle in this world, of my going to the Government and asking for R3 or R4 million extra for the purpose of remuneration?</p>

<p>I told the member that we would move in this direction step by step. The first step we took was to increase the allowances for dependants this year. I think that is a major step forward. By that means we have been able to accommodate those very people who are suffering the most hardship. I did not say last year that I would approach the Government; I said that I would choose the time when, in my opinion, it would be in the interests of the Defence Force to approach the Government. But I approach the Government all the time: I get R250 million from the Government. After all, other Government Departments also have demands. If we come here with increased Estimates, then hon. members of the Opposition are the first people to say: &#x201C;Look how the Estimates figure has increased this year!&#x201D; But then the hon. member attacks me because I have not effected all the necessary improvements in one year. My reply to him is that I am sympathetic towards these people, but that I shall choose the time when I think it is possible&#x2026;</p>

<p>Subsequently I had it worked out, and I decided that I could not, at that stage, approach the Government.</p>

<p>Just one other announcement. I thought that there was something more important which should now be done, and consequently the Defence Force has held discussions with the South African Railways. As a result of those discussions, certain resolutions have been adopted to which the Minister of Transport has given his approval. When the Defence Amendment Bill was being piloted through I announced that consideration would be given to granting vacation leave to persons liable to national military service in the Citizen Force during their first period of uninterrupted service, because their service obligation had been increased by the amendment Act and their period of service had been extended. In addition, consideration was to be given to having transportation to and from their homes during the vacation period made available at Government expense. The granting of a period of vacation leave not exceeding seven days, excluding travelling time, to members of the Citizen Force during their first period of uninterrupted service, and for their transportation at Government expense, has now been approved after consultations with my colleague, the Minister of Transport. A draft amendment of the relevant provisions of the Citizen Force regulations to make provision for this has already been drawn up, and is receiving attention. The concession will come into operation during this year. Vacation leave will be granted over the period which does not clash with the basic training in the last three months of the service period of the persons liable to compulsory military service, leave will be granted in such a way that it will have the least possible effect on the activities and obligations of the Defence Force. Leave must be granted in such a way that large scale trainjourneys do not coincide with the peak periods of the S.A. Railways. When leave is granted consideration will also, where possible, be given to the religious holidays of certain groups. Members serving at remote posts, such as Marietskop, will be transported to and from the nearest railway station by means of Departmental transport. The provision of free railway transport to persons liable to compulsory military service for the purpose of vacation leave will entail an estimated additional expenditure of R120,000 per year for the Department, and we hope to be able to recover this amount from savings. I hope that this announcement of mine will prove most gratifying to thousands of parents.</p>

<p><span class="col_6045-6046" refersTo="page_0227"/>The hon. member spoke about a piece of underground construction work, and I want to rectify that story immediately, because I do not want an incorrect version to be bruited abroad. It is generally known that we are undertaking certain underground construction work at Devon. The hon. member went to look at it; he was quite welcome to have come and asked me, I would have told him about it. The fact of the matter is that it was necessary during that time to build rapidly, and underground construction work would have delayed the process. But in the meantime we knew that provision would also have to be made for new equipment, and the new equipment, together with the fact that we now have the time, has resulted in our now being able to go underground there, but the expenditure on the buildings which have already been erected is not useless expenditure; the buildings will also be used in the system. Consequently the State has lost nothing in the process; all that has been done has been to establish a more efficient system. I hope that the hon. member will be able to sleep more peacefully to-night.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is in a privileged position as regards time and I can only react rather briefly to one or two of the matters to which he referred. Sir, I am sure that all of us in this House and in the country appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement and his attitude towards the defence of the Cape route, particularly as the importance of that route, not only to us, but to other Western countries, is becoming more obvious day by day. I am sure that in taking up the stand which he does that in our own interests we accept the responsibility as far as the Cape route is concerned, he has the support of the whole country. Secondly, we are pleased to hear that he is endeavouring, in our mutual interests, to arrive at an understanding with those other countries which are also concerned with the maintenance of the Cape route. We look forward with interest to an announcement by him as to what he has been able to achieve in regard to the question of mutual responsibility so far as the Cape route is concerned.</p>

<p>Then I want to turn, if I may, to one or two matters relating particularly to the citizen forces of our larger cities. Sir, when the hon. member for Waterkloof was peaking on Friday and was making an appeal for open-house hospitality and for warm fires for trainees on winter nights, I interjected that these men were not on vaction. I think I should elaborate a little so that we can realize, especially in view of the Minister&#x2019;s announcement to-day that these men are to have seven days&#x2019; leave during their period of training, that they are in the Defence Force undergoing continuous training to do a job of work and not to have their period of training interrupted by week-ends off. I think that we can over-emphasize this hospitality aspect and lose the balance which is necessary between work and relaxation. I want to say firstly that these young men are not career militarists. Their civilian life is being interrupted in the national interest to enable them to undergo continuous training. A limited time is available for that purpose and it must be used fully. Secondly, I accept that training is necessary in present-day circumstances. It is technical, physical and mental training that has to be crowded into that period of continuous training. The purpose is to equip our country to the highest degree for the maintenance of law and order and for defence. We must see to it that this training is realistic, and we must remind ourselves that we live in times when it is necessary to train our young men to deal with unconventional warfare. Sir, I have been privileged to witness the training of our citizen forces when they are undergoing continuous training, and I want to emphasize that there is no glamour about the training they are receiving; there was never intended to be any glamour about it. In fact, unconventional warfare demands more individual initiative, more individual courage and more individual dedication than any other type of warfare demands. For that reason I believe that the training must be continuous, and when I say that I mean that it must be continuous when they are in camp. That is why I welcomed the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s announcement to-day that they will have a seven-day break. I do not want these young men to feel that they are entitled to a five-day week, with the prospect of going off somewhere during the week-end to enjoy hospitality, particularly when one bears in mind the trouble which the Department may have in getting them back into training the following week. I believe that we are training these men so that they will be able to discharge an unpleasant duty if the occasion arises. That day may come. The sons of hon. members here are undergoing continuous training to learn how to kill and to destroy to prevent themselves being killed and destroyed. I believe that this realism must be brought home continuously to the men who are undergoing training and that their period of training in the armed forces is not a recreational period. I have found from my own inquiries that a number of nations which are adopting a similar system of continuous national training as we do are almost entirely obviating the week-end breaks and rather going in for the system of having a definite break of so many days during the course of their training.</p>

<p>Then I want to turn to a problem which I have raised with the hon. the Minister by way of question and which is facing the commanding officers of citizen force regiments at the moment, and that is the increased administrative duty that is imposed upon them. I know that the commanding officers of most units have available a member of the Permanent Force for clerical work for five days of the week, but the position appears to be that a problem is arising in regard to the administration of stores. A citizen force quartermaster <span class="col_6047-6048" refersTo="page_0228"/>is finding it quite impossible to cope with the amount of work involved in handling the quartermaster&#x2019;s stores of a regiment with the increasing numbers who are being posted to the regiments from year to year. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could not cause an investigation to be made to determine whether the time has not come for the quartermasters of the citizen force regiments to be Permanent Force officers instead of civilian officers as they are to-day. I remember that in the last war one of the civilian quartermasters said after he had been involved in his first bombing raid, &#x201C;Thank goodness, I can now return to the Union; that has squared my books&#x201D;. We do not want these civilian quartermasters to find themselves in the position that they have to wait for some catastrophe before they are able to resign from their posts or to square their books.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister on behalf of the Scottish Regiments that form part of our citizen force. These Scottish Regiments form an integral part of the Defence Force of the country. They have earned many battle honours and they have made a proud contribution to the military history of this country. Sir, the hon. the Minister has spoken with approval, and correctly so, of the enthusiasm shown by members of the commando units. But I wonder how many people in this country know that the Highland Regiments are able to equip themselves as they do because of the generosity of those people who financially support these regiments, because they have to buy every piece of their distinctive uniform and equipment. I cannot see that it is going to involve the Government in very great cost if, when a Highland Regiment chooses to have balmorals issued to them instead of berets, they were given a free issue of balmorals. Furthermore, I wonder whether, because of the part which they have played in South African history, some grant cannot be made to them, in lieu of the normally available equipment of the type which they do not take up, towards the cost of equipping themselves in their traditional uniforms. I think that hon. members on both sides of the House who perhaps claim a drap of Scottish blood in their veins, will support my appeal to the hon. the Minister to help these regiments, particularly having regard to the increasing numbers who are called upon to perform ceremonial and other duties outside of their normal training functions. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will be able to find ways and means whereby this assistance can be rendered to them. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. REINECKE</person>:</from>

<p>It is my sincere desire to thank the hon. the Minister for this very fine and clear exposition of so many different aspects of our South African Defence Force, especially as regards the use of the sea-route round the Cape and how the Defence Force is kept in a state of readiness for its defence. Also of particular interest were the new usages envisaged for the ranks of field-cornet, combat-general, and so on. It sounds very interesting and it seems to me as if it will meet with approval. It would also have been very interesting if the Minister had only referred to the procedure which is followed in recruiting immigrant children for military service and the circumstances under which they are taken into the Defence Force as the general public still does not have a great deal of clarity in this regard.</p>

<p>To-day I should like to discuss the aspect of housing in the Defence Force. We took cognizance of what the hon. the Minister said about housing. We greatly appreciate that and I can assure the Minister that the vast majority of Defence Force personnel greatly appreciates the enormous work which is being done in this direction. But due to the rapid growth of the Defence Force, housing will always remain a topical matter and it will continually become more acute, despite of what is being done by the authorities. We believe that these housing problems are one of the greatest causes for so many trained instructors having to resign from the service of the Defence Force, because financially they are simply compelled to do so. The allocation of Government quarters under the present system is made, we know, according to the old points system which has been in use for many years. This has the effect that when a young officer or non-commissioned officer marries, he cannot, according to this points system, come into consideration for Government quarters, because he cannot build up sufficient points. This has the effect that he has to pay between R60 and R100 per month in the city&#x2014;I am now speaking specifically about Pretoria and its environs&#x2014;for a house or a flat, and that his wife is eventually obliged to take a job in order to make ends meet. This mounts up, and eventually the man is compelled to resign for financial reasons in order to seek higher remuneration elsewhere. At the same time there are many senior officers with salaries of R5.000 per year and more who live in Pretoria residential areas such as Waterkloof Ridge and who let their houses for up to R120 per month and move to Government quarters because they fortuitously qualify under the points system, and they live there for as little as R27 per month. That cannot be held against those senior officers. They are surely within their rights and they are not contravening any regulations, but the question is whether it is in the interests of the Defence Force that this stream of resignations of instructors should continue due to the housing problem.</p>

<p>I should like to suggest for the serious consideration of the Minister&#x2014;and this comes directly from the military personnel in my constituency&#x2014;the institution of a housing allowance of say, R40 per month for every newly-married non-commissioned officer or a <span class="col_6049-6050" refersTo="page_0229"/> young officer who is unmarried, but who perhaps has to support an aged father or mother who is his dependant, up to the rank of major, in cases where they cannot be housed in Government quarters. Soldiers in my constituency have even gone as far as to make personal representations for a realistic upward adaptation of the current tariffs at which Government quarters are let to soldiers, in order to cover expenses when it is perhaps possible to introduce a housing allowance. They themselves say that they are prepared to pay more in view of the fact that transport, water, electricity, etc. are included in the rental, which is in fact a very low one. At present the rental varies from R15.13 for a corporal to R29.63 for a commandant which, measured against the salary of a commandant, really is very inexpensive accommodation. I am not speaking now of the housing of officers who service as commanders of units far beyond the densely populated urban areas; I am referring specifically to housing in Pretoria and its immediate environs.</p>

<p>I should like to broach a second point, and that is the question of spiritual care. It is with sincere gratitude that we notice that R25,000 is being voted for church buildings at Da Gama Park and R4,000 for church buildings at Langebaan Road this year, and R30,000 next year, and that progress is being made in streamlining the Field Chaplain Corps and its work. As parents we should like to thank the Minister sincerely for this gesture in the right direction, but I have personal objections to the word &#x201C;kapelaan&#x201D; which is foreign to Afrikaans. The traditional Afrikaans word is &#x201C;veldprediker&#x201D; (field chaplain) and we should very much like to retain the designation &#x201C;veldprediker&#x201D; in Afrikaans, while in English it can simply be called &#x201C;chaplain&#x201D;. But this is just my personal feeling in the matter.</p>

<p>In the Estimates this year there is once more R5,000 for the purpose of medals and decorations, and this affords us the opportunity to say that we are proud of this unique series of individual medals and decorations which will always serve to honour the memory of the late Mr. Frans Erasmus, who introduced them. Recently, and quite rightly so, the Pro Merito medal was introduced for non-commissioned officers, to be awarded in war or peace for exceptional devotion to duty, and it is equivalent to the Southern Cross medal for officers. It serves a good purpose. A medal on the uniform of any soldier is his pride, but now the position is that it is not possible for a young soldier to obtain a medal early in his career. But for young men it can also be an incentive to remain in the service if they were to be enabled to obtain some medal earlier in their careers. I mention the example of the inauguration of the State President. This is a good opportunity for a special medal to be awarded to each member of the Defence Force who participated in that ceremony. For many of them it would be a reminder of something which does not occur frequently. Similarly a special medal may be awarded to members of commandos, of the citizen force and everyone participating in the quinquennial Republic festival. This is something special for them and it will assist in enabling a young man to pin something on his chest sooner. This also applies as regards the young men now serving in the fine Presidential guard. I think that the young men with their fine uniforms who serve in that guard, would regard it as an incentive if at the termination of their service they were to receive a medal for that service.</p>

<p>In conclusion I once more want to plead for medical benefits for retired Permanent Force personnel who retired on pension before 1964. Those people devoted the best part of their lives to the service of the country in the Permanent Force. While they were in the service, they received the benefit of those medical services, and to-day they are deprived of them. I should like to plead that some provision be made for the medical expenses incurred by those people, because they have made their contribution. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I am satisfied that the National Party Government has succeeded brilliantly in two extremely important fields in our South African economy, in spite of any allegation which the Opposition may make to try to prove the contrary. The Government has given us two mighty pillars on which our people can build and on which our country&#x2019;s peace, safety and prosperity are based as on nothing else; that is to say, it has strengthened us economically and militarily as we have never been before, not during the Opposition&#x2019;s regime either. The economic strength of South Africa is indisputable, and together with the wonderful development of our Defence Force gives greater international status to South Africa. If we could succeed in preparing our people spiritually as well for their responsibility towards the Defence Force, in other words if we can succeed in strengthening our people and making them capable of defending themselves economically, militarily and spiritually, then we shall become an impregnable military bastion here at the southern tip of Africa, which is also such a strategic key position to the Western powers.</p>

<p>I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. the Minister for his visit to the training camp at Zeerust last year. [Interjection.] Yes, it is necessary to thank the Minister, and the Opposition has nothing to do with it. I want to assure the Minister that the officers and the trainees as well as the public at Zeerust appreciated it very much. If all the Minister&#x2019;s visits to various training centres, defence bases and armaments factories, etc., in the country produced the same good results, then his policy of making a positive contribution, by way of personal visits, to <span class="col_6051-6052" refersTo="page_0230"/>create a more favourable image of the Defence Force to the outside has been rewarded. I have no hesitation in saying that to him. The policy of the Supreme Command of the Defence Force to hold as many air force and ground force displays as possible, not only at the larger centres, but also in the rural areas, has brought the people and the Defence Force closer together, and that is very necessary because, as the saying goes, unknown, unloved. Meeting the heads of the Defence Force and the hon. the Minister of Defence at such occasions contributes a great deal in bringing the people and the Defence Force closer. Displays by the Air Force, armoured and infantry units show our people the skill of our trained men. In this way they also get to know the efficiency of our weapons when they are demonstrated, and this gives the public confidence in the Defence Force. Our Defence Force has already succeeded in this connection in establishing a sound relationship between the Defence Force and the people.</p>

<p>As regards Marico I should like to bring a few matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I do not want to dictate to the Minister and the heads of the Defence Force, but I nevertheless want to take the liberty of submitting certain representations in connection with expansion. I am convinced that more use could be made of the facilities at the training camp of the Defence Force at Zeerust. For example, an infantry training division should be added. The terrain is ideal for this purpose. I think that after his visit the Minister will agree with me that is the case. The existing base is a suitable one and is conveniently situated on the slopes of the picturesque Zeerust mountain range. The country atmosphere together with a hospitable civilian population can have a formative and wholesome effect on the trainees. I think that the strategic training ground within the mountainous and woody 200 mile long border belt stretching from the North Cape to the Waterberg between Botswana and the Republic is particularly suitable for the combined training of an armoured squadron and an infantry division from a Defence Force point of view. In my opinion the terrain is particularly suitable, because they can acquaint themselves there right from the beginning with circumstances along the border. We know that this area is a popular corridor for infiltrators from outside our borders, such as terrorists, etc. Getting acquainted with such border circumstances in the initial stages of their training can contribute a great deal to better preparation of the trainees.</p>

<p>I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister for his decision to reintroduce cavalry units in our Defence Force. The traditional &#x201C;burgher and his rifle and his saddle-horse&#x201D; will therefore come into their own once again and may prove to be a vital factor in many cases of unconventional warfare, especially in the border areas. I have on previous occasions pleaded with the Supreme Command of the Police to station mounted police at the control posts and access points in the wooded areas because it is easier to pursue and catch a suspected infiltrator on horseback than by making use of other vehicles. For this reason I am glad that the Defence Force now recognizes the value of mounted units for all sorts of tasks. Zeerust will welcome such a mounted unit very much. It may be supplementary to and useful for the citizen commandos and the training which is already taking place there.</p>

<p>In the last place I want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention that the modern and well-equipped hospital at Derdepoort, which belongs to the Cape Dutch Reformed Church, will be vacated shortly. The extensive buildings there extend over some 38,000 sq. ft. There were beds for about 120 patients. The site covers 30 morgen and is situated in the angle formed by the Great Marico River on the one side and the Botswana Border on the other side. The church is going to vacate the hospital and the Transvaal Provincial Administration is not going to support the institution any further. It no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally established. It had been intended for the mission in Botswana. After our becoming a Republic the people of Botswana have hardly been able to make use of the hospital because of the border control measures which are being applied. Therefore the beautiful complex of buildings there is now becoming useless. I think it will be worthwhile for the Defence Force to negotiate with the church or at least to investigate the possibility of incorporating that institution with the training structure of the West Transvaal Command and of Zeerust. I only wanted to bring these few ideas to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, both the hon. members who preceded me, submitted certain administrative matters to the hon. the Minister and I am sure that he will respond according to the merits of their proposals.</p>

<p>During the Budget debate, and even during the discussion of this specific Vote, a few hon. members on this side of the House let the spotlight fall on certain aspects of our defence effort, and the reaction we have had from the hon. the Minister and other hon. members on that side of the House, in no way satisfies us, and therefore I should like to return to one or two of these points.</p>

<p>Let me put it like this. Our defence effort to-day, seen in terms of our manpower position and our economic capacity, is a massive one. The Minister himself indicated on a previous occasion that the munitions, armaments and military supplies which we have, already amounted to R2,000 million. We are certainly spending more on defence to-day than previously and our training effort is a greater and a more permanent one than was previously the case. This is all very well. But we say that our military force is a defence force, and everyone also accepts it as such. The critical <span class="col_6053-6054" refersTo="page_0231"/>problem with which we are then faced, is to determine where, how, when and under what circumstances that defence force will be employed. It is about this that I should like to express a few ideas.</p>

<p>It would appear to me as if there are various alternatives which we will have to consider. The first is a large-scale conventional invasion of South Africa with combined land, air, and naval forces. On a previous occasion I tried to indicate why we think that this is not a very likely occurrence. It is fairly easy to motivate this and I do not want to cover that field again. A second possibility is the employment of these new kinds of shock weapons with which the great nations of the world are intimidating one another. I am thinking here, for example, in terms of this new rocket which contains up to 15 different atomic weapons which can be launched in different directions and at different targets. We think that the employment of this kind of weapon is not very likely either, because with these weapons you cannot be selective: you strike the enemy as well as the potential friend. The irony of the matter is that our greatest protection in South Africa is the very fact that there are millions of non-Whites living in our midst, and if the Government&#x2019;s policy can ever really be implemented, so that there is total segregation of the non-White groups, the situation will of course change overnight.</p>

<p>The third possibility is that of large-scale guerrilla warfare, and here it would appear as if the broad strategic plan is already unfolding. The communist countries are moving southwards. They will throw open the Suez Canal as soon as it suits them to do so. We often speak of marriage by proxy and it seems to me as though in this case we have to deal with a kind of warfare by proxy: the communists themselves do not fight, they use other people to do it for them. What we are threatened with is therefore the establishment of a guerrilla front which will probably extend from Mozambique on the one side to Angola on the other. Apart from the broader strategic objectives, this plan will of course include certain specific objects. Firstly, the object will be to try to pin the security forces of Southern Africa down in such a way that they cannot assist the Portuguese, or cannot assist them on a large scale. Secondly, the object will be to dramatise this clash with white Southern Africa, and this kind of dramatization is specifically necessary for propaganda purposes at the moment. Thirdly, they will probably try to block and to cut off our own diplomatic movement to the north. It will also be the strategy, of course, to identify this clash more and more with the East-West confrontation.</p>

<p>In this kind of warfare the chances are therefore that they will be reasonably successful. We all know that in guerrilla warfare one pins down at least five other persons for every man one puts into the field. We know that the enemy will have inexhaustible manpower resources. We also know that there will be no lack of funds and technical advice. But what is more, they will also have the knowledge that in almost all the countries of the world in which these guerrilla tactics have been employed, with the probable exception of the Federation of Malaya, they are continually making progress or have already gained the victory. It is, then, against this kind of background that we must consider our own strategy.</p>

<p>It would appear to me as though there are certain conclusions which we must draw. To begin with, the key to the situation in Southern Africa is undoubtedly the Portuguese areas. They are the terminal points of a horse-shoe which is drawn around South Africa. We know, and it is often said here, that the Portuguese already have approximately 100,000 men in the field there. It is estimated that the expenditure in connection with their military action amounts to between 40 and 50 per cent of their national budget. I do not want to say too much about this, and one often has to read between the lines, but let me just say this. If a change of government or of leadership were to occur in Portugal, or if there should be any change in the equilibrium, in the balance of power here in Southern Africa, this situation can change overnight. The great problem with which we are faced, as I see the situation, is to try to determine precisely where our battlefront should be. All military experts know that under certain circumstances one must reduce one&#x2019;s battlefront in order to shorten one&#x2019;s lines of communication, and everyone knows that under certain circumstances one must push out one&#x2019;s battlefront, away from one. This brings me to the third point, and this is the local position in South Africa itself.</p>

<p>I now ask hon. members opposite not to think as politicians for a moment. I ask them to consider the matter purely from the military point of view. According to Government policy these Bantu homelands will be made completely independent. The Minister tries to get round this by saying that this is a completely natural situation; it is traditional; it is as it has always been. But surely this is not so. The Government not only speaks of self-government; the Government says they must become independent, and independence is something absolute. Let us proceed further. If these areas should become independent, they would in certain cases facilitate access to the Republic from the sea. They will also straddle our main lines of communication and our water sources. It is easy to say that the protectorates are there and that they are independent. They were, however, made independent by Britain, which is 5,000 miles from here. The homelands are within the borders of South Africa. By making these areas independent, we will overnight double the borders which we have to defend.</p>

<p>But let us go further. It is easy to speak of individual identities if we view the matter as politicians, but individual identities often <span class="col_6055-6056" refersTo="page_0232"/>give rise to a divided loyalty. It is easy to speak of self-government.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is this. There is a direct clash between the ideological plans of the Government and the most elementary strategic considerations. I am dealing with strategy now. I therefore ask the Minister: Where is the general in South Africa who recommends this policy of fragmentation? Where is the general who says that under these circumstances it would be easier for us to defend South Africa? We are here dealing with the basic security of South Africa. There is a clash between this aspect and the ideological approach of the Government, and it is on this problem that we should like an answer.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with attention to the hon. member dragging the question of our colour policy into the debate on Defence. I want to point out to the hon. member that America is at present fighting in Vietnam, almost 6,000 miles from her borders, in order to protect her interests, and that he need not be so frightened, so afraid and so rash; he need not conjure up so many apparitions as regards military matters in the Bantu areas. I want to give him the assurance that when the time and the occasion arises it will be equally important both to them and to us to consider the military aspects of the matter both in our own interests and in theirs. The hon. member should rather confine himself to certain concrete aspects of our Defence policy.</p>

<p>While the hon. member was speaking, I was reminded of what Clausewitz had said. He was one of the great military writers and strategists after the First World War. Clausewitz said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most decisive act of judgment a statesman can exercise, is rightly to understand&#x2026; the war in which he engages. He should not take it for something or wish to make of it something, which by the nature of its relations it is impossible for it to be.</block>

<p>I think that if there is a reply which that hon. member deserves, it is contained in this view held by Clausewitz. Now I want to say that I am perfectly satisfied that our Defence Department, with the Minister at the head, completely meets the requirements set by this strategist and that I have read out here. I just want to repeat this: &#x201C;The most decisive act&#x2026; is to understand&#x2026; the war in which he engages&#x201D;. Having heard what was said here, and having listened to the reply given by the hon. the Minister, I am perfectly satisfied that he has a good understanding of what we are faced with in this present-day situation. It is strange that as many people as can stand up in this House could give their own individual evaluation of our present military position. There is no doubt about that at all. It is capable of a variety of interpretations and evaluations. But what is important is to emphasize what we are doing. Our evaluation, which is an overall one and covers the broad position, will virtually amount to the same. I say it is important that we should know what we are doing. This is what gives me the greatest satisfaction. The U.N. Charter provides that any country is entitled to defend itself as its interests may require. We should realize that a military build-up is taking place to the north of us at the moment. Although those countries are economically weak, they are sure to be supplied with weapons. This we must take for granted. They will get weapons. They will use those weapons against South Africa, in combination with the terrorist assault which is directed against the Whites in South Africa. I want to refer hon. members to the speech made by Kaunda in Botswana the day before yesterday, which amounts to nothing but an attempt to keep the spirit of resistance and insurgence burning bright. I think we may as well inform Mr. Kaunda that we understand what he means, particularly if we see it in the light of the recent unsuccessful terrorist invasion in Rhodesia. Hence also the accusation by Zambia and other hostile countries to the north of our borders, that South Africa is arming herself and that we are playing the part of an aggressor. I am convinced, as I am standing here, that our refusal to support this agreement in connection with the ban on the distribution of nuclear weapons before we have clarity about its full implications, will also be used against us in their attempt to brand South Africa as an aggressor and not as a defender. Now we should keep in mind, and while the hon. member was speaking. I was thinking about this, that our entire military strategy, our entire effort to streamline our defence system, is of a defensive nature. It is not aimed at the offensive aspect. We simply want to defend ourselves. We are not aggressors. We are people who are very keen to have peace. Just as the nuclear weapon has a peace function, our defence effort also has a peace function. It is only the expression of our desire to maintain peace. The world in which we are living to-day, is a world in which armed peace seems to have become the accepted state of affairs.</p>

<p>But I am satisfied that we are taking the right view of our task. I am satisfied that the Department of Defence and the Minister know what we have to deal with. This is what is of basic importance. Whether the attack will take the form of an invasion by terrorists, as the hon. member put it, or whether it will coincide with the creating of incidents or <span class="col_6057-6058" refersTo="page_0233"/>whether it will take place by way of a combination of forces against us, is beside the point now. The point is that we should prepare ourselves for any attack. I am not saying that we should prepare ourselves for a general nuclear war; in that eventuality we shall have no say in any case, but we should prepare ourselves with the means at our disposal, within the perspective which we command, for whatever we might have to face. The establishment of Armscor a short while ago, as discussed in this House, I consider to be a step in the right direction. Surely we can never allow this tremendous industrial machine and potential of South Africa to leave the hands and sphere of influence of the free Western world, because then this very same industrial power of the Republic of South Africa will be used to bring about the downfall of the free Western world. This is as clear as daylight. This is our primary duty. If we say that we align ourselves with the Western world unconditionally, then our standpoint implies that we must retain this tremendous industrial potential and power, particularly in times of war, within our sphere of influence. This puts us under certain obligations. This is why all of us in South Africa are so shocked at the fact that Western countries will not give us the opportunity to strengthen ourselves to such an extent as to retain within the power and sphere of influence of the Western world this tremendous power we possess, both in the industrial sphere and as far as raw materials are concerned, which will be essential in times of emergency and war.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the end of last year and at the beginning of this year there was considerable turbulence in my constituency of Heidelberg as a result of the fact that the teachers college at Heidelberg was closed down and taken over by the South African Defence Force. That teachers college was an institution which had rendered service to the country and nation for more than five decades, and which supplied more than 3,000 men and women to the Transvaal to serve their fellow men and their nation. Therefore it is understandable that we in Heidelberg were sad to see the closing down of that excellent institution. But in what a fortunate position did we not find ourselves to welcome in our midst in the place of that institution, an equally fine institution, namely a division of the South African Defence Force. Therefore I want to thank the Minister and the supreme command on behalf of my constituency this afternoon for having a high enough regard of Heidelberg to establish that division of the organization in our midst. The arrival of the Defence Force did not mean something completely new to Heidelberg, but merely the continuation of a tradition of long standing, because Heidelberg is a place which at the end of the previous century and at the beginning of this century played its role in the military field. We think of various great strategists produced by Heidelberg. We think of Generals Spruyt, Alberts, Salmon van As and others. Therefore it is fitting that the Defence Force deemed it fit to name the local hostels after various great military experts from our past, names such as De Wet, De la Rey, Hertzog, Pretorius and others.</p>

<p>I also want to express my thanks to the Minister and his Department because they went out of their way to establish proper accommodation for the personnel of the Defence Force, when they went as far as to recommend very strongly, and I believe this did happen as a result of their insistence, that the existing accommodation of the lecturers be taken over. To-day our Defence Force lecturers are happy, satisfied and proud to live in those houses.</p>

<p>Then I also want to address a request to the bon. the Minister, and I do so in view of the fact that we now have these young men as well as a part of our Defence Force at Heidelberg, and in view of the fact that he is about to establish civil defence in our country, that he should go out of his way to consider also Heidelberg as a likely place for the establishment of one of the civil defence centres. I want to say that there is accommodation for 1,200 students in Heidelberg. At present it is being occupied by approximately 600 boys. I think the nature of the buildings is such that one or more of those buildings may be set aside temporarily for the purposes of civil defence until such time as better provision has been made at Heidelberg.</p>

<p>This brings me to the point I really want to make, namely the preparedness of the South African woman and the South African girl. We want to express the hope that the establishment of civil defence will in point of fact only be the beginning of the training of our women and girls in order to prepare them for times of real emergency so that when the time comes, something which not one of us desires, when we perhaps will have to defend the last stronghold here, our women and girls will know how to defend themselves. Perhaps we are underestimating the physical potential of our girls. Every day we read in the papers how an Anne MacKenzie can do the 880 yards in two minutes and how an Annatjie Botha can do the 100 yards in 11 seconds, how a Pauline Craven can do better than 20 ft. in the long jump. Which of us men in this House to-day can come anywhere near those achievements? This shows us what the South African woman and girl are capable of doing when they get the necessary training and practice. Therefore we must realize what potentials they have.</p>

<p>In the minute which I still have at my disposal I want to address myself to the hon. the Opposition as regards their objections to promotions in our Defence Force. I do not want to argue about this on a political level. I just want to remind them for a moment of the British-South African military history. I <span class="col_6059-6060" refersTo="page_0234"/>want to take them back to the beginning of this century when the most fantastic and unheard-of promotion was made at Heidelberg, one which is most probably unequalled in the history of the world. The authenticity of history proves what I am now going to tell you. What I am referring to is the promotion in the Transvaal in 1901, under the supreme command of Lord Milner, of a dead baboon to the rank of captain in the British force. This is how it happened. A British captain for some reason got lost at Heidelberg. After the British had been looking for him for months and could not find him, they gave him up as dead. Now it so happened that in those years a very large rejected male baboon was giving the farmers a great deal of trouble on the farms and in the Suikerbosrante. Then one day he was shot by a farmer and left to the vultures. A few months later a British scouting corps discovered that skeleton. On their return they reported that they had found the missing captain. They received orders to coffin and bury him properly. Covered by the British flag the mortal remains were placed on a gun-carriage and then made its last journey on earth, flanked by various British officers, to the cemetery at Heidelberg. While the last post was being sounded he was lowered slowly, in a stately and dignified manner, into his grave and was buried. As if this was not enough, a grave-stone was erected for him one month later with the inscription, and this is still there: &#x201C;Here lies captain so and so who died an honourable death for King and country.&#x201D; Now I just want to tell the Opposition that it is a good thing to know one&#x2019;s history and to think about one&#x2019;s history to see how one&#x2019;s own ancestors made promotions before one criticizes one&#x2019;s contemporaries who grant promotions on merit alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to react to the speech of the hon. member who has just sat down, except to say that I agree with him entirely when he said some very good things about the womenfolk of South Africa. I agree with him in that regard. I should, however, like to take him up on one point he made, a point which has been made by a few hon. members on that side of the House, in which they appear to object to members on this side being critical of the Government in the handling of this Department. I should like to remind hon. members opposite that we have every right to be critical of the Department of Defence and particularly the Government&#x2019;s handling of the Department of Defence because after all it is the policies of this Government that make the actions of the Department of Defence necessary.</p>

It is the government of every country in the world which either puts itself in the position of having friends or not having friends.

<p>Mr. Chairman, some of the interjections that come from the hon. members on my left are so ridiculous that one wonders whether one is in fact standing in the Parliament of South Africa. I should like to deal with a particular aspect of civil defence. Civil defence in South Africa, like defence as a whole, is of vital importance to us. It is of more importance to us when one remembers that this nation is probably the only nation on earth which draws its resources for its defence, both civil and ordinary defence, from only one-sixth of the population. Therefore the burden on that one-sixth of the population is obviously so much greater. The hon. member for Pinelands mentioned for instance the question of air-raid sirens being erected in certain parts of South Africa. I should like to direct a few questions in this connection to the hon. the Minister. When such air-raid sirens are erected, is consideration given to the fact that they should be erected near vital installations, e.g. ports, railway centres, power stations, etc.? Because when erecting air-raid sirens one presupposes attacks from the air and with that goes the necessity of erecting air-raid shelters. I know the Minister has said that there are certain buildings which lend themselves to use as air-raid shelters. However, I should like to suggest that a greater study of this particular aspect be made.</p>

<p>Anybody who has had experience of air-raids overseas will realize that it is not only the situation of these air-raid shelters that is important. There are many other aspects to be considered as well. Have we taken note of what is being done in Rhodesia, in Portuguese East Africa and in Angola, countries which will be in the front line when air-raid attacks are launched in this direction?</p>

<p>But while air-raid sirens may be well and good, I believe the most likely form of civil defence we shall have need for in this country will be that occasioned by riots, disorders, and natural disasters, from whatever cause. In this connection we shall have to look very closely at things like transport services because if the transport services in the cities break down it can cause tremendous catastrophes. I have seen this for myself in Europe, where transport <span class="col_6061-6062" refersTo="page_0235"/>services was rendered completely chaotic with a complete breakdown in ambulance services. This is an aspect of civil defence. I also think that the greatest help in the field of civil defence can be rendered by the creation of home guard units for the protection of property&#x2014;civilian property and other property. To what extent does the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department link up with the police reserve whose duties include, <i>inter alia,</i> the guarding of civilian property in times of disorder?</p>

<p>Another thing I am concerned about is that we should be very careful not to instil in the public mind a degree of tension in regard to defence, including civil defence. Whilst these things are necessary, and whilst the machinery must be there in case of need, we must remember that we are still living in times of peace and consequently we must be careful that we do not resort to sabre-rattling. In this connection I must say that I have been alarmed by some of the speeches made by the hon. the Minister as well as by certain speeches made in this House to-day. One could, I think, say of these speeches that if read in a particular light they could cause a degree of tension amongst our population which would be completely unnecessary and unwarranted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know much more about it than that hon. member because I have seen it. I have seen a lot more than he has. I was with the Russian army for one month during the war and I was in Berlin when most of the hon. members opposite were fighting elections. I have seen the disruption of civilian life through circumstances which civilian defence is there to prevent. So, in all sincerity, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether all these various things are being taken into consideration. I am not criticizing the Minister and I am not criticizing the department, despite the fact that there are many things about which they can be criticized. I am simply asking whether things like ambulance services, hospital services, transport services, the supply of food, and other factors, are being taken into consideration in working out a civil defence programme. And, let me say, we can do without speeches such as some of the speeches made by the hon. the Minister himself not long ago, wherein he referred to the time of tension in which we were living in South Africa. I believe that the tensions we create ourselves, will become far more dangerous than those tensions created by enemies (beyond our borders who would like to do us harm. We on this side of the House talk of the Department of Defence with a great deal of pride, because many of us have served in that department. We talk with pride, but we hope that the machinery which we create we will never, in fact, use. I therefore appeal to the hon. the Minister that, when dealing with matters of this sort, he guards his words and does not in fact create the tensions in the minds of the population of South Africa that we do not wish to be there.</p>

<speech by="#morrison">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House would probably take much more notice of the constructive ideas which the hon. member for Port Natal expressed if he would only not do it in such an arrogant way. I shall leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to a section of the Defence Force which makes a considerable and important contribution, but which does it for the most part unobtrusively. I am now referring to the South African Medical Services. From the Surgeon-General down to the lowest ranks we have here a group of people who execute their task with such love, devotion and dedication towards South Africa and the people they serve, that one can only have the highest admiration and respect for them. I am now not only referring to the medical officers, but also to the lay officers and other ranks. The new training system in particular has set high demands on these people, but they met those demands, and they overcame the challenge with which they were presented and they carried out the task entrusted to them with great success. For this spirit and devotion which they displayed, we want to express our sincere gratitude.</p>

<p>Seen in its proper perspective, the South African Medical Services is one of the most important sections of the Defence Force. Not only is its task to provide for the medical care of Defence Force personnel, but the work which this unit does, also stimulates the morale and fighting ability of the combat units. This can only be achieved if the S.A.M.S. is well organized and functions efficiently. In a scientifically orientated Defence Force such as the South African Defence Force it is imperative that the status, esteem, scientific preparedness and the efficient functioning of the S.A.M.S. should never be prejudiced or questioned. With a view to achieving this ideal, one needs the manpower, apparatus and sufficient equipment. One is therefore concerned to find that in the S.A.M.S. almost 40 per cent of the posts of professional and technical personnel are vacant. In the category of medical officer alone we find that only 57 of the posts are filled. This shortage has admittedly been supplemented to a certain extent by the assimilation of medical officers who are liable to military service, officers who could accept responsibility for much of the clinical work which must be carried out by members of this unit. I also want to express the hope that the spirit which the hon. the Minister mentioned a moment ago, namely the loyalty towards the Defence Force and the particular spirit displayed towards the Defence Force, will now also take root among those acting medical <span class="col_6063-6064" refersTo="page_0236"/>officers who are undergoing their military training. I want to express the hope that some of them will make the Defence Force their career. However, I want to suggest that the great shortage of professional personnel, especially in the S.A.M.S., should he attributed to the unrealistic salaries which are being paid and also to the fact that these people are still tied to the Public Service Commission as far as the determination of their salaries is concerned. Furthermore, these people are also tied to a particular rank. In other words, when a medical officer reaches the highest notch applicable to, for example, the salary scale of a major, he must either wait to be promoted to the rank of commandant or he must wait at the top of that salary scale. I therefore want to plead that salary scales be made continuous and that they should not be tied to ranks. In the medical professions ranks are of less importance. It is skill, knowledge and experience which are the decisive factors there. I do not want to suggest that ranks in the S.A.M.S. should be done away with altogether. The ranks fulfil an important administrative and disciplinary function. However, I want to suggest that when a man is proficient in his work, he should not be tied to a particular rank so that the unhealthy situation develops later on that he must be promoted to a higher rank merely to retain his services. This does not only diminish the status of the ranks of the Defence Force, but it also causes dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>In the expression of these few ideas I also want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Middelburg pleaded for here. I gained the impression that the hon. the Minister was not unsympathetic towards this idea of a Defence Force Service Commission. I therefore feel that one can safely leave the matter in his hands.</p>

<p>In the S.A.M.S. there exists another important section of the Defence Force, namely the Military Medical Institute where work of a high scientific standard is done. This Institute is, in fact, not only an embellishment for the Defence Force but also for this, country. It is manned by officers who are animated by the highest ideals not only of medicine, but also of the related sciences, and who carry out auxiliary services there. One of the primary functions of this Institute is to lay down spiritual and physical norms for almost every category in which the men of the Defence Force are employed. This classification cannot be made on a clinical basis only, but it is also made in the applied physiological, biochemical, biological and psychological spheres. We also find the same bottleneck here. These highly specialized posts simply cannot be filled due to a shortage of manpower. I want to suggest again that the work done by this division is of such great importance that all possible efforts should be made to bring its salary scales into line with the needs which exist, so that one can obtain the people to fill the posts.</p>

<p>As is also fitting in a Defence Force which is scientifically orientated, this Institute has at its disposal highly technical and scientific apparatus which largely contribute to the efficient execution of its particular function. A human centrifuge is at present being installed together with other equipment, and the personnel are in a position to make scientific investigations of a very high standard. The ideal of this Institute is, and should also be, for every member of the Defence Force to be tested by this Institute at some time or other so that all latent deficiencies, shortcomings and personality defects may be revealed by special tests which are carried out here. People may then be placed into the categories which best suited them. I therefore want to plead that when this Institute asks for equipment and apparatus to enable it to maintain its scientific preparedness at a high standard, such requests should not fall on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, permit me the luxury of replying to one point which was mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (Point).

He said that there should be more training by commissioned officers and less by non-commissioned officers.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say to him that, if his information is based on hearsay, it is wrong. Instruction in the Defence Force has a responsible basis. For those officers and non-commissioned officers charged with instruction duties, there is no such thing as times fixed or office hours. They are busy day and night with the training of our young men. I suggest that instead of saying something like that about them, we should rather salute them.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Green Point is concerned, I believe that he misconstrued the position as regards the pleasant visits to families by our ballotees. This side of the House was referring to the free time of these young men. We were not referring to visits during military service, and I do not think that he will begrudge our ballotees that. I also want to follow up the hon. member for Hillbrow in what he said. I shall not follow him up in all aspects, but shall leave that to the United Party. I agree with him that our solidarity is the greatest deterrent to the outside world. If we display a united front in all respects to the outside world, the chances of our country being invaded are very slight. However, by raising an aspect such as the homelands in this debate, the hon. member indicated that there is in fact no desire for solidarity on that side of the House. The sooner we can prove to the outside world that there is solidarity, on this important aspect as well, the sooner will the talk of a successful attack on our country be stopped.</p>

<p><span class="col_6065-6066" refersTo="page_0237"/>As far as the hon. member for Port Natal is concerned, I want to assure him that if tension was discussed, he was the first to do so. The approach of this side of the House is that preparedness is based on responsibility. There is no reason for tension, but there is sufficient reason for being prepared. This brings me to the matter that I want to deal with, namely Civil Defence. The hon. the Minister has already dealt with this, but I want to refer briefly to an aspect thereof which is receiving the attention of military philosophers in other parts of the world. Civil Defence also means complete co-operation with the defence forces of that country and also with the civil protection organizations. It would, for example, include something like psychological preparedness. While this is fully recognized in countries such as America and Switzerland, I want to ask whether the time is not ripe in this country as well for research to be undertaken in connection with this aspect in order to determine whether it is necessary to prepare our people psychologically. We must accept that our entire defence system is geared to operation in our own territory. Consequently everyone will be involved in this matter. Everyone must therefore also be prepared psychologically.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to refer briefly to the speech made by the hon. member for Cradock who mentioned the Medical Corps of the Defence Force. I think this is a group of men who are very often overlooked by the public. There service to South Africa is of the very greatest value.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer to a matter which was mentioned by the hon. the Minister, and that is the shortage of personnel in the Defence Force, a shortage which, as he put it, is due in some respects to inadequate housing facilities. I share his view that we have not been able to attract people to our defence forces because, amongst other reasons, we are not able to provide them with the necessary housing. I believe that our servicemen should receive the highest priority when it comes to housing and other residential facilities. We on this side of the House, and I am sure hon. members opposite, fully support the policy of the Defence Force to provide housing and other accommodation for servicemen at the cheapest possible rental. The point is that there are just not enough houses available for us to accommodate all servicemen in the Defence Force villages and many of them are forced to take houses outside of Defence villages at very much higher rentals than they would pay if they were accommodated in the villages. I believe that the time has come when the Government should subsidize those members of the Defence Force who are forced to live outside Defence villages. The difference between what they would have paid if they had lived in a Defence village and the amount that they have to pay outside should be made good to them.</p>

<p>Then I should like to refer briefly to another matter raised by the hon. member for Pretoria (District), and that is the question of housing loans. From my information it seems that the 100 per cent loan that can be obtained is not a popular loan. It is not a popular loan because it is based on the salaries paid to members of the Defence Force. In my opinion those salaries in many respects are completely inadequate, with the result that, if I may put it that way, &#x201C;too little house&#x201D; is provided for the family in the Defence Force, undertaking a 100 per cent loan, particularly as the member of the Defence Force is responsible for capital redemption on his loan and also for interest at a higher rate than is necessary. I would like to make an appeal to the Minister to-day to consider first of all the question of subsidizing the rentals paid by members of the Defence Force who are accommodated outside Defence villages, and, secondly, that a system of homeownership scheme should be thoroughly investigated, so that a member of the Defence Force will be able to pay off the capital of his loan in very reasonable monthly instalments at the lowest possible rates of interest, commensurate with the Department&#x2019;s ability to pay a subsidy. I should like to confine myself today to naval housing, and particularly the situation at Simonstown. As Simonstown has been proclaimed a white group area, I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that his Department should, as soon as possible, undertake a survey of existing non-white houses available with a view to renovating and repairing those houses and accommodating white Navy personnel in them. Secondly, I believe that an immediate investigation should be held into the possibility of a crash housing programme in the extension of Da Gama Park Village. There is plenty of land available, and I suggest that the hon. the Minister should make houses available there by means of such a crash housing programme. A further aspect that I should like to raise is the question of the maintenance and repair of existing houses in the naval village. We have recently had a most unfortunate experience in that Community Development has taken over from Public Works the maintenance of houses at Da Gama Park, which is the only naval village to serve the Simonstown Naval Base. 129 houses were put out to private tender by the Department concerned and repairs and renovations are taking place at present. I would like to tell the hon. the Minister, from my own observations, quite apart from any other information I might have received, that the specifications for the repairs and renovations to those properties are certainly not being adhered to. The houses are being renovated and repaired in a most inadequate manner. First of all, in terms of the specifications, a plaster sealer had to be applied to all exterior walls before applying P.V.A. That is not being done in all cases. All the chimneys of those houses were to have been swept before the painting commenced and that has certainly not been done. One hundred and <span class="col_6067-6068" refersTo="page_0238"/>fifty chimney cowls and weather vanes were to have been installed in those houses. In many cases that has not been done. The outside door locks on garages and external doors, were to have been removed and cleaned with graphite grease; that has not been done. Vermin-proof air vents were to have been installed in weather walls in place of the terra cotta air vents; that is not being done. The defective woodwork on the exterior of the buildings was to have been replaced and it has just been painted over. This contract expires in October of this year, and as there are various other aspects of the scheme which are being overlooked at the moment, I would suggest that the hon. the Minister who should have the welfare of the servicemen in the Da Gama Park village at heart, take up this matter with the Department of Community Development and see what can be done about it.</p>

<p>Then I want to come back briefly to another most unsatisfactory aspect of the work that is being done in Da Gama Park, and that concerns the tender itself. The lowest tender was R66,000 and the highest was R218,000. The lowest tender was accepted. lt works out, for repairs and renovations, at approximately R513 per house. The specifications were altered after the contract had been awarded. Fresh tenders were not called for and the tenderers themselves were not advised of the amended specifications. Instead of using the most suitable substance for the exterior walls of the houses, namely a substance called Kenitex, the specifications were altered, and instead of using Kenitex, one coat of plastic sealer and two coats of P.V.A. are being used in a sea climate. This is most unsuitable. The Department&#x2019;s reason for the departure from the specifications is that it has been found in other places in South Africa that the Kenitex material or a similar material as originally specified, has not proved suitable. I would like to point out to the Minister, who is responsible in the ultimate for the condition of these Service houses, that Kenitex has been used on the State President&#x2019;s residence and on other ministerial residences; that it carries a 10 year guarantee period; and that it has a lifespan of 20 years. The existing guarantee period for the repairs and renovations being carried out on the houses is only until 90 per cent of the work has been completed. I would also like to know, although it would probably have been more appropriate to ask this under another Vote, whether the contract price of R66,000 was amended after the specifications had been altered and whether the lowest tenderer in fact tendered on the basis of using Kenitex as specified or a similar material? Unless the foreman was the case, I do not believe that he could possibly have come out on his tender price. I would earnestly commend to the hon. the Minister of Defence that he should look into this matter and take it up with the Minister of Community Development.</p>

<p>Sir, before I can say to the hon. member for Simonstown that I will take up this matter with the Department concerned, I shall have to investigate it. I will let him have a reply as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point raised the question of the cost of administration in respect of Citizen Force regiments. The difficulty which the hon. member raised also applies to the commandos. We have made a study of this problem already and we are at present considering alleviating the position.

<speech by="#member">

<from>*The hon. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>for Pretoria (District) referred to immigrants. I can inform him that in terms of the provisions of the Act and the proclamation that was promulgated in regard to the registration of immigrants this year&#x2014;they had to start registering as from this year&#x2014;3,914 young immigrants have registered to date in terms of that provision in the Act, and of that number more than 60 per cent have already intimated that they want to become South African citizens and are therefore prepared to accept compulsory military service. I think this is a very fine achievement. One cannot but feel grateful in this regard, and I think these young immigrants should be congratulated on this very fine spirit they are displaying. I think everybody will agree with me on that point.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the points system for the allocation of houses. I made a point of inspecting the whole system personally, and we had talks about this matter. So far I have been unable to find a better system. If the hon. member would help us to work out a system which would not amount to discriminating against and doing injustice to people who already have houses, we could consider it once again, but at the moment this seems to me to be the most equitable system. The solution is more houses, and now I want to add at once that so much has been made available to us on the Estimates this year that I can state with a clear conscience that, once these houses for which the money was voted this year have been built, the position will have been alleviated considerably. If we can keep this up, the position will be alleviated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico pleaded for his military camp to be enlarged. I do not like the word &#x201C;camp&#x201D;, and I hope that we shall never again hear that word. I do not like the word &#x201C;camp&#x201D;. It is a &#x201C;military basis&#x201D;. &#x201C;Camp&#x201D; is not a word that fits in with a modern defence force. I hope that we shall use the word &#x201C;basis&#x201D;, and as we talk about an <span class="col_6069-6070" refersTo="page_0239"/> air force basis so we should also talk about an army basis. But I want to give the hon. member the assurance that as we expand&#x2014;and we are now going to expand under the system of compulsory military training&#x2014;we shall bear in mind what can be done at Zeerust. Therefore he has reason to be very hopeful; if he invites me again, we might just do it!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock referred to the S.A.M.S. and I agree with him one hundred per cent on the excellent work done by this branch of the Defence Force. I think the Surgeon-General and his whole staff ought to be congratulated on the work that is being done there. As the hon. member knows, the human centrifuge is now being erected. This forms part of the broader planning of a new hospital that is to be built eventually. The planning is in progress. We have also called in the assistance of experts in this field, which is very valuable to us. As regards the question of the costs, etc., it will shortly be subjected to a very exhaustive enquiry by the Public Service Commission. This has already been arranged. I may just inform the hon. member that the second-year to sixth-year medical students and the few who have already qualified will form a total of 38. Therefore this position, too, will probably be alleviated considerably.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg referred to the Army Gymnasium, but I do not think the hon. member should insist on young women receiving their training there as well. He has a very fine institution and Heidelberg is very friendly towards that fine institution, for which we are grateful. But I think that if a training centre for young women is to be established, it has to be situated centrally.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein (West) rightly pleaded for psychological preparation. As he knows, we in the Defence Force are engaged in doing that. As we succeed in this matter, we shall also spread this spirit amongst the population. But in the main I agree with the plea made by the hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal referred to sirens and then he read me a fairly long lecture on what I should not do and what I should in fact do. I may just inform the hon. member that all the things he referred to, are being done by Civil Defence. There is liaison with other Government institutions and with private institutions, and there is liaison with bodies such as the Red Cross, St. John&#x2019;s Ambulance and the Noodhulpliga. It is our intention to make much more use of them than we have before. There is liaison in connection with hospital services and ambulance services. The State has granted assistance to certain municipalities in regard to the acquisition of fire brigade services. A specific programme has been implemented, and these services are in the process of being provided. We are also making a study of civil defence services in overseas countries, which has not been published because everything used in preparation for that has not necessarily been published. The hon. member also referred to what I had allegedly said about &#x201C;a time of tension in our country&#x201D;. I did not speak of &#x201C;a time of tension in our country&#x201D;. I said that we should have regard to the times in which we were living in this world, and that South Africa had to take note of these things and be prepared to deal with that situation. That is what I said. The hon. member must quote me correctly if he wants to quote me.</p>

<p>I must apologize to the hon. member for Karoo for my having omitted to reply to his pleas. It was purely an oversight. The hon. member referred to the Coloured Corps. My information is that there are still quite a number of vacancies that can be filled, but as the hon. member knows, we are laying down very strict minimum standards with which a person must comply before being admitted to the Coloured Corps. We do not take any person. Recruitment for the Coloured Corps is done by paying visits to certain parts of the country and, as the hon. member knows, the training it offers is of a very high standard. My information is that there are still 70 vacancies in the Army and 63 in the Navy, but that by means of the present training centre we are quite capable of meeting the needs. I do not think that we should once again erect expensive buildings for a new training centre while the present one can meet our needs, if we receive the necessary applicants. That is why I said that for the time being Eerste River should remain the only one. I do not think that we can simply establish a second centre for no particular reason. These things cost money, and if we erect buildings of a poor quality we are criticized. There are so many needs in the Defence Force in other fields, such as housing for our people at Simonstown and at Voortrekkerhoogte and at other places in the country, that I do not see my way clear at present to embarking upon new undertakings of this nature if they are not absolutely necessary. The hon. member also wanted to know whether Coloured instructors were being trained so that they might eventually replace the white instructors. That is the ideal, and as soon as we have brought them up to that level, we shall definitely afford them that opportunity. Then the hon. member referred to a possible Indian Corps. Let me tell the hon. member at once what attitude I adopt in this regard. The Minister of Coloured Affairs has had legislation adopted here, in terms of which cadet camps are being established for Coloureds. And as that training takes place, so it will to my mind be possible for us to draw from the ranks of those trained Coloured youths for the Coloured Corps. In my opinion the same applies to the Department of Indian Affairs. In view of the other obligations we are imposing on the Defence Force, I do not see my way clear to establishing an Indian Corps as well and erecting a training centre. I think the Department of <span class="col_6071-6072" refersTo="page_0240"/>Indian Affairs should provide that training, so that we may use them for the purpose of auxiliary services. That is my attitude. I do not think we should place all these burdens on the Defence Force. The Defence Force has enough other burdens to bear, and that is why I have always been reluctant in respect of this idea. But we cannot use the Defence Force to perform all these services. We have too many other tasks to perform. I think the hon. member will agree with that. I think that I have now replied to all the points that were raised.</p>

<p>I have already told the hon. member that we have occupied part of Salisbury Island. As provision is made for the University for Indians, Salisbury Island will be placed at our disposal in its entirety. If the hon. member would look at the Additional Estimates from Loan Funds, he would see that provision is made there for certain transport costs. That is to make it possible for certain things to be moved to Salisbury Island in the course of this year. We are therefore in the process of doing so.

<p>No. Those buildings are in too good a condition for us to vacate them at present. I am stating this very clearly. I myself went there to look at the command headquarters. I think they are very fine headquarters. There can be no question of our spending funds for the purpose of leaving those premises. We will have to be compensated if we do leave them. Until a better arrangement can be made, I do not think that we can consider leaving those premises immediately or in the near future. It is a long-term project. My information is that it is a ten-year project, and I do not think that we should now act precipitately as far as that matter is concerned. We have too many other obligations in the future.</p>

<p>Then I come to the hon. member for Hillbrow. I deliberately left him for last, and now I have almost forgotten about him. The hon. member is a knowledgeable person, and I have respect for that knowledge of his. I do not want to disparage what he has to say in regard to Defence matters, but the hon. member did not do justice to himself to-day. Instead of making a valuable contribution here, which he is capable of doing, the hon. member felt more like making a little political capital. I think the hon. member did an injustice to himself. He can make a better contribution, and I shall tell him why. The hon. member assumed that the Black people who are living in the homelands, and will be living there in the future, would be enemies of South Africa. [Interjections.] Yes, the hon. member did act on that assumption. He said that through that policy we were exposing our coast-line to the enemy and thus adding to the task of our Defence Force. In other words, the hon. member acted on the premise that we must assume that those people are our enemies.</p>

<p>Acting on the hon. member&#x2019;s premise itself, i.e. that those people are going to be our enemies, I maintain that they would, after all, be enemies of South Africa under his policy as well. Then, under his policy, he would concentrate around our cities a proletariat of millions of Blacks, and if they were to revolt he would need his entire Citizen Force, all his commandos and his Police to suppress such an uprising. [Interjections.] No, hon. members must not interrupt me now. I listened attentively to the hon. member for Hillbrow. The hon. member said that those people would complicate our defence task and the task of defending our coast-line. They would be a source of danger to us. The hon. member did not take the view that those people, as a state, might be on friendly terms with South Africa. I take the view that for economic, military and other reasons it will be necessary for those emergent states to retain South Africa&#x2019;s friendship and to reciprocate such friendship.</p>

<p>That may be so. The hon. member&#x2019;s whole argument is invalidated by this fact. Because of his fear that somebody may murder him, he commits suicide. I am telling the hon. member that he did not do justice to himself, because the hon. member is not a person who would commit suicide for no particular reason. On the contrary, he is a brave man and he proved that in the war. The hon. member, together with six other people, has defied greater dangers in his life; why is he getting scared now? I maintain that the policy advocated by the hon. member would create a much greater danger around our cities. [Interjections.] Wait a minute, give me a chance; after all, I did not make such a noise while hon. members opposite were speaking! I maintain that under the policy advocated by the hon. member we would create in South Africa a black proletariat of millions, which would be the breeding ground for communist agitation and chaos around our cities and which we would only be able to suppress with the aid <span class="col_6073-6074" refersTo="page_0241"/>of security forces. My accusation against the United Party is that they would make the task of our Defence Force impossible, since the Defence Force would have to preserve internal safety and consequently there would not be men to cope with the enemy from beyond the borders. But under the National Party&#x2019;s policy the Citizen Force would be able to assist in defending our borders, whilst the commandos could play the role I set out here this afternoon. That is my reply to the hon. member for Hillbrow. I also want to say this to him: When he takes part in Defence debates, he is capable of making a contribution, but then he should not allow himself to fall a prey to cheap politicking.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the matter which I wish to deal with to-night is the position in which the wattle industry finds itself. I should like to commence by saying that the hon. the Minister knows there have been difficulties as far as wattle growers are concerned and as far as the wattle market is concerned. Over the course of the past six months or so an agreement was arrived at between certain milling interest and growers&#x2019; interests. I wish to make the position of this side of the House quite clear and say that we do not blame the Minister in any way for what is taking place, to which I shall refer shortly. The Minister deals with the growers&#x2019; representatives and the millers&#x2019; interests and he waited for an agreement to be arrived at between the two sections. I think it is fair to say that as far as the Minister was concerned an agreement was in fact arrived at. But one section of the growers are extremely dissatisfied. I am one of those people who will abandon wattle growing during the next three or four years. Wattle growing is an essential part of my farming activities which have now been conducted for over 50 years, but, as I say, within the next three or four years I will discontinue wattle growing. I will be leaving that field with a number of other farmers who are meeting this afternoon to discuss the situation. We are abandoning wattle growing because of an agreement which was arrived at with a certain sector of the milling interests in terms of which a fund has been established and for which that sector of the milling interests has actually received thanks from some people because of its generous contribution of funds, so they say, to help those wattle growers who are suffering hardhips as a result of the agreement arrived at. I do not know how that fund is to be administered and I have not been able to get any explanation as to how it is to be administered. I do not know if the Minister has any knowledge as to how it is to be administered and whether he can tell the Committee anything about it. It looks as if it is going to be administerd by a joint committee set up by the millers&#x2019; interests and the growers&#x2019; interests. If that is so, then apparently the committee has not made any final arrangements as yet. We still do not know which people will be considered to be suffering hardship as a result of the agreement which was concluded. I am informed privately that people like myself who will be completely out of the wattle growing industry within the next three or four years, and some farmers will be out sooner, are not deemed to be suffering any hardship. Those of us who are now going in for a different form of timber growing will have to wait for eight or nine years before we can get another crop of timber. That is the suffering which we will have to bear. I can assure you, Sir, that we feel very sore indeed about this matter. The only criticism I can make of the Minister is this. While he was waiting to see what agreement was arrived at, he might have put in a word for those wattle growers who were going to be completely out of the wattle growing industry hereafter&#x2014; within, as I say, the course of the next two or three years. I am out of it now and I have no personal interest in this matter whatsoever, but I want to say to the Minister that we on this side of he House feel very strongly about this matter, and we feel the time has come for the Minister to have a look at overseas financial interests and how they control the South African wattle growing industry. Certain big overseas interests are taking our wattle industry to where they want it to go under terms they are dictating, and I think we can ask the Minister to go into the matter. Some years ago the then Minister of Forestry, now the hon. Senator Paul Sauer, visited certain overseas countries to ascertain what was the tie-up between the financial interests in those countries and the major milling interests in South Africa. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not referring to all the milling interests in South Africa, that is, the wattle milling industry or the bark packing industry. I am talking about certain vast interests whom I have good reason to believe to-day hold about 51 per cent of the financial interests in the South African wattle growing industry through the milling side. I say they are an offshoot of an overseas concern, one with big financial interests overseas, and they are taking our wattle industry where they want it to go.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which they are doing it are such I want to predict that within the next few years when the small man is out of wattle growing, the price of bark will go up again. That is what will happen. Of that I have not the slightest doubt. I hope when the Minister rises to reply he will indicate that he is willing, with the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, to have a full-scale inquiry into the ramifications of overseas finance as regards the South African tan bark industry. I think it is completely wrong and very bad policy that we should permit overseas financial interests to dictate the future of an industry which has meant so much to South Africa and will continue to mean a great deal <span class="col_6075-6076" refersTo="page_0242"/>to us. I do not believe it is right that the wattle industry should be controlled by overseas interests, any more than it would be right for that sort of thing to apply to other branches of industry where the Government has already taken a strong line. Suggestions have already been made in connection with other matters that the control and even the dominant financial interest shall be vested in people here in South Africa. But in the wattle industry things are going the other way, and one of the huge concerns dealing entirely with vegetable tanning materials, not in one continent but in four continents, is so strong that it can virtually dictate to this country what our prices are going to be. We sit down and have meetings where we discuss the prices of other tanning materials from other countries, and we are discussing merely the other overseas interests of precisely the same financial undertaking. Those are their interests, and they can deal with those other tanning materials in other countries and then tell us our wattle is being priced out of the market, and so forth, out of a market which they control themselves. Therefore I say only a full-scale inquiry with the Minister of Economic Affairs into the whole of the ramifications of that overseas interest can bring the matter properly before the South African wattle growers so that we can be placed in a proper position to compete in the world market with people who should be our normal competitors. There should not be all this financial string-pulling behind the scenes which is depressing our market from time to time when it suits the people concerned so as to get rid of the small man and the small grower. They want him out of the market altogether. I appeal to the Minister of Forestry to please do his best to have such an inquiry. I hope when the Minister gets up to reply to this debate he will inform us that he will give this matter very early consideration.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to deal with during the two or three minutes left to me and that is the question of the drying up of water supplies, which links with the Water Vote we discussed here the other day because the hon. the Minister is responsible for Forestry. This is an extremely delicate matter; it is a matter which in the light of the two reports I saw recently can be described as hardly having been proven. The matter is delicate because of the widespread interests and the number of people who are affected. We cannot afford to take chances in this matter. What worries me about this matter is this. As so often in these scientific matters, to-day&#x2019;s gospel is to-morrow&#x2019;s heresy, and the heresy of to-day was the gospel of ten years ago. Therefore we have to tread carefully. I am not asking the Minister to act hastily. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast spoke about the wattle industry a moment ago, and I am glad that he said that they did not blame the hon. the Minister for the predicament in which that industry was finding itself at present. We know it is a very difficult matter and since he asked for the matter to be investigated, I think it may probably serve a useful purpose to have such an investigation carried out. However, I do not want to express an opinion on that.</p>

<p>I should like to draw attention to-night to the considerable progress that has been made in recent years as regards our forestry industry. We hope to have an estimated income of R14 million from our forestry industry this year, while expenditure on current account amounts to R2,057,000 and on the Loan Account to R12,300,000. I mention these figures because they indicate that our forestry industry has almost reached the stage where our capital expenditure can be grouped together with current expenses. This means that forestry is virtually becoming a paying proposition. I think it is a great achievement that all the expenses can be covered by income.</p>

<p>I should like to point out to-night what is being done as regards accommodation for our forest workers. In its annual report the Department stated that it was difficult to find employees, one of the main reasons for it being the shortage of accommodation. The commission of inquiry which had been appointed, found that there was a considerable shortage of houses, particularly in the Western Cape and in the Midlands of the Cape Province. The commission then recommended that R3,300,000 should be spent on the provision of accommodation for forestry workers. Very good progress was made with this scheme and I want to congratulate the Department on what they have already achieved in this respect. During the five-year period 387 houses for Coloureds were completed, while 400 houses have still to be built. 152 houses for Whites have already been completed and 150 are yet to be built. What is also important, is the fact that the normal housing programme has not been negelected by the Department. These houses I mentioned, were additional houses. According to Loan Vote F this Committee will be asked to vote a further amount of R237.000 for accommodation for Whites and R180,000 for accommodation for Bantu workers. Therefore I say it is indeed a major effort on the part of the Department of Forestry in this respect.</p>

<p>During the forestry festival at George we had the privilege of visiting the factory where the houses are manufactured. I am particularly glad about the fact that these houses are all made of timber. The different parts are manufactured there and then put together. It was gratifying to see how well the whole procedure is carried out. I would like to congratulate the Department on the manner in which it tackled this problem of accommodation.</p>

<p>I would like to say a few words about another matter, i.e. the spreading of weeds and obnoxious shrubs. I notice that exactly the same amount is being asked for again for combating of these intruders. I want to refer <span class="col_6077-6078" refersTo="page_0243"/>in particular to hakea. Hakea has already become a very great danger and I hope that we will be able in future to do a great deal more in regard to the eradication of this weed. I really do not think that the amount that is being asked for here is adequate to cope with this dangerous weed. Hakea was brought to this country towards the end of the last century by someone who wanted to grow firewood for his farm labourers. He sowed 12 lbs. of hakea seed in the Stellenbosch mountains and saddled us with a heavy burden. The plant has already been declared a weed. Altogether 100,000 morgen of our mountains along our coasts are infested with this plant and it is now spreading from the mountains to the plains.</p>

<p>Hakea belongs to the protea family and, as we all know, the protea is one of our most beautiful fauna. As a result of this the matter becomes an intricate problem because we cannot simply use any kind of eradication method to combat hakea. If we do that, we run the risk of endangering our beautiful flowers as well. Hakea is a tremendously strong grower. It grows so densely that the area in which it grows becomes virtually impassable, and animals cannot graze on it. That is why hakea is such a great danger.</p>

<heading>SECOND RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provisions of this Bill amend various Railway Acts. The implications of each clause are fully explained in the explanatory memorandum which has been tabled, and my remarks will consequently be brief.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 1 the position is that the Railway Department is from time to time inconvenienced by having to accommodate foreign vessels in respect of which writs of attachment have been served on their masters for moneys due by their owners for services rendered, or goods supplied, by private concerns. In terms of the Harbour Regulations a Port Captain is empowered to remove a vessel to any berth as he may direct. These powers cannot, however, override an order of the court, resulting in a vessel, after having been attached, having to remain where berthed at the time the writ of attachment was served. The Department is, therefore, through no fault of its own and without being a party to the litigation involved, placed in the invidious position of having to accommodate attached vessels without any legal redress. Due to the continuous pressure on the available berthing space, the Department cannot afford to be burdened with idle vessels and it is considered that the time has arrived for steps to be taken to enable the harbour authorities, when complying with an order of the court attaching a ship, to do so in a way which will not reduce maximum exploitation of the harbour facilities.</p>

<p>The purpose of clause 2 is to amend the statutory amounts for which the Railway Administration is liable in respect of stock killed or injured by a train. In terms of section 38 of Act No. 70 of 1957, the Administration is compelled to compensate the owner of any stock killed or injured by a train, provided the killing or injury is not due to the lack of ordinary care or diligence on the part of the owner or his servant. The compensation payable in this connection is limited to the amounts laid down in the Act, but these amounts differ substantially from the current market values of the animals enumerated therein. Section 29 of the Act provides for compensation in respect of the loss, destruction or deterioration of animals in transit and the maximum amounts of compensation payable are stipulated in the Third Schedule to the Act. These amounts were reviewed during 1966 and brought into line with the current market values of the various kinds of animals. Provision is now made for compensation for stock killed or injured by a train to be paid on a similar basis.</p>

<p>Clause 3 concerns the appointment of staff to permanent employment, which is normally effected after the completion of a minimum period of two years’ service. In the majority of cases where servants do not comply with all the requirements prescribed for permanent employment, their services are, however, retained in a temporary capacity beyond the period of two years. Cases of such servants who have completed five years’ service in a temporary capacity at present require to be referred to the Minister for authority to retain their services on a temporary basis. It is now proposed to delegate this authority to the General Manager of Railways. This will reduce work and simplify matters from an administrative point of view.</p>

<p>Clauses 4 to 8 deal with the calculation of annuities payable to servants on reaching the superannuation age limit or to their dependants <span class="col_6091-6092" refersTo="page_0250"/>in the event of their death. At present annuities are based on, <i>inter alia,</i> the annual average of a servant&#x2019;s pensionable emoluments for the period of seven years immediately preceding his retirement. Following upon a concession recently made to public servants in terms of which their annuities are, with effect from 1st April, 1968, based on their pensionable emoluments for the last four years of service, it is now proposed to make similar provision in the case of Railway servants who retire or whose death occurred or occurs on or after this date.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House accept this Bill. It allows for adjustment for administrative purposes. Other hon. members will talk on particular clauses of the Bill. In regard to clause I of the Bill, which deals with the necessity of moving these boats after they are attached, I should like to prevail upon the hon. the Minister to remember this. The removal of a ship has had unfortunate consequences in Cape Town. He will see one lying on the beach here. When these vessels are attached they are nobody&#x2019;s baby. They should be properly secured to whichever berth they are moved. I know that the Railways and Harbours are protected against any loss but if you look along our coast you will find a trawler lying on the beach because it was moved from one harbour to the other, not as a result of an attachment, but it is quite evident that it was not properly secured and during a storm it broke loose. I should like the hon. the Minister to take note of this.</p>

<p>We are glad to know that the administrative effect of clause 3 is to expedite the acceptance of permanent employment in the Railways. We are glad to see that the Railways are bringing their regulations into line with those of the Public Service Commission. We support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the (Deputy Minister mentioned that this Bill is an omnibus Bill affecting a large variety of matters, from the removal of ships to stock being killed or injured by trains as well as the appointment of servants to the permanent employment of the Railways. The Bill also amends the method of calculating pensions. I should like very briefly to deal with clause 2 of the Bill, whereby the Administration shall pay compensation to the owner of any stock killed or injured by a train. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister cleared up one point about which I was doubtful, namely stock-on-rail which are involved in accidents. He said that section 29 covered this. The other point about which I am not clear is the question of stock killed by veld fires caused by steam engines. I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain to us what the position is in this regard.</p>

<p>In regard to the compensation for stock, I see that horses will now be compensated for up to R70 instead of the previous R40 in the case of &#x201C;any horse&#x201D;. We know that to-day a large number of thoroughbred race horses are being conveyed by rail from one place to another. I feel that some consideration should be given to thoroughbreds. The hon. the Deputy Minister might feel that an insurance scheme could cover this aspect. I merely mention this as a suggestion. I see that compensation will be paid for &#x201C;any sheep&#x201D; up to an amount of RIO, whereas previously the amount concerned was R6. I still feel that this amount is very low. Since &#x201C;any sheep&#x201D; could mean a merino ewe in full fleece, which would be worth very much more than RIO, I feel that this amount is very low. It would be even lower in the case of a merino ewe in full fleece and in lamb. I do feel that this is a point which deserves some consideration. On the other hand I think that the R8 in the case of a donkey is a good figure. The amount has been raised from R4 to R8 and this is a good figure.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to mention, namely the fencing of the railways. I noticed in a recent issue of the <i>Farmers&#x2019; Weekly</i> that:</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Railways have accepted full responsibility for the fencing of all railway tracks passing through farming areas, including sections from which it was previously absolved.<br/>In its annual report the North Western Cape Agricultural Union says that with the acceptance of this important principle all railway lines will eventually be fenced at the cost of the Railways Administration.</block>

<p>What was the principle referred to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>It is the principle of fencing in the railways in areas in which they were never fenced before, in other words, where the farmers to an extent were responsible for the erection of fences. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Work is to be tackled according to a priority list, as it will be impossible for the Railways to complete all the fencing within a short period.</block>

<p>This is understandable, but I know of long stretches of farmland, which are as yet not fenced in, areas not very far from Cape Town. I know too that the intention is as follows. I am thinking of one particular farm which has a ten-mile stretch of railway line cutting or running through the property and which has no fence on either side. The Administration is in fact planning to fence in one mile of this railway line, and the remaining stretch of nine miles is to be fenced in at some later date. We all know that this would be ridiculous. We must either fence the whole farm, or none at all. One mile will not solve anything. I do appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to bear in mind, where a railway line running through a farm is to be fenced in, the Administration should fence in the whole farm, or not at all.</p>

<p><span class="col_6093-6094" refersTo="page_0251"/>I realize that not all the areas can be fenced in simultaneously. It is for this very reason that I do appeal to the Administration to consider this matter very seriously. It is a problem which has been worrying farmers for a long time. I believe we should tackle this particular problem judiciously and methodically. We must start one job and finish it, and then continue with the rest at a later stage, when the Administration has the money available. It would be appreciated, not only by this side of the House, but by all agriculturists in general.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I, with your leave, briefly make two announcements at the outset of this discussion. In the first place, I just want to state that the Deputy Minister will take charge of this measure.</p>

<p>In the second place, I want to announce that to-day will be the last occasion on which we shall have Mr. W. J. C. Wessels, the Secretary for Inland Revenue, with us in this capacity, since he is going to retire from this office at the end of this month. I want to avail myself of this opportunity to express on behalf of all of us a word of thanks and appreciation to Mr. Wessels for the great work he has done in this Department. It is no easy task to be Secretary for Inland Revenue. I think all hon. members will agree with me that Mr. Wessels has carried out this task with great distinction and ability, and that he has done so because he has undertaken his work with dedication and zeal. I think you will agree with me, Sir, that during this period Mr. Wessels has always reconciled the firmness required for this office with a measure of friendliness and tact, and that by doing so he has gained friends for himself and for the Department. Mr. Wessels has been associated with this Department for almost half a century, i.e. 47 years. In 1921 he joined the Department, and in 1943, after he had served in Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Krugersdorp, he acceded to the head office. From 1949 to 1965 he was the departmental legal draftsman. In 1962 he became Assistant-Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and in that year he was responsible for the consolidation of the Income Tax Act. He also played a major role in the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system. In 1963 he was promoted to Deputy Secretary and in 1964 to Secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. Wessels is a person who has a great deal of experience and who has gone through an important period in our history. He has not only gone through that period in our history, but has also helped to shape history by helping to formulate our legislation and smarten up the administration and organization of our offices. We have also had the privilege of availing <span class="col_6103-6104" refersTo="page_0256"/>ourselves of this services, not only in South Africa, but also in the overseas service. He participated in numerous discussions between South Africa and other countries, especially as regards negotiating treaties for the purpose of avoiding double taxation. On this occasion I want to express my gratitude to Mr. Wessels for the wonderful work he has done. In thanking him for his work, I want to add that we shall miss him. It is a great pity that people with such long experience in such a specifically technical department should leave the service when they retire on pension. I am very glad to say that we can still retain his services in the sense that he will remain a member of our Commission of Inquiry into Monetary and Fiscal Policy. I know that he will perform great work there. In taking leave of him and extending our thanks to him, we want to express the hope that he will have a pleasant period of rest, but that he will not merely rest but still be active in many spheres and that there will be many more fruitful years ahead for him.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the words of the hon. the Minister of Finance concerning Mr. Wessels. We on this side of the House have been associated with him for many years and know him to be a co-operative, courteous and diligent civil servant. I think that the Department of Finance, and in particular the Department of Inland Revenue, has been fortunate to have this very high standard of civil servant prepared to undertake responsibility fearlessly and without fail. We wish Mr. Wessels a long and happy retirement. As the hon. the Minister has said it is unfortunate that these gentlemen grow old. The years advance and they have to give up, sometimes at the best time of their lives when their services are very useful. The Department of Inland Revenue has had, as the hon. the Minister has said, a very difficult two or three years over the question of P.A.Y.E., which is a revolutionary system. Mr. Wessels has played a large part in the reorganization of his department in order to give effect to the alterations in the laws and in the whole of the administrative machine of the department. We know that he will be missed, but we hope that he will have a very happy retirement. We fully endorse the words of the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I make no apology for raising this question of the scale of taxation again. I referred to it during the Budget Debate, I referred to it last year and I intend to refer to the question of the bulge again this year. I know that the hon. the Minister will reply that this matter has been referred to a special committee. We know that a special committee can meet and it will be some time before the hon. the Minister will introduce an amended Bill. I do not think it is fair to ask the public to wait indefinitely before they get relief. I am supported in my views by several financial articles. I refer in particular to the <i>Financial Gazette.</i> I do not think that anyone can suggest that the <i>Financial Gazette</i> is a paper which supports this party. I refer to an article of 25th August, 1967, which was written by the financial staff of this paper. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africans in the higher income bracket are now among the most heavily taxed in the world. For a married man with two children the rate of income tax is now higher in South Africa for gross salaries above R 10,000 a year than in most European countries. Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway are the exceptions. At R10,000 a year the rate of income tax is virtually the same as that in the United Kingdom. It leaves the taxpayer with 72 per cent of his gross income. At R20,000 a year a married man with two children is left with only 54 per cent of his gross earnings in South Africa compared with 59 per cent in Britain.</block>

<p>The criticism may come that we are dealing with the higher income brackets. What we are concerned about at the moment is a factor referred to by the hon. the Minister of Finance, namely this question of productivity. It is unfortunate that when we go to our big cities we see in our professional and executive class a tendency not to put their whole weight behind the job. They ease off and ask why they should &#x201C;work for the Receiver of Revenue&#x201D;. That is a colloquial saying. The attitude is: Why work so hard when there is no incentive? This is also the case with married women. I am now talking of competent married women in the professional class, particularly teachers, nurses and persons who have university qualifications. They are not doing the jobs they could be doing, because they say there is no incentive and they embarrass their husbands when they go to work. If their income paid at the proper rates is added to their husband&#x2019;s income, wives say that by the time they have paid their transport, additional Native servants to do the chores around the house and by the time they have paid their tax they might as well stay at home. We are losing people that could be productive, because of the incidence of taxation. I have another article here which appeared in <i>The Cape Argus</i> on 6th May, 1967. Taxation for last year is the same as it is this year. This article in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 25th August, the top income brackets are among the most highly taxed people in the world&#x201D;. In another article in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 25th August, 1967, it is stated that &#x201C;In fact, for most salaries above R10,000 per annum South African tax is higher than in most European countries.&#x201D; We find an endorsement of this view in financial papers throughout the country, namely that the tax rate is high. We feel that the hon. the Minister should give this matter some attention, because it is killing incentive. We do want increased productivity. We do want our professional class to work to their fullest <span class="col_6105-6106" refersTo="page_0257"/>capacity and not to take time off. Frequently certain members of a profession, and I do not want to mention a particular profession, find it more profitable, as far as their health and their pocket is concerned, to improve their golf handicap than to improve their monetary income. They feel that the incentive is killed and that they might as well take life a little more easily rather than make a greater effort and eventually hand the additional income to the Inland Revenue authorities.</p>

<p>We find that this is also encouraging another class of person, namely persons above a certain income group who are looking for fringe benefits. He looks for a house from the company at a nominal rate and for a prestige car when a cheaper car would do. He looks for certain travelling allowances, entertainment allowances, and so forth. They do this to keep their income down. The Revenue Office has great difficulty in making a fair assessment as to what these additional amenities are worth. In general, the annual duel between the tax authorities and the tax avoiders&#x2014;I am not talking about the tax evaders&#x2014;is growing more and more keen, because the rate is so high in the other brackets that it is killing incentive. For that reason I hope that the Minister will give some consideration to these high income brackets because the rate of taxation is having the effect of discouraging productivity and effort, and we as a young country should be encouraging people to put their best foot forward. This attitude of &#x201C;I am not going to work any harder because most of it goes to the Receiver of Revenue&#x201D; is infectious; it starts at the top and goes right through the community.</p>

<p>Once people at the head start taking life easily it permeates right throughout all ranks. Once a Minister, for example, starts taking life easily&#x2014;and the Minister of Finance cannot take life easily if he is doing his job properly&#x2014;one finds that the same thing is done by the senior staff and from the senior staff it permeates down to the junior staff. A young country like South Africa cannot afford to have its people take life easily. I do not say that people should work themselves to death, but they should have some incentive to give of their best, and when the tax system is such that it discourages incentive, then I suggest that there is something wrong with the tax system. I hope that these factors will be taken into consideration by the committee which is investigating this matter, and I hope that the Minister will ensure, as far as possible, that the committee submits its report at the earliest possible moment because until we get our tax position right, we will not get the effort to which this country is entitled.</p>

<p>Along with the hon. the Minister and the first speaker on the Opposition side I, too, want to convey my thanks and pay tribute to Mr. Wessels and wish him a very fruitful period of rest, especially in view of the fact that at present he is doing such particularly valuable work for us in regard to the inquiry into the system of taxation. At the same time I want to wish his successor a very fruitful term of office; he will need our good wishes, for under his dispensation we shall have to give effect to the recommendations made by the commission which is conducting the inquiry at present. Consequently he will be the person to give effect to the recommendations.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pinetown astonished me again this afternoon. So often in the past few years the accusation has been levelled at us that this Government has now become a rich man&#x2019;s Government, whereas hon. members of the Opposition have become the champions of the poor man and the lower income groups. And, would you believe it, Sir, this afternoon the hon. member came forward and pleaded for the higher income group. I do not know what to make of the Opposition. Are they the champions of the higher income groups, or do they want to be the champions of the lower income groups?</p>

<p>For the umpteenth time the hon. member for Pinetown spoke here of the so-called bulge. After all, it is this Government which has from time to time levelled out that bulge to a certain extent. If one thinks of the bulge that existed before this Government came into power, one will see that it was this Government, and more specifically the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor, who started levelling out that bulge. After all, we do have the promise made by the Government that as soon as the opportunity occurs, as soon as finances permit, this bulge will be levelled out further. Since a commission is at present investigating this matter, I believe that we may safely leave it in the hands of that commission. However, I have just one suggestion to make. If we look at the <span class="col_6107-6108" refersTo="page_0258"/>tax rates we have before us, we see that the increases in the percentage taxation is fairly uneven. The amounts on which taxes are being levelled increase as follows: R500, R1,000, R1,200, R2,400, R3,000, R4,600, R5,000, and then there are increases at regular intervals of R1,000 up to the RIO,000 mark, after which it leaps to R12,000, R14,000, R16,000 and R18,000. I would appreciate it if attention could be given to this matter of effecting regular intervals in this scale, and if we could get away from the irregular increases we have at present. It is, of course, a fact that the R4,600 notch is merely the old super tax notch of £2,300. But, whereas we no longer have super-tax, whereas we have a block system at present, we may after all just as well do away with the increase from R3,000 to R4,600 and then again from R4,600 to R5,000. Why can we not have even increases from R2.000 to R3,000, to R4,000, to R5,000, to R6,000, etc.? Mr. Chairman, with these observations I want to leave the matter at that, for ‘I am convinced that this commission will work as quickly as possible, and that it will perhaps be possible for that commission to submit a report before the next session, a report to which it will then be possible to give effect.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member for Paarl did at least permit himself one or two slight criticisms of the taxation system and that his speech was not one of the conventional I-thank-the-Minister contributions.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to refer primarily to the taxation proposals as set out on page 417, paragraph (1) (a). During the Budget debate my colleague, the hon. member for Pinetown, very effectively and very eloquently dealt with certain principles taken up in these taxation proposals, and I would have been happy to have left it at that, but then the hon. member for Florida rushed in with a vast set of statistics to prove to us in fact how sound these proposals were. I think it is necessary that someone should react to what he put before the House because quite clearly his speech had a considerable impact upon the House. He told us that our taxation was lower than anywhere else; he completely overlooked the question of the bulge; he dealt with indirect taxation and all sorts of other things, and having accused us of having painted a distorted picture, he proceeded to do precisely this. He became guilty of the very thing of which he had accused us. In order to justify the high taxes which are taken up in the proposals before us, he indicated to us that indirect taxation in South Africa was much lower than anywhere else in the world. In fact, he put it at the low rate of 36 per cent and he indicated figures which showed that elsewhere it was appreciably higher. I think this Committee is justified in asking where he got that information from. What are his sources; what does he include when he talks about indirect taxation? In putting indirect taxation in South Africa at 36 per cent does he, for example, include the pipeline from Durban on which the Government has apparently been making a profit of about 600 per cent? That surely is a form of indirect taxation. Does he allow for the fact that telephones must be hired from the Government and that we probably pay more for a less efficient service? All that is part of the indirect tax pattern.</p>

<p>But we can go further than that. There is no sense in comparing our tax rates with those of Britain, as he did, because Britain is a welfare state. They finance exceptional social services.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>But you are always comparing things with Britain.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member did so, and if you look at his Hansard, Vol. 9, Col. 3211, you will see precisely what I am talking about. There is no sense in comparing our rates with those of Britain. They have a national medical scheme. They pay pensions to everybody, there is no means test, and they give exactly the same treatment to people whether they are white or non-white. He mentioned New Zealand and Australia, but what is the sense of making comparisons with those two countries unless you also indicate that they have major subsidies for primary products in order to lower the cost to consumers, and unless you also indicate that they make major cash endowments for dependants.</p>

<p>But I want to return to something else. The hon. member studiously avoided what we have been referring to all along and what we call the marginal rate of increase. Our contention has been that this is higher than it is anywhere else. Now again, if I may quote Britain as an example, you find that this rate remains constant for all incomes from R 1,700 to R 11,000. But what do we have here in South Africa? I made a little calculation. If your taxable income is about R3,000, then the marginal percentage rate is 10 per cent. I am rounding the figures off. If it is R4.000, then it is 12 per cent. If it is R5.000, it becomes 14 per cent, and when it gets to R6.000 it approaches the 30 per cent mark. When it gets to R7,000, it becomes 39 per cent, and when it comes to R8,000, it becomes 42 per cent. So over a narrow range, from R3,000 to R8.000. it increases from 10 per cent to 42 per cent. This is what we are talking about. We say that this might be historically based, but it is indefensible on grounds of logic and equity. It is unfair and it is not a system that we should persevere with in South Africa.</p>

<p>But there is an important other point which hon. members opposite never put before this Committee, and that is the point at which you reach the maximum marginal rate; and here South Africa does not compare at all well with the outside world. Again, if you consider a married man with two children, which might well be the norm that we should follow, you find that in South Africa you reach this maximum marginal point at an income of R 18,000.</p>

<p><span class="col_6109-6110" refersTo="page_0259"/>In Sweden it is R25,000, in the Netherlands it is R33,000, in the United Kingdom it is R37,000, and in America it is well over R100,000. We believe that this is one of the most powerful disincentives that you could possibly have, because these are precisely the people who are maximally productive. Let me say, too, that these top bracket people, constituting about 3 per cent of our tax-paying population, contribute almost 40 per cent of the taxes collected in this country. We talk about immigrants. The immigrants whom we really want in South Africa would fall into these categories, and we will not get them here if this is the system of taxation.</p>

<p>Then, to get to what I believe was the hon. member for Florida&#x2019;s <i>coup de grace,</i> he ended up by indicating that our taxation rates now are lower in South Africa, in 1967, than they were in 1947. This is also the sort of comparison which is not really meaningful, because 1947 was immediately after a major war when new services had to be stimulated and introduced. In fact, the Government even today reaps the benefit of what was done then. But surely when making that sort of comparison you cannot discount inflation. We all know that money values erode away at the rate of more than 2 per cent per annum, and I challenge anybody on the other side of the House to deny that the value of the 1947 rand is to-day more than 50 cents. So if you compare our taxation rates to-day with what the position was in 1947, what do you find? I have taken a couple of categories which I believe will illustrate what I have in mind. If you take an artisan who earned R1.000 in 1947, his earning rate to-day would be R2,000. The Government would agree with that. But in 1947, after tax, he was left with 94.6 per cent of his income. To-day he is left with 93.7 per cent. Take a professional man at the middle level earning in 1947 about R3,000. He was then left with 91.5 per cent of what he earned, but to-day he is left with 87.7 per cent. Take the executive who earned about R5.000 in 1947. He was then left with 83.6 per cent, but to-day he is left with 75.2 per cent. And take the senior executive who earned about R8,000 in 1947. He was then left with 75 per cent of what he had earned, but to-day he is left with 56.4 per cent. So in practically every category one can illustrate that these people are worse off to-day than they were in 1947. That sort of argument is meaningless and the House should not be put under a false impression, as we were. But our contention has been that this is a young and expanding country where rates of taxation should be low so that there could be massive capital formation in the private sector. But probably the greatest indictment of the sort of argument the hon. member for Florida put before us is that the hon. the Minister himself has appointed a commission of inquiry. If he thought that the whole system was perfectly in order, and if he was happy about it, would he have taken the trouble to appoint this commission? It is precisely because he knows that the present system is archaic, wrong and unjust that he has appointed this commission, and I hope this commission will, take into account some of these factors which I have tried to put before the Committee.</p>

<p>But that is what the hon. member for Pinetown did. What is more, having said that, the hon. member made a detour and then he compared &#x201C;the rates of taxation in South Africa with those of other countries&#x201D;, after he had said, &#x201C;There is no sense in comparing them&#x201D;. Then he asked about the indirect taxation, and he asked what about the corporations in America which had to pay so much, and what about the small percentage in South Africa which had to pay as against the large percentage which had to pay in other countries. He says that one cannot compare these things, but what he and the hon. member who spoke before him took delight in, was in fact in comparing these things. And if the hon. member had compared them in the correct way it would not have been so bad, but what did he say? He said, &#x201C;The marginal rate of increase in South Africa is higher than anywhere else in the world&#x201D;. But, surely, the hon. member knows that this is not the case.

Does the hon. member know what the &#x201C;maximum marginal rate&#x201D; is in the United Kingdom? It is 91.25 per cent. And this publication which I obtained from the Department also states that it is 91.25 per cent. In Canada it is 80 per cent, but that is merely in respect of the central government, and if one takes the State and the province together, the maximum marginal rate in Canada is 99 per cent. In the U.S.A, the maximum marginal rate is 70 per cent. That is stated both in the publication I have here and in the newsletter of the bank. The figures correspond exactly.</p>

<p>At what income level do they reach that rate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that in a moment. Since we are talking about the U.S.A, at the moment: the hon. member said that once their income exceeded the R 100,000 mark, they would reach that rate. But, surely, the hon. member knows that they have two systems, and he should have said so to the House. They have the system whereby they assess the incomes of a man and his wife together, and then they have the alternative system whereby the husband alone is being taxed. When they are to furnish separate returns, they reach that rate at the R71,428 mark. It is true that if joint returns are furnished, it exceeds the R100,000 mark. Let us take comparable countries, not old countries, not welfare countries, but let us take developing countries. Let us see what the position is in Australia. In Australia the maximum marginal rate is 68.34 per cent. I want to compare it with ours, since the hon. gentlemen opposite are claiming that ours is 73 per cent. Ours is not 73 per cent. In respect of normal income tax South Africa&#x2019;s figure is 50 per cent marginal, to which is added the share of the provinces which amounts to between 16 and 17 per cent. South Africa&#x2019;s is approximately 66y per cent. That is our real maximum marginal rate. It is even lower than that of Australia. In Australia one reaches this rate at the R36,000 mark, whereas we reach ours at the R18,000 mark. It is quite true that the point at which we in South Africa reach the maximum marginal rate is much lower than it is in other countries. I do not want to deny that. The question is not what is the marginal rate alone; the question is what is the effective rate of taxation one pays; what is one left with after one&#x2019;s tax has been deducted? That is why we should now look at what percentage tax the people in South Africa pay on certain incomes. In that connection I also want to say this: A rand in South Africa, in Britain and in Australia does not buy precisely the same amount of food and clothing. The values of the money also differ. I want to suggest that in comparison with what can be bought with it in other countries, the South African rand can still buy more than the same amount of money can buy in other countries. If that is the case, South Africans are still somewhat better off. If we were to compare it on a rand basis, then we should ask ourselves what percentage of their money people in other countries pay in effective taxes and what they are left with. After all, this is a fact which hon. members opposite will not dispute, namely that the lower income groups in South Africa pay less in taxes than they do in any other comparable country. Surely, hon. members opposite will grant that. I shall not dilate on the figures. Then we come to the bulge.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the bulge has its historical background and on two occasions so far the National Government has tried to level out that bulge, and now it has once again appointed</p>

<p>a commission to see whether it is not possible to level out the bulge further.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>If possible, I think it would be a good thing if we could level it out. We have, of course, inherited the bulge. I do not want to make a political issue out of this matter. As I am saying, the bulge is an old legacy from the old system we had. Hon. members may look it up in Hansard, and when we have the Income Tax Bill before us, we can investigate this matter further, but I want to tell hon. members that on both occasions on which the hon. the Minister of Finance tried to level out the bulge, hon. members on that side of the House levelled the accusation at us that we wanted benefits to accrue to the rich which we begrudged the poor. I looked up those speeches; I know what I am talking about, and I can quote these things from Hansard. The bulge was wrong, and when we wanted to put it right those hon. members said that we wanted to accommodate people who did not deserve it. In those days money was worth a little more than it is to-day. Today they do not talk about the rich, but about the middle income group.</p>

<p>Let us see what is the actual position here where the bulge occurs. I want to quote from this statement, and any hon. member who wishes to talk about this matter can borrow the statement from me. As regards South Africa, I am taking the figures in respect of the State and the provinces jointly, and I shall also do so in the case of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Now I want to compare these four countries. I shall furnish the figures in respect of South Africa first, and then I shall deal with Canada, Australia and New Zealand in that order. In South Africa a married man with a wife and two children pays 10.8 per cent of his income, if the latter is R6,000. This figure is in respect of both State and provincial tax. In Canada such a person pays 13.5 per cent, in Australia 23.3 per cent, and in New Zealand 20.2 per cent. What other income should I compare? I shall take R8,000. The figures are 18.2 per cent, 16.8 per cent, 29.5 per cent and 27.3 per cent, respectively. On R 10,000 the respective amounts are 24 per cent, 20.1 per cent, 34.6 per cent, and 33.6 per cent. Let us take the top incomes where under our system we reach our maximum marginal rate at such an early stage, namely 50 per cent normal. In South Africa one pays 41 per cent if one&#x2019;s income is R20,000. That is the effective tax, and 59 per cent of that income the taxpayer puts into his own pocket. I am not taking the savings levy into account, for we do after all get it back later on. The percentage in Canada is 32.1, in Australia 48.2 and in New Zealand 46.7. The highest figures I have here, are in respect of R30,000, and the tax percentages are 49.3 in South Africa, 38.3 in Canada, 54.1 in Australia and 51.1 in New Zealand. I quoted these figures because I do <span class="col_6113-6114" refersTo="page_0261"/>not want the Opposition to create the impression in this country that we are being terribly overtaxed. I concede that in a young country, such as we are, initiative should be fostered. Our system of taxation must not stifle the initiative of the people. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am very interested to learn that now we are going to have another income tax commission. I have spoken many times on one aspect of income tax, the taxation of gold mining companies. Hon. members know of course that now we have a commission, the question will arise whether the gold mining formula is to be referred to the commission as well, or whether it will be excluded? This formula which we have to-day emanated from the brains of civil servants, from what I would call a drumhead court-martial appointed by the Minister of Finance of those days. That is a very long time ago. We had the Secretary of Finance, the Government Mining Engineer and others, a small committee of five senior civil servants who devised a system of taxation. That system was not found altogether satisfactory and later a commission was appointed by the doyen of our Ministers of Finance, the late Mr. Havenga. Mr. Havenga appointed an income tax commission in his day, namely the Steyn commission, of which the late Mr. Raymond Steyn, a very learned accountant and one of the most able men in South Africa was the chairman. They had just begun their investigation when the Minister of Finance notified them in the second order that they were not to deal with gold mining taxation. The principle underlying gold mining taxation is very simple. It states that the Government is a partner in the enterprise. The Government does not only impose taxation on the profits; it is actually a partner in the enterprise. That partnership is defined by a formula. The formula says that the Government will grant a lease to the gold mining company for the right to mine. The argument used against the gold mining companies is very simple. It is said that in a gold mining company you are taking the patrimony of the country and making it your own. You are taking the wealth of the country. We all agree on that. Of course that is what you are doing. But if the Government says that in order to mine that gold for us and the community through a company, we will come into the partnership, then I think the Government have established their right, a justifiable right, at the beginning of the enterprise. After that the gold mining company should become an ordinary company for taxation purposes. What is the justification for saying that after you establish the lease there will be a special system of taxation for a gold mining company? Mr. Havenga said there should be no revision of the tax but that it should remain as it was. I should like to say it is a most unsatisfactory tax. This is what happens to the shareholder in a gold mining company. Such a company does not live for ever, as we know. Some have a very short life. A new company established three or four years ago will have a very short life of about 15 years. There are companies like that. The first thing that happens is that the Government says that it wants its share of the profits, under the lease. Having done that the Government then says: You will now be taxed not as an ordinary company but according to a special formula, namely

<img src="Eqn8.tif"/></p>

<p>Having done that the Government says to the shareholder: We have taken out two shares already for the Government, and we will now tax you on your dividend as an individual. He therefore has to pay three times. In its report a gold mining company said recently that it paid 72 per cent of its profits to the Government. Then when the shareholder gets the remaining 28 per cent he has to pay tax on his dividends as the income of a private individual. I think this is grossly unfair. I want to make a simple suggestion. The Government should grant a lease and after the Government has taken its share under the lease a gold mining company should be taxed in the same way as any other company. The Government should establish its position when it grants a lease.</p>

<p>I should now like to say a few words about the formula itself. What I should like to say concerns a detail arising from what I have already said. I refer to section (1) (c) of the taxation proposal. The formula here is the formula I referred to. It appears on page 418 of the English copy of the Order Paper. The

<img src="Eqn9.tif"/></p>

<p>We all know that Y</p>

<p>is the share of the profits and X the ratio of profit to recovery expressed as a percentage. This is well-known to people familiar with taxation. That was the system adopted. There have been times when the Minister of Finance, when he is in financial difficulties, has changed the formula slightly. I could mention cases in the time of Mr. Havenga during the depression. I understand such cases. But the interesting thing is that two or three years ago the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor introduced a new formula. He did not introduce a new formula for all gold mines, but a new formula for gold mines established after a certain date. That is a fine state of affairs. You will see in paragraph (1) (d) that we have provision for &#x201C;mining for gold on any post-1966 gold mine&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The formula in this case is

<img src="Eqn10.tif"/></p>

<p>If you established your company in 1966 you are taxed under one formula, and if you established your company a month later in 1967, you are taxed under another formula. Surely this is the height of absurdity. You do not say <span class="col_6115-6116" refersTo="page_0262"/>to a company: If you were established this year you will be taxed in one way but if you were established the year before you will be taxed in a different way.</p>

<p>It must be established some time.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>But it is quite absurd. The situation is absurd. I do not know how we can put it right. In those days the hon. the Minister of Finance was very anxious to get more money invested in gold mining and he found that this was a good way of doing it. But in perpetuity that will be the tax for the mines. There will be a differential system of taxation, differentiating between one mine and another according to its date of birth; whether it was last year or this year. I now want to explain that if you take the mines established in 1967 or 1968, and as the hon. the Minister knows one is being established next month&#x2014; the lease has gone through and we expect a great deal from this mine&#x2014;such mines will be taxed under the formula <img src="Eqn11.tif"/>. This means that if the ratio of profit to recovery is 8 per cent, it will pay nothing; <img src="Eqn12.tif"/> divided by eight equals nothing. But if you take the same formula and apply it to another mine, namely <img src="Eqn13.tif"/> and they get 8 per cent, eight into 360 is 45 so that these people will pay 15 per cent. The whole matter is absurd. I therefore want to move the following amendment to paragraph (1) (c)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In paragraph (1) (c), to omit the formula and to substitute the following new formula:

<img src="Eqn14.tif"/></block>

<p>In other words, I want to tax the 1967 mine in the same way as the 1966 mine. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know for how many years the hon. member for Kensington has been proposing the customary change in the taxation on gold mining companies, but he has done so every year since I have been here. I am afraid that if the hon. member uses the same speech every year as he has done in the past few years he will not again be elected unopposed in Kensington at the next General Election.</p>

<p>What is strange in the hon. member&#x2019;s reasoning is that he only presents us with one side of the argument every time. He pleads every time that when the capital redemption has been discharged, the gold mine should be treated as an ordinary company. But this is a typically United Party approach and displays a typically United Party mentality in asking for benefits without accepting any risk. What other company&#x2014;with a few exceptions, exceptions of which the hon. member must be aware &#x2014;can write off its total capital investment and only become taxable when that original expenditure has been fully redeemed? Year after year they make the statement here that the State is a partner in the gold mining companies. I dispute this statement of course&#x2014;at any rate, the truth is not correctly reflected in the words used by the hon. member. But if it is so, surely it is justified, in the sense that the State allows that gold mining company to redeem its expenditure <i>in toto</i> before it makes that company liable to taxation. What the hon. member omitted to say, was that while other companies have had to carry a tax increase of from 30 to 36&#x2154; per cent from before 1966 to date, the tax on gold mines has remained constant since 1956. Thus, while the taxation of other commercial and industrial companies has been increased, that of the gold mines has remained constant. He also omitted to tell us that gold mines with a 6 per cent net income on turnover are not liable to taxation, that is to say, gold mines which were established before 1966, and that gold mines established after 1966 are not liable to taxation unless they have an 8 per cent net income on turnover. In addition the hon. member omitted to say that the burdens imposed upon an undertaking, whether it be a gold mining company or any other company, are to a certain extent calculated&#x2014;and should be&#x2014;to oblige these undertakings to increase their efficiency. Let me put the matter in this way: The easiest system of taxation is of course to have no taxation. If the hon. the Opposition is suggesting that we can govern this country without levying taxes, they must tell us so. But if one says that in a well-ordered and well-governed country such as South Africa taxes have to be levied and that for that purpose certain taxpayers have to be found, then I say that taxation compels the entrepreneur or the individual to increase his efficiency and productive capacity. And permit me to say that in this respect the gold mining industry has not disappointed South Africa. As a matter of fact, our gold mines are amongst the most efficient gold mining industries in the world. Only recently our gold mining industry introduced two new techniques, namely the so-called &#x201C;reef cutter&#x201D; and the so-called &#x201C;raise borer&#x201D;. Although these techniques are still being developed further, the gold mines have thereby succeeded in increasing the efficiency of the industry considerably.</p>

<p>I find it a peculiar state of affairs that when the United Party no longer finds it advisable to disparage and condemn present public servants,<span class="col_6117-6118" refersTo="page_0263"/> as we heard earlier on in this House, it now proceeds, in this case in the person of the hon. member for Kensington, to condemn past officials. This is the nature of the remarks made by the hon. member in connection with the mining engineers and others who are supposed to have designed the formula which he criticized so severely. To my mind this is becoming a strange tendency in the United Party, because we encounter it every time. I now want to ask the hon. member for Kensington whether the Chamber of Mines has ever asked for a tax concession to the gold mines along the lines advocated by the hon. member for Kensington year after year? Has the Chamber of Mines ever asked for that? A further question to the hon. member is: What is the object of his amendment and of his proposal? Surely it cannot be to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> Neither will it be to increase the tax liability of gold mines. This means that the amendment can only have one object, and that is to reduce the tax liability of gold mines. If this should be the case, who does the hon. member want to tax more heavily? Earlier in this debate we heard hon. members venting their spleen about the so-called &#x201C;bulge&#x201D; in the taxation curve. They want that &#x201C;bulge&#x201D; shifted; either downwards or upwards. One cannot flatten it. Any expenditure by the State must be financed by taxation and/or by loans. But now the hon. member and other hon. members on that side are asking for concessions year after year in respect of pensions, services and, in this case, tax liabilities. If the hon. member wants to suggest that the tax liability of the gold mining industry be reduced, whom does he want to tax additionally? With what does he want to finance the expenditure of the State? I have to conclude that these hon. members, who are continually saying that they are speaking on behalf of John Citizen, the general public, these days and who want to restore politics to a bread-and-butter basis, now want to tax the poor man more heavily, because hon. members on that side, among others the hon. member for Hillbrow, made earnest representations about the decrease in the productivity of the professional man and the man in the higher income group because their marginal rate of assessment was too high. In other words, the taxation of the man in the higher income group must be reduced. The hon. member for Kensington asks that the tax liability of the gold mines be reduced. If this must be so, who is to be taxed? Surely it must be the poor man, the man in the middle and lower income groups. Or would hon. members tell us in what respects we must curtail our expenditure so that we can then grant tax relief? I want to say that this formula, in respect of the gold mining industry is a very reasonable one. I want to say that the Chamber of Mines and those who risk their money in the gold mining industry have reaped rich rewards over the years, and are still doing so, as a result of this formula. I want to content myself with saying that in my opinion there is not the slightest reason for this formula to be changed in so far as it may entail liability to taxation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to thank the hon. member for his contribution, because he at least is giving some thought to the matter. But he seems to be living in the old days when they used to sling words across the floor of the House, the days of Hoggenheimer. Hoggenheimers to-day, if they are big companies, are not men who come from overseas to take the wealth of South Africa and then go away. Who owns the gold mines in South Africa to-day? The South African shareholders, directly and indirectly. One can get the lists of shareholdings from these companies. The control of the company is only a small percentage. South Africans invest their money directly or indirectly in gold-mining companies. How do they do it indirectly? They do it indirectly through finance holding companies and through mutual trusts.</p>

<p>Pension funds have moneys invested in these gold-mining companies. The old days of the cry of &#x201C;Hoggenheimer&#x201D; are gone; we are living in a different world to-day. Hon. members know that unfortunately to-day we have Afrikaner groups operating separately. We have an Afrikaner company to-day that is one of the Hoggenheimer big gold-mining groups and the I.D.C. is associated with them in other enterprises with Anglo-American, Johannesburg Consolidated Investments and Rand Mines; they are all working together. It is South African to-day, and my plea is for the South African shareholder who has money invested in these mines. It is the shareholder I am thinking of; why should he be overtaxed? The important point about what the hon. member has to say is that if we do not tax this way we shall have to tax another way. Surely you cannot justify taxing a 1966 company on a different basis from a 1967 company? We tried to tell the Minister of Finance of those days that he was on the wrong trail but it had no effect; he had made up his mind. Take the case of farmers. Would you say that the old man on the farm should be taxed differently from the young man commencing farming? It is quite absurd to suggest it. Well, that is the absurdity of these two scales. I am not talking of the small company with a profit of under R40,000; I am just talking about two companies of the same kind being taxed differently because of the period when they were established.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington will pardon me if I do not follow up what he said. I did not intend taking part in this debate, but I do want to reply to a few statements made by the hon. member for Hillbrow. Since I made my speech in this House on 2nd April, the hon. member for Hillbrow has now had two months to go a little more thoroughly into the things that I said. I must say that if this is his effort after <span class="col_6119-6120" refersTo="page_0264"/>two months, he will need a further two months and then he will still not arrive at the truth. Referring to the question of indirect taxation, he asked whether postal rates were not indirect taxation as well. The hon. member would do well to make a study of what indirect taxation is. To-day he has only&#x2014;he will pardon me if I say so&#x2014;proved his ignorance in regard to this matter. The main indirect taxation levied in other countries is the sales tax. The hon. member has travelled a great deal in the world and surely ought to have known this. This is one of the methods applied by older countries in order to obtain the revenue with which to cover their expenditure. Most of the older countries have the sales tax, and South Africa does not have it. One cannot compare direct taxation rates unless one also takes into account indirect taxation, because this is one of the main sources of revenue used by older countries to-day to cover their expenditure. How the hon. member can bring the question of postal rates into the matter is beyond me. In fact, if he should draw a comparison between our postal rates, which have nothing to do with indirect taxation, and those of other countries, he would come to the conclusion that our postal rates are of the lowest in the world.</p>

<p>The same applies to telephones; there is no difference. Let the hon. member bring us proof that our telephone calls are so expensive. He has no proof; he is simply making the statement without any proof.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member complained because I had mentioned 1947. I had drawn a comparison between the position in 1947 and the position in 1967. The hon. member said that 1947 was just after the war. Sir, this is the only argument which hon. members on that side advance here from time to time: &#x201C;We were at war.&#x201D; For every one reason which they mention for the fact that income-tax was high in those years, I can mention ten reasons why it is &#x201C;high&#x201D; to-day, although it is still lower than in 1947.</p>

<p>Do you know that our Defence expenditure this year is even higher than it was in 1947? What about social services; what about State expenditure to promote economic development and to bring about decentralization of industries? The hon. member cannot use the excuse that taxation was high in 1947 as a result of the war. That is no argument. For every one example which the hon. member mentions, we can mention many others in regard to why taxation ought actually to have been higher to-day than it was in 1947, and yet is lower. The hon. member says, in connection with the question of a comparison with other countries, that there is no sense in it. Yet it is very strange that hon. members on that side of the House come along here with comparisons morning, noon and night when it suits them, and in fact they drew comparisons here between South Africa and various other countries. The hon. member for Pinetown also did so, and I am not criticizing him for it. A comparison between South Africa and other countries is an important criterion, just as a comparison between the position to-day and the position in earlier years is also an important criterion.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have never said that there is nothing wrong with the pressure of taxation. Why would the hon. the Minister have appointed a commission of inquiry if he was satisfied that there was nothing wrong? I am one of those who at an early stage pleaded with the hon. the Minister for a commission of inquiry, and the hon. the Minister knows it. We do not say that everything is right, but we do say that if one takes into account the total amount in taxation which the State asks of the population, then it is a very low one; it is a small sacrifice which is asked of the population by comparison with the position in other countries. This is as plain as a pikestaff. But then hon. members on that side of the House come along, as the hon. member for Hillbrow also did here, and tell you morning, noon and night how high our taxation is. We do not deny that in certain instances it is higher than in other countries, but what is the effect on the whole? I again want to remind the hon. member what South Africa pays, as compared with other countries, as a percentage of its gross national revenue: South Africa, 17 per cent; Japan, 22 per cent; Switzerland, 24 per cent; the U.S.A., 29 per cent; Canada, 32 per cent; West Germany, 38 per cent; Sweden, 43 per cent; and France, 43 per cent. This side of the House says that there may be reasons why the pressure of our taxation should be changed here and there, but the accusation that the National Party Government is taxing the nation heavily, is untrue; it is untrue by comparison with other countries and it is untrue in relation to history and by comparison with the actions of the United Party itself.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that on our main arguments the Government side is supporting us. That has clearly emerged from the discussion here this afternoon. The mere fact that the Minister has appointed a commission of inquiry confirms that according to hon. members on that side all is not well with the taxation scheme as it exists at the present time.</p>

<p>The Government are not satisfied with the taxation system as we have it at present. We have asked for some years for a commission of inquiry. That is my answer to the hon. member for Sunny-side. We have asked for a commission of in<span class="col_6121-6122" refersTo="page_0265"/>for some years, and we are very glad that the Minister has appointed one. There is no member on the Government side who has said that the appointment of a commission of inquiry is not justified; in fact, they have confirmed that it is justified. Anybody who has had any experience at all of the taxation world, is aware of the consistent efforts in the higher income brackets to evolve tax avoidance schemes. As a result of the fact that the individual tax rate is so much higher than the company rate, you are finding that whole families are turning themselves into companies. Hon. members opposite can get hold of financial magazines and make comparisons between one country and another country until they are blue in the face, but the hard fact of the matter is that the rate of taxation above a certain level of income is killing incentive. It is all very well for hon. members opposite to say: &#x201C;You are pleading for the rich man and not for the poor man.&#x201D; Sir, what is a rich man and what is a poor man in this country to-day? What was regarded as poor a few years ago is sheer poverty to-day at the same rate of remuneration as the result of inflation over the years. What we are concerned about is that if we want development in this country we must not kill incentive. We want people who are in the best position to give leadership in this country and to continue to give leadership. Our country develops when we have people with outstanding ability who are concerned with making money, not getting money; there is a difference. There are many people who are just concerned with getting money and giving no service for it, but there are quite a number of people who are capable of making money by reason of their initiative, by reason of their brains and by reason of their drive, and they find that the load of taxation is such that it is killing initiative. That is one of the reasons why the Minister of finance, because of representations made to him, has at last heeded our request that there should be a commission of inquiry to go into the whole of our taxation system. We have asked for a commission for years and we are glad that the Minister has appointed one, but we still want to take this opportunity of reminding the Minister that this problem is an urgent one which concerns both sides of the House and which concerns the country as a whole. Until such time as these anomalies of taxation are ironed out, we will not get the initiative and the drive that is necessary in a young developing country such as ours.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is almost unnecessary for me to take part in this debate, except of course to make known the attitude I adopt in regard to the amendment introduced here by the hon. member for Kensington. I think we should be careful lest we lower the tenor of an important debate such as this one to the level of a school debating society by saying, &#x201C;Yes, we did ask for a commission and the Government appointed one, because it agrees with us and because it itself has misgivings; the fact that a commission was appointed, proves that our request was justified and that what we said in the past was correct, etc.&#x201D; With all due respect, this puts one in mind of the almost insignificant debating points made in a school debating society. Hon. members on that side of the House who participated in this debate this afternoon, attempted to bring to the fore once again those ideas which they had expressed before. Last year we had a thorough discussion here of these very same matters, and on that occasion I, acting on the instructions of the Minister, indicated to the Committee that a committee would be appointed to inquire into the fiscal and monetary policy of the country and to bring out a report in that regard. But I want hon. members to realize that committee was not merely appointed for the purpose of inquiring into income tax. Far from it. That was never the intention. In fact, that is merely one of the many forms of taxation we have in South Africa. Under the terms of reference given to that committee, it can inquire into any form of taxation levied in South Africa. It is for the committee to decide on what it is going to concentrate. I want to point out that in appointing this committee our major object and aim was that it should recommend a monetary and fiscal policy with a view to the stability and growth of South Africa. To a large extent the hon. member for Queenstown has already replied to the assertions made here by the hon. member for Pinetown as well as the hon. member for Hillbrow. I do not consider it to be necessary for me to go into them any further. The hon. member for Pinetown said, in the first instance, that our taxes were higher than those of most of the other countries of the world. Sir, I am not ashamed and afraid of making comparisons with other countries of the world, and, as a matter of fact, the hon. member for Queenstown has already done so. But to a certain extent the hon. member for Hillbrow is correct in saying that one cannot really compare South Africa with other countries. The reason for that is that South Africa&#x2019;s average productivity is so much lower than that of other countries of the world. The percentage of people who pay income tax in South Africa is so much lower than that of other countries of the world. Only 5 per cent of the population in South Africa pays income tax, whereas the figures in respect of Canada and Australia are 30 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Is that the White population?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is in respect of the total population, but our infrastructure is, of course, not designed merely for meeing the needs of the white population. It is for that reason that I say that it is difficult to make a comparison with other countries since such a small percentage of our population has to bear the tax burden, whereas in <span class="col_6123-6124" refersTo="page_0266"/>other countries a large percentage of the population shares that burden. But hon. members opposite make no mention of that when they want to pass criticism on conditions in South Africa. Well, I assume that it is the Opposition&#x2019;s right to pass criticism, but if that is the case, one simply feels that their criticism should be a little more substantial than was the case to-day. On 27th May, 1968, an article appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> which has only now been brought to my notice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An average &#x00A3;2,000 a year (R3,440) man in Britain, married with one child, a small car and a modest house which he is buying on mortgate, pays &#x00A3;875, or more than 43 per cent of his income directly or indirectly to the state.</block>

<p>I do not want to read any further, but hon. members opposite will nevertheless agree with me that a man in that income group in South Africa is indeed far better off than his counterpart in England is. I do not want to advance these arguments in order to say that our taxes must remain as they are, that they are sound and that they cannot be improved upon. That is not the argument. It is solely intended to rectify the impression those hon. members tried to convey to the outside world this afternoon.</p>

<p>Last year we also discussed the rapid increase in our effective rates of taxation. It is true that when one exceeds the R6,000 mark, there is a rapid increase in one&#x2019;s marginal rates, but this increase is in fact not such a terrible one as hon. members opposite maintain, except that I agree that every wage-earner in the home should basically be placed in a position which will enable him to subsist. That is why we must have, up to a certain stage, a tax burden which is such that the people will be left with enough to subsist. But hon. members will also agree with me that this is also the case in all the other countries of the world, i.e. that at a certain stage income-tax must start increasing more rapidly; at a certain stage the marginal rates must start increasing more rapidly in order that the person with a high income may be taxed more heavily. One cannot allow that rapid increase to continue, for then one would later on exceed the 100 per cent mark, and that is why the curve has to start running horizontally again at a certain notch so that this marginal tax increase may at least come to a stop at some stage or other. Be that as it may, I do not think it is necessary for me to argue about this matter any further. We have had an interesting discussion about this matter. We are all aware of the fact that a committee has been appointed to inquire into all the various forms of taxation in our country. To-day we merely discussed this matter, but we are all eagerly awaiting the report of this commission, and once we have it we can see how we can elaborate on the basis of that report.</p>

<p>With due respect to the hon. member for Kensington&#x2014;he and I may still have to argue on the same side this afternoon&#x2014;I think that to a certain extent he was perhaps joking this afternoon when he put forward this proposal. I do not think the hon. member is serious. After all, the hon. member is aware of the fact that the post-1966 gold mines were accommodated for a specific purpose.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<p>Why?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member is not aware of that, I suppose he failed to understand at the time what it was intended for. It is because the risk involved in the development of these developing mines is a greater one. The costs involved in the development are greater at present, and that is why a concession was made to the post-1966 mines; and that is why there is a difference between the pre-1966 mining formula and the post-1966 mining formula. The proposal the hon. member pur forward here will not really come to much. I suspect that most of the pre-1966 mines have already written off their capital, and in the light of all these circumstances I cannot give way to the amendment the hon. member introduced here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister this? Will he explain to me why Kloof and the new mine, East Driefontein, sponsored by the same mining house and the same people, namely West Wits, should be taxed differently?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is for the reason I mentioned a moment ago. As regards the post-1966 mines, when this formula was introduced the intention was to accommodate these mines in their process of development To place the pre-1966 mines on the favoured formula that applies to the post-1966 mines, would destroy the basis of the difference that was effected at the time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="moore">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>But Kloof is one of the developing mines, just as the other one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to suggest that this formula should always remain as it is at present. These formulas and the tax proposals are discussed in this House every year and they are amended from time to time. But as far as the amendment introduced by the hon. member for Kensington is concerned, it does not serve any purpose whatever and I cannot accept it. I think this is all I have to say at present.</p>

<p>From the outset the Minister has seen fit to entrust the new stamp duties to me, and hon, members will realize that it was a major task to revise the entire Stamp Duties Act, modernize it and submit a new Act. From the nature of the case we could in fact do it in no other way than to submit the increases in regard to stamp duties to this Committee in the form of tax proposals. In this way an entire series of changes have been made according to these proposals, which will subsequently be embodied in an act,. But now there are certain basic principles which we took into account when we considered these stamp duties. I think the most important of these is that since there is a stamp duty which is based on a monetary amount, or which is based on a transaction which is reflected in monetary value one realizes that over the years, with the increasing cost of farm properties, etc., and the attendant decrease in the value of money, we have already received the full benefit of stamp duties as a result of these increasing values. That is why there is not the same measure of justification for effecting an increase in stamp duties in cases of <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duties, but it is different in the other cases. There are numerous documents on which stamp duties are being paid which are not based on monetary values and which have remained unchanged from 1911 to the present. In those cases you will agree with me that it was desirable to effect a substantial increase in the stamp duties. Take, for example, a special procuration. All these years the stamp duty on such a document has been as little as 10 cents regardless of what amount was involved. For a general procuration it was 50 cents, but for a special procuration it was 10 cents, and we are now increasing it to 50 cents. I think hon. members will agree that, in view of the circumstances which prevailed in 1911 when the <span class="col_6137-6138" refersTo="page_0273"/>amount of stamp duty for a procuration was decided upon, an increase to 50 cents is justifiable to-day.</p>

<p>Then hon. members will see that no use whatsoever is being made of a half-cent, and we have now attempted to lay down a minimum of 2 cents in all cases. That is why you will find that in cases where the amount of 2 cents was previously payable, 5 cents is now payable. I should welcome it if hon. members would give an indication of whether or not they agree with the modernization of stamp duties in this respect.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the proposals are now before you, and there are certain of them in regard to which we have in the meantime effected further changes. You will see that in certain respects the stamp duties, as you have before you to-day, differ from those which appeared on the Order Paper immediately after the Budget speech made by the Minister of Finance. Now there are two of these items in respect of which I should like to introduce further amendments, and the first relates to mortgage bonds. The duty on bonds, as well as on transfers, are amongst those which are based on monetary value and in regard to which we have already in the past. I think, to a very large extent and perhaps to an adequate extent, derived all the benefit of the decreasing monetary values on the larger amounts which are involved here. When bonds were being considered we initially debated whether to simplify the formula, because I should like to explain that with the modernization of the Stamp Duties Act we did not only try to effect a realistic adjustment in stamp duties which would be in accordance with to-day&#x2019;s values, we also tried to simplify the formulas involved. The stamp duty on bonds has up to the present been 5 cents on R100 up to an amount of R1,000. From R1,000 to R2,000 it is at present still 7&#x00BD; cent. After that it is 12&#x00BD; cent from R2,000 to R4,000, and above R4,000 it is 25c per R100. Initially there was a proposal that it should be 25 cents throughout, and I must admit that I felt rather unhappy about that, and I subsequently reconsidered the entire question of bonds. I then came to the conclusion that we must try to find a new formula for bonds. The new formula which I then worked out for bonds is that we should try to simplify the position and that we should try to keep the bond stamp duties more or less as they are at present, but that we should retain the concession which we had for small bonds. That is why I should now like to propose that item 7 of the Stamp Duties be deleted and be replaced by what I am now going to submit. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>All that this amendment envisages is to lay down the following stamp duties: 10 cents per R100 up to R4,000; 20 cents per R100 from R4,000 to R6,000; and 25 cents per R100 above R6,000. The final outcome of this amendment will be that we will derive more or less the same income out of stamp duties as we have been receiving up to now. With this amendment we are trying to simplify the tariff structure a little. Previously there were four separate columns, i.e. from 5 cents per R100 to the maximum stamp duty of 25 cents per R100 above R4,000. Now we will begin with 10 cents per R100, and the maximum for stamp duties will only be found at R6,000. That means that the amount on which the maximum stamp duty is payable has also been increased somewhat. As I have said, this new scale will yield more or less the same income and at the same time the small bond holder is being accommodated. I think that in general this amendment ought to meet with approval.</p>

<p>In addition I also want to move an amendment in regard to stamp duties on transfer deeds. The history of stamp duties on transfers is a slightly longer one than that on mortgages. Prior to 1952 the stamp duty on transfers was 5s. per &#x00A3;100. In that year the stamp duty was increased to 25 cents per R100 up to and including R7,000, and when a transaction exceeded R7,000, it was 75 cents on the total amount. In 1960 the Minister granted another concession to the small transferee by laying down that the stamp duties on transfers up to and including R7,000 would remain as they had been before, i.e. 25 cents per R100 and that the stamp duty of 75 cents per R100 would only be levied on the amount by which R7,000 was exceeded. It was proposed that we should also round off these figures a little. Initially it was proposed that the 25 cents per R100 be increased to 40 cents per R100, and that the 75 cents per R100 be increased to 80 cents per R100&#x2014;in other words 40 cents per R100 up to R7,000, and 80 cents per R100 above that. In the proposals which are already before the Committee, hon. members will notice that provision is being made for a decrease to 30 cents per R100 for amounts up to R7,000. In addition I now want to move&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_6141-6142" refersTo="page_0275"/>We are therefore keeping the position as it was, i.e. 25 cents per R100 up to and including R7,000, and 75 cents per R100 above R7,000. I want to make it clear to the hon. gentlemen that as far as transfers are concerned the position remains exactly as it is at present. I am only including it in the tax proposals because the formulation thereof is now different. Previously it was based on &#x00A3;100&#x2014; now R200&#x2014;and in order to adapt it to the new system it is now being included in the taxation proposals, and the amounts are 25 cents per R100 on the first R7,000, and 75 cents per R100 after that. Therefore, the position as far as transfers are concerned remains unchanged. As I have already said, we are making a small adjustment to mortgages in order to simplify the formula, but the end result as far as the revenue of the State is concerned, will remain as it is at present. I hope and trust that this amendment will be a concession which will receive the support of hon. members.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are all pleased that the hon. the Deputy Minister has had second thoughts and has amended sections 7 and 21 of the proposals as they appear on the Order Paper. But we do not think these amendments alter the basic consideration of the proposals to any great extent. The Deputy Minister has not told us whether the fiscus is going to suffer to any extent by these changes. He said the fiscus would receive the same amount as before, but he has not told us what amounts he expects to collect as a result of the new proposals.</p>

<p>The first indication we had of these new proposals was in the Budget speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance, when he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the result of criticism that the provisions of the present Stamp Duties Act were involved and had become antiquated, my predecessor, the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, agreed to replace the Act with a modernized and simplified version. Financial and other institutions were asked by the Secretary for Inland Revenue to submit their views and suggestions. After due consideration of the comments submitted, a Stamp Duties Bill has been drafted and will be introduced during the present Session. The taxation proposals which I shall table give full details of the instruments which will become liable for duty as well as the rates at which duty will be calculated.</block>

<p>It is these rates we are now debating. If one analyses the statement of the Minister of Finance one finds this. Firstly, there was criticism that the existing Stamp Duties Act was involved and had become antiquated; secondly, the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges had agreed to replace the Act with a modernized and simplified version; thirdly, financial and other institutions were asked to submit their views and suggestions; fourthly, comments submitted were given due consideration. Unfortunately we have not seen the comments or suggestions submitted to the Minister of Finance, but I think there is one thing we can say with certainty. That is that the suggestions did not provide that the taxpayer would be required to pay an additional R6,500,000 per annum in a full year as a result of the proposals we have before us this afternoon, because that is the total effect of the proposals.</p>

<p>It is true the Minister has done away with the stamp duty on receipts and in terms of an amendment which the Minister tabled today to item 8 no stamp duty will be levied where marketable securities tax had been paid. We accept these two concessions. They, of course, are pertinent to the Bill really and not to Ways and Means. But the Minister has given with the left hand and taken back with the right hand and unfortunately for us his right hand is much more dexterous than his left hand. I say this because if one deducts from what he is going to take from us with his right hand what he is giving back to us with his left hand, one finds he has a surplus of R6&#x00BD; million in his pocket. This is what these proposals mean. What led to the criticism by interested parties was not the low rate of stamp duties; it was the fact that there were inconsistencies and difficulties in the context of the Act itself, not in the Schedules. What appears to have happened is that the Minister and the Deputy Minister, finding it was necessary to change the context of the main Act, decided they might as well get the benefit of changing the Schedules at the same time. But they got the benefit, not us, because every single item has been increased.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister told us that some of these rates have been in existence since 1911. This is quite true; many of them have. But what is the necessity or the wisdom of raising these rates at the present time? The Minister gives two reasons. First of all he says we must modernize and streamline our procedures. This is true, but it is a very strange thing that in the course of this modernization he has not found a single case, except as far as receipts are concerned, where that modernization is in favour of the public. In every single case this modernization is in favour of ‘the fiscus. All I can say is, if this is going to be the case throughout the civil service, then heaven save us from any further modernization! Because instead of benefiting us it is harmful to us. Surely the purpose of modernization is to improve things for the taxpayer, not to place further imposition upon him. Then the Deputy Minister says one of the reasons is that he has not used the <i>ad valorem</i> basis, in other words, it is for a service. I want the Deputy Minister to tell me where it costs the fiscus any more when I place a stamp on a power of attorney to-day than it did ten or 20 years ago. Yet he says that where previously one paid ten cents on <span class="col_6143-6144" refersTo="page_0276"/>a special power of attorney, now one must pay 50 cents. What additional cost am I now bearing that the fiscus has incurred? This is what the Deputy Minister says. It may be that in some cases where a service is rendered there may be excesses, but there are dozens of instances where this is not so.</p>

<p>Surely this is not the time for the Government to ask from the public additional funds. The Deputy Minister in his budget showed a surplus of R5.1 million, and he expects from the increases in stamp duties this year an amount of R3.2 million, so even if we do not increase these stamp duties he is still going to have a surplus. So what is the point in asking the public to pay more when the Minister of Finance has R180 million that he does not know what to do with. He has a surplus for the year he does not need, and yet he says to the public, &#x201C;Please pay more.&#x201D; I am very glad the Minister brought in his amendments this afternoon because we were going to take the Government very seriously to task for imposing on the small man. But all these new amendments have taken from the small man, the impositions which were originally proposed. There is still one which the Deputy Minister has not removed, and that is the extra half-cent on cheques. I do not think it does the Minister justice to come to this House and say, &#x201C;We round off our figures; we do not want to deal in half-cents.&#x201D; We will find occasion to bring this to the notice of the hon. the Deputy Minister again, I am quite sure. The hon. the Minister gave me this indirect answer in advance. 	He said the reason why the stamp duty on cheques has been increased from 1&#x00BD; cents to 2 cents is because they do not like dealing in 1&#x00BD; cents. But this is an imposition on the small man and the small woman. We are not concerned about the big businesses who undoubtedly issue a large number of cheques; we are concerned with the small man who runs a bank account, whose money is invested with a local bank free of interest, which money in the normal course of events flows into commerce and industry in this country. These are the people who are now going to be penalized by an extra half cent on every single cheque form which they issue. As I say, the hon. the Minister has dealt with most of the issues. But there is one left, namely the question of share transfers. The hon. the Minister has perhaps been reasonably mild in his suggestions regarding other matters, but here he is asking for an increase of 1,000 per cent. The present Act provides that one must pay 5 cents per R200 to transfer a share. Now the hon. the Minister wants from us 50 cents per R100. I can see no justification at all for this specific item, any more than I can see for all the items that appear in this &#x201C;Ways and Means&#x201D; proposal, and therefore we shall vote against these proposals.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with great attention and interest because I very much want to know what the reaction of the hon. member for Parktown would be to these proposals. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister, as the hon. member does, that we welcome very much his proposal that items nos. 7 and 22 be changed. It is true that, particularly in our small country towns, we have pensioners who purchase small houses and take bonds which seem very small to us who live in the cities. But nevertheless these are actual figures and actual transactions which are taking place in certain sections of our country and amongst certain income groups in our country. That is why I should like to say that in fact we welcome this very much.</p>

<p>In addition I listened very carefully to what the hon. member for Parktown had to say. The hon. member is not opposed to the simplification, shall we say the polishing up and renovation of the Act as such, and the attendant scales. It seems to me he welcomes these as well. I heard him raise only one real point of criticism, i.e. he said that we should not take more money out of these people&#x2019;s pockets nor should we do so in this way. But now I do want to say to him that I am under the impression that a part of the proposals before us are proposals which the United Party has been advocating very strongly over the years. I call to mind that the hon. member for Kensington has risen to his feet in this House year after year and said: &#x201C;Look, it is not right that if people negotiate share transactions they should do it outside the Stock Exchange. They ought to go to the Stock Exchange and to a broker&#x201D;. That has been the attitude which the hon. member has consistently adopted here in this House. I do not think the Opposition can raise any objections to-day if requests such as those made by the hon. member for Kensington and by the Stock Exchange, which is a very important institution in our country, are acceeded to. That is what is happening. People who previously concluded large-scale share transactions outside the Stock Exchange, transactions which involved millions of rand, and who only paid the registration fee&#x2014;I think it was 10 cents&#x2014;now have to pay 50 cents. In reality it will, in terms of these new proposals, still be only half of what has to be paid if people purchase shares on the Stock Exchange through a registered stockbroker, practising on the Stock Exchange. I do not think there can be any objection to that. If I understand the proposals correctly, it now costs two amounts of 50 cents each, that is to say a total of R1, if one purchases shares on the Stock Exchange, i e. for the broker&#x2019;s note of the seller plus the marketable securities tax, as well as that of the seller.</p>

<p>That is a total of R1. This is what it is, according to my information. It was R1.10 under the old provisions, which we are now replacing. I think that is the reply which I want to give the hon. mem<span class="col_6145-6146" refersTo="page_0277"/>for Parktown, since he stated that nowhere else was it cheaper; unless I am not understanding this matter correctly now. I concede that these matters are complicated, but I think that where it previously cost the buyer and the seller 110 cents, it will now only cost R1&#x2026;</p>

The increase which has been introduced is, however, as I have said an increase to which the Opposition can make no objection, and it is in cases where one negotiates share transactions outside the Stock Exchange. There the buyer must now pay 50 cents instead of 10 cents upon registration. That is the one aspect.</p>

<p>The other matter I would like to raise is the following. The hon. member also said: &#x201C;Every single item has been increased&#x201D;. But that is not as I understand the matter. There are many items which remain the same, which are not being increased. If my figures are correct&#x2026;</p>

<p>Is there any decrease?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>No, but all I am talking about now is that the hon. member said that there was not a single item which had not been increased. I maintain that there are many here which have remained the same. That is what I am asserting. There are a good many which have remained unchanged. Take the following example. The levy on a sworn statement has been 10 cents since 1911. It is now being increased to 20 cents. That really does not seem too unfair to me. For example, the levy on bills of exchange and promisory notes is only one amount now, namely 5 cents per R100. This is merely the amount which bills of exchange, in contrast to bills of demand, always were. Only bills of demand were always 1&#x00BD; cents.</p>

<p>I want to mention two other reasons here to the hon. member for Parktown as to why we are now going to obtain more money out of these proposals. It seems to me that the hon. member for Simonstown might be going to speak. The one is for example that it was possible for a company, which perhaps owned an entire fleet of motor cars or motor trucks &#x2014;it could have had 8, 10 or 100&#x2014;to have them insured under one third party policy. Under that provision it only paid 10 cents stamp duty per policy. Now we are changing it so that the amount is payable per vehicle. To my mind that seems quite fair. This will of course make available a large amount of money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<p>Why increase it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now wants to tell me that if a man has 100 vehicles in his business undertaking, he should only pay 10 cents for his third party policy stamp which is the same as the man who only has one motor car and who uses it to drive to work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Why are you not reducing the levy on the man who has only one motor car?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I find it interesting that the hon. member seems to think that, if one has 10, 100 or 800 motor cars&#x2014;I think there is an organization in South Africa which has 800&#x2014;one should only pay 10 cents on the third party insurance. Then one should abolish the 10 cents which the hon. member for Yeoville and myself pay, and then one would still be doing something which is fair. I do not think the hon. member can assert that this will be a fair solution.</p>

<p>But there is another item here, i.e. item no. 20, in regard to security. Previously this was evaded. One simply omitted to specify the amount of the suretyship, and then one paid the minimum amount, which was 5 cents. But now a provision is being inserted which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where such instrument secures the payment of any money debt and the amount secured is not stated in such instrument&#x2026;</block>

<p>An amount of R10 is payable. That does not seem too unfair to me. Then there is another one here in regard to the registration of a company. A company is registered with a nominal share capital. Previously it paid almost nothing, and now the company also has to pay a certain minimum amount. I think it is also R10. Surely one establishes a company with a purpose, and if one deems it worthwhile establishing a company, I think one ought to be prepared to pay this R10 stamp duty on the deed. That is my reply to the hon. member. I do not think that the amounts indicated here are in any way unfair. I think the hon. members on the opposite side will have to rise and mention the specific item which they think is unfair if they really want us to argue this matter. They must prove their statements. We can no longer retain the figures on the 1911 scales. These are normal changes which have become necessary with the passage of time. They comply with the new demands and circumstances of the economic situation in which we find ourselves to-day.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think that we should accede to the request of the hon. member because we would be setting a very bad example. When we dealt with certain items of detail the hon. the Deputy Minister used some unfortunate words. On reflection I think he regrets using those <span class="col_6147-6148" refersTo="page_0278"/>words. He suggested that we were dealing with the matter in a school debating society manner. I do not think that it became the hon. the Minister to make those remarks. If we are to accept the views of the hon. member for Queenstown and consider the matter item by item, we will do it in a schoolboy debating society manner. I suggest that is not what the hon. the Minister wants. The main charge made by the hon. member for Parktown was that this was taking another R6 million out of the pockets of the taxpayer. Once you consider the matter item by item you must consider all the pros and cons. We could be here all day considering each item separately. The main charge of the hon. member for Parktown was that the Government was taking another R6 million out of the pockets of the taxpayer and that it was not justified. But seeing that the hon. the Deputy Minister is in a critical mood to-day might I suggest to him that when he introduces items of this kind and changes his mind at the last moment he should give us more adequate notice than he has given. He has had these items on the Order Paper for several weeks. We are grateful to the Minister for giving us a list yesterday afternoon to consider overnight. Now while the hon. the Minister has been talking this afternoon messengers have been bustling around the House giving us his latest ideas. I submit that is not the way for an aspiring Minister to treat this House. He should put them on the Order Paper in the proper way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it easy to understand why the hon. member for Pinetown is so bitter now. It is because the hon. the Deputy Minister has, with his proposals in this House to-day, taken the wind out of the sails of the hon. members on that side. They thought that they would be able to blow up this question of the stamp duties on bonds, and on the other item which has been decreased, i.e. deeds of transport, and go to the general public with these things again as the champion of the small man. Now they have come off second best. The hon. the Deputy Minister will most probably deal with the hon. member for Pinetown. I just want to return to two aspects which were raised by the hon. member for Parktown. He began his speech very well by repeating the speech made by the hon. the Minister in respect of stamp duties word for word. I sat listening tensely waiting for him to read out a very revealing and important section, namely where the hon. the Minister stated that: &#x201C;Hon. members will ascertain with pleasure that the stamp duty on ordinary receipts will be abolished entirely.&#x201D; This is a very sound and productive concession which is being envisaged. I expected the hon. member for Pinetown to refer to that, because here the Treasury is not only surrendering revenue, it is also saving manpower in that it is now eliminating the necessity to affix stamps to receipts.</p>

<p>Order! Would the hon. member please give me the reference to the item in the Schedule which he is now discussing?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I accept your ruling. I return immediately to item 5 (1) in respect of which the hon. member for Parktown objected strongly to the increase of .5c stamp duty which is being levied on a cheque. Now I just want to point out that when decimalization was in progress two pennies, or 16&#x2154; per cent of the then valid monetary unit, namely one shilling which consisted of 12 pennies, was the valid stamp duty on a cheque. With decimalization the point of departure was apparently, and this was an excellent point of departure, that decimalization as such was not to be used to make money for the Treasury. Consequently the stamp duty on cheques was decreased to 1&#x00BD;c, namely 15 per cent of the at present valid monetary unit of 10c. It was therefore a decrease in the stamp duty at that juncture of 1&#x2154; per cent. Since an increase of a &#x00BD;c per cheque is now being announced, it is in my opinion a valid and an easily justifiable increase, because previously there had been a decrease, and because the increase must not be seen as an increase of one-third on the valid monetary unit, but an increase, seen in its entirety, of 3&#x2153; per cent, or in fact one-fifth of what it was before decimalization. Consequently I do not find it easy to understand the reasoning of the hon. member for Parktown.</p>

<p>There is another aspect in regard to which the hon. member for Parktown expressed vehement criticism, i.e. the increased stamp duty in respect of share transfers. What other person purchases shares but that man who can afford shares transactions, who can afford the risk attached to that, and who, according to his judgment, because he would not otherwise buy them, is going to make a profit out of it? Does the hon. member for Parktown <span class="col_6149-6150" refersTo="page_0279"/>deny that the transactions on the share market in Johannesburg have increased tremendously, from R164 million during the last three months of 1967 to R285 million in the first three months of the current year? If the public of South Africa and the public outside South Africa want to negotiate share transactions, then to say that the increase is something which has been valid for many years is not an argument which can be put forward here as a reason why share transfers should not be taxed more heavily. As regards the argument of both the hon. member for Pinetown and the hon. member for Parktown that an additional amount of R6.5 million is being taken from the pockets of the public, I should like to know how the hon. members derived at that figure. I should like them to demonstrate to this Committee what their source in that regard is, because the impression we have at present is that the new stamp duties will not entail that type of additional advantage. At the same time I want to argue that if additional funds can be acquired for the Treasury by means of simplification and modernization, in regard to which there is apparent unanimity, then no objection can be made to that. In point of fact, we have a surplus of funds and if an alteration of the stamp duty will facilitate this state of affairs for the State, why should it not take place?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I am surprised at the callous approach of the hon. member for Wonderboom to what he admits is a 20 per cent rise in the cost of a cheque in comparison with its cost at the time of decimalization. I think that just shows the trend of thought of Government members in regard to any form of increased taxation. Sir, I do not regard a cheque book as being a luxury. I think the average person in the middle income group possesses a cheque book, and it seems to me that he is being penalized in every phase of our financial life. Sir, do you know that the cost of a cheque book containing 20 forms is 40 cents at the moment, and the cost of 50 is R1.00. I admit that the existing stamp duty is low at 1&#x00BD; cents but I do not think it is necessary to increase it to 2 cents. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with me that the consequence of this step will be that the cheque book user will use cheques less often? Is that what he wants? Secondly, the cheque book user is going to transfer his account to a savings account either at a savings bank or with building societies. Is that what he wants?</p>

<p>Then there will be a further consequence. The banks have already been hard hit by the credit squeeze and by various ceilings which have been put on their activities. They will pass on the increased stamp duty of &#x00BD; cent per cheque to their customers. That, in turn, has an accumulative effect on the general pattern of the spiralling cost of living. It seems to me that Government members are filled with equanimity whenever there is an increase in taxation. There has recently been an increase in motorcar licence fees; there has been an increase in rail-fares, there has been an increase in telephone charges and now there is an increase in stamp duty. All this fills them with equanimity&#x2014;but not the man in the street!</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I thought that hon. members would accord these proposals a far greater welcome than they did this afternoon. I am rather disappointed since I came forward myself with concessions in respect of stamp duties on bonds and deeds of transfer. I just want to point out to the hon. member for Pinetown that this concession on deeds of transfer alone will mean a loss of R300,000 in revenue, and that it will mean a loss in respect of bonds of R 150,000. The hon. member could at least have subtracted that amount when he made that calculation here a moment ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me dwell for a moment on the increased stamp duties on cheques, in regard to which hon. members on that side kicked up such a fuss here. The hon. member for Pinetown stated that he did not want to argue about details, because I would then have said that we would be bringing the level of the debate down to that of a school debating society. Sir, we can argue about details here, because we can achieve something here by doing that. Earlier this afternoon we were not dealing with a matter in regard to which we thought that we could achieve something. As far as this matter is concerned, we can in fact achieve something, and that is why I expect hon. members to stand up here and state: &#x201C;See here, previously the stamp duty on a sworn statement was 10 cents, and it is now being increased to 20 cents; this is unrealistic; it does not take into account the changed values of our money.&#x201D; If they had put forward arguments like that, their arguments would have <span class="col_6151-6152" refersTo="page_0280"/>had some value, but they did not come forward with arguments like that. There are many examples I can mention in this regard. Let us start with the stamp duty on cheques. In general hon. members on that side objected to the fact that the stamp duty on cheques is being increased by a half cent. I want to say to the hon. member for Simonstown that the increased stamp duty will of course be paid by the man who writes out the cheque. It is not the banks which are going to pay it. Hon. members must remember that we have already done away with the stamp duty on receipts. This concession entails a loss of more than R1 million in revenue. Who are the people who are going to be affected? If the hon. member is pleading for the man in the street then I want to tell him that a very large percentage of these people do not have cheque book accounts. The people who use cheque books are the large businessmen which we have now accommodated by doing away with the stamp duty on receipts. They are the people who write out hundreds and thousands of cheques. Take my own case as an example. I think that I can be regarded as a reasonably average case. I would say that for my domestic requirements I write out at the most perhaps 200 or 300 cheques per year, or perhaps not even so many.</p>

<p>This item will therefore cost me an additional R1 per year. I want to ask the hon. member to go into the history of the stamp duty on cheques a little. In 1911 the stamp duty on a cheque was one penny; we are now making it two cents.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall now explain the history further to the hon. member. I am now asking the hon. member again: If he has no quarrel with me when I increase the stamp duty on sworn statements from 10 to 20 cents, for reasons which hon. members are themselves aware of, then surely they can put no argument forward as to why, if we want to be realistic, we should not increase the stamp duty on cheques from one penny in 1911 to two cents to-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>It is unnecessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We are dealing here with the modernization of our stamp duties; but the purpose is not merely to simplify the system; the purpose is also to obtain a uniform pattern throughout. I think it would also be realistic to obtain more or less the same pattern as we had in 1911, in other words that we accept the 1911 pattern as being a good basis. I am not saying that it necessarily is a good basis. Errors could have crept into the provisions of the Stamp Act in 1911. But if we want to remain more or less realistic on the 1911 basis and we find that our income from transfers and our income from other <i>ad valorem</i> stamp duties has increased tremendously, then I want to know why the other man who is paying a stamp duty on a document which is not based on monetary value should get off scot free; why should he not pay a little more as well? The modernization of our stamp duties entails that stamp duties, which owing to circumstances have not been increased, should be increased and that the troublesome incidents in respect of stamp duties on receipts for example should be rectified. The abolition of stamp duties on receipts is meeting with great approval because it is inconvenient to have to affix a one-cent or two-cent stamp to each receipt which is made out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville asked me to delve a little deeper into the history of the stamp duty on cheques. In 1911 the stamp duty on a cheque was one penny. From 1931 until decimalization in 1961, it was two pennies. We did not want to make it 1&#x2154; cents, which is more or less the value of two pennies, and we consequently made it 1&#x00BD; cents. In 1961 therefore, as a result of decimalization, we effected a decrease in the stamp duties in cheques. We would not want to work with &#x00BD;-cent units. Hon. members are laughing, but I should like to hear their serious opinion in this regard, because this Stamp Duty Act which we are now placing on the Statute Book is something which we would like to keep for many years, and we must not make a political issue out of the matter. Let us be honest, and try to determine what stamp duties should be placed on certain documents. Let us put forward proper and fundamental arguments in this regard. We now have an opportunity of doing so, and I want to invite hon. gentlemen to do so. I feel that the increases which we are introducing here are realistic; they are not unsuitable, and in the light of all the circumstances I would have expected hon. members to welcome them.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to say something else in regard to the stamp duties on the transfer of shares. The hon. member for Parktown stated that we had increased it 1,000 per cent. I was surprised that the hon. member for Kensington did not discuss that matter. I was waiting <span class="col_6153-6154" refersTo="page_0281"/>for him to speak because I think that he is on my side. He has been advocating this for many years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to let you down gently.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member has let me down this afternoon. I waited for the hon. member to speak because he has been advocating this for many years. He told us&#x2014;I am now returning to the hon. member for Parktown&#x2014;that it was the small man who undertook his business through stockbrokers. The small man has up to now paid 110 cents on a transaction of R100. The seller and the buyer have each paid 50 cents, and on each of the broker&#x2019;s notes there was a 5 cent stamp duty. Over and above that the buyer still had to pay a 5 cents stamp duty on a transaction of R100 for registration purposes, for the transfer of his shares.</p>

<p>That is what the small man paid, but the big man, whom the hon. member for Kensington told us about, does business in hundreds of thousands, and millions, but he does not go through the brokers, and what does he pay? He pays only 5 cents on a transaction of R100. I think that we should ask ourselves on what this tax is based. If I were to analyse it I would say that it is based on the fact that a change has taken place in the proprietary right of shares, and that it is on this basis that the tax is being paid. If one accepts that is the basis on which the tax has to be paid, then hon. members must in point of fact tell me that whereas we are now imposing a tax of R1 on a transaction of R100 which goes through the broker, we should also upon registration, charge R1 on a transaction of R100 which does not go through a broker. Is that not correct? Surely that is correct. If the basis of the tax is that a change takes place in the proprietary right of the share, then I ought to-day to impose a stamp duty of R1 on the transaction of R100 for the registration in cases where the transaction does not go through a broker. But in contrast to that we are only imposing a stamp duty of 50 cents. I think this is quite correct. Why should the big people get off scot free, whereas the small man has to pay the tax because he is compelled to go through the brokers and through the Stock Exchange? No, I do not think the hon. member for Parktown had any argument in this respect. We have given this tax our careful attention. I want to admit candidly that it is a difficult and complicated matter. I should like to see that we investigate the matter further during the course of the year. We now have something on which we can work for the time being, but I would like to see that we investigate this matter further, and take all the different arguments and aspects into consideration to see whether the stamp duty should not in both cases be precisely the same. According to these new proposals the stamp duties on transactions which do not go through the broker will only be half as much as the stamp duties in the case of transactions which do in fact go through the brokers. I think that we are being reasonably realistic. Of course this is not a case where one can say &#x201C;Twice two is four and twice four is eight&#x201D;. One must, as far as possible, be realistic in regard to stamp duties, but I think that we have made an honest attempt, and that we have achieved a good measure of success.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was speaking about the weed hakea. I mentioned that it belonged to the protea family and that it was therefore very difficult to eradicate it. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services is taking this matter very seriously. They have gone as far as sending people to Australia to do research in connection with this weed. Unfortunately it is difficult to import parasites or fungi to destroy it, because they would also attack our proteas. Moreover, such biological methods of control are long-term projects and at this stage the Department cannot give any assurance that these methods of eradication will be successful. In the meantime, therefore, we have to continue eradicating the weed by mechanical means, but unfortunately this is a very expensive process. It costs from R40 to R60 per morgen to eradicate the weed where its growth is dense, and therefore it is very necessary that more money be made available by the Department of Forestry for this purpose. Of the 100,000 morgen contaminated, the greater portion is State-owned land, and therefore more ought to be done by the Department to eradicate it. I just want to mention in passing that magnificent work has been done in the Western Cape by the Land Service Movement in clearing the mountains near Stellenbosch of this weed. In the Outeniqua Mountains and the Tsitsikama Mountains, however, this weed is still rife and something will have to be done there. The farmers are experiencing difficulties as a result of the fact that State-owned land is infested with this weed. They clear their lands of it, but then the south-east wind comes across the mountains and blows the seed over their lands, and then they have to begin clearing all over again. I therefore want to make an appeal to the Minister of Forestry that he should see to it that the State will also do is duty in clearing its land and in preventing this weed from spreading any further. The farmers also need financial assistance for this, but that does not belong under this Vote, and at this stage, therefore, I only want to ask that the State-owned lands be cleared of this weed.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we on this side of the House will support the hon. member for Humansdorp in his plea for assistance from the hon. the Minister and his Department in the eradication of hakea. The hon. member also spoke about the great advances in forestry, and he mentioned the annual report of the Department and the enterprises undertaken by this Department, but I want to talk to the Minister this afternoon more about the private sector.</p>

<p>The question of financial assistance to help the smaller growers to plant trees is still a very vexed one. Many areas of South Africa are unsuitable for other types of agriculture, but are suitable for afforestation, yet those areas remain unplanted. The inability of timber planters to obtain loans at low rates of interest over long periods is one of the reasons and perhaps the most important reason why those areas have remained unplanted. Yet we find that similar loans are available in respect of other types of farming. The hon. member for South Coast mentioned the wattle industry. I am sure the Minister knows that the wattle industry is in the doldrums and that rationalization has brought about the position where many planters of wattle have found that they now have to eradicate upwards of 50 per cent of what they already have established. This is a most costly business. It is not only the felling and the stumping, but it is the eradication of the &#x201C;opslag&#x201D; which continues for years and years. Because of this, the land which has been planted to wattle is not always suitable for other agricultural crops. It has been found that the easiest way to utilize land that has been under wattle is to plant some other type of timber. But this is an expensive business and very many farmers find that they cannot afford to lay out a large amount of money for which they will get no return for eight, ten or 15 years, depending on what they plant, so much so that you will find that at the recent congress of the S.A. Timber Growers&#x2019; Association a motion was discussed urging that some form of low-interest loans over long terms should be made available to timber growers. This Minister, I submit, in the interests of the timber industry and of South Africa generally&#x2014;because, make no mistake, this is becoming big business here&#x2014;should bring his influence to bear on his colleagues and try to obtain some form of financial assistance for the small timber grower. I know this question was raised during this debate last year, but unfortunately at the conclusion of the debate the hon. the Minister rather begged the question although it was obvious that he was sympathetic to the growers. He advised the Committee that he had appointed a committee which was investigating this very point. He went on to say that its report would be submitted in due course and he realized that this was something which needed the attention not only of himself but of his Department. I want to ask the Minister whether this committee has reported and, if he has received the <span class="col_6159-6160" refersTo="page_0284"/>report, will it be tabled in this House, and if so, when will it be tabled? Has the Minister been able to make some headway? Perhaps he can tell us to-day that some financial assistance for small growers will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>I have been trying to find some statistics and information on the timber industry in this country, and I found it most difficult to get any up-to-date statistics. The annual report of the Department is a very good report, but unfortunately it only reports on Government activities and not on what is happening in the private sector. Nowhere in that report is there any mention of acreages under timber, the production of timber and things like that, statistics which are vital to this industry if it is to continue. It is obvious from what I have been able to find that this is a rapidly expanding business. The volume of cut timber, for instance, in 1961 was only 8.3 million cubic feet, and in 1966 it was estimated at 20 million cubic feet. I believe it has nearly doubled since then, but unfortunately we cannot get the statistics. I want to urge the hon. the Minister to do something about this and to get statistics, particularly accurate and up-to-date statistics, from which projections can be made into the future. Timber growing is a long-term business and it not only affects the grower himself but also the consumer, the industrialist who uses timber products. This is one of the reasons why the industrialist is becoming a planter who is competing with the farming industry. He must have continuity of supply and the dearth of statistics in this country has put him in the position where he does not know whether he will have continuity of supply, and therefore he has had to resort to planting his own timber so as to be sure that he will have something in the future.</p>

<p>The annual report of the S.A. Timber Growers&#x2019; Association shows that from the point of view of the planter the timber industry is growing in all spheres. It shows that some sectors have reached the stage where there is actually over-production. Either the Association or the Minister and his Department, or both in collaboration, must now look for further markets, and particularly must they look for export markets, or for ways of encouraging further consumption in this country. I think particularly of sawlogs. I believe that the production of sawlogs in South Africa to-day has come to the point where we no longer need to import any building timber at all. This, together with the improved techniques of processing, finger-jointing and glue-laminating, have put us in the position at the moment where we do not need to import any building timber at all. The anti-inflationary measures, I believe, have affected the building industry, and similarly the sawlogging industry has been affected to the extent that to-day they are faced with an over-production. I want to urge the Minister to see whether he cannot look for other markets. It has been suggested that South West Africa, Rhodesia, Malawi, Botswana and Lesotho are potential export markets for this particular sector of the industry, and I want to urge the hon. the Minister to look into that matter and to assist us.</p>

<p>We find that at the same time in the pulpwood sector the report shows that the production of pine for pulping exceeds the demand, so that once again we must look either for further uses for this product in South Africa or for export markets. But we find that hardwood pulps are still in short supply. In fact, two of our own local industries have guaranteed to the producers very much increased quotas which they will take in, if they can be produced locally. We find that the supply of poplar, notwithstanding the fact that the match factories are no longer using wood for their match-boxes but have turned to cardboard, still falls short. We find that the production of treated timber for droppers, fence posts, electric light poles, telephone poles, etc., is exceeding the demand. I am pointing these things out to the Minister to show that statistics in regard to these matters are needed, not only statistics of what can be produced to-day but what can be produced over a period ahead, based on what is planted already, so that not only the industrialists but the planters themselves can be guided in various spheres, for example rather to plant poplars than logwood. Estimates can only be based on accurate data and statistics, and I submit that it is the duty of the Minister and his Department to gather those statistics.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the previous speaker dealt mainly with the role of the private sector. I do not want to touch on all the points which he mentioned, and mentioned convincingly, but I want to draw his attention to the fact that the report of the commission of enquiry into private forestry in South Africa is very enlightening. I am not sure whether he is awaiting this report or the report of the committee which is recommended. He referred to the question of financing. On page 53 of the commission&#x2019;s report they make certain recommendations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>That is only a technical point. I think hon. members can acquaint themselves with the position and see that progress is in fact being made, that work is being done. It is so opportunistic to ask for something when one knows that it is just round the corner in any case, because then it seems as though one has served as a stimulus for the release of the report or for the work which is done. I do not want to dwell on this any longer.</p>

<p>I now want to exchange a few ideas about the question of marketing and so forth. I should like to consider forestry in South Africa as a whole. In terms of my approach I am very enthusiastic and I feel very happy about the development of this industry. It is true <span class="col_6161-6162" refersTo="page_0285"/>that there are certain bottle-necks, but if we think back to what the position was 40 or 50 years ago, then I venture to suggest that the development of forestry in this country symbolizes the development of the country as a whole. We who saw how the people, led by the Department of Forestry, planted trees in the high rainfall areas by the sweat of their brows, we who saw those trees grow, and who to-day look upon those beautiful forests from the Cape right up to the Soutpansberg mountain range can only feel proud of the work that has been done. We are aware of the part which the Department of Forestry played in that regard and which it also played subsequently by providing the private sector with information and assisting it in various ways to allow forestry in this country to come into its own.</p>

<p>As a result we have the position to-day that forestry is making a valuable contribution in the economic sphere in respect of the national revenue, and in providing employment in various fields. Not only does the industry have great economic value, but it also has a tourist value. I mentioned how one could see the beautiful forests from the Cape up to the Soutpansberg mountain range, and along the southern and eastern mountain ranges of our country. I think that these beautiful forests play a large role in making our beautiful natural scenery even more vivid and in increasing and promoting the benefits which this holds for us. It is therefore a good tourist attraction. In the Eastern Transvaal in particular one can see the enormous forest plantations.</p>

<p>I think that we should go further in expressing our appreciation here. In the previous annual report of the Department it was envisaged that it would take quite some time before the Forest Act could be revised and consolidated. I am glad that the matter has already progressed so far that it can probably be disposed of this year. I want to congratulate the Department sincerely. I think this is a milestone which will mean a great deal to forestry in the future. There is perhaps one aspect which has been overlooked, i.e. that of the small producer. I hope that the question of financing will, in fact, receive further attention and that we shall be able to meet this need to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Another point which is very important is the question of the utilization of our forests. This is something which I find very interesting, and the previous speaker also referred to it. If we look at the report of the Timber Growers&#x2019; Association and at other reports, <i>inter alia,</i> that of the S.A.B.S., then we notice that while in 1948 only 15 per cent of our construction timber was grown locally, we are now obtaining as much as 80 per cent of our construction timber from our own forests. I think this is an exceptional achievement. However, there is a shortcoming in this connection, and that is that last year only one half of this timber carried the mark of the S.A.B.S. This is nevertheless an improvement on the previous position. In 1960, 600,000 cubic feet of timber carried the mark of the Bureau, while in 1967, 4.5 million cubic feet of timber carried this mark. This is indeed a very great improvement, and now that the Act has made it compulsory for sawmills to make use of the mark of the Bureau and since standardization is to come, I definitely feel that we are making very good progress. The use of finger joints and laminated wood has of course contributed to the greater use of wood.</p>

<p>I also want to touch on the question of paper. Last year it was carefully estimated that 350,000 tons of paper were already being produced locally and that this represented an exchange saving of R50 million. There is a rapid increase in the rate of production and use. All these things are very encouraging signs to us and indicate that the Department of Forestry and the private sector are co-operating well. The liaison and the co-operation between these two organizations have already reached a particularly high level and I feel that we can be particularly proud of it.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that there are marketing problems and that we should begin to think about exporting. I foresee that in these fields we are going to experience great difficulties, because the other timber producing countries of the world have mainly natural forests, which are of particular advantage to them. I was disillusioned to see what wages were paid to lumbermen and sawmill workers in countries in Europe as well, countries which have a high standard of living. Their wages sometimes compare rather unfavourably with those which we pay our Bantu labourers at our sawmills. This, of course, makes the problem of competition even more difficult. There is the prospect of our finding a market in the African states for certain quantities of wood in the near future, but I feel that those countries themselves will to an increasing extent emerge as primary producers of timber products. We are already finding this position in Swaziland. The marketing of our own products is adversely affected by the fact that they are mainly dependent on us for the marketing of their products. A good prospect here is the construction of timber houses. If one reads the report of the Timber Growers&#x2019; Association, one sees that this type of house has not yet found sufficient favour. I now want to refer to something which I have also seen in my own constituency. Farmers and others are making use of timber houses in providing accommodation for their employees. These houses are extremely durable and well-planned. I feel that our architects and our public bodies should give greater attention to houses of this type, because it would mean a greater market for a product which we ourselves produce locally in this important industry.</p>

<p>I also want to refer briefly to our indigenous forests. I do not want to say a great deal in this regard, except that there can perhaps be a better planned utilization of our indigenous forests. In the distant past some of our forests

<span class="col_6163-6164" refersTo="page_0286"/> were exploited ratner rapidly and to a certain extent ruined. The matter has already received attention, but I feel that more attention can probably be given to it. I also want to hold out the prospect of future research in respect of the improvement of some of these outstanding indigenous trees. This is perhaps only a figment of the imagination at this stage, but I do think that the. Department can begin thinking along these lines. If they are engaged in planning for the better utilization of our indigenous forests, they can perhaps also give a little attention to the improvement of these valuable trees. For example, I am thinking of the stinkwood, yellow wood, kiaat and even marula trees which can have greater commercial value for us in future than is the case at present, if we can succeed in bringing about the improvements which I have suggested. From the nature of the case this is, of course, a long-term undertaking, but they should devote attention to it at this stage already. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when my time ran out yesterday I was dealing with the question of the planting of timber trees in certain areas where difficulties had arisen because of the drying up of water supplies. I pointed out that one had to be very careful in this matter because often the gospel of to-day is the heresy of to-morrow, and what was believed ten years ago is often rejected to-day. There is undoubtedly the odd instance here and there where the planting of timber can have detrimental effects on water supplies. I think it can be accepted that in some instances this is so. I wish to point out the value of this industry to-day, particularly in the private sector which is expanding so rapidly, to our South African economy. This is a new industry providing employment for a number of people and which is earning hard currency for South Africa to a far greater extent than was possible by agricultural means in the past. This is a delicate matter which should always be in the mind of the hon. the Minister and the Government.</p>

<p>These considerations lead me to ask whether it is not possible for the Minister to establish closer ties with the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs. Unfortunately that Minister is not here at the moment. The interlinking between water supplies and care of water sheds which may be forested or under scrub or grass, is an important matter. These water sheds require protection, indeed as much protection as the State can give them. Often one comes up against very hard and fast lines which are drawn between, for example, the Minister of Water Affairs and the Minister of Forestry. The Minister of Forestry has an Act dealing with the protection of water sheds and water sources, &#x201C;waterbronne&#x201D;. The sources of the rivers, the big sponges and so forth, can be demarcated forestry and then they are protected in terms of the Forestry Act by the Department of Forestry. All the water that comes from those sources goes to the Minister of Water Affairs, but he has no say over the sources from where the water comes. In practice this set-up causes great difficulties. When speaking on the Water Affairs Vote the other day I said it seemed to me that sooner or later at least one aspect of forestry should be linked closer with Water Affairs. Soil and water conservation, the protection of our water supplies, and the sources from where our water comes, these things are all closely related, they are all part and parcel of one central problem. Water being so important and as it has repeatedly been shown how vital it is for water to be protected in this country, it seems to me that all we can ask is for the Minister of Forestry to co-operate as closely as possible with the Minister of Water Affairs so that they can have a common object, which will not be forestry but the protection of water supplies and the protection of the sources of our streams. That should be the common goal.</p>

<p>Related to this question is the matter of hydrological research, which I want to deal with now for a moment. A certain type of hydrological research is undertaken by the Department of Water Affairs. In respect of the forested areas, especially in those areas which are forested by the State, there is vast room for scientific investigation and research in the Department of Forestry which falls under this Minister in regard to fundamental matters connected with hydrological research. This research work can deal with increased or decreased precipitation, increased or decreased run-off and it can be scientifically ascertained what is the result of the protection of our mountain ranges under one or other type of vegetation. There is a vast field which can be investigated in respect of matters which fall under this Minister. It is parallel to the type of research being undertaken and which can be undertaken by the Department of Water Affairs. I ask that more money be made available both under this Vote and other related Votes for basic scientific research work to be carried on. It must be done in many fields, not only in regard to the conservation of our water, but in many fields connected with our forestry which, as I say, is such a valuable and growing asset in South Africa. Basic scientific research should be assisted by all the means in our power. If we can get the staff, which is one of our troubles, let us see that when we have them, we keep them, and let us see that the facilities are made available to them, so that they have available the opportunity to carry on their research in that field.</p>

<p>I want to make another plea in regard to <i>cedrus deodara,</i> the Himalayan cedar. I speak with knowledge of my own province, and not so much in regard to the other provinces, although I imagine that possibly on the eastern slopes of the mountains in the Transvaal, the same would probably apply. But there are areas in Natal, all around the Ngeli mountains, and the offshoots of the berg up there, where the Himalayan cedar does very well indeed. <span class="col_6165-6166" refersTo="page_0287"/>When I say it does very well indeed, I have in mind the fact that two of the first trees that were ever planted in South Africa, are now over a hundred years old. They are near Karg’s Post, just outside Kokstad. Those two trees were well over a hundred feet high some ten or twelve years ago. They are not only magnificent trees, but they are magnificent timber.</p>

<p>We are developing our forestry in South Africa along the lines of quick-growing timber, producing pulpwood and sawlogs at the earliest possible age. In the end result we want sawlogs. That is what we are aiming at. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) earlier said that probably we could exist now on our own sawlog industry. We may not need to import construction timber any longer. We can saw our own logs; we have sufficient. It is perfectly true when I look at some of the timber that has been produced by the Government sawmills. I think of Weza, where there is patula, which is 30 years old and over. That timber is magnificent. Patula has always been rather looked down upon as not producing a very good timber. But I must admit that the 30-year-old timber that they are sawing at the Weza sawmill is excellent timber. It is first-class timber. Even some of the people who boycott South Africa and have nothing whatever to do with us, find that it pays them to buy some of the sawn timber from South Africa, which is patula. This is fine. This is excellent. We have to produce in bulk quickly timber for building purposes and pulp.</p>

<p>There has been a need for haste because of South Africa’s lack of a quick-growing indigenous tree which could be used for building purposes. Our trees by and large, are slowgrowing and they are found in limited quantities. So South Africa’s policy was always aimed at producing good timber quickly. I mentioned before the paucity of literature dealing with this problem. When the matter was under discussion three or four years ago, I asked the Library here if they would let me have the best reference book that they had on pines. They sent me a very interesting book, dealing with the growing of pineapples, down here at East London. That was not exactly what I wanted, Sir, as you will understand. I had to go along, and of course T found what anybody interested in forestry will know. Until a book was produced by the Stellenbosch University not long ago, the best book on South African pines was one written by an Englishman who was out here. I feel that we should do something to give deodara a chance, even with limited plantings, so as to get that class of timber in South Africa. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Nelspruit said a moment ago in connection with the development of our indigenous forests. Firstly I want to express my joy at the Department’s appointment of a qualified individual in the person of Mr. Von Breytenbach, who is stationed at George and who has been specially commissioned to utilize our indigenous forests. While our forebears destroyed the indigenous forests, we have protected them fully since 1909. We virtually ceased felling trees in the indigenous forests, with the result that the indigenous forests have developed into a very large asset to-day, not only from the recreational aspect or from the nature-lover’s aspect, but also as a source of very good timber. I understand, for example, that there are nearly two million cubic feet of iron-wood available in those forests, but that there is no market for the wood. I was quite amazed to hear this, because iron-wood is a very beautiful wood if it is properly processed. It can be a very great asset to us. I think, for example, that if in our Government offices or our Post Offices we could have ironwood parquet floors or panelwork on the walls, it would be very attractive. I have already mentioned to the Minister that it is perhaps in the mehod of presentation that the fault lies. There is not only iron-wood; there is also a large quantity of yellow-wood and South African beech wood, as well as the kinds of wood which the hon. member for Nelspruit mentioned, which can be used in our Government offices. I wonder if the time has not come for the Department of Public Works, when drawing up specifications in respect of Government buildings, to tell the architects to make use of these kinds of wood.</p>

<p>I should like to touch on another item which has to do with the attractiveness of our forests and our utilization of them. I noticed that in the Estimates the amount for camping sites in forest reserves had been increased from R9,000 to R29,000. I understand that the Department of Forestry has a five-year plan as regards opening our forest reserves and plantations to the public. I just want to express my joy at this. I think that it is a very good idea. People will then have a greater appreciation of the indigenous forests and plantations. They will see that the Government is putting to very good use the money which is being spent. The old question of whether we should allow the public into the forests, it appears to me, has now been answered. It has apparently been decided that we are in fact going to allow the public into our forests. Proper provision must just be made against fires, and then this danger will also be eliminated.</p>

<p>Our State-owned lands can be divided into various groups. There are the mountain catchment-areas, where there are no forests. There are our indigenous forests, which I have already mentioned, as well as our plantations. Then there are also the coastal areas, where driftsand is being combated, which can also prove very useful for the city-dweller who wants to get out a little. I just want to indicate a few possible lines of thought here. For example. I am thinking of motor tours which can be arranged. Roads which are made for <span class="col_6167-6168" refersTo="page_0288"/>forestry purposes can be opened to the public, and even more roads can be built in our mountain areas. All that is necessary is turnoff spots along the road and camping sites where a man can light a fire if he wants to grill his meat. I also envisage that our firebreaks which are made up in the mountain areas will be opened for those who want to go there. I am also thinking of walking tours and mountain-climbing. A great deal can be done to make footpaths in the mountains. I am also thinking of the erection of mountain huts to make our mountains more accessible to the public. Camping sites at our indigenous forests or beaches or on river banks, where driftsand has been combated, can also be very useful for such purposes. We can provide picnic spots at any place where there is scenic beauty. There are so many places on State-owned land. Then I also have in mind fishing and water sports, where the balance of nature will not be disturbed. We must of course be careful not to act indiscriminately and not to allow things which ought not to be allowed. There are many special sights for which tourists will travel far. I am thinking of the way in which the Knysna forests are now being developed, for example, by making it possible for visitors to view the large trees, waterfalls, or other attractions. With only a path made in that forest, the place becomes more attractive. People will drive far to see it. I am also thinking of the possibility of the erection of holiday huts next to the sea and in our coastal parks which are now being developed. Apart from the pleasure which it would afford our public if we open up our forests in this way, we can give the people a greater appreciation of our beautiful forests.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should first like to reply to the speech the hon. member for South Coast made last night. At the outset I want to say that I appreciate the atmosphere in which his Vote has been discussed and the way in which hon. members discussed the merits of factors of which so many of them have particular knowledge. To that extent one can approach this subject with complete objectivity. In the first instance I must say that I disagree with the hon. member for South Coast when he says that I should now in conjunction with the Minister of Economic Affairs have a full-scale inquiry, and I think those were his words, into the machinations of a particular international group in regard to the wattle, industry. I will tell the hon. member why I say that. I do not do it because I merely want to oppose him from this side of the House. But I submit to the hon. member that there is the Wattle Industry Control Board, which is established as a statutory body. It consists of 14 members, seven of whom are producers and seven of whom are manufacturers. Out of this seven only one represents this group the hon. member referred to. There we have a body to whom I as a Minister, and to whom the Government looks to advise us on the wattle industry in general. I am quite prepared to convey to them the content of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, but I think that they would regard it as a lack of confidence in them, if I were to accept over their heads what the hon. member for South Coast has submitted to me, I think they would react in that way. I think that that is the responsible body and the body to whom I and the Government must look for any suggestions or any representations they want to make and not, I regret to say and I do not say it with any antagonism, in this instance to the hon. member for South Coast who asks for a full-scale inquiry, casting suspicions on a particular sector of the industry. This would be the effect if on the basis of what he has said in this House I were to join with the Minister of Economic Affairs and request a full-scale inquiry.</p>

<p>Have you no other evidence apart from what I said?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As a matter of fact I have spoken to the board on a number of occasions. I have had deputations from their Marketing Committee, and I have always regarded the approach to their problems as being made in the light of objectivity. These approaches were not dictated as the hon. member for South Coast seems to think by this particular firm. The marketing decisions were reached after very careful consideration. I might add that this Marketing Committee, as it is called, consists of nine members. Admittedly this firm serves on the Marketing Committee. I would say quite rightly so because it is an experienced international firm. I know economics, markets and business and I would say that this committee would be at a very great disadvantage if it did not have a member of that firm serving on it. I have met the committee and I think that if I said to them that their policy of marketing was dictated by this firm they would treat my insinuation with a great deal of scorn because I do not think that that is the position. I do not want to pretend that the wattle industry is in a wonderful position. The wattle industry has had a great battle as the hon. member has quite rightly said. It has had an uphill battle. The mere fact that it had to reduce the production of its members to quotas of between 40 and 45 per cent shows the marketing problems they have. But these problems did not arise as a result of an individual firm. These problems arose because in the international field there was synthetic leather which did not need tanning extract to produce the final product.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> The hon. member is a wattle grower and he has a vote for the representative on the Wattle Board. That is his representative. What does his member say on the Wattle Board about the point he has raised? He should have made his representations to him. I want to say to the hon. mem<span class="col_6169-6170" refersTo="page_0289"/>ber that to use Parliament when it comes to matters of this nature, to make charges which in fact involve a lack of confidence in the Wattle Board itself is going very far, because this body is responsible for the industry. This body knows what it is doing. Whatever the hon. member may say and whatever asides he may make in this regard, these are responsible people, I have known many of these growers and I have spoken to an hon. member on the other side who is a grower. As he told us in this Committee his forefathers were among the original wattle growers in Natal. I have never heard him say to me: &#x201C;You know there is a scandalous state of affairs in the wattle industry because of this particular firm&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> Yes, and I presume that the hon. member for South Coast is also still a grower. He says that he may leave the industry in three years. [Interjections.] Then the hon. member presumably decided to sell his quota.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not. I am out of the industry.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<p>I said yesterday that I left the industry nine years ago.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> What I am saying and what the hon. member cannot get away from is this. Here is a responsible statutory body but now I must take the advice of a member of the Opposition on how their affairs should be conducted. I do not think that that advice is sound. As I have said I am not prepared to charge that there were any ulterior motives behind the members proposal because I do not believe it. I would, however, say that when you have a board such as that, if you do not recognize the responsibilities of that board and you act on representations made across the floor of the House, I doubt whether the Minister would be acting very responsibly. That then is my view on this subject. I am sorry that I am not prepared to follow up the suggestion made by the hon. member for South Coast. I will, however, bring his speech to the notice of the Wattle Board, and then they can tell me as the body which represents the wattle industry what they feel about the situation. I will do that but I will not conduct a full inquiry.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also spoke about the Compensation Committee. He also seems to indicate that this committee was not handling the affairs of the grower properly. He said that he would like to know more about this committee. I shall tell him the little I know about the committee. It is run by the Wattle Board itself. It is not controlled by me. The hon. member rightly said that I did not enter into certain problems that arose, because they resolved them themselves. It is only when they do not resolve their problems that they have the right to appeal to the Minister of Forestry and ask him to make a ruling. But they never did it, because they were able to reach agreement amongst themselves. That is the right way. I do not think this industry should be controlled from the top, but should be allowed to develop in its own right sector. I always felt that this was the right policy and I am sure the hon. Chief Whip of the United Party will agree that that is the right policy for me to follow. But all of a sudden the hon. member now wants me to tackle this industry from a different angle. Well, I disagree with the suggestion and I cannot concede his point. Let me give the hon. member some information about this fund. The seven wattle growers on the board and seven industrialists, only one of which is an international firm, came to an agreement and eventually established a fund of R 160,000. The object of the fund is to compensate growers, and not industrialists, because on the basis of a certain rationalization schemes the industrialist was going to move certain of his factories. It is the growers who have the say about the method how the formula of compensation is to be applied. I think there are three growers and only one manufacturer on the compensation committee. What could be fairer? Therefore, the hon. member should not cast any suspicion on the growers&#x2019; committee. What the hon. member should do if he feels he has no more confidence in the committee is to go to his representative and try to persuade him. He should not throw it across the floor as he did there this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not casting any suspicions; I am merely asking what the conditions are under which compensation will be paid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> No. The whole tenor of the speech of the hon. member, where he talked about this international firm, this &#x201C;great&#x201D; international firm, was to create an atmosphere of suspicion. He continued the same vein in an endeavour to put over some insinuation on that issue.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> When the hon. member tackles something of this nature, he should be factual and must not come here and suggest things which can only create ill-will in an industry which already is facing many problems. An industry which has to use marketing systems available to it and which in fact have been used to its advantage. The hon. member must not insinuate that things are all wrong and that there ought to be a full scale investigation.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> The hon. member said very much more than what he should have said. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) is now trying to save the hon. member. The hon. member for South Coast also raised the question of the Himalayan Cedar. In this connection I can inform him that the forestry experts of my department have suggested that officials of the department should go to Mexico to investigate the availability of the seed of the Mexican Pine because they feel that species have more prospects of success in South Africa than the other species of pine, like the Himalayan Cedar. These experts are responsible people and know what they are about. Therefore I accept that they made that recommendation on the basis of their knowledge and that their recommendation is justified.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Have these been tried in this country before?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Where?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> It has been experimented with already, but they are now thinking in terms of bringing in larger quantities of seeds. The idea is that departmental officials should go over in order to be able to select the seeds themselves. They have already experimented with small quantities of seeds at our various tree breeding stations. They have now reached the stage where they think these seeds should be brought in bulk for distribution in South Africa.</p>

<p>As far as hydrological research is concerned, the department has at present three hydrological research installations, namely at Cathedral Peak in Natal, in the Transvaal and in the Cape. In addition, in collaboration with the Departments of Water Affairs and Agricultural Technical Services, research is being carried out at Lebanon and Zachariahoek Forest Reserves in the Cape Province.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the first part of the hon. member for Humansdorp&#x2019;s speech. At the outset I want to say that the accounts of the department are quite complex and therefore I do not want either him or myself to draw any unnecessary conclusions from what one reads on the surface. The reason why I say this, is because the total expenditure of this department is some R14 million. Even in the accounts to which the hon. member referred to there are items of capital expenditure which should not really be reflected in a profit and loss account. On the other hand they also contain items which are non-revenue producing such as the control of sand dunes, for instance. There is no revenue attached to these items and yet the department fulfils those functions. As far as hakea is concerned, I want to say that the amount that has been granted for hakea this year is R54,000 compared to R27,000 last year. This amount is in respect of the plantations of the department itself. Contrary to what the hon. member said I want to point out that as far as our information is concerned there are 15,000 morgen of our State forests which are infested with hakea, compared to the private sector where more than 100,000 morgen are infested. The amount voted for the department is used for the plantations of the State itself and is naturally not spent on the private sector. I was very pleased to hear what the reaction of the hon. member was when he saw the timber-frame houses at George. We are also satisfied and, in fact, another unit has been established at New Sabie, which is also manufacturing timber houses for the Bantu. The same programme that is going on at George is also being carried out in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>The hon. member, and also the hon. member for Nelspruit, raised some questions on tourism. I do not have to explain the fact that forests are beautiful natural amenities. As far as the visitor is concerned, this was something that struck me immediately. I have been to some of the forests and I felt that, although there were certain amenities and certain camping areas I wanted to expand them. In conjunction with Treasury it was decided that we would go into a five-year plan. The idea is that certain amounts will be spent in various of these areas for the purpose of creating more and better amenities. I do not want any hon. members to think that there is going to be a luxury. It will be camping and picnic sites. To give hon. members an idea, R5,600 is going to be spent this year in the Tokai forest, which many of them know, on 50 additional fire places, a new water scheme and other facilities so that more people here in the Peninsula, who want to go out into those beautiful surroundings, will have certain camping facilities made available to them. I have visited Cane Vidal in Zululand and the very thing that the hon. member suggested has been arranged there. Ski clubs have been given certain facilities where they can house their ski boats and also a place where their members can go and even sleep overnight. These are, however, <span class="col_6173-6174" refersTo="page_0291"/>on a limited scale but we are gradually developing this approach. At Cape Vidal itself where there was an, area for 50 caravans, we have gone further into the valley and hope to extend the facilities to accommodate 100 caravans. An ablution block will also be established which, up to now, has not been available. A water scheme will be provided. In this way, with the amount that is available this year, we intend going ahead to create facilities in these forest reserves for more and more people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) talked about the lack of statistics. As the hon. member knows, as he served on the Select Committee, this was one of the matters which was dealt with by this particular legislation. As a result of a report on private forestry, two matters were included in this new Bill, namely registration and compulsory statistics. I quite agree that, if one can provide better and up to date statistics in respect of the timber industry, it will be a big asset to them and to the State as well. It will not only give the private sector information which they need, but it will also give the department and myself as the Minister information which we can use at various times. He also talked about the financial assistance to timber farmers. This is also dealt with in the report and whereas I would say that it is not my intention to table the report, I made the report available to all interested bodies. I made it available to the hon. member and to the members of the Select Committee. I also made it available to all the private sectors concerned with forestry and anybody who is genuinely interested and wants to make a study of that report can obtain one. The department has not withheld it from anybody.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Can I then take it that those of us who serve on the Select Committee, and to whom you kindly gave reports, do not have to keep them confidential?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> I might mention to the hon. member that those reports were also made available to members of the trade. I therefore do not expect these reports to be regarded as confidential at all. They are there for study, comment and criticism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Can we expect some results in regard to finance?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p> That, as the hon. member knows, was dealt with very carefully in the report. I think he was not quite right when he said that there are various sectors of agriculture which have the same facilities. I think that there is only a category 3 in agriculture where there is a subsidized rate of interest. I think that that is the only category in the whole of the agricultural industry where there is a subsidized rate of interest, although they go in for fruit tree growing and vine planting. In brining that to his notice I merely do so in order that he will appreciate that what he probably had in mind is not a general criterion for agriculture. On the other hand I appreciate that timber farming is a long-term investment. What has worried me is that whereas long-term money is available to big units, it is not available to small units. This is a matter I will certainly go into. If the small unit goes into the open financial market, he is charged a rate of interest which may be regarded as exorbitant. He is therefore not in the position to raise money at the low rate of interest the big unit can. That feature I fully appreciate.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about sawn timber and what I could do to extend the market. All I can say is that I do not look so much at the export market, but to the local market for increasing sales of sawn timber. If we can encourage a greater consumption of sawn timber in this country it will be our best market. The consumption dropped from 2.5 cubic foot per head to 1.5 cubic foot per head in this country. The basis for introducing compulsory standards for the construction timber was to ensure that people who were building houses need not fear using South African timber, and would not make use of substitutes or importations. The hon. member knows there are many substitutes for timber.</p>

<p>With regard to research and wood promotion the Government has always contributed to both these aspects with the idea of creating a better demand and better understanding and knowledge of the use of timber. The report on private forestry in South Africa which was submitted to the members of the Select Committee is one which I do feel members should study very carefully. I myself found it very interesting.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Nelspruit talked about the potential of tourism and I answered his question partly when I replied to what was said by the hon. member for Humansdorp. I think that we must educate our people more and more into making use of these natural relaxing amenities of our forests. I only hope that our people will appreciate that when they are allowed there they must behave in a responsible manner. In Pietermaritzburg I spoke to private plantation managers and they nearly shouted me down when I suggested that they should open up their forests to tourists. The reason is that to them the most fatal thing that can ever happen, is a fire in a plantation. They felt that South Africans were not careful enough when it came to fires and taking precautions where carelessness can cost foresters such large amounts of money. I can assure the hon. member, however, that the aspect of the potential is not lost on me and I hope that he will see in the future results which will satisfy him.</p>

<p>With regard to our indigenous timbers I want to say that there are magnificent trees particularly in the Knysna area and also in the Northern Transvaal. I realize that this is a matter which has an aesthetic attraction. Commercially the man-made forest is apparently the <span class="col_6175-6176" refersTo="page_0292"/>one which shows a more viable approach than the indigenous timber. But I was shown a tree in Knysna, which I was told was 500 years old, so the indigenous timber in this country has a record of age which is quite formidable. I would like to see indigenous forests preserved as an attraction to tourists.</p>

<p>Sir, I think I have replied to all the speakers. I realize that the hon. member for South Coast is just waiting for me so I shall sit down to give him an opportunity to speak.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>How right the hon. the Minister is! Sir, let me deal first with the question of the committee which is dealing with compensation for those who have suffered as a result of the adjustments in the wattle bark industry. I cast no reflection on that committee. I said that I had been unable to ascertain the principles upon which compensation will be paid; that I in the next two, three or four years would be completely out of wattle and that I would have to change over to a different type of timber, if I wanted to go in for timber growing, and that it would take me nine or ten years before I could get a return. I want to know whether in terms of that arrangement I was one of those who would be deemed to be someone who had suffered and therefore entitled to compensation. That is my own personal position, but I am one of many. I need not apply it to myself because I am only one of many. I said to the Minister: &#x201C;If you have the conditions under which compensation is to be paid, will you please inform this Committee?&#x201D; not for my sake, but for the sake of that group of people who will be out of wattle. The Minister obviously has not got the conditions under which compensation will be paid. He does not know how those who have suffered will be compensated. All he can say is that there is a sum of money of plus-minus so many thousand rand and that there is a committee of four, three planters and a member of a milling group who, he says, is associated with an international group, who are dealing with that compensation fund, but he does not know the conditions. That is what I wanted to know. I said, &#x201C;If he knows the conditions, will he tell the Committee&#x201D;. He does not know the conditions. As regards the question of the status of the company in respect of which I want an inquiry, let me say that the committee set up in terms of the Act, i.e. the general committee, has nothing to do with international companies and affairs overseas. That was a company that was set up in terms of the Act for our domestic purposes in South Africa, where it operates. It has neither influence nor anything else, and may I say to the hon. the Minister that a predecessor of his went across to the Argentine in the early stages to see whether something could not be done about it. He was prepared to go across there himself personally and I mentioned his name yesterday&#x2014;the hon. Senator Paul Sauer. When he was Minister he went across to the Argentine. This is not a case of the Minister taking the word of the Committee or acting on its advice. What I said was this&#x2014;and I am entitled to say it in Parliament; this is the one place where I can say it on behalf of the whole of the industry.</p>

<p>Sir, we are getting to a wonderful level if the Minister adopts that attitude. Let me deal objectively with the matter in hand. I say that I am speaking on behalf of the whole of the wattle industry of South Africa when I say that the international company&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister was the man who named it an international company this afternoon&#x2014;has a hold on the marketing of vegetable tanning materials in the world markets&#x2014;that was what I said yesterday&#x2014;and therefore its association with our wattle industry in South Africa has its repercussions in the price paid for our wattle bark when it is sold in the world markets against other vegetable tanning materials. What is the association? How far can markets in which we have to sell be determined by that particular company? What is the proportion of wattle extract which it sells in relation to the total production in South Africa? We keep some of our extracts, some of our pressed bark, our chopped bark, for the purpose of our own leather tanning industry, but in the main our existence as a wattle industry is dependent upon oversea markets. When an international company like this one&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am taking the Minister&#x2019;s word; am I not entitled to quote him? He used it first. I made no secret about it yesterday that what I was talking about was an organization that had a controlling interest in the vegetable tanning markets of the world, whether it is quebracho or other vegetable tanning materials, whatever they may be. That company has this controlling interest in those concerns and now it has a wholly-owned <span class="col_6177-6178" refersTo="page_0293"/>subsidiary operating in the Republic of South Africa. How far then is our market prejudiced or influenced or affected? That falls outside the scope of our wattle affairs committee in South Africa created in terms of our Act. That is why I suggested to the Minister that he should co-operate with the Minister of Economic Affairs. It probably falls outside his scope as Minister. He cannot entirely deal with it; it has to go to the Minister of Economic Affairs for him also to lend a hand so that use may be made of the agencies which we have in those other countries, with a view to trying to ascertain how far we are being affected, prejudicially or otherwise, by the interests and the ramifications of the business interests of that particular company, in so far as it affects the marketing of our produce when we send it overseas to the international market&#x2014;chopped bark and tanning extract. That is what I asked the hon. the Minister to do. Sir, I cannot make him carry out that investigation. If he is not prepared to do anything as Minister to try to assist the wattle industry of South Africa, if he is trying to hide behind the fact that there is a committee in terms of the Act created here in South Africa, if he will not move, if he is too timid, if he will not do anything on his own responsibility, then there is nothing more that I can do about it. But it is perfectly clear to us now exactly what the position is, and that is that the Minister is not prepared to act at all. He has a committee to hide behind; that seems to be his attitude, and I lay that squarely at his door. I say that in this matter where nobody else has any authority whatsoever and he is the only one who can act, he is apparently afraid to accept the responsibility.</p>

He comes here and says that he talks on behalf of the wattle industry of South Africa. Of course he does not talk on behalf of that industry. There is a wattle industry board that talks on behalf of the wattle industry. He is just trying to rake up something to see if he cannot make a bit of propaganda for himself and for his Natal Stand. I know the hon. member. He must not try that sort of bluff and bluster on me; I know him only too well and I am not frightened because he throws his arms around and gets himself excited. It leaves me cold; I have seen him perform too often. I saw it in Durban and I have seen it in Natal. No, that horse will not run any more.</p>

<p> The Wattle Board is the body that will tell me what to do, not Douglas Mitchell. After all, there are seven growers on the Wattle Board. They will come to me and say: &#x201C;This is the situation, we want you to hold a full inquiry&#x201D;, but I am not going to do it just because an hon. front-bencher on that side of the House stands up and tries to make insinuations without any concrete evidence. That is why I say he does not represent the wattle industry in this House. He does not talk on behalf of the wattle industry in South Africa; he talks politics when he says it is this Minister who will not move a finger and is not interested in the wattle industry at all. Of course the member maintains that is not politics; it is just Douglas Mitchell having his little fun. The hon. member then says that I have taken the wrong line as far as this committee is concerned. How could I have taken the wrong line? He was the man who said that he, like so many others, was not receiving compensation, although he and the others were being forced out of business by this&#x2014;I had better not say &#x201C;international&#x201D;&#x2014;by this company which markets tanning extract on a world basis; and then he himself used the word &#x201C;international&#x201D; which he objected to my using. I just cannot understand the hon. member. It is just a torrent of words that flows from him. This committee consists of four members. It has a farmer from the Transvaal, a farmer from Zululand, a farmer from Southern Natal, where the hon. member comes from, and it has one representative of the Natal Tanning Extract Company. Compensation will be considered by the committee to those who have claims on the fund. The claim of growers on the fund is (a) the net amount that would have been received for bark delivered to the closed down factory; (b) the actual amount received for the new deliveries. The difference between the two amounts will be reimbursed to the grower and these reimbursements will continue for a period of ten years or until the fund of R 160,000 is depleted, whichever period is the lesser. Now the hon. member wonders why I do not want to make a big song and dance about the conditions of compensation. But it is in the hands of a body which is controlled by producers&#x2014;three to one. They know what they are doing. The hon. member makes these assertions. I say he must make sure of his facts. I do not want to make a political issue out of a debate like this, and right in the beginning I thanked the hon. member because he did not do so. I said that I hoped this would be an objective discussion, but that does not mean that if the hon. member makes wild allegations I just have to accept them without replying to them, and they are wild allegations. I think anybody who knows the wattle industry will know how the Wattle Board has been established and the manner in which it operates, and will know that his are wild allegations when he calls for a full inquiry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>The Vote we are now about to discuss appears to me to be one of the Cinderella Votes, if I may put it that way. It is difficult to appreciate what the responsibility and activities of the Minister are. It is one of these intangible organizations which is rendering a service, and you cannot judge results except by the number of visitors who may be brought to South Africa and by the service given to internal travel in this country. It is very difficult to ascertain what exactly is happening. It is appreciated that the Minister has many difficulties. He has said that his function is one of a propaganda Minister for tourism. I think that is correct, summing it up very briefly; that appears to be his function. If he is tackled about doing things in regard to a particular problem, he states that it is not his responsibility; he can only do it by persuasion, in other words by convincing others of what has to be done. I should like to know from the Minister what success he is having, what are the problems he is busy with, and what success he is having in persuading people into co-operation and action; because it would appear that talking about tourism is everybody&#x2019;s concern, but action on tourism is nobody&#x2019;s concern. That is one of the difficulties as I see it. How is the Minister going to achieve some positive, some definite result in this very vital industry of tourism to South Africa? Of course it can&#x2014;and other members will deal with this aspect of it&#x2014;mean a great deal to this country in foreign exchange, and a very necessary substitute for activities that in the future may fade away. It has become in other countries one of the foremost industries. In some countries it is their first industry. South Africa has great potentialities and possibilities of becoming one of the foremost tourist countries. We have difficulty, because it is off the beaten line at the moment, and there are other difficulties, but there is no reason why it should not become one of the great countries for tourism. One knows that when one is dealing with a Department and one has to persuade others into taking action, then one is up against great difficultés. I should like to ask the Minister what success he is having with the regional development which replaced the old provincial basis we had and which failed. For various good reasons, like the fiscal policy and the authority of the provinces, we did not get very far with that scheme, and now we have gone back to this regional scheme, and I should like to know what success or otherwise the Minister is achieving and what problems he is faced with. In regard to the structure of his Department, you have Satour the body which deals with international travel and travel into South Africa from overseas. you also have the Hotel Board which is dealing now with the grading of hotels and allied subjects, and then you have the Department which apparently deals mainly with internal tourism and keeps a fatherly eye over international tourism. So we have representatives on Satour and also on the Hotel Board. Now those two organizations, I think it may be said, are doing a good job of work, generally speaking. They are doing their best, but there are difficulties. I believe, for instance, in the Hotel Board not sufficient emphasis is being put on services in the grading of hotels. A great deal of emphasis is put on the tangibles, the carpets you can measure by the square yard and the curtains and the mirrors that you can measure. Those are all calculated and accurately calculated, but there is a feeling that in regard to service not sufficient credit is being given to some of these establishments. Other members no doubt will deal more fully with the activities of the Hotel Board, but I would like to say a word about the Satour side of travel and their publications. They bring visitors here and they have various publications, all excellent in their way, but when one sees the results one asks oneself whether it is achieving what it sets out to do. I think the question was asked in this debate last year whether consideration should not be given to the type of publicity being put out; in other words, is it pulling the traveller to South Africa or has it become too general to attract them? It may be interesting but it does not make the traveller want to come to this country.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the Minister how far he has got with the survey. I notice in the annual report of his Department that projects receiving attention or research are set out very fully, and the various matters to be gone into are very fully set out, and quite accurately, and it states at the end that sound planning can only be based on research.</p>

<p>As I understand the position, the Minister started out to get outside people to do this research work. It was found to be too expensive and unsatisfactory in its nature, and it was decided to have it done by the department itself. How far has the Minister gone with this? Because it would appear to me and I think that I have seen it somewhere, that such a policy will make progress very much slower, although it will increase the quality, rather than having it done outside. I am wondering whether the Minister would consider taking expert people on contract to help to do this work and facilitate it. He has, as is shown from the annual report of Satour. a limited staff. That staff has I think, expanded from 15 to 67. But it is still limited. One wonders whether he would not be wise in going outside, taking people on contract and forming an organization in his department, under the Secretary of the department, to get on with the research and direct it as to what they want and why they want it. Because I believe that a lot of what is decided to-day is &#x201C;by guess and by God&#x201D;. We have no figures and no accurate information. One can have a discussion with somebody and then think afterwards: &#x201C;Well, that is the thing to do.&#x201D; It may prove right or utterly wrong. I think we should as soon as possible get away from that position.</p>

<p><span class="col_6181-6182" refersTo="page_0295"/>The other point I want to make in my limited time is: How prepared are we for the age of what we call the jumbo jets? Five hundred people can arrive at one time, and very frequently. I am informed most reliably that today, if a party of 60 people want to come to South Africa in the season, unless they gave two years&#x2019; to a year&#x2019;s notice, they could not be accommodated. That is the considered opinion of people in the travelling business, namely that, if they have to notify people that they were coming here, it would be arranged with the greatest difficulty. Probably they would have to turn it down because it was at a busy time. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis put quite a number of questions to the hon. the Minister. They are questions to which one cannot really expect any member on this side of the House to reply. However, I should just like to associate myself with one question put by the hon. member, i.e. when he referred to the report of the Department of Tourism for the year ended 31st March, 1967, and particularly to page 5, where mention is made of research work that will have to be done in order to allow this industry come into its own in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think we all appreciate the statements made on page 5, and identify ourselves with the idea that, where every industry on earth must of necessity be based on research, on the gathering of information and the evaluation thereof, we must also use it as a basis for our future actions. While the tourist industry is by far the largest industry in the world to-day, and there are indications that it will increase its lead in the years to come, relatively little research work is being done in other parts of the world as regards the tourist industry. Therefore it was gratifying to see that this young Department intends to undertake research work in connection with this industry on quite a large scale here in South Africa. Therefore I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Von Brandis by saying that any money which has to be spent to expedite this research work as much as possible and consequently to obtain the plan which ought to result from that for this industry is money which this Committee should vote without any hesitation. This Department is one of the youngest and smallest in our State administration. But the South African Tourist Corporation will already be 21 years old on 1st August this year. One may be grateful for the work done by the South African Tourist Corporation, and if one looks at the annual statistics, not only of tourists entering South Africa from countries in Africa, but also those coming from Europe, Asia, the Americas and Oceania, then one finds the increase to be a reasonably constant one. The figures are mentioned in the report, and we find that the stream of tourists increased from 202,000 to 257,000 from 1962 to 1966. These numbers are probably quite encouraging. It should further more be mentioned that the stream of tourists from Europe and all other countries outside Africa to this country doubled itself in the years 1962 to 1966. The South African Tourist Corporation can be proud of the record they have built up over the past 21 years. The tourist industry is an extremely large one, not only in the case of other countries of the world, but also in the case of South Africa and her neighbouring states, and we should consider whether we can be satisfied with Southern Africa&#x2019;s receiving such a small amount of the money spent by tourists all over the world. Therefore I think this Department has a double task to fulfil. Since South Africa is the basis of the development which has to take place to the borders of many countries to our north, this Department is still going to play a large part in the tourist industry. This industry is not only of great importance to South Africa, but also to her neighbours. The Department should make an exhaustive study of this industry and develop it until eventually it occupies its rightful place in our national economy.</p>

<p>It was recently announced that about ten projects were to be undertaken in South West Africa on which approximately R7.4 million would be spent up to the year 1970. I notice, furthermore that in the five-year plan which Portugal announced for herself and her overseas provinces, R253 million was allotted for the development of communications and transport in Angola, Moçambique and certain other small Portuguese provinces abroad. More than half of the amount allotted for communication and transport in Angola in particular, will be spent on road construction. This means that a big, new tourist route might come into being between Cape Town and Luanda during the next three years. The vote for communications and transport in Moçambique also stresses the importance of the construction of roads, and a third big rourist route may possibly come into being during the next few years, i.e. from Durban to Beira. The situation developing at present is one not only of large-scale development in South Africa and her neighbouring states, but also and particularly of a good network of roads which will extend from 2 000 miles north of Carte Town, from Luanda on the west coast to about 2,300 miles north of Cape Town in Beira.</p>

<p>If we consider the number of tourists who visited South Africa in the last few years, then it is notable that the Percentages, particularly in respect of tourists from the Americas, are still exceptionally small. I want to plead now that when we endeavour to attract tourists to South Africa, we should see South Africa as part of a larger complex, and we should perhaps concentrate on attracting tourists from countries related to Angola and Moçambique, and particularly from South America. As a result of the establishment of new communications between the Republic and South America I think we should expect a normal increase <span class="col_6183-6184" refersTo="page_0296"/>in tourist traffic from South America to South Africa. We are to have a particular population composition in Southern Africa, especially as far as the Whites are concerned, in future years, and we should take note of the fact that Portugal intends to settle approximately 500,000 Portuguese immigrants in the Kunene Basin alone. In the Zambesi Valley, under the Cabora Bassa scheme, there will likewise be approximately one million white Portuguese eventually.</p>

<p>That means that, in addition to some 3&#x00BD; million Whites in the Republic, we shall have a Portuguese population of approximately the same size in the two Portuguese provinces on the east and west coasts. Considering the immigrants which South Africa has been attracting in recent years, it will be a natural thing for people in the countries of origin to visit the members of their families who live here. As a result of the information sent by immigrants to their people abroad, members of their families in their countries of origin will naturally be inclined to visit the Republic. People in countries such as Brazil and other South American countries as well as in Portugal, will also be inclined to visit immigrants in Mozambique and Angola. We should therefore expect that, apart from the normal tourist routes we have overland from South Africa to the Victoria Falls and which we call the great northern route, a great western and a great eastern route will likewise develop. Perhaps it will be known some day as one of the most attractive tourist areas in the world. I shall be pleased if the Department takes note of these developments and I hope that the Department will be one of the greatest in our national economy 21 years from now.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can give us some clarification regarding the tourist position in Natal and what development he envisages in that province. We have in Durban a very alive organization dealing with visitors and tourists. We have on the South Coast, at Margate and so forth, another very live organization. We also have a very active organization in Pietermaritzburg. But by and large the picture is one of individual groups of people and municipalities working in isolation and unco-ordinated.</p>

<p>In Durban there is a young man who to my knowledge has already gone overseas twice to &#x201C;sell&#x201D; South Africa to potential tourists. He owns an hotel in Durban. He believes in selling goodwill and selling what the country has to offer the tourist. But these are isolated instances. I do not want to follow the hon. member who has just sat down. I think he made a very fine speech and raised some very good points. What he envisages is a much larger organization which can offer many tourist attractions so that it can play a worthy part in drawing tourists to his country. There are also other organizations which can also play a worthy part. As I say, in Natal we have independent activities, nothing is coordinated. In the main the task has fallen on the Natal Parks Board. I raised this point here in the past years. But the Natal Parks Board is not a tourist organization, nor is it a tourist promotion organization. Because it is a conservation body, people want to see what is being conserved; they want to see the animals, the rhino, the buffaloes, and all the other animals. So people came to look at the animals the same way as people visit the Kruger Park to see the animals. As I say, it was not however a tourist promotion body but a nature conservation body.</p>

<p>The fact that it has attracted tourists in ever-increasing numbers is incidental to its main purpose, which is nature conservation. I wonder, however, whether this is a good long-term basis on which nature conservation should be established, that a body which is promoting tourism should be independent of a body which is concerned with nature conservation. The facilities and amenities which are related to nature conservation and which are available to people from overseas and our country will undoubtedly attract visitors. In itself this is good. But what is lacking is a central organization in Natal. I think the Natal Parks Board is co-operating fully with the Minister&#x2019;s Department and his officials, and I think we shall improve this co-operation greatly.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister took over this portfolio there was an understanding that finance would be made available and channelled through committees established by the Administrators of the various provinces. This arrangement however broke down because of certain constitutional difficulties which we do not need to go into to-day. The Minister knows what they were. The difficulties were insurmountable. The difficulties apply as far as the provinces are concerned but they do not apply as far as other activities are concerned and other branches of tourist promotion.</p>

<p>My colleague the hon. member for Von Brandis spoke about what would be the position when the first jumbo-jets arrived in this country and the difficulties of having to cater during the tourist season for a tourist group of say 60 people who came together and wanted accommodation. The first jumbo-jet will be the forerunner of many others and we just do not have the accommodation to deal with so many arrivals. Steps must be taken now and money must be made available so that we can cater for the people who will come. We can talk as much as we like about this subject, but if the capital is not made available for the provision of facilities for tourists, then we will not get the tourists. Because of the credit squeeze, high interest rates and so forth, private enterprise which would be interested in providing capital are simply shut out. That is also the position of the Natal Parks Board. It is not one of the functions of the board to provide these facilities. They cannot expend money on these things because their Estimates have to go before the Natal Provincial Council and before the Administrator and the <span class="col_6185-6186" refersTo="page_0297"/>money has to be voted in terms of the constitution of the Parks Board. As I say, they are a conservation body. Large sums of money are required to provide the necessary facilities for the many tourists we should draw. We are only scratching the surface of the world tourist industry. We are only scratching the very outside edges. We are getting dozens and scores of tourists where we should have them in thousands, people who should be spending their money here. I want to suggest to the Minister that money laid out to provide facilities and amenities for tourists is money well spent. Tourists do not come here to see our towns and cities. They can go to a thousand towns and see buildings like those we have in Durban, in Cape Town, in Johannesburg. No, they come to see our natural features, our wild life and our Bantu life. That is what they come here for. It should be possible for a tourist say in Western Europe to buy a ticket in his hometown and come here on a planned and organized tour with others to see what he wants to see here in South Africa, not what we want to show him. We must let the tourists see what they themselves want to see. That tour must continue until eventually the tourist ends up in his hometown once more, having paid for his trip, gone on a properly organized tour, seen what he wanted to see and, &#x201C;provided for from beginning to end&#x201D;. There should not be any breaks or gaps in the tour. No unexpected difficulties should arise. Human nature and human affairs being what they are, difficulties do sometimes arise, but so far as it is humanly possible the tours should go off without a hitch. When one sees in certain overseas countries how well-organized their tourist industry is, one realizes what can be done through human endeavour. I say we are merely scratching on the surface of something which is so vast and so important in terms of money. But I say we must lay out our funds so that we can lure tourists to this country. I ask the Minister whether he could not envisage some scheme for Natal which can provide a central authority in which all those people, who are only too anxious to play their part as far as the development of tourism is concerned, can play a part. Moreover, some financial assistance should be forthcoming. It is no use sending back people who are keen to provide amenities for tourists and telling them to approach a bank for assistance or directing them to orthodox financing systems at the present time. But now is the time that we should be spending money on facilities because the jumbo jets will be coming here. Instead of there being a good advertisement for South Africa and tourists leaving South Africa satisfied and happy, we are going to have a bad beginning and send away dissatisfied people who will have no regard for the arrangements which they encountered in South Africa. We must take time by the forelock and do what is necessary now, even if the tourists will only be coming in two years&#x2019; time, because it will take at least two years to complete even the initial steps to cater for the many visitors who are coming.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast will most probably not take it amiss of me if I do not follow him up. He mentioned certain positive points here and the hon. the Minister is sure to pay the necessary attention to them. My time is too short to elaborate on them any further.</p>

<p>The Department of Tourism is a relatively young one, but it has nevertheless done a good job of work already and has made good progress. If we look at the departmental report for the period from May, 1963, to 31st March, 1967, then it is very clear that good progress has been made. We wish to express our appreciation for that. It is clear that the attraction of tourists is one of the cheapest ways of earning money for any country. Practically no money need be invested abroad, but the tourists come of their own accord if there is something to offer them. If we look at the report of the control board of the South African Tourist Corporation for the year ended 31st March, 1967, we see that there has been an increase of 50.37 per cent over the past five years. We see, further more, that tourism has increased by 547.55 per cent since 1946, which is a tremendous increase. We have already exceeded the quarter of a million mark. 82.7 per cent of the visitors entered our country on holiday and 70.6 per cent of the 257,008 visitors who visited this country in 1966, were from countries in Africa.</p>

<p>We know that all the countries in the world are at present promoting their tourist industry. They are doing their utmost to draw tourists. Last year the increase in the number of tourists who visited the Republic was 7.3 per cent, which is just a little more than the average increase for the world. If we want to take our rightful place as a tourist country, we shall have to raise our annual increase to at least 18 or 20 per cent. There were 138 million tourists in the world last year, of whom only .2 per cent came here, and that is a very small percentage. Our country has so much to offer the tourist, and the percentage coming here is much too small. I know there are many factors to be taken into account, such as transport, accommodation, etc. World political conditions also play a part.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I should like to make a personal statement. On Monday, 27th May, during the discussion of the Defence Vote, I referred to the speech made by the hon. member for Durban (Point), who spoke immediately prior to me, and compared it to the actions in the past of &#x201C;a former hon. member for Simonstown&#x201D;. It has come to my attention that a local evening newspaper yesterday interpreted my reference as being to the late Mr. L. C. Gay, late M.P. for Simonstown. The person whom I in fact had in mind was Captain W. R. Butters, a former M.P. for Wynberg. I am sorry if, on the spur of the moment, I expressed myself incorrectly and in so doing created a wrong impression.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>In the second reading yesterday, when no objection was raised to the principles of this Bill, but a few questions were put to me in regard to details, I undertook to reply to these to-day in the Committee Stage. As regards clause 1, the hon. member for Salt River asked for the assurance that the necessary care would be taken that ships which are attached and which are then moved by the harbour authorities will be firmly moored. I can give the hon. member the assurance that this is being done. It is also in the interests of the harbour authorities themselves that those boats are firmly moored.</p>

<p>I move, as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Third Time.</p>

<p>I should just like to furnish a reply to a question which the hon. member for East London (North) put to me. He is of the opinion that the compensation paid in terms of clause 2 for animals which are run over and killed by a train is, in certain cases, inadequate. I just want to point out that the amendment which is being proposed here is only being introduced in order to bring this provision of the Act into line with a provision which was accepted in 1966 in regard to animals killed or injured during the journey. It would therefore be unsatisfactory to effect a change in the prices of the value of animals, because they would then differ from the provisions which were adopted in 1966. The prices accepted then, which are also being proposed here, are prices which were agreed upon with the S.A. Agricultural Union and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. I readily concede that one can argue about the values attached to those animals, but almost every animal has its value. One finds a basis on which one can work, and determines the values according to that basis. When one conveys pedigree animals such as racehorses or stud animals by rail then it pays, as the hon. member quite rightly remarked, to have the animals insured, and if one then suffers losses one can institute a claim at the highest value which one placed on that animal.</p>

<p>The hon. member also put a question in regard to the fencing in of railway lines. This is not relevant either, but I can merely inform the hon. member that it is the policy, where possible, to fence in an entire section, but it depends upon the priorities, and it also depends upon whether the funds are available to undertake that work. I can give the hon. member the assurance that the Railways Administration are as anxious as he is to fence in the railways completely, if it is within its capacity to do so and that they also want to do so as quickly as possible, (because this would also indemnify us against payment of damages.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member asked what the position was in regard to veld fires. It is true that veld fires not only cause the death of animals, but that it also causes damage to grazing and to trees and even, to buildings, and it is obvious that when animals, are also involved, the matter must be dealt with on its merits. This is in fact being done in practice.</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>I desire to complete what I was saying last night. I had got to the point of asking the Minister what preparations had been made in regard to what are called the jumbo jets. I had said that it was reliably stated in the travel world that if a party of 60 was to come to South Africa during a busy period, it would be very difficult to accommodate them as regards hotel accommodation, transport, and everything else that they need. In other words, you have to give a year&#x2019;s or two years&#x2019; notice. The importance of this is that a prospective traveller going to an agent overseas makes inquiries about South Africa and he is told that arrangements cannot be made for him to visit this or that part but that they can be made if he wishes to go somewhere else. Then he says that this is the trip he wants to do, and if he cannot do the trip he has in mind then he is not going to South Africa; or it may not even get as far as making the inquiries to see whether accommodation is available. The agent may just say that it is very difficult at this time of the year, but seeing the traveller wants to go to the sunshine, what about going to the Caribbean, because the agent says he knows he can confirm the bookings, transport and everything else by the next day. The result is that South Africa loses a prospective tourist. I believe that is happening, to what extent one does not know. But it is happening to quite an extent overseas, and people who have the desire to come to this country are not coming because it is considered that the facilities are not readily available at the time they want to come. I gave that illustration to show that we are not really ready for this jumbo jet age when some 500 people at a time can come, and come very frequently. What preparations is the Minister making, and what action is he taking to prepare South Africa for that age? It is stated, for instance, this year that in the travel world there is an explosion in the East. Malaysia and those countries are experiencing a travel boom that they have never experienced before. It might quite easily happen to South Africa if we were ready for it, if we were prepared to accept the traveller. It is one of those conumdrums: Which comes first, the egg or the chicken? Do you wait until the people are on you to provide the facilities, or do you start Providing the facilities so that they may come and enjoy themselves? That is the difficulty. What I want to know from the Minister is what his thoughts are on this matter, and what action he is taking.</p>

<p>In regard to the hotels in particular, we have had emphasis up to now on the prestige hotel, which is acceptable; it should be done. I believe that they are now provided, and it may be that this has even been overdone, but they should be there. However, the real need in the hotel industry is to have hotels of the middle class, the cheaper hotels, because the bulk of the travelling public patronise those hotels. As far as one can see by observation &#x2014;I have not the figures before me&#x2014;those hotels are disappearing. We know of our own observation in Cape Town that they have disappeared and have become flats to a very large extent. We know that in Durban hotels are going out of business and are becoming holiday flats and no longer hotels, and that is happening in various parts of the country. The real need is to provide those hotels which attract the middle class person, people who constitute the greatest numbers as far as travel is concerned. There is a limited public as far as the prestige hotels are concerned, and they are provided for at the moment. I believe the Minister should take some action in that regard. There is a provision under the Hotels Act that certain moneys can be lent to provide amenities for hotels, but the difficulty is that the hotels must have a grade before the moneys can be advanced. What happens to the people who want to start hotels initially? One of the most difficult things is to raise money for the hotel industry. It is well-nigh impossible to raise the money through private enterprise. I ask the Minister to direct his attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter. There is the question of creating a greater interest in our country and concentrating less on the general attractions of the country, but having what I call &#x201C;interest tours&#x201D;. That is a movement that is taking place in the rest of the world. For instance, recently there was a trip to the Antarctic, under the leadership of Peter Scott, who took a number of people all the way to the Antarctic just to see the Antarctic. There was also a trip recently to Greenland to see the flora and fauna and the bird-life of Greenland. People are prepared to travel far afield in the interest of their own hobby, to see what is happening in other parts of the world. It is a development which is taking place and on which I think we should capitalize in this country. We have a great deal to offer. There is, for instance, our fishing. I am told that we have the finest game fishing in the world around the shores of South Africa, and people will travel halfway around the world to get one or two game fish and in doing so they spend tremendous sums of money. The amount of money spent by a man who wants to catch a game fish somewhere in the world is amazing. It is the same with hunting. There is no reason why in this country, through the co-operation of farmers and others, we could not have places where hunters would come to get a specimen of certain wild animals. It would not be to our detriment; it would not affect our wild life, but in the course of doing that tremendous sums of money would be spent in South Africa. It is a question of <span class="col_6191-6192" refersTo="page_0300"/>organizing trips also on which the emphasis is photographic. In East Africa to-day there are trips, at least arriving weekly and sometimes daily, purely organized on the basis of taking photographs, under the auspices of certain safari companies, and they are drawing large crowds of people to East Africa. East Africa has nothing better than we can offer in South Africa, and such trips could be organized. Take the archaeological position. We have some of the most famous people in this country in that sphere, but what do they do? They go as directors of trips to Israel and the Mediterranean to show people the archaeological sites and lecture to them. I do not know how much we have to offer in this regard, but I think we probably have a great deal to offer. There is no reason why one cannot get those persons interested and organize such trips in this country, bringing people from overseas. I give these examples simply to make the point that there is a wide field to be ploughed. What is being done about it?</p>

<p>Finally, there is one rather lesser point in regard to chartered aircraft. I understand the Minister has made representations in regard to this matter and the answer has been an emphatic no. I may be wrong; I am subject to correction and information from the Minister, but I believe that the answer has been an emphatic no to chartered aircraft in this country. The S.A.A. do not want to know about it. I read that somewhere. I want to know what the likelihood is of that aspect developing because it forms a very large part of the tourist industry in other countries. When the party is large enough an aircraft is chartered and there is no difficulty about it. I understand that in the past there has been difficulty about this, and I think it was also mentioned in one of the Satour reports. I believe that is a development which could take place and I should like to hear from the Minister what is being done about that.</p>

<p>What I said last night and what I have said here this afternoon are efforts to put forward constructive criticism to find out what the Minister is doing. If he will tell us what he is doing and, as I said last night, what his successes are, what obstacles he has, he could create a public opinion in favour of the things he wants to do. If I may say so, he is too silent on many of these things; we want to hear about them, we want to talk about them and create the right climate so the right things can be done in the interests of the tourist industry.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis will probably not take it amiss of me if I do not follow up on what he has said, but unfortunately my time will not allow me to do so. Last night when the House adjourned I was discussing the tourist industry in South Africa. America, which does everything on a large scale, and even boasts on a large scale, is proud of the fact that the redwood trees in California are the biggest trees in the world. They also allege that the Grand Canyon is one of the greatest natural wonders of the world. But it is not only America which can boast about such things, because here in South Africa we have some of the tallest trees in the world. I am referring to the tremendous yellow wood trees in the Tsitsikama Forest, which are probably as much of a natural wonder. Between the small towns of Leydsdorp and Gravelotte we also find some of the largest baobab or cream of tartar trees in the world. Some of them are so large that in the old days the gold diggers of Leydsdorp hollowed out one of the trees and used it as a wine cellar to keep their liquor cool in that warm climate.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the Blyde River canyon. This is probably one of the most impressive natural sights in South Africa. I have met tourists who had seen the Grand Canyon in America, and they assured me that the Blyde River canyon compared very favourably with, if it was not better than, the Grand Canyon in America. So I can continue. We should also include South West Africa here. We also have botanical and natural wonders in that area. Here I am referring to that living fossil, the welwitzia plant. I believe that those who are interested in botany would come from far and wide to see such a sight. It is something quite out of the ordinary and that is the only place in the world where those plants grow.</p>

<p>Our country has been richly endowed with natural wonders, but tourists do not only want to go to see natural wonders. Their only desire is not to look at wonderful trees. They also want to look at human achievements. In that field we also have something to offer the tourist. I am referring in this regard to the trek route followed years ago by Louis Trichardt when the Voortrekkers crossed the Drakensberg. If we can organize walking tours for our domestic tourists and students to enable them to follow that route, then we would have gone far in depicting our history to people graphically. This would undoubtedly be something impressive, historic, as well as educational.</p>

<p>I come now to another matter, and this is in fact the point I want to make. If we want to attract overseas visitors, we must of course build good luxury hotels for them, hotels of an international standard. However, we must also supply the necessary facilities for everyone according to his own pocket, and not only for the rich man. Not all tourists coming here are millionaires. We have visitors here who cannot afford to stay in the large, expensive hotels, and I am now advocating that cheaper accommodation be made available in our country for that group, the middle income group. We must remember that it is not only the rich tourists who are possible immigrants. I think it is precisely those tourists from the <span class="col_6193-6194" refersTo="page_0301"/>middle income and lower income groups visiting our country who are potential immigrants. After they have seen our beautiful country they may subsequently decide to settle here.</p>

<p>A party of tourists recently visited South Africa, and on the eve of their departure for Europe one of them was asked for his impressions of our country. His reply may be summarized as follows: &#x201C;You have a wonderful country, but your hotels are too expensive; the ordinary man cannot afford to stay in them.&#x201D; I think that there is a great deal of truth in that remark, and that we ought to give attention to this matter. Of course we also have many rich South Africans who tour the Republic, and consequently we must not concentrate solely on overseas tourists. They can stay in the luxury hotels. However, I want to repeat that middle and lower income group tourists cannot avail themselves of those expensive facilities. We must make it possible for the lesser privileged people, who are also entitled to a holiday, to enjoy their vacations. They would also like to see our country, but owing to their low incomes, it is simply impossible for them to afford accommodation for their families in an expensive hotel. Nor do they have the means of acquiring a motorcar and caravan, for that, too, costs a lot of money. They are therefore dependent upon public transport, and they must consequently make use of hotel or boarding house accommodation. But the rates are so high that those people simply cannot afford them, and as a result they have to remain at home all their lives, which is of course very frustrating for someone who has, throughout his life, had to render his services to his country. I think it is our duty to make it possible for these people to undertake tours as well. I am advocating that the Department and the Hotel Board should consider establishing cheaper hotels with liquor licences for our lower income groups.</p>

<p>I shall go further. At the moment the hotel industry is falling to an increasing extent into the. hands of the trust companies, and so on, which are well provided with capital, and the danger exists that the private hotel owners, who have for many years rendered such good service to us, will be completely eliminated. I feel that we should give those people all the necessary assistance so that they can continue to render their services to the travelling public.</p>

<p>It is a very risky undertaking to build an expensive hotel along a route which will only be visited during certain times of the year. They run the risk of suffering major losses. Consequently they simply cannot see their way clear to building those expensive hotels. We must remember that the person who does in fact have a decent little hotel there, has every right to retain his liquor licence without having to incur major expense on alterations, so that he can serve the travelling public. We must see to it that we make it possible for our workers and their families to undertake tours in their own country. Tourism has such an educational value for our own people that we should expand it to a far greater extent than we are doing today.</p>

<p>In conclusion just this. Apart from what the hon. member for Von Brandis said, I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Secretary of the Department, with his handful of officials, on what they have already achieved up to the present. We want to wish them every success, and we hope that they will receive the necessary support in order to expand their Department into one which will prove to be one of the best sources of income in our country.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to two speeches made by hon. members on that side of the House. In the main they both stressed the economic importance of the tourist industry to South Africa. They made the point that South Africa at this particular stage was not receiving its fair share of the tourist trade. Then they pleaded that the department should do everything in its power to encourage and promote the flow of tourists to South Africa. Quite obviously I must agree with all these sentiments.</p>

<p>While it is of course very encouraging to read in various reports that the tourist traffic in South Africa is expected to reach the record figure of 300,000 in 1968, we should not allow ourselves to fall into a mood of complacency because of this very welcome increase in our tourist figures. I say this because in the same year of 1968 more than 85 million individuals will visit and tour other countries and they will spend the colossal amount of more than R8 billion in the process. I draw attention to these figures merely to show that unfortunately South Africa still lags far behind in the very lucrative field of international tourism. I want to say in all fairness that the South African Tourist Corporation has done a truly magnificent job in stimulating the flow of tourists to South Africa. There is no doubt in my mind that the steady increase in the flow of tourists from 68,000 in 1947 to 275,000 in 1967 is due mainly to the efforts of this body. But we must remember too that the South African Tourist Corporation has to work within the confines of a very tight budget which is voted yearly by Parliament, so they can quite obviously only do what their budget will allow them to do under the circumstances. I believe that the Minister of Tourism and his department should appreciate the fact that international tourism has to-day become big business and a very competitive business. I believe that if South Africa is to fully exploit its vast tourist potential to the stage where we can count our tourists in millions instead of thousands, the Minister of Tourism and his department will have to approach their task of promoting tourism with a far greater degree of urgency than they have shown in the five years of their existence. Because tourism as <span class="col_6195-6196" refersTo="page_0302"/>such does not represent a clear-cut sector of our economy we are all inclined to underestimate its great economic value to South Africa. There can be no doubt that South Africa to-day has to a certain extent missed the boat when it comes to international tourism. Any expert in the field of tourism will tell you that for a country to sell itself as a major tourist attraction the bodies and organizations charged with the task of promoting tourism should apply their minds in the first instance to four main essentials. Firstly they should see to it that the natural resources of the country and the existing tourist attractions are developed to the fullest extent. Then they must see to it that these attractions are publicized continuously in the right quarters and through the right channels. Then they must make sure that enough capital is made available to make this possible. When I mention capital I do not mean that this capital should come only from the central Government. I think it is a known fact that the private sector stands to benefit most from any increased flow of tourism. We should look to the private sector to make a far greater contribution to the promotion of tourism than they are doing today. There should also be continuous efforts on the part of all these departments and bodies to encourage and promote greater community participation because you will find that this is really what brings tourists to a country. I want to mention one example. The island of Mallorca just off the coast of Spain is only 30 by 40 miles in extent. It has a population roughly the size of that of Cape Town, namely 500,000. This little island has increased its number of tourists from 800,000 in 1953 to 1,600,000 in 1964. The point is that, of this population of 500,000, we find that 200,000 are in fact subscribing members to the publicity associations on that island. This shows what can be done when the community in a particular area is called in to do a job of work. Fourthly these organizations should see to it that only people with the specialized knowledge of tourism and who also have the required managerial abilities should be employed in key posts in tourist organizations. There is no need for me to stress the fact that South Africa is very richly endowed with natural tourist attractions. Let us take as an example the Western Cane. I want to ask how many prospective tourists overseas realize for instance that we have here a truly Mediterranean climate. How many tourists realize that if they come to South Africa they can expect on an average 2,750 hours of sunshine each year? Do they realize that this amount of sunshine equals the amount they can expect on the famous Florida Keys and that it in fact surpasses what they can expect in famous tourist resorts such as the Riviera, Southern California and even the fabulous Hawaii?</p>

<p>I have mentioned the question of community participation. I should now like the hon. the Minister to tell me whether he is satisfied that the various regional and other committees that he has established are doing the job of encouraging the local people to participate more actively in the encouragement of tourism. Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has done anything at all to see to it that the private sector does in fact contribute more capital for the promotion of tourism for the reasons I have stated earlier.</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will tell us whether he has investigated the possibility of creating special courses in this country, and this is being done in other countries overseas, where people who are interested in tourism and who want to make a career of tourism can study subjects such as tourist law, tourist geography, anthropology, languages and archaeology. These things are all very important because there can be no doubt that unless you have the proper personnel you will never really exploit your country&#x2019;s tourist potential successfully. I think that this comment by an expert in this field bears reading. This particular expert says:</p>

<block name="quote">It is no longer sufficient to entrust to unsuitable and unqualified persons the task of presenting our tourist attractions to the world, for in the inept hands of the doleful attendant, bus driver or guide lies the greatest threat to the success of our tourist ventures.<br/>These persons should be adequately equipped to relate faithfully and accurately not only that which is relevant to a particular tourist attraction but should be able to answer, correctly, intelligently and in a pleasing manner, questions on other aspects of our history, culture and mode of living.</block>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I raise some specific points. I want to associate myself with the congratulations offered to the hon. the Minister and his officials this afternoon for the first-class way in which they have promoted tourism in this country in the past year, sometimes under difficult circumstances, and also with a limited budget. The work done by Satour and also the Hotel (Board deserves our highest commendation. The mere fact that our tourist industry is now worth some R160 million a year in foreign exchange and also the fact that the tourists coming from Europe only, increased from 18,000 in 1961 to some 60,000 in 1967, is ample proof of the good work that Satour has been doing overseas. Because I know that the hon. the Minister is as keen as anybody else to promote tourism and to get it into absolute top gear in this country, I know that he will not take amiss any criticisms and some suggestions which I want to raise here this afternoon.</p>

<p>The first aspect which I want to raise, is that I think that the elimination of the division in control of internal and external tourism between divergent bodies in this country will do much to streamline our efforts at tourist promotion. I think that too many people have <span class="col_6197-6198" refersTo="page_0303"/>their own ideas about how tourism should be promoted in South Africa, and I think it has become a definite necessity that there should be greater co-ordination between the different bodies. I feel a central co-ordinating body, perhaps a Tourist Promotion Organization should be established on which all the different provinces should be represented, as well as the municipalities, the National Parks Board, the hotel industry, the South African Airways, Satour, the Department of Information, Die Handelsinstituut, Assocom and all other bodies that may be interested in promoting tourism. Such a tourist promotion organization should, I feel, meet at least four times a year and iron out all promotion snags which may arise in the different bodies represented on this central organization. I know that I will be treading on dangerous ground, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he could not consult with his colleague, the Minister of Justice, about our liquor laws, so that they could be made more flexible. Why cannot our liquor be served after 12 o&#x2019;clock at night in some places as well? Why cannot tourists drink some of our fine wines in our caf&#x00E9;s and restaurants, and why must liquor, according to law, only be consumed on hotel steps, and not also for example, at swimming pools?</p>

<p>Another matter to which I want to refer is the possible establishment of a large free international trading centre at a place like Jan Smuts Airport, an international airport, where tourists will be in a position to buy at the very last moment, if they so desire, all the wonderful souvenirs and gifts which our country can offer. I also want to ask the hon. the Minister to do everything possible to draw the best staff into his department, and also to ask Satour to do the same, especially staff who are absolutely proficient in as many languages as possible. I have heard complaints that there are some officials who have not been able to serve overseas tourists, for example Germans, Italians and French people, in their own language. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that these people come here to spend their money and that they are entitled to be served in the language which they speak. As a matter of fact I wonder whether we should not treat our tourist industry as seriously as Spain is doing at present. Spain has been mentioned here. I think Spain is an example to the whole world. It has legislation, for example, which compels firms to give their employees annually 25 days leave out of season. That is done in order to promote all-the-year-round tourism in Spain. Spain, as a matter of fact, has been so successful that she now draws annually some 19 million tourists. She earns as much from her tourist industry as the gold we produce from our mines.</p>

<p>Another aspect which I want to raise, and which the hon. member for Von Brandis also touched on briefly, is whether we could not perhaps pay more attention to accommodating visiting tourists in private homes, on the same lines that Switzerland and France are doing at the moment. I think the Minister will agree that one does not really get to know a country and its people well if one stays in the resplendent hotels of that country. But it is when one is living with private people that one really gets to know the people and gets an insight into the way of life of that country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis mentioned the extra attraction for tourists of perhaps participating in hunting trips. I think that that is an excellent idea, and I wonder whether that could not be followed up. We all know that thousands of Americans beat a dusty path on safari to East Africa to go on these hunting trips. I am sure that if a hunting trip is included in say a packaged tourist deal to South Africa and on a very cheap basis, we would be able to draw tremendous numbers of people from overseas to our country. I think nowhere in the world can one go on a hunting trip as cheaply as in South Africa; it is probably the cheapest hunting country in the world at the moment. Only a few days ago I read in the papers that the National Parks Board intend to do some large-scale culling of excessive impala, wildebeest, buffalo and elephant in the Kruger Park. I am fold that there are some 20,000 redundant impala in the park, and I wondered whether the hon. the Minister could not persuade the National Parks Board to allow tourists the opportunity of shooting one or two of these impala at say R50 a head. I think that would entice people from all over the world to come to our country.</p>

<p>Before I sit down, I want to raise a few other brief points with the hon. the Minister. There is the question of publicity by means of posters. My predecessor in this House once advocated that the Clifton bikini girls should be put on posters. Well, I want to say that I think that is an absurd idea.</p>

<p>The image that has been created of South Africa, as far as tourism is concerned, is that of a country where Bantu tribal life and animal wild life can still be seen abundantly. I think that our tourist organizations should put the emphasis on this.</p>

<p>A second point I want to raise is whether it is not possible in the future to compile a register of all the tourist attractions in this country. That will enable our travel agencies here and abroad to tell prospective tourists exactly what attractions this country can offer. I also want to ask the Minister whether the time has not arrived for the Central Government to develop more intensively the many inland holiday resorts which we have. There are many beautiful resorts which absolutely cry out for development, and it will help to take the pressure off the over-populated ones, like the Kruger National Park. Many overseas tourists I have found wanted to visit the Kruger National Park, but they cannot get <span class="col_6199-6200" refersTo="page_0304"/>accommodation there, because South Africans are looking at the Park as some sort of prolonged holiday resort instead of just going there for a few days to see game.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it would not be a proposition to propagate our tourist attractions even more effectively overseas by scattering thousands of tourist pamphlets from the air onto cities in Europe and America, as many overseas countries have done with great effect in the past.

However, without taking up a final stand on what he said about girls, I should like to remind him that girls constitute a very large tourist attraction in many countries!

<p>However, to return to the Vote under discussion I should like to say that it is clear from the discussion so far that everybody is under the impression that South Africa is on the threshold of very big possibilities in the field of tourism. We have the attractions and we have so much else, to parody the song. But I fear our approach lacks the modernity required in a matter such as this; I fear that the Government does not display the required degree of modernity in respect of certain matters. Only think of television and of how we spurn this modern attribute. No one in his right senses would like to see our rugby techniques, for instance, become out of date; no South African would like to see our surgery falling (behind. But in other respects, such as television and to a certain extent in the field of tourism, we are prepared to take a back seat. But the time has come where we should not only think big, but also act big.</p>

<p>In the discussion on this Vote last year, the hon. member for Durban (Point) touched upon the question of the divided control over hotels. I do not think the hon. the Minister replied to that particular aspect. So I should like to advance certain thoughts on this aspect and should like to hear what the Minister&#x2019;s response is thereto. In the light of the need for action and a modern approach to this developing possibility, I should like to plead with the Government to place all hotels under the control of one authority, namely the Hotel Board, as soon as their initial classification has been completed. Let the National Liquor Board by all means complete its classification; but having done that, it would have discharged its main purpose. Let the off-sales liquor facilities of hotels by all means remain controlled by local liquor boards. But (beyond that, surely the time has come for us to have the control over hotels placed fairly and squarely under the Hotel Board itself. For that it may be necessary that it be given additional powers and that certain other aspects be brought under its wing. But it has been established, and it has been operating well, and has the goodwill of the industry. It should therefore (be entrusted with this task. Of course one realizes that the hon. the Minister cannot bring about this transformation single-handed. However, there is no reason to doubt his ability to persuade the Minister of Justice. The hon. the Minister of Justice can be very amenable, and I trust this hon. Minister may find him in such an amenable mood on this matter. I suggest that this matter has become urgent. It has been shown that there is an unprecedented need for hotels, both from the point of view of overseas visitors and from the point of view of our local people, who are travelling more and more. What causes concern is that there has been an unprecedented reduction in the number of hotels in (South Africa. I do not know whether this was the intention when legislation controlling the hotel industry was introduced. I cannot (believe that it was the intention.</p>

<p>At any rate, this is a most unfortunate feature of the effects of that legislation and of the introduction of a &#x201C;new deal&#x201D;, that we are losing hotels at an unprecedented rate. I am informed that by the end of the year about 500 hotels will not have been classified. This will mean that these hotels will lose their right to supply spirits, which in turn will mean that many of them will go out of business, thus bringing about a still further reduction of the number of hotels. Like any other business, hotels too are looking primarily for a return on their investments; and, if they do not get that return, they may sell out. They may occupy a valuable business site for which they may get a good price. As a matter of fact, this has already happened to a large extent. Then of course there are other difficulties&#x2014;such as the availability of Bantu labour in the Western Province. Then there is the multiplicity of controlling bodies with which hotels have to cope. This is affecting hoteliers not only through the cost involved but also through the wear and tear on their nerves. From an industry that has been one of the least controlled, it has become one of the most controlled industries to-day. Let me mention some of these controlling bodies.</p>

<p><span class="col_6201-6202" refersTo="page_0305"/>There is, first of all, the Hotel Board. This board has to carry out the original grading inspection and annual inspections thereafter. But this may still be perfectly acceptable. On top of that, however, we have the National Liquor Board which has to do the initial classification and a further classification every three years thereafter. Such classifications involve a considerable inquiry into the affairs of an hotel and can involve an hotel in considerable extra expense. Then there are the local liquor licensing boards who have to grant licences which have to be renewed every year. Such a renewal is of course not automatic, as certain requirements can be insisted upon before a licence will be renewed. There is also the likelihood of police inspection and continual police surveillance. Apart from all these factors, there is the multiple licence required by hotels&#x2014; about 20 licences in all, whereas the Hotel Commission recommended that there should be only one licence covering all these.</p>

<p>Consequently there is a feeling amongst hoteliers that they are being policed rather than assisted and guided. This is not a happy frame of mind under which to continue in this very important industry. If overseas countries can do without such multiple controls, then surely it ought to be possible for us in this modern age to do so too. We have good hotels, like hotels overseas where there is not this multiple control. Surely the basic factor determining and guaranteeing the standard of our hotels is the patronage of the public. Members of the public are very conscious of what is a good hotel and what is not and they will withdraw their patronage if the standard drops.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the. hon. the Minister whether or not he is thinking in the direction of making the Hotel Board the only authority over the hotel industry. The hotel industry fully supports this board and favours such a change. I fear that if this wish is ignored any longer it may lead to more hotels closing in the time to come. This is a worrying possibility especially when we are on the threshold of attracting far more people to this country. I know there are reasons why this multiplicity of controls were maintained in the past, but I should like the hon. the Minister to think boldly, to act boldly and cut the knot in this situation.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on both sides of the House commented in their speeches on the development of tourism, which is becoming an important industry. The general consensus of opinion is that it should be developed even more extensively in order to keep pace with the world-wide explosion which is occurring in the field of tourism today. But most of the speakers think in terms of external tourism, i.e. tourists from, overseas countries, and are somewhat remiss in giving some attention to internal tourism as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to refer to something which I read in the Press early in February in regard to a national congress of tourism which was to have taken place on 18th March this year at Oudtshoorn. According to the report a motion was to have been introduced there to the effect that a statutory national advisory board should be established to promote tourism and publicity. The idea was that such an advisory board would have a more co-ordinating effect on the liaison between tourism and publicity associations. It was felt that there are individual associations which are doing good work, but that there was unnecessary overlapping. We know that one of the most important tasks of the Department of Tourism is in fact to act in a co-ordinating capacity. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in regard to this congress which was to have been held, whether the congress was in fact held and whether such a board, as was mentioned in the Press, has been established; whether the Department played any part in regard to the congress; and if such a board has been established, how it functions. I would be glad if the hon. the Minister could give us a little information in that regard, since the question of co-ordination has also been mentioned here to-day.</p>

<p>I would also like to touch upon another matter in regard to the hotel industry. Recently it has come to our notice that members of the public, tourists and travellers, are complaining about a new practice which is now coming into force in our hotels, i.e. to add a so-called service charge to the hotel account. We have also read in the Press that this practice has in general met with disfavour. The Hotel Board, under the chairmanship of Dr. Wiehan, has also given attention to this matter and has recently expressed itself strongly against this levying of a service charge at hotels. The hotel owners alleged that this service levy is in fact a service fee, or as they call it in English, a &#x201C;service charge&#x201D; which is levied and is then apparently distributed evenly amongst the staff of the hotel, from the room servant to the cook. What it amounts to is a method of charging a compulsory tip. The question is for what reason that so-called service charge is being levied, because after all the hotel account also includes the salaries of the staff. Surely it has nothing to do with a tip. After all, the tourist, visitor or guest at the hotel has the option of deciding whether he wants to give a tip or not. If he is served well and receives courteous treatment from the waiter and other servants, he will gladly give such a tip. It seems to me as though this system is simply being used to disguise an increase in hotel tariffs, and this can in due course lead to malpractices. It is difficult to believe that this service fee is in fact equally distributed amongst the staff, as is being professed. I also read somewhere that this malpractice has made its appearance in South West Africa and that it was prohibited there. The Legislative Assembly of South West Africa passed an Ordinance in this regard last year. In the Ordinance wide powers are conferred upon the Department of Nature Conservation and Tourism in regard to the <span class="col_6203-6204" refersTo="page_0306"/>grading, subsidizing and control of hotels. These powers are so wide that the Department in question can also take steps to encourage the tourist industry in South West Africa. In this regard I should like to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister. I want to ask him whether his Department, or whether he as Minister of Tourism, have any powers to prohibit this unwelcome practice, whether he or his Department can delegate powers to the Hotel Board to counter this practice, and whether the Provincial Councils have the right to promulgate ordinances in order to put a stop to this practice?</p>

<p>In addition I should like to ask the Minister what progress has been made in general with the classification and grading of hotels, and whether it will be possible for all hotels to have been classified or graded by the end of 1968?</p>

<p>Then, just one last remark: We know that internal tourism has increased tremendously during the last decade. Our people have become more tour conscious. I should like to raise a plea here for a matter which was also mentioned in passing by the hon. member for Lydenburg but which I should like to elaborate on. I should like to see an appeal being made to internal tourists to visit places of historical value when they are on holiday or go on tour. It so happens that many of the places which have an historical background and are of historical value, are in fact situated in the most attractive parts of our country&#x2014; parts which in themselves offer tourist attractions. If one were to visit some of these places of historical value, where visitors&#x2019; books are made available for signature, then it is remarkable how many overseas tourists visit these historical places in our country while our internal tourists drive swiftly past and do not even know that such places exist. One wonders whether it cannot be explicitly stated in brochures which are distributed by the various regional committees that there are such places on certain routes which are in fact worth visiting.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that I should cover some of the points raised in the debate so far, and that I should rather start at the end of the discussions than at the beginning, particularly as the hon. Chief Whip has indicated that he will be back shortly. I Shall therefore start with the hon. member for Pineland sand then come back to the hon. member for Koedoespoort.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands raised a matter which I consider one of important policy, and that is what he referred to as the divided control of hotels. He suggested that I should talk to the Minister of Justice and that some arrangement should be made between him and me. Of course that is exactly what has taken place already. I do not know whether the hon. member read it, but the hon. the Minister of Justice had a deputation from Fedhasa, who discussed with him this problem of divided control, and his attitude, in my opinion, was the correct one. We had discussed it before. He said that he was quite prepared eventually to hand over the hotels, as the hon. member suggested, to the Hotel Board and to the Department of Tourism, and from that point of view not necessarily bring them under the jurisdiction of the National Liquor Board&#x2014;or shall I say that the methods which are applied at present through the Department of Justice might not necessarily be applied in future. But he rightly said that when he and I were satisfied that we were in a position to take over that function which is at present performed by Justice, he would then give the matter his further consideration. I mention this because it is a major policy issue, and I might say that the members of Fedhasa&#x2019;s deputation were satisfied with that reply because they also realized, as the hon. member realizes, that just to move over machinery which has been in operation, to a Department which is not equipped to operate it, would not be justified. But his view was that he did not dogmatically oppose it, and they were satisfied and I was more than satisfied with this approach of his. I think the hon. member for Pinelands will therefore appreciate that this is something affecting future policy.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the Minister whether he is setting in train moves to put himself into the position to take over that work?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I would say to the hon. member for Pinelands that my attitude up to the present has been that I did not want to completely overwhelm my Department and the Hotel Board with functions which they were not in a position to perform, and that the essential function was to register and grade hotels and to endeavour to improve the standard of hotels. Therefore I wanted them to fulfil that particular task first of all, and as we go on our idea is, in consultation with the Minister of Justice, to see to what extent we can fit ourselves into a pattern which may be the pattern for the future of the hotel industry as such. So if the hon. member wants to know whether I have anybody trained in the Department to do that particular job, my answer is no, but eventually, if this job is handed over to the Department and by the Department to the Hotel Board, obviously one would have to have personnel to do this task. But the idea is to simplify the situation and not to complicate it. That is the attitude, I am sure, which the hotel industry itself wants. So we do not think in terms of having all the inspections and the complications that apply at present. We are trying to simplify the situation. The hon. member is quite right when he says that the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s report referred to the multiplicity of licences and suggested that there should be one hotel licence to cover these. These are matters which will eventually be handled, but the immediate <span class="col_6205-6206" refersTo="page_0307"/>task was to ensure that there should be some basis of registering and grading and improving the standards of hotels in this country to meet the development of tourism here.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member was somewhat concerned about the hotels themselves. He indicated that the information he has was that the new rules and regulations applying to hotels resulted in 500 hotels going out of business and so being lost to the industry, because they failed to classify. I want to point out, as the hon. the Minister of Justice pointed out to the Committee at one stage, that an hotel need not do a thing and still could sell malt and wine, but if it wants to sell spirits it has to conform to certain standards. In addition to that, if it meets with those standards it can also practically automatically get an off-sales licence. The hon. member referred to 500 hotels that may be lost to the industry and to tourism. I have also seen these figures appearing in the Press, and I asked the Hotel Board to give me their assessment of the position and they said that they anticipated that it would be less than 150 hotels which would fail to classify. But those hotels can still operate with wine and malt licences. Let us be frank. If you want to improve the hotel industry in this country, you cannot immediately bring them all in. If you must have grading, you must accept that certain hotels will not be able to be graded. With classification under the conditions set by the Liquor Board there may be certain hotels that cannot classify, and they will lose their spirit licences, but they may still sell wine and malt.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Even if they have not operated in the past, they can still qualify for a wine and malt licence?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not sure of that. That is a matter which the Liquor Board will have to decide. That does not fall within my portfolio at all. I have just given the situation as it applies as far as I am concerned, in regard to the number of hotels in the country, because although I am concerned with the number of hotels, I am also concerned with the standard of accommodation, and that is what South Africa has lacked. The hon. member for Von Brandis knows what his inquiry led to and, he knows what was stated in the report of the last Hotel Commission. It said that certain hotels were not really hotels but just liquor outlets. Of course, if we want to meet the demands for accommodation by tourists, we will just have to accept the situation where some of them will have to go out. Some of them maintain bedrooms only to comply with the Liquor Act. They did not want anybody to stay in their hotels. In fact, they did not welcome people. If you came there, they said they had no accommodation, although the place was probably empty. That is my general answer to the hon. member for Pinelands.</p>

<p>I see the hon. member for Von Brandis is now back. Perhaps I can now handle the matters he raised in the beginning of this discussion. He spoke, first of all, of this &#x201C;Cinderella Department&#x201D;. I am not sure whether he used the word &#x201C;neglected&#x201D;, but he gave the impression that it was a Department which was handled very poorly, like Cinderella, and after all Cinderella was a very neglected little girl.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member and other hon. members on that side of the House: Let us be realistic when we approach this matter. The amount now devoted to Satour, for instance, which is an essential feature of tourism, is R1&#x00BD; million. I want to point out to hon. members that in the year 1947-&#x2019;48 less than R90,000 was devoted to Satour. To-day it is as much as R1&#x00BD; million. She must have been a very lucky Cinderella; 12 o&#x2019;clock must have struck between then and now for her to get an amount like this. I am quite prepared to listen to criticism, and I will deal with some of the criticism raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis. But I really think he is exaggerating when he refers to this Department as a Cinderella department.</p>

<p>As regards tourism, I do not want to pretend for a moment that this country can compete with France, Italy or Spain when it comes to drawing tourists. I extracted some figures in this regard and I want to show how many tourists came to this country from outside. In 1947-&#x2019;48 we had something like 68,000 whereas to-day we have reached the 300,000 mark per year.</p>

<p>This is an important figure, and I should like to ask the Minister this question. I think the figure for 1966 is <span class="col_6207-6208" refersTo="page_0308"/>just over 250,000. What is the figure for the calendar year 1967? I have not seen the figure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The figure was 275,000 for that year. What I am trying to show hon. members is that the growth of tourism in this country has been quite considerable. It has not been static; it has not been neglected. The hon. member for Durban (Point) in his usual jovial way said &#x201C;We will have to get a new Minister&#x201D; or something like that, when someone on that side spoke about disappointing tourist results. But of course it is not so. I do not want to say that because I have been in charge of this Department, the tourist figures have increased so much. There has been an effective growth from year to year and this Government has always accepted that tourism must be developed. After all, it was this Government which established a Department of Tourism. I know the hon. member for Durban (Point) feels that the portfolio was created so that I could have a job, that it was only a home-made job for me. That is not so. The Department was established because the Prime Minister was satisfied that tourism was becoming a very important factor in world economics. What is more, this Department created the Hotel Board. The hon. member for Von Brandis was anxious to have a hotel board years ago and sat on a commission in that regard when the United Party was in power, but his Government did not establish a Hotel Board. This Government did it. And so this Government will go on improving the position. Therefore I say I am anxious to have criticism which can help towards improving the tourist industry still further. The hon. member for Pinelands talked about the problems which face hotels, and I have great sympathy for them. I felt this was a basis on which one could approach the future. I felt it would improve the lot of the hotels, it would make them more attractive for tourists, and I think in that way more accommodation would be available to people in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis said he was a little disappointed with the approach of the Hotel Board to gradings because the emphasis was not placed on service. But in fact the emphasis is placed on service. Indeed, more than 50 per cent of the possible 1,000 points for grading are based directly or indirectly on the type of service supplied by the hotel concerned. Hoteliers have complained because they cannot get classified, but it is because they cannot meet the physical demands or else they do not meet the service demands. We are determined to place emphasis on service. If one goes overseas one realizes how important service in an hotel is. We must not forget that Europe does cater very well for tourists. One of the important features of those hotels in the type of service given. Our hoteliers must learn that good service must be given, and if they do not provide satisfactory service, then they will not be given grading. There are no arguments about it. Certain people have said we should be slack about our requirements. It has been said I must be concerned because a number of hotels cannot be registered. Well, I am not concerned, because I cannot register a liquor-serving hotel unless it has been classified. I say that is how it should be. Let the hotel know it is lacking in certain features and if it wants to become graded and registered, then it must conform to certain physical and certain service requirements. Let me repeat what the Minister of Justice said about being classified in category E, namely that it is not such a tremendous problem. It has really been completely exaggerated. It is laid down, <i>inter alia,</i> that 25 per cent of the hotel&#x2019;s bedrooms must have a bathroom or a similar amenity. It is not necessary for a hotel to have say 50 bedrooms. If three of a 12-bedroomed hotel&#x2019;s bedrooms comply with this requirement, then the hotel can meet classification on that aspect and could be registered as a one-star hotel if finally classified. But it must also provide other things, including service to attain this.</p>

<p>As regards loans to hotels, the Government has made the position quite clear. It will not through the Hotel Board lend money to hotels to assist them in becoming classified. That is the financial responsibility of the hotel concerned. I want to point out to hon. members that it is not such a great hardship. After all, various industries in this country are developed by private capital, and the hotel industry has also been developed by private capital up to now. The Government however went further. It established the Hotel Board and gave hotels certain guarantees so that this Board could raise money. This guarantee meant that the amount of R20 million could be raised. It was prepared to lend money to improve only registered hotels. If an hotel became classified and was automatically registered with a one-star grading then it could put its case to the Hotel Board and ask for money to use on improvements because it desired to earn a higher grading. It could obtain that money.</p>

<p>Hon. members spoke of luxury hotels, of international hotels. There are only two such international hotels in the country. The Government assisted them by guaranteeing certain loans in conjunction with the local council. Both hotels are in Johannesburg, namely the President Hotel which is in operation and which is a magnificent hotel of prestige value, and the Carlton Centre which is in the process of being built. The Carlton Centre is going to have the same luxury standards as the other hotel, and I understand it is going to have 600 bedrooms as against the President Hotel&#x2019;s 300 bedrooms. Those are only two features. People say the Board is only concerned about luxury hotels. That is not so, because 82 per cent of the hotels already graded are only one-star or two-star hotels. Then there are the three-star hotels. I think there is one four-star hotel and four or five five-star establishments. To me most of the hotels are what could be called reasonable hotels of one-star grading standard. I think if we want to draw and cater for tourists, we must not <span class="col_6209-6210" refersTo="page_0309"/>offer hotels of less than one-star standard, if such an establishment is to be called an hotel. The tourist could also be offered private accommodation, and we have been working on this aspect for quite a long period now. Some of our officials have visited Namaqualand to see whether there were private accommodation facilities for people who wanted to tour that area in order to see the Namaqualand flowers. It would not pay to have a hotel up there which is only occupied for three or four weeks in the year. But private accommodation could cater for those visitors. The Department has been attending to that particular aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>Further with regard to the speech of the hon. member for Von Brandis, I should like to say that this Department has always realized the necessity for research. But with the first project of research we tackled the firm concerned wanted such a large fee to do the job and it wanted to spread it over such a multiplicity of issues that we turned it down. It came to a quarter of a million rand. I did not feel that I could come to this House and ask for a quarter of a million rand for research. What is happening is that we have given certain priorities to research. We are carrying out research in regard to the tourist attractions and amenities in our country. The next research will be carried out with regard to accommodation. We will tackle each priority in turn. We feel that we can do the job more efficiently if the priorities are dealt with in that order. We will then go on to other matters requiring research. Suddenly to be faced with a blueprint of a mass of information where you cannot see the wood for the trees, is I feel not necessary at this stage. I might say to the hon. member for Von Brandis that if it becomes necessary and if we can get a job done by some outside firm I would not hesitate to do so. I would discuss the matter with Treasury especially since we have a certain amount in the Vote provided for this and I would then allow this firm to do the job. But I was not prepared to approach the Treasury in regard to a quarter of a million rand.</p>

<p>I am not sure but I know that up to now the Government has actually granted the Hotel Board certain funds to operate because it said that if it went into the finance market to-day the rate of interest would be too high. If I am not mistaken the rate of interest at which they got the money from the Government was just under 7 per cent per annum. They then lend that money to the hotel people at a low rate of interest, at 7 per cent of 7&#x00BC; per cent. This is not a profiteering game. It is done purely on the basis of helping them to finance their project.</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<p>Have they lent any money up till now?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they have. I think that they have lent just over R400,000 up to now to hotels that wanted to improve themselves. In every case it had to be an hotel that was registered. We would not register a hotel unless it was classified, namely hotels with liquor licences.</p>

<p>With regard to the regional scheme, all I can tell the hon. member for Von Brandis is that the regional scheme was originally in operation under the Provincial concept. The only difference is that whereas the regional scheme was operating through the provinces and through a provincial tourist committee, because of certain problems that arose from a fiscal point of view this matter of general tourist promotion had to be taken away from the provinces. This was not originally the idea and now the Department itself has to deal directly with the various regional committees. But we do not interfere with them and their operations still go on. In fact the Department itself is going out of its way to assist them so that they will develop even greater enthusiasm for tourism in their own areas. I might also say in regard to hotels that of the 218 hotels already graded 59 are in the platteland. Over 25 per cent of them are. therefore, actually platteland hotels while the others are town hotels. Of course this development is accelerating all the time. The Hotel Board handles applications at every one of its meetings for the grading of new hotels.</p>

<p>As far as the question of visitors from America is concerned, which the hon. member for Von Brandis also mentioned, all I can tell him is that America has now introduced certain measures to stem the flow of tourists rather than to encourage tourism from America. They have done this for financial reasons and I therefore cannot expect any appreciable increase in tourism for South Africa from America in the near future. As far as the hon. member for Koedoespoort is concerned, I should like to advise him in regard to the conference at Oudtshoorn that I was fully aware of what was going on. They are sending a deputation to see me to submit certain resolutions that were decided upon at this conference. One of the resolutions is that there should be a statutory co-ordinating committee for tourism. But I have not come to any decision in regard to this matter as yet.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of service charges, I myself feel that it is not a very healthy thing that we have imported from overseas.</p>

<p><span class="col_6211-6212" refersTo="page_0310"/>This Department took this matter up about two or three months ago. We also passed the matter on to the Hotel Board to get their views. Their views were very interesting, because serving on the Hotel Board there are three hoteliers. They said that a service charge applied to accommodation should not be allowed to continue. They felt that an hotel should not be allowed to charge a service charge on accommodation. A service oharge in a hotel restaurant should not exceed 10 per cent. If there was a service charge of 10 per cent it should be brought immediately to the notice of the customer who has to pay that service charge, instead of it being automatically included in the account. I think that that was more or less their views on the subject.</p>

<p>My own view was that unfortunately even though you pay the service charge, if you do not pay a tip you do not get the service. That is a feature of the Hotel Board&#x2019;s decision which I still want to ask them to explain to me. A service charge is for service. They also said that one cannot stop tipping. That is all very well but then I am more inclined to agree with the hon. member for Koedoespoort. A service charge is for services rendered. You do not have to make a tip as well for services rendered if a service charge is levied. This is one of the matters being discussed by my Department and the Hotel Board at the present time. The hon. member for Koedoespoort asked me what powers I had to prevent the levying of a service charge.</p>

<p>As far as I can see I have no powers whatsoever to prevent this. This is not part and parcel of the powers of the Hotel Board, or the functions I have to perform. The hon. member referred to the fact that more South Africans should visit our historical tourist attractions. I quite agree with him. In fact, many of these spots which do not necessarily appeal to overseas tourists will appeal to our own people if there are plenty of signposts to show us where they are when we go motoring, in our country. In this regard I quite agree with the hon. member. The hon. member for Turffontein spoke about Satour and the Department and I appreciate his remarks. He said that many people wanted a co-ordinating body for tourism. Of course that is basically the function of this Department. The Department is there to co-ordinate the tourist effort in this country. I would say that the meeting of a high co-ordinating body once every three months is not my idea of proper co-ordination. I think that a Department such as this can do the job properly. Through Satour. The Hotel Board and the various regional committees, we are able almost by day to day contact, co-ordinate far better than a large coordinating body which meets from time to time. I think that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) mentioned that such a body could meet four times a year. But that is not my idea of co-ordination. I think that it must be more intensive than that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein mentioned the matter of liquor laws being made more flexible, as regards cafés, restaurants and swimming baths. These are outside my particular field, and I would say that he must address these remarks to the Minister of Justice. The custom-free shop at the Jan Smuts Aerodrome is taking shape. There are some problems which are being ironed out. He talked about the staff speaking many languages. The problem of tourists with different languages. This requirement is something which we are endeavouring to meet. Up to now it has not been a problem in South Africa, because by and large the tourists who have come here had been mostly English-speaking people. But that pattern is changing. Nowadays there are Germans and French and more and more people from other parts of Europe who are coming here. I quite agree that it is essential to meet them and to discuss matters with them in their own language wherever possible. He talked about the publicity posters and the bikini girls, but I leave that to the hon. member for Pinelands, who has so much more experience than I have in that field.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is far too late, I am afraid. I think I have dealt with the points which the hon. member raised.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Lydenburg talked about the tourist attractions in South Africa, especially in the countryside. He talked particularly about the Blyde River Canyon. Of course, the province itself appreciated that. The Finance Relations Act was amended by this Government so that the provinces themselves could invest in tourist attractions and develop them, like Blyde River Canyon, for example. All I can say to him, is that it fits into the pattern which we feel is the right one, namely that the Central Government, which has its own tourist amenities, like the Kruger National Park, which comes under the Parks Board, the provincial authority, the local authority, the divisional council, and private enterprise, must also develop tourist attractions. Anybody who goes to Durban knows how much is done for the tourists by private enterprise. All these bodies we are anxious should be used as far as tourist attractions are concerned. I think the hon. member, although he accepted luxury hotels as part and parcel of the pattern in South Africa, has an exaggerated idea of their importance as far as this Department is concerned.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that there are only two international luxury type hotels which are being built at the present moment, and in respect of which the Government, together with the local authorities, have guaranteed loans which they could themselves make use of. The cheaper registered hotels, consisting of 82 per cent of one star and two star hotels. I think cover that aspect. I regard the person who <span class="col_6213-6214" refersTo="page_0311"/>runs his own country hotel, as the best host there could possibly be. I hope that he maintains his contact with our people by meeting the demands of classification. It is not expected that he should have a ten-storeyed or five-storeyed hotel; as long as he has a number of rooms, 25 per cent meet certain physical requirements regarding bathroom facilities and the service is good, can be classified; he can get his full liquor licence, and he can run his hotel. If he wants to improve his hotel, he can approach the Hotel Board for loan money, and they can decide whether they should give him the loan money to improve his hotel. But the responsibility in the first instance rests with him. I only hope that he does not just pull out, because I am certain that, with the tourists who are coming to this country, more and more opportunities will be available for that sort of hotel to do business with very satisfied customers. Therefore I hope that this type of hotel will not fall into the hands of big groups.</p>

<p>The non. member for Johannesburg (North) raised certain points. He talked about the tight budget for Satour. I think that if he followed the argument that Satour&#x2019;s budget is now R1&#x00BD; million, compared to some R90,000 in 1948-&#x2019;49, he will realize that it is gradually developing to, I will not say a generous budget, but nevertheless not the tight budget that he thought it was when he spoke. I think, from that point of view, that is a reply to the point he raised. He said South Africa has missed the boat as far as tourism is concerned. He gave the example of Monaco. I would say that South Africa has not missed the boat as far as tourism is concerned. That is quite a wrong conception. I would say that South Africa is not convenient for the ordinary run of tourist. After all, Italy, France, Spain, Monaco and those countries are within a short distance and a cheap flight from Britain and the rest of the Continent. Germans go into Spain by their hundreds of thousands by car. The Americans, as the hon. member knows, come over to Europe and spend some time in Spain. But South Africa is not really geographically in that particular tourist country category. But the mere fact is that we are drawing more and more tourists every year; I think the increase is about 7 per cent per year. Every year it is increasing. I am quite happy if it goes on increasing. What I do not want, is a flood of tourists and no accommodation and no method of handling them properly, which will be a very bad advertisement for South Africa. As long as we can keep up and maintain progress, I am quite happy that that is the best business method of tackling tourism. So, although the hon. member gave me these fantastic figures with regard to Monaco, and tells me we are missing the boat. I do not think we are missing the boat at all in South Africa. I think we are going on reasonably well.</p>

<p>He talked about key men in the Department of Tourism. I suppose every Department would like to have key men. He talked about special courses. I want to refer him to the report of the Department of Tourism and I just want to read one section. It says on page 5:</p>

<block name="quote">Realizing the need for properly qualified tour guides to accompany tourist groups on their travels through the Republic, the Department obtained information from overseas countries and entered into negotiations with the educational authorities concerned with a view to establishing such a training course in the Republic. Details of the proposed course are still being worked out.</block>

<p>That was the training of tour guides, the very point that the hon. member raised. I would say therefore that we have not neglected that aspect. We realize the importance of it, and we are anxious that South Africa, which did not have to worry about these matters in the past, should realize that with the growth of tourism trained guides are very essential.</p>

<p>He talked about South Africa and her sunshine. All our publications with regard to publicity have the theme: &#x201C;Come to South Africa for sunshine.&#x201D; I remember one film I saw, which is shown in Europe and Britain. It shows a man sitting on Durban beach in the sunshine. He was a man from Britain and was reading an overseas paper which said: &#x201C;Britain closed in with blizzards.&#x201D; That is what we are trying to sell, sunshine, space to move, lovely beaches, excellent roads &#x2026;</p>

South Africa is not the place for a tripper to come to, but for a man to come to, even with his wife and family. We have a healthy and beautiful country with plenty of sunshine even in winter. This is what we can offer the tourist. The hon. member for South Coast also put a number of points to me. He indicated through the Chief Whip that he will not be able to be here. I will see that the points he raised are attended to and he will be informed of the results later one.</p>

<from><span class="col_6215-6216" refersTo="page_0312"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. Minister has replied to a certain number of questions asked by hon. members on this side of the House. These replies were mainly in regard to the hotel industry. I do not want to take this point any further, because I know that one of my colleagues will do just that. This attempt on the part of the hon. the Minister was really one which did not make much impression. Here and there he dealt with the question, he touched upon this and that, kicked a loose pebble, but he failed completely to come to the heart of the matter, as well as to state his philosophy and further approach to this extremely important problem and the need for central management. The hon. the Minister becomes alarmed when hon. members on this side of the House refer to his Department as a &#x201C;Cinderella&#x201D; Department. The amount being appropriated only totals R1,700,000. The amount for Satour only totals R1,500,000. There is an English expression which goes, &#x201C;You are trying to run a thing on a shoestring&#x201D;. It seems to me as though the hon. the Minister is trying to build up an entire Department on a shoestring. The hon. the Minister maintains that this is good business and that he is satisfied with what is happening. However, I want to tell him that tourism is costing South Africa a great deal of money and that it is being run at a loss. What did South Africa lose last year through its overseas tourists? This figure amounted to R60 million, of which South Africa only recovered R50 million. In other words, there is a loss of approximately R10 million. The hon. the Minister maintains that this is good business. I have never in my life heard of a good business which is being run at a loss.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The difference between us is that I am aware of what I know and that hon. member is not. I do not want to become involved in an argument with the hon. member. It has been said that one&#x2019;s knowledge can be bounded by a circle. The more one knows, the greater is one&#x2019;s contact with the outside edge of the circle, which stands for the unknown. I do not say that I know a great deal, nor do I say that my circle of knowledge is a great one, but I know how much I do not know. However, if that hon. member makes an interjection of that kind, then it seems to me that what he knows cannot be represented by a circle, nor by a line, but only by a dot.</p>

<p>It seems to me that quite a number of matters were touched upon here which the hon. the Minister has not reacted to. Possibly he is reserving them for the second part of his speech, and I want to afford him an opportunity of taking these matters further when he replies. We all speak of an explosion in this field of tourism. This is true, and I think there are two very clear reasons for this. There are more and more people in the world who have more and more time and more and more money to travel about more and more. The second important point is that tourism is a function of the transport system. In this field a tremendous revolution is taking place. After the war people in this country thought in terms of the Dakota, which represented only 30,000 passenger miles per day. To-day we already have the Boeing which represents a half million passenger-miles per day. Just round the corner is the Concorde which represents 2 million passenger-miles per day, as well as the American SST aircraft which represents 4.5 million passenger-miles per day. As a result of this there is a large-scale explosion in the field of tourism and more and more people are travelling. We want the planning to be done now so that South Africa can take proper advantage of what is hapening in this field.</p>

<p>I think we welcome tourism in South Africa for three main reasons. Firstly I can say that we welcome it because of humanistic reasons. We should very much like people to come here so that we can get to know them. We should like them to see our customs and culture. We will then be able to return the compliment. In this way an inter-action will be possible which I hope will enrich us as well as them. Secondly, there are also important political reasons as to why we should encourage tourism. At the moment we are paying an annual amount of R2.9 million for our information officers in overseas countries. The people overseas are not interested in this because they are of the opinion that it is Government propaganda. Of course the best kind of propaganda to have is to get those people to pay personal visits to South Africa in order to see what is going on here. We think that if they come to South Africa they will obtain a better insight into matters, and with a better insight there will probably be more sympathy for our standpoint. More sympathy may in fact lead to more goodwill. For purely political reasons it is essential to bring more and more tourists to South Africa. There is also a third, and probably the most important reason why we should promote tourism, i.e. the economic reason. I should like to elaborate a little on this matter. At this stage the goldmining industry is the backbone of our economy in this sense that it earns us an annual amount of foreign currency to the value of more than R700 million. However, everybody knows that inflation is stifling the gold-mining industry. Unless something radical happens, this mighty industry will, within 20 years, be a mere shadow of its former self. What is the easiest way of earning this foreign currency? What method requires the smallest capital investment? The reply to this is tourism. By means of tourism this gap which is going to be created can be filled. According to available figures an approximate number of 250,000 tourists come to South Africa annually. It is not clear how much they spend here, because the estimates vary from approximately R50 million to as much as R70 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_6217-6218" refersTo="page_0313"/>I do not know what the precise figure is, but perhaps the hon. the Minister can furnish it for us. If we were to put the figure at R60 million, it would mean that to replace the gold-mining industry in South Africa as an industry which earns us foreign currency, this amount in respect of tourism must be multiplied tenfold over the next 20 years. I am of the opinion that it is a target which is not beyond our reach. We want the hon. the Minister to think in terms of this. We want to know what his plans are for dealing with this kind of situation. However, he talks about hotels, and what should be done here and there. Surely that is not going far enough. My colleague, the hon. member for Von Brandis, spoke about special interest groups. I want to ask the hon. the Minister a simple question. Suppose there were 150 people in Europe who said to the hon. the Minister&#x2014; and this is a common occurrence overseas&#x2014; that they want to come to South Africa and that they want to visit Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and the Kruger National Park, and that they want to journey together and share accommodation. Suppose they say that they want to come out here within a month. Will the hon. the Minister be able to deal with the situation? This is the simple question which we are asking him. This will show how prepared he is to cope with tourists.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are talking about special interest groups. It seems to me that the more man develops and the more progress is made in the field of technology, the more man&#x2019;s thoughts turn to prehistoric times, and so we find that&#x2014;to mention a special group &#x2014;there are thousands of people to-day who are interested in old and anthropological discoveries, who are interested in rock art, in stone engravings, in the paleolithic era when stone implements were fashioned. I can take as an example a cave system such as Laseaux in France, which is visited daily by hundreds of people. Here in South Africa we probably have more than any other country can offer. There are the Magaliesberg and the Drakensberg mountains; there are hundreds of these places which can be visited, but nobody overseas knows about them. Sir, even if one visits a place like Sterkfontein, where one of the most important discoveries in South Africa was made, then the guide, the old Bantu guide, tells you, &#x201C;This is the place where the oubaas found the oumissus.&#x201D; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not want to say too much in response to the speech made by the hon. member for Hillbrow, particularly not when he discusses business, because we are aware of the fact that he worked for a big boss who knows a great deal more about business than I do. But when he spoke about this deficit of R11 million which we have on our tourist account, he omitted to say that that figure has diminished to a tremendous extent during the past number of years; that the figure had been much higher, and that last year it

was lower than ever before. The hon. member also omitted to point out the effect of a considerable credit balance on our tourist account in this time of inflation in which we have now found ourselves. We are aware of the fact that inflation is a temporary condition in the country, but I think the Government is quite mindful of the fact that as soon as circumstances warrant it, one can proceed to a large-scale attempt to develop this source of income, tourism, fully &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>The Government is aware of that time lapse, but it is no more than 18 months. In other words, if one makes a start with one&#x2019;s promotion work, then one can expect results after 18 months, but the hon. member omitted to tell this to the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to turn my attention more specifically to the hon. member for South Coast, and I regret his not being in the House to-day. I am sorry because I am certain that the fact that he is not present at the moment will result in his becoming annoyed at me when delayed reaction sets in. Yesterday the hon. member for South Coast took a great deal of trouble to prove to the Committee that the Natal Parks Board was not really geared to tourist promotion. That was really news to me. I gained the impression that he was doing so by way of offering an excuse; that there was something he felt badly about, and that he was only explaining in advance that they were really not geared to doing that type of work. But it is also true that we have very tangible proof that the Natal Parks Board is very proud of the tourist work which it has done during the past 20 years in Natal, and particularly in my constituency, Zululand. They are jealously proud of the work they have done there. But if we were to consider what they have achieved after 20 years, then we realize that the hon. member is apologizing for their achievements. The hon. member for South Coast was particularly afraid of the introduction of the so-called Jumbo jets. He has reason to be afraid of their introduction. I believe that if one Jumbo jet were to arrive in this country he would not be able to supply those people with accommodation in all his game reserves and parks in Natal. I want to go further; they will not even be able to transport those people in his game reserves because the policy of that hon. member, through his Natal Parks Board, is not even to allow a tourist bus into the game reserve.</p>

<p>Yes, it must serve only as a sanctuary. The hon. member for South Coast went further and advocated a central authority in Natal to promote tourism. This is a very difficult matter. We have already tried, <span class="col_6219-6220" refersTo="page_0314"/>even on a regional committee level, to cooperate with the Parks Board, hut each time&#x2014; and this is what the hon. member did yesterday&#x2014;we discussed tourist promotion, they talk about conservation. We give the Natal Parks Board full points for conservation attempts, but we give them nought out of ten for their tourist promotion. This is a fact which we must begin to face up to. Mr. Chairman, ironically enough the hon. member for South Coast also spoke about the lack of accommodation. The only accommodation which is being made available in the Natal Game Reserves is provided exclusively by the Natal Parks Board; nobody else can get into the game reserves. I want to allege that this accommodation is totally inadequate and inefficient, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. I shall merely mention a few particulars in regard to the bigger camps. There are camps which are beautifully situated, but there is no accommodation for tourists. The Mkuzi camp has six rondavels and three huts. The Hluhluwe camp has four six-bed dwelling units and 25 two-bed dwelling units. This is the most famous camp in Natal. The Umfolozi game reserve has 12 two-bed rondavels. At Richard&#x2019;s Bay there are only ablutional and toilet facilities, and at False Bay there are ablutlonal and toilet facilities and in none of the camps is there any food of any nature available for tourists.</p>

<p>Probably on snakes and spiders. We are aware of the policy of the Natal Parks Board. We know how they feel. They are of the opinion that this accommodation should be provided outside the game reserve, on the periphery of the game reserves, and we are satisfied with that, but then we ask that private initiative be afforded an opportunity, and in particular the land, to make these facilities available to tourists. We must think of the requirements of the foreign tourist. He does not want to be put to any trouble; he wants to see and photograph things. When he returns home after what was a very tiring day for him, then he wants to relax in peace and comfort. If we bear the needs of tourists in mind, then the facilities which we are making available to them in Natal through the Parks Board are totally inadequate. I want to allege that it is time the Department of Tourism stepped in firmly so that Zululand with its sub-tropical climate, its unspoiled natural beauty, its wealth of wild animals, birds and plant life, will not merely be a kingdom of the Natal Parks Board, but in fact a world-famous tourist attraction where money can be earned for the Republic.</p>

<p>In conclusion just this remark about a different matter. It would perhaps have astonished the hon. member for South Coast if he had been present, but I do nevertheless want to bring the condition of the St. Lucia Lake to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The problem of salination has become a very serious one. When the salt content increases to more than 60 parts per thousand, then as the hon. member knows the biological life is destroyed. It is destroyed by way of a chain reaction, from the lowest to the highest form of animal life. If the plankton is destroyed, the fish are destroyed, and the birds disappear. Even hippopotami need fresh water. That lake is being threatened to-day. We have now received the St. Luoia report, with which I am not in full agreement; steps must in fact be taken there, but there are certain parts which deal with the question of desalination of the lake. Not only the Natal Parks Board, but all of us are concerned about the lake because we believe that it could possibly become one of our greatest tourist attractions in Natal.</p>

<p>The last point I want to mention deals with a purely organizational matter. It concerns these regional committees which have been appointed under the auspices of the Department of Tourism. I can understand very well that the hon. the Minister does not like to interfere in the establishment of these committees. The constitution of these committees is being left to them, and the fact of the matter is that those people sit too long on those oommittees; there is no fluctuation and no change. I should like to suggest that provision should be made for those committees to be reappointed or should hold elections at least every two or three years so that one does not find the same persons sitting on those committees for years on end.</p>

<p>I do not intend to spend much time on the hon. member for Zululand and his private vendetta against the Natal Parks Board. We have heard him before on the subject, and this sort of speech is not going to help him; he is not going to get himself put on the board. He knows perfectly well that the Natal Parks Board, as he himself admitted, is a nature conservation organization; it is not a tourist organization, and what it has done in the way of promoting tourism has been done over and above and outside the purpose for which it was established. Just as the National Kruger Park Board is now developing or allowing hotels to develop outside the park, so is the Natal Parks Board. It is not intended to be, never has been, and it will never be a tourist organization. It is there to conserve and protect the natural flora and fauna of the areas in which it has reserves. Sir, that hon. member attacks Natal; he does not attack the National Parks Board. Where are the hotels in the Kruger Park? Exactly the same policy is followed there, except on a larger scale. Sir, one of the matters raised by the hon. member for South Coast was the question of co-ordinating the conservation work that is being done through the Natal Parks Board with the tourist promotion aspect. I would be very sorry to see the true basic purpose of the Natal Parks Board undermined by turning it into a simple tourist organization instead of a nature conservation organization.</p>

<p><span class="col_6221-6222" refersTo="page_0315"/>Now, I want ito come back to certain matters raised by the hon. the Minister. He said that this was not. a Cinderella department. What it certainly does not have is a Prince Charming as a Minister. He is quite right; the Government realized the need for a Department of Tourism; it realized the need for a Hotels Board&#x2014;in fact the establishment of the Board was pressed for Iby the hotels themselves&#x2014;and it therefore established the Department and the Hotels Board. Those are two good actions. What we have complained about is the Cinderella way in which the Department has been treated and the lack of a Prince Charming at its head. The hon. the Minister does not even know his own Department. He has said here this afternoon that the Hotels Board is an autonomous board which lends money&#x2014;that is correct&#x2014;and that he does not know what it lends.</p>

I want to ask the Minister to tell this House what hotels have been assisted by the Hotel Board, with his permission and authority, and what are the gradings of those hotels; because the point we have made, and the point which the Minister has missed completely, is not that we object to luxury hotels. You must have them; you need them for the tourist. We do not object to the standards laid down. Our concern is that the ordinary traveller in South Africa will have no hotel to stay in in two or three years&#x2019; time because he will not be able to afford the tariffs that are forced on hotels in order to achieve the minimum standards laid down. The average sum being spent by an hotelier to classify is something around R30,000.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister can check it. That has been spent by many hotels, to my personal knowledge, and it has been stated by hoteliers and by hotel associations that that is the average sum which has to be spent. But assume that it is not the average, and assume that a lot of hotels&#x2014;and this the Minister will have to accept&#x2014;are spending R30.000, it will bring their tariffs up to such an extent that a family man, a husband and wife with three or four children, can no longer afford to stay at a normal hotel when they go on holiday. We have pleaded for consideration for the special needs of the type of hotel which, for instance, you get on the beaches, the holiday hotels, and the mountain resorts, instead of this nonsense, which is not the Minister&#x2019;s fault but is part of the pattern, that rondavels must now be linked up by glass-covered passages to all the bathrooms in case people catch cold. The whole character of those mountain resorts is being destroyed. We feel that the Minister should have interceded and should still intercede to ensure that the hotel for the smaller man, the hotel for the not-so-rich man, will still remain available and be able to provide hotel facilities at tariffs which can be afforded. Otherwise you are going to destroy the hotel industry. Already in Durban I believe there are 10,000 beds available in holiday flats. All that is providing accommodation, but it will become more and more difficult for the small man to find an hotel to which he can take his family. Look around Durban now at the hotels that are closing. I can immediately think of four or five, and what is being built in their place is the luxury hotel. The luxury hotels are also needed, but we plead that we should not become so obsessed with tourism and luxury hotels that the needs of the ordinary person are forgotten.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask the Minister please to tell the House and through the House the country what benefits accrue to an hotelier who registers and is graded. I ask this because only 259 hotels have been graded and numerous hoteliers have said to me: &#x201C;We have our classification, so why should we bother to become graded? We can automatically register; we do not want to be graded because then we have to pay a levy to the Hotel Board, and what do we get? Only a tax rebate and no other benefits at all.&#x201D; I think it is necessary for the Minister to make it clear what the benefits are&#x2014;I know they are there, but I want it from the Minister&#x2014;to the hotelier, so that the hotelier who is hesitating now to apply for grading will in fact do so. What will the hotelier who is graded receive as compensation for the extra control and the levy he has to pay?</p>

<p>Then, could the hon. the Minister tell us what has happened in regard to the training schemes for hotel labour? The reports I have had are that the refusal to allow Bantu labour behind the Eiselen line is creating tremendous hardships and that of the Coloureds who have been trained only a very small proportion have proved to be satisfactory and are still working in hotels. The majority, who have been trained at some cost and trouble, have poved to be quite unsuitable when they had to work in hotels. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>When eloquence was distributed, the hon. member for Durban (Point) was at the head of the queue, but when <span class="col_6223-6224" refersTo="page_0316"/>realism was distributed, he was not there at all, because despite the explanation which the Minister gave about a variety of matters and which made it clear to us why certain things had not been done or could not be done at this stage, the hon. member kicks up a tremendous fuss about them. Not that we find this strange, because in this matter the hon. member has only tried to do once again what he always does, and that is to steal a political march, but he will not get away with it and I shall leave it to the hon. the Minister to deal with him.</p>

<p>I should also like to associate myself with the many speakers who have to-day expressed their appreciation to the hon. the Minister and his department for the very great work thus far done under difficult circumstances by this vigorous and able young department, especially in bringing tourists to South Africa from abroad. If one looks at the figure of 257,008 tourists who came here in the past year, one gets some sort of impression of the number of visitors to South Africa who came here largely as a result of the good work of this department. However, there are a few other matters which I should like to bring to the kind attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the question of the part which can be played by local authorities, especially the local authorities of the larger centres, which in my opinion should have a larger share in making a pleasant visit to South Africa possible for our visitors from abroad. Every local authority worth mentioning usually has at its disposal the services of a publicity officer, who with the assistance of the Department of Tourism can be instrumental in acquainting visitors to South Africa from abroad with the attractions in the area concerned. But they can make a further contribution by acquainting the visitors with the way of life of the community concerned. I do not want to say that we should give less attention to publicity in respect of our natural attractions, but South Africa&#x2019;s greatest asset, its greatest treasure, is not only its parks, but its proud possession is the people of South Africa, who they are, what they do and how they live. Visitors from abroad must definitely be afforded more opportunities of meeting the people of South Africa and of getting to know them better, and then I want to say that a great deal more must be done in future to make it possible for the visitor from abroad to get to know the Afrikaans-speaking section. Visitors from abroad must be afforded more and more opportunities of becoming acquainted with the cultural products of the Afrikaans-speaking section. If we are in earnest that the world should know the whole truth about the white man and his role in this country, we must in every possible way keep this basic concept in mind, i.e. that the truth is a property of knowledge, knowledge with particular reference to the origin of the Whites, their present and their future in South Africa. It is particularly in this respect that our cultural contributions can play a major part.</p>

<p>It is always easy to allocate tasks and I am convinced that the Department of Tourism can do a great deal, but what I am concerned about, on the other hand, is the fact that it is actually a two-headed department. On the one hand we have the Department of Tourism, and on the other hand the South African Tourist Corporation. I think that this is becoming an impossible situation and therefore I want to ask the Minister if he will consider, with a view to the further development of the Department of Tourism&#x2014;and the emphasis must primarily fall on the Department of Tourism&#x2014;whether the time has not arrived for a very thorough investigation to be instituted concerning the future role of the Tourist Corporation and in what way the Tourist Corporation can be made a more integral but subordinate part of the Department of Tourism. I believe that if there is to be only one department which will play a role as far as the outside world is concerned, it must be the Department of Tourism. For this reason I plead that anything, such as the Tourist Corporation, which can possibly influence the actions of the department, should be investigated thoroughly; I am convinced that if that is done, the Department of Tourism will be able to play an even more positive part.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member for Springs and I would like to congratulate him on it. I thought it was a most constructive speech and that he made some very good points indeed. In particular he tried to relate the activities of the Department of Tourism to the role played by the local authorities, and that is a matter on which I should like to touch. But before doing so I should like to say that I believe he is quite right when he says that our local authorities, generally speaking, do not make visitors, either from overseas or inland visitors to the coastal areas, feel at home as they should. Generally speaking, they do not put themselves out.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I think Durban does.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>I would say that Durban is a good example of what can be done for both inland visitors and visitors from overseas, but that is an exception. I also liked the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks about informing overseas visitors of the aspirations, the culture and the history, as he put it, of the Afrikaansspeaking people of South Africa, but, as I would rather put it, of the South African people of both language groups. Thirdly, he emphasized that visitors from overseas in particular are not made aware of the great historical contributions that the Whites in South Africa have made to the well-being of our country. There, too, I agree with him, because I think too often visitors, from overseas particularly, <span class="col_6225-6226" refersTo="page_0317"/>are shown Native Reserves and, in the case of the urban areas like Johannesburg, tribal dancing. They go away with an idea of the Native Reserves and what the towns are doing for the Natives, but certainly not enough emphasis is placed on the history and the culture of the white people in South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to deal with one aspect of the Department, and that is that it seems to me there are not any promotional funds available to the Department of Tourism at present. It seems also that under present circumstances loan funds are not available to the Department other than through the Hotel Board. If I am incorrect in this assumption then I would be glad if the hon. the Minister will correct me. Reading the Minister&#x2019;s recent speech in the Other Place I see he enumerates certain functions to be performed by his Department. For example, it has to list and describe existing tourist facilities and to list potential tourist attractions. What does his Department do after having done that? Is everything then left to the provinces who likewise have no funds, no promotional funds for tourism? Or is everything left to the local authorities concerned, who likewise have no funds for promoting tourism? If I may give the Minister an example of the difficulties that the local authorities and the provinces experience I will give an example with which he is well acquainted, and that is the example of the False Bay coast. To list the existing and potential attractions, I would say that the two commercial fishing harbours which are run by the Department of Commerce and Industries at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay and False Bay should play a major part in the future development of the Bay. In fact, the Department of Commerce and Industries has no plans to expand either of those harbours in any way. As regards future or potential attractions, there is not a single harbour for small-boat anglers anywhere in False Bay. There are likewise no launching sites for small-boat owners &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; with the exception of Buffel&#x2019;s Bay. There is no harbour for deep-sea anglers, there is no yachting basin&#x2014; there are really no facilities for yachtsmen in False Bay at all except in the lee of the defence breakwater at Simonstown, which is not really a suitable mooring place. In the Bay, which has an entrance 25 miles wide, there are no fewer than eight local authorities: Eight local authorities border on the shores of False Bay. There is no regional or metropolitan authority whatsoever in the Peninsula which perhaps could be a body which on a regional basis could help to promote tourism, and in the result the eight local authorities are from the point of view of finance completely unable to undertake developments of the kind I have sketched. Yet, as the Minister knows, we have a large fishing potential in the Bay. I think of tunny fishing, marlin, yellowtail, Cape salmon, snoek when in season, and others. It has attractions which no other part of the world has to offer. I am not aware of any place in the world that can offer such a variety of fish as we have in False Bay. We have safe swimming and surfing such as can be enjoyed at only a few places in the world. Our beaches are unequalled and yet the amenities at those beaches which the local authorities concerned are able to provide are completely inadequate even for the local people, quite apart from tourists, whether from the interior or from overseas. I ask the Minister who has officiated at some of the provincial surfing tournaments at Muizenberg and Fish Hoek whether he feels the facilities which are available and provided by the local authorities are adequate for the staging even of provincial tournaments, to say nothing of national tournaments or international competitions. I ask him in what way can his Department help with this problem, the problem being that the local authorities are not in a position financially to provide amenities for the tourists of the kind I have described. It seems that the provinces are also not in a position to do so. What is the Minister able to do and what does he propose doing about this situation in the future?</p>

<speech by="#van_vuuren">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. Z. J. VAN VUUREN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to express my appreciation of the report which we received this year. I think it is the first report of the Department of Tourism. I think that if one reads it very carefully, one comes to the conclusion that since the creation of the Department considerable spadework has been done in order to extend this major industry, tourism. I want to congratulate the Department and express the hope that next year, when the next report is available, we shall be able to make a much more realistic appraisal of what the results were of the spadework which was done in the past year. I must say that this has probably not been an easy Department to develop. Those of us who were from the outset familiar with its initiation realize that the hon. the Minister and the Department probably had many problems in getting under way. If one reads of the work which has been done, of the direct promotion work which is being undertaken at present, of what has been done to provide accommodation in the form of hotels and so forth, and of projects which are receiving attention, one comes to a full realization of the fact that this Department is busy laying very sound foundations for the development of this industry, We want to congratulate the Minister and the Department very sincerely on that. One gains the impression that they have now found their feet. I think that as far as this side of the House is concerned, and possibly that side as well, although we most certainly do not need it very much, we will do everything in our power to assist the Minister and the Department in our way.</p>

<p><span class="col_6227-6228" refersTo="page_0318"/>As far as hotels in general are concerned, I want to put in a good word for them today. We know that the South African hotel industry is passing through difficult times, but I think that if one considers the circumstances, it appears that the hotel industry has in the past few years made accommodation available of which the country in particular, and I think the tourist in general, can be very proud. If one considers the Transvaal areas, one must concede that especially as far as the rural areas are concerned, the hotel accommodation is very good for the tariffs which are charged. In the Lowveld area, for example, the hotel accommodation is probably comparable to the best in the world in that category. We are very grateful for that.</p>

<p>I see that on the Loan Account an amount of R1 million is being made available to the Hotel Board this year. I do not know if difficulties developed which resulted in this smaller amount being made available, but we hope and trust that this fund will be greater in the future. We know that it is difficult always to make capital funds available for projects of this kind. Last year there was R 1,700,000 on the Estimates, and this year it has been decreased to R1 million. We hope that the Minister will make a larger capital amount available in the years to come. I cannot find out why this year&#x2019;s provision is less than last year&#x2019;s, and perhaps the hon. the Minister can enlighten us about this.</p>

<p>We must realize that our tourist industry can make great progress in the years to come and therefore we are glad to see that the Minister and the Department are alert in this matter and that they are not oblivious to the Jumbo jet era which is approaching. I cannot agree with hon. members who said that the Minister was not aware of it. We know that that era is coming, and we are most certainly preparing for it.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about research. If we look at the proposed programme, we see that only R100 is being made available for this purpose. I find this is a very small amount, and I should like to know how the project is going to be financed.</p>

<p>Then, as far as the training of tour guides is concerned, I just want to say the following. We who have done some travelling realize what value a tourist guide has in propagating his country. I see that negotiations are already under way with various organizations to offer this proposed course. This is the 1967 report. Perhaps the Minister can just tell us what has been done in the past year to introduce these courses.</p>

<p>Then there is a little matter which is very dear to my heart, and which was also mentioned here last year. I am glad and grateful to see that even the Secretary for Tourism referred to it in a recent speech. This is that in a country such as South Africa, where there are two strong language groups, Afrikaans and English speaking, we should do a great deal towards bringing these population groups together by means of the promotion of domestic tourism. What I envisage, and what I pleaded for last year as well, is that we should go out of our way to bring the city dweller to the country districts. To-day there is a one-way traffic. The country dwellers are very fond of going to the cities to-day. What happens in the cities? In the cities one also lands in a whirlpool of tourists. One is completely absorbed in that. But I also want traffic in the other direction. The Secretary said that it was difficult to implement, but I think that we should begin on a small scale. Through organized agriculture and local authorities we should see if we cannot find a point of contact and a point of departure somewhere, so that people can provide accommodation on farms. Let us begin on a small scale and make this accommodation available to tourists and to local people who want to spend vacations on farms. I personally know of many people who would be only too keen to spend a vacation on a farm. This would bring the city dweller and the country dweller into direct contact with each other again. In this way we can learn to understand each other, and cultivate mutual liking, respect and understanding for each other. Circumstances have caused the country districts to become depopulated. We must do something so that our White population, and in particular the city dwellers, would once again develop a love and respect for the country districts. I am thinking of many small towns which are struggling for an existence to-day. All of them want an industry or something similar. I know of small towns where numerous church houses stand empty and are probably only used during times of communion. By encouraging the local publicity association or town council to organize, can we not establish a local organization to make those houses available during holiday periods for families from the cities to stay there? This would also provide an extra source of income to those people. This is not something new, and it is done on a large scale in Europe. I myself went to see what was happening in the Ruhr area in Germany. In America it is done on a large scale. In America this tourist attraction on farms offers those people an additional source of income and the State finances that kind of accommodation. I am pleading for this to be done, and I really think that we should not simply say that it is an insurmountable difficulty. We should begin on a small scale and expand from there.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I should first deal with the hon. member for Durban (Point). I think hon. members on this side of the House are beginning to take him too seriously. They should know the hon. member for Durban (Point). I have known him for a long time. All this dour and harsh attack is just bluster. It is just a show. The trouble is, he has done it so often, that many of us are beginning to <span class="col_6229-6230" refersTo="page_0319"/>realize more and more that this is the speaking pattern of the hon. member for Durban (Point). The hon. member stood up, brought out the Act and said: &#x201C;This Minister does not even know his Act. He says the Hotel Board is an autonomous body, whereas in section 29, it says this and that. Every loan has to be passed by the Minister.&#x201D;. Of course the hon. member does not know what he is talking about. That section only deals with the method in which the Hotel Board raises money which it loans to these hotels.</p>

<p>The hon. member said every loan to an hotel has to go through the Minister.

But he did not say that the Minister, if they loaned R5,000 to a hotel, has to go through it and check it. That is the impression the hon. member tries to give this Committee. Of course it is not so.

<p>I am right. All I can say, is that they have granted loan money to the extent of R400.000 to hotels and they have not come to me about one of those loans at all. They only have to come to me when they loan money to a new hotel. If they want to loan money to a new hotel, they have to come to the Minister and get his approval as well. That only is in the Act, if the hon. member will read it. There has only been one case of a new hotel, to which the Hotel Board has loaned money. I am very sorry in a way to tell the hon. member that it is in his province. They came forward and recommended to me&#x2014;they have to&#x2014;that an amount of money should be made available to a new hotel to be built at Hluhluwe. There was no hotel there and they said that an amount should be made available. The hon. member for Zululand knows more about it than the hon. member for Durban (Point), much more. They said: &#x201C;There is no hotel in the vicinity. A hotel will serve a purpose for the Hluhluwe game reserve&#x201D;. My reply was: &#x201C;Go ahead with that loan&#x201D;.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now the hon. member says &#x201C;that is right&#x201D;. But the hon. member tried to indicate that this was not an autonomous body, that they could only loan money to hotels if I put my stamp on each one. You know, he and I know each other very well. If he only came and talked to me in the lobby, I could have told him where he was going to put his foot in.</p>

<p>Let me go back to the hon. member for South Coast. I see the hon. member for Zululand in the House. The hon. member for Durban (Point) said he was carrying on a vendetta with the Natal Parks Board. I did not refer to the speech of the hon. member for South Coast at all. He was not there. I prefer to tackle him when he is here, but I will say that the hon. member for Durban (Point) should speak to the hon. member for South Coast. He is getting some very amazing ideas about his position in Natal. Yesterday he said that he was talking on behalf of the wattle growers. I said he was not, because they have the Wattle Industry Board. Then last year he talked about &#x201C;my Parks Board&#x201D;. Then in his speech on this Vote he said &#x201C;my province&#x201D;. I think that he reckons that he owns the whole of Natal. I think that it is about time that that hon. member spoke to the hon. member for South Coast and made him realize that he may have been a Pooh-Bah as an Administrator in Natal in the old days but that he is not a Pooh-Bah when it comes to Natal any more. It will do him a lot of good. I might also add that the hon. member for South Coast said that there must be a central authority. He said that South Coast has a body and that there is one in Durban and others elsewhere in Natal. He said that there must be a central authority to co-ordinate the activities of these various bodies. But I remember that the hon. member for South Coast is the member who whenever you talk about a central authority for Natal nearly hits the roof. The last thing he wants is that anybody must interfere with Natal. Yet now he talks about a central authority to co-ordinate tourism in Natal. What is really the basis of the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude? I can understand why the hon. member for Zululand gets so frustrated and annoyed with the hon. member for South Coast. These days the hon. member is really talking in such a way that one never knows whether he is making a serious speech or whether he is just talking from the cuff without even considering the matter. He must not talk to me on behalf of the wattle growers, the Wattle Board, Durban or the Parks Board. I regard him as the member for South Coast and no more.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. member for Durban (Point). He said that hotels must spend R30.000 before they can be classified. Then I told him that that is not true. He then said that he knows of hotels that have spent R30.000. I listened to the Minister of Justice when something similar was said to him. He had all the facts before him. He said that those hotels which were rebuilt completely did not have to do so.</p>

But they decided, and I am very glad that they did, to rebuild their hotels. But then the hon. member must not say that that is due to classification. That is where the hon. member gets his facts all wrong. I should like to say that one does expect criticism from those hon. members but that criticism must be based on facts. They must not exaggerate the position. They may get the headlines in the English language Press hut it will not get them anywhere.</p>

I merely think the other part and my thoughts cannot be ruled out of order surely for my thoughts. [Interjections.] I am quite happy to learn and to listen but then I want the facts and not an exaggerated story. The hon. member talked about the benefits a hotel gets if it is registered and graded. He wanted to know from me all the details of the benefits. I will read them to him. Firstly there are income tax benefits, as the hon. member mentioned himself. They are very important benefits. I might tell the hon. member that many hotels would not have gone as far as rebuilding hotels to be registered, classified and graded if it were not for the income tax benefits involved. If therefore an hotel which the hon. member says he knows spends R30,000 on rebuilding their hotel it is doing it also because of these benefits of being able to write off the capital for income tax purposes. Not every business can write off capital for income tax purposes. This is a special advantage given the hotel industry. They have made use of this and I am glad that they have made use of this. That is a big advantage, far bigger than the hon. member wanted to dismiss as being very small.</p>

<p>No 4 per cent. I know that the write off is for 25 years for a one star hotel. That is the period in which the capital can be written off. In the case of a five star hotel I think it is ten years. You cannot write off your capital in the case of a factory or a store. I cannot do it in my business but the hotel industry can. I am very happy that they can do so and I hope that it encourages them to build new hotels. The hon. member must not now try to say that because it is a 2 per cent concession it does not mean anything. The hotel industry maintain that it means a great deal to them and yet the hon. member maintains that he has the ear of the hotel industry. I come now to the other benefits. Only if hotels are registered can they apply for loans. If they are not registered they cannot apply for loans. Another factor which has a negative side, is that if they are not registered with the Hotel Board after a certain date they can no longer call themselves hotels. Many places of accommodation want to call themselves hotels. Only if they are capable of being registered and graded can they call themselves hotels. There is something else which the hon. member will probably also want to dismiss but the Hotel Board itself has been of great usefulness to the hotel industry as such. The inspectors have discussed their problems with them. They do not go to them negatively to push them out of business. They discuss things with them and tell them how they can improve their service, etc. There is a very good relationship between the Hotel Board and the hotel industry. These are the things we offer. That is why hon. members opposite must not belittle the efforts of the Hotel Board.</p>

<p>I have just told the hon. member that the contact of the Hotel Board with hotels is another benefit. They make representations to the Hotel Board where they have problems. We have had many representations through the Hotel Board which have been conveyed to me. These are contacts of a very essential nature. The training of catering staff is another matter conducted by the Hotel Board. I was going to reply to the hon. member in regard to this issue. The hon. member talked about the failure of our staff training scheme. They ran a crash scheme for two sets of coloured hotel staff at the Queens Hotel. The director of the Hotel Board has just informed me that after eight months there are still 52 of these Coloureds working in the hotel industry. I would like to have seen a 100 per cent attendance but I cannot force people to work in the hotel industry. The hotel industry is a demanding industry. It keeps people busy over the weekends and people do not like to be busy over the weekends. After eight months <span class="col_6233-6234" refersTo="page_0321"/>52 per cent of these people are still in the employ of hotels. I might also say that the Hotel Board is negotiating with the Sultan Technical College in Durban to extend and improve their training of Asiatics for the hotel industry. They already run courses and we have asked them to extend their courses. We have told them that we will assist them to expand their courses. As a result of the Board&#x2019;s negotiations the Department of Coloured Affairs will soon establish a permanent school in Bellville for the training of Coloured hotel staff. These are things that have come about as a result of the activities of the Hotel Board. Negotiations are under way with the Department of Higher Education to commence the training of Whites for administration and managerial positions in the hotel industry. This has never happened before in South Africa. The Hotel Board is also preparing certain plans for the training of Bantu. Much of this progress is the result of discussions by a national committee on hotel training which was convened by the Hotel Board representing various departments and other bodies. That is my reply to the hon. member. This body operates and it is an autonomous body; it has three hoteliers on it, and is carrying out its functions very effectively.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Hillbrow. I know that he is capable of making a reasonable contribution to a debate. But I was disappointed with him this afternoon. Of course, I do not mean this in any unpleasant way. I want to say to him, and here again I do not want him to think I am doing so in an abusive manner, that he should remember that when he talks to this committee that he is not a philosopher talking from a &#x201C;preekstoel&#x201D;. Instead, he is talking to individuals.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no, I do not mean the hon. member for Houghton; I am talking about the hon. member for Point. The hon. member, more or less on the same lines as the hon. member for Johannesburg (North), tried to paint the picture that we were missing the bus as far as this tourist explosion was concerned. Here, he said, was a gold industry which may ultimately disappear and here, he continued, was a source of foreign exchange which could step into the breach. Of course, that is absolute nonsense. Not for a moment do I believe that tourism as a source of earning foreign exchange can ever equal the goldmining industry in this respect. Consequently, any suggestion of that nature is quite unrealistic. But the hon. member did that merely with the object of creating the impression that this Government was missing out. But yet from year to year the volume of tourists increases. We are increasing year by year the funds to attract tourists. That is what the hon. member is so upset about, because when his Party was in power they thought they were doing wonderfully well when they spent R90,000 on Satour and brought in 68,000 tourists, including tourists from Rhodesia. But now when the volume of tourists has come to 400,000 we are missing out, he said. Now that we are spending R1&#x00BD; million on Satour, we are losing out, he says. Of course, that is nonsense. If the hon. member wanted to make a political speech and attack this side of the House, that would have been fair enough, but then he should not try to pretend that he is making one of his highfalutin objective speeches. Let him rather talk like the hon. member for Durhan (Point), whose language I can understand.</p>

<p>I am sorry I overlooked to reply to the hon. member for Vasco earlier on. But in the course of my speech I referred to the question of research, a question which he also raised during his speech. We appreciate that research is necessary. To the hon. member for Benoni I should like to say that the R100 on the Estimates is merely a token amount. Our arrangements with the Treasury is that the moment we can come to them with a sound and approved plan that amount will be increased. Therefore this R100 is purely a token amount, indicating that we intend conducting a research into the tourist industry. I want to thank the hon. member for Vasco for his remarks about the 21st anniversary of Satour. To the credit of my colleagues on the other side of the House I must say that Satour was incorporated during the period when they held office. However, fortunately for the country, this Government took over in 1948 and were far more generous with Satour than hon. members opposite were when they were in power. The hon. member also referred to the Kuneni and the Caborra Bassa schemes and the many immigrant Portuguese that would eventually live there. He said that we could attract these as tourists. I shall go into it but from what I know of the Portuguese in Mocambique the position is that when they get leave they go back home, to Portugal of course, this in understandable and therefore it might be a little bit difficult to get them to come to South Africa as tourists.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand answered certain comments made by the hon. member <span class="col_6235-6236" refersTo="page_0322"/>for South Coast. Apart from that. I do not think he raised any question which requires a reply from me.</p>

The hon. member for Simonstown said they were not doing enough, and I quite agree with him. In fact, some local authorities are doing nothing at all. However, it is quite another thing for the Central Government to force a policy on to local authorities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, not capital assistance in the form which the hon. member has in mind. What we did do however, was to arrange with Treasury that the legislation regarding financial relations be amended in order to enable provincial authorities to do something in this direction. Of course, provincial authorities themselves have certain amenities &#x2014;like the Blyde River Oanyon, and so has the divisional council&#x2014;like the caravan camp at Miller&#x2019;s Point. These amenities must be decided by the local authority and their provincial authority. It is very easy to say that the central authority must do the promotion, but then I can say that the central authority will not want to do that without the right to see what is being done with the financial assistance given by it to local authorities. But the central authority itself has actually developed tourist amenities. The National Parks Board is run by the central authority: it is paid for by the central authority, and it is not only the Kruger Park. I think there are eight different parks and they will probably be expanded. But when it comes to the local authorities and the provincial authorities they themselves have the power to deal with this matter. It does not have to go to the central authority as the hon. member for Simonstown thinks.</p>

<p>Sir, False Bay has been going for a long time and I have never heard that policy advocated by hon. members on that side of the House. The construction of a harbour, where it is an economic asset from the point of view of harbour dues, is a different matter, and the construction of a fishing harbour in False Bay, a fishing harbour which is viable, is another matter, and the central authority goes into that. But I cannot justify expenditure such as that envisaged by the hon. member merely to accommodate holiday boats and that sori of thing. The suggestion has been made to me not only by people in False Bay but by people along the whole of the coast line, and perhaps the hon. member can tell me where I should start and where I should finish.</p>

<p>As far as that is concerned, I certainly would not know. The hon. member has been a member of this House for a long time; he sat on the Government benches for years, and I have never heard him sponsor that sort of expenditure by the Central Government.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member for Benoni that I have noted the points raised by him. I think that basically, from the South African point of view, there is tremendous room for our people in the country and in the cities to get together&#x2014;but they should go from the cities to the country rather than from the country to the cities. The cities have not got the amenities that the country can offer. If there is some way in which this Department can assist in creating that flow of holidaymakers. I will most certainly investigate it. I thank the hon. member also for his remarks about the Department and the report and for his statement that we have now established the basis for tourism.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote 39,&#x2014;Sport and Recreation, R335,000:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>At the outset I would like to say that we appreciate the fact that the Department supplied us with a preview of the annual report for last year. This Department has been in existence for approximately 18 months. The report is most informative on the principles on which the Department is working. It also gives certain information about grants and the intentions of the Department. As I have said, we appreciate the fact that this information was made available to us although the report as such has not been tabled because it has not been printed. It was useful to have it before the Vote came up for discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we must congratulate our sportsmen and sportswomen in South Africa on the results they achieved during this last year. I think the past year has been an exceptional one from that point of view. These achievements will culminate shortly in the presentation at a suitable function of the State Persident&#x2019;s Sport Awards, which are being awarded on this occasion to Mrs. Angela Harrison (hockey), Bob Hewitt and Frew McMillan (tennis) and Denis Lindsay (cricket).</p>

<p>Since this is the first occasion on which Parliament as such can express an opinion about this matter, I think that I voice the view of all members when I say that we in Parliament congratulate our sportsmen and sportswomen on their achievements. They are among the best ambassadors that this country can have overseas. I think that our sportsmen and sportswomen generally who go abroad, either as individuals or as members of teams, not only win renown for themselves but they also bring great credit to this country.</p>

<p>The position at the moment appears to be that the Department, in the short time that it has been in existence, has been making money available for coaching and training projects, for financing administrative bodies, for tours to this country and tours overseas, for bringing experts and sending out experts, for certain apparatus and publications and for a little research. I think this year the Government is setting aside in the Estimates R165,000 for that sort of item whereas last year it was R136,000. The amount to be voted for the Department is R335,000 as compared to R250,000 for the previous year. Sir, one might say that the Department is being run on a shoestring budget because R335,000 is not a great sum of money and in the circumstances it is understandable, but I do not think that this allows the Department to do what should be done in the field of sport and recreation because it has a long way to go. The first point that I want to mention in regard to sport is that I think the sooner a sport centre can be created the better. This matter was mentioned last year by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and others. I believe that that would give a tremendous fillip to sport and that it would facilitate training and make it easier to organize sport in this country. We know that in Britain there is the Crystal Palace centre, where expert training is available in the various fields of sport; in Scandinavia there is a centre which does the same, and I think in America there are similar facilities, although I do not know much about the American situation. I believe that if an appeal was made to all sporting bodies in this country to raise funds on a R-for-R basis, the Government contributing R1 for every R1 contributed by the sporting bodies, you would raise sufficient money to meet the capital costs of such a scheme. I think it is high time that this is done in the sporting field, and I can see nothing but good resulting from it. Such a centre would be a growth point for sport in this country. The establishment of such a centre would save sport liaison officers a tremendous amount of trouble. At the present time I think liaison officers, speaking from memory, had to attend about 282 meetings during the year. If we had such a centre, many of these people could be brought together there and things explained to them. Many of our young people could be trained there and I think that nothing but good could result from it.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the question of recreation. It seems to me that this is the sphere in which the least has been done by the Department, perhaps because it has not been in existence long and secondly because of the lack of funds. It would appear that as far as sport is concerned the Department is well buttressed by many organizations outside. As far as recreation is concerned we have the National Advisory Committee for Recreation which has had a checkered career. It has been passed from Education to Planning and from Planning back to Sport, with the result that it has not really got off the ground. Sir, my time is limited and I can only make one or two suggestions. I believe that there should be a survey of space available in this country. We believe that we have any amount of space to do anything but in fact I am informed that as far as Natal is concerned, there are only 16 miles available on the coast for further development. That is the only ground which has not yet been taken up. It is high time therefore that some sort of planning took place with a view to providing recreation for the present population and for our future population in this country. For instance, there is a national playground at the foot of Table Mountain; at any rate, it has been proclaimed as such. I do not know what has been done in that connection and I do not know what influence the Minister has in that respect. This situation applies throughout the Republic. It is also the older people, the people who have reached the age where they no longer actively participate in sport, that we should take an interest in, particularly in this day and age where the emphasis is more on leisure than ever before. I believe that the Minister would <span class="col_6239-6240" refersTo="page_0324"/>be doing great work if his Department would give some attention to this question of providing more recreational facilities for the people of this Republic.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. N. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up on what the hon. Chief Whip of the Opposition said in his speech. He put forward certain suggestions and I think that the hon. the Minister will reply to them himself. Sir, outdoor life is deeply rooted in the traditions of the South African. Whenever the South African seeks what is significant and glorious in his heritage, then he seeks it not in old ruins but in nature; he seeks it in our mountains; he seeks it along our rivers; he seeks it in our plains and he seeks it along our coast. He does so because our history is one of discovery, of clashes and of dearly-bought occupation; but this heritage is more than simply the land itself. The love for and contact with the land has always played an important and essential role in the formation and the development of the South African&#x2019;s character and philosophy. It has also ensured the fitness of our people. But we are losing the essential resources. As a result of the industrial explosion in South Africa, the greatest percentage of the population is at present concentrated in a few large centres; there they are being crowded together in flats, in dwellings and in areas where there is little space for relaxation. If one drives out to the recreational resorts near Cape Town over the week-ends, and one sees how congested these are then one realizes for the first time how serious the situation has already become and one shudders to think what the situation will be in the year 2000 if active steps are not taken now to combat this danger. That is why it is the duty and the task of the State to rectify this unfortunate state of affairs and to bring home the seriousness of the matter to local authorities and to the population itself. There are many bodies and many people who do not realize how late in the day it has become for South Africa in this regard. Let me mention one example. I have here a report which appeared a few weeks ago in the <i>Cape Times&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Part of playground is wanted for parking: Another attempt is to be made to get the use of part of the children&#x2019;s playground in Belvedere Road, Claremont, as a parking area to relieve the traffic and parking congestion that occurs at the shopping area on the opposite side of the road.</block>

<p>If that should happen, the community would be committing an offence against the children of Claremont. We so easily forget to-day. in our pursuit of economic gain, the finer and the more important things of life. Are we not doing to-day precisely what Thoreau once warned against when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why should we not have our national preserves for inspiration and our own true recreation? Or shall we, like villains, grub them all up, poaching on our own national domains?</block>

<p>During the past year two American experts in the field of recreation visited this country of ours, and I want to read to you what they had to say about the situation here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A visiting United States zoologist and nature conservationist has urged that land for nature reserves should be set aside as soon as possible in South Africa before the population explodes on American lines.</block>

<block name="quote">Professor Russel E. Mumford, vertebrate ecologist from Purdue University, Indiana, said: &#x201C;At home we have little virgin prairie land left and the Federal Government would dearly love to establish a prairie national park. But they are up against powerful grazing, mining and timber interests, and the land is prohibitively expensive.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Professor Wayne van Huss, a physical fitness expert, said that South Africa must not make the same mistake as the Americans by using its large open spaces injudiciously. New expansions must not be planned without sport and recreational facilities. During the past week Professor Wayne van Huss said in Pretoria that it is absolutely essential that sport facilities should not be neglected in the laying out of new expansions. He said that it has now been proved that young children should be subjected as far as possible to strenuous exercise. Their capacities must be utilized to the full in order to ensure their own protection in future.</p>

<p>In America the position to-day is so deplorable that in 1958 Congress appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Laurence Rockefeller to advise on this matter. This committee tabled its report in 1962. This report. under the title &#x201C;Outdoor Recreation in America&#x201D; can be studied profitably by those who are interested in this matter, as well as by those whose approach to this tremendous problem is an unsympathetic one. In the short time at my disposal, I cannot quote extensively from this report, but I am going to quote a few paragraphs. On page 7 it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each state, through a central agency, should develop a long-range plan for outdoor recreation, to provide adequate opportunities for the public, to acquire additional areas where necessary, and to preserve outstanding natural sites.</block>

<p>It goes further and states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Federal Government and the States should recognize the potential recreation values in highway construction programmes and assure that they are developed &#x2026; Government should stimulate and encourage the provision of outdoor recreation opportunities by private enterprise.</block>

<p><span class="col_6241-6242" refersTo="page_0325"/>This committee recommended that the Government should assist bodies to establish these recreational areas. They state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Initial grants of up to 75 per cent of the total cost of planning would be made the first year and a reduced percentage thereafter. Grants for acquisition for development would be made up to 40 per cent of the total cost &#x2026; The grants-in-aid programme should be supplemented by a programme of loans to the States. This would assist in projects where the States did not have matching funds available.</block>

<p>Now I am pleased to be able to say that our young Department of Sport and Recreation is tackling this matter on the basis as set out in this report, and as recommended by this committee in America, and I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and his handful of able and enthusiastic officials who have already achieved so much in the short while they have been in existence. I am only sorry that the funds of this Department and the manpower at its disposal are so limited. They can only penetrate the top layer, but they definitely cannot delve deeply into this problem. That is why I would welcome it if this Department could, during the course of the year, grow into a fully fledged Department, so that this problem, which constitutes a real danger to south Africa and the people who will come after us, can be solved by means of more funds and resources.

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I will not comment on the matter raised by the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet. because in the time at my disposal I should like to raise two entirely different matters with the hon. the Minister of Sport.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have always maintained that the administration of sport and the staging of sporting events should be left entirely to the bodies conducting those particular sports. I think hon. members here will remember that last year in this House in a debate we pleaded with the Government to allow the sporting bodies to conduct their sports in their own particular way. It is, therefore, rather disturbing to find that as the result of a statement made by the hon. the Minister of Sport, a certain amount of confusion and consternation has arisen in the minds of certain sporting bodies: and when I say this, I mean of course in relation to the proposed South African Games. You see, Sir, on the one hand we find that the Olympic Committee, after very careful consideration, took a firm decision that the South African Games should be staged in Bloemfontein in 1970. and then we find the Minister of Sport coming out with a statement in which he says that the Games will be held in 1969. I want to say immediately that I think the South African Games is a very laudable project, and I hope that it will be a great success, but I believe the time is opportune for the hon. the Minister to give us a clear statement and tell us how his Department is involved in the staging of these particular games? Because there is no doubt that this statement of his has caused a certain amount of confusion. We find various headlines in the Press. We find, for instance, that Mr. Braun, the Chairman of the Olympic Committee, says that sporting bodies need have no fear that there will be a sport takeover by the State. I want to say that I do not believe for one minute that the Government intends taking over sport. I merely raise this matter to show that we have to be very careful when making statements in regard to sport.</p>

<p>Then, too, we find that it was originally decided to have South African sporting games for both sections of the community, for the Whites and the non-white section, and we find, too, that the South African Games for the non-Whites have now been transferred to Umlazi in Natal. Now, I have no particular objection to these Games being held in Umlazi, but I would like to know whether the Department of Sport had a hand in this particular matter, because obviously this might be misinterpreted in certain quarters. I believe the Minister can give us an explanation and I would be very pleased indeed to hear what he has to say in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Then I should like to raise the matter of the National Sports Fund. As you know, Sir, this fund was made possible by a very magnificent grant by Messrs. Shell of South Africa. They made a grant of R150,000, and I think they should be complimented on the spirit they have shown in making this grant. I want to say, too, that I welcome the creation of a fund of this sort, but I believe that it should be taken very much further. There is no doubt that there are many other commercial and industrial concerns who would like to contribute to a fund like this, and I believe that the Government itself should set an example here and offer to donate rand for rand to build this fund up to at least R&#x00BD; million. I have a very good reason for saying this, because you know. Sir, that through no fault of their own various sports in South Africa find themselves completely isolated in the international sphere, and whereas one would expect any sport to look after itself in normal times and to find its own money when either inviting teams to come here or sending teams overseas, the position to-day is not normal. I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that any sport in South Africa needs a certain amount of international competition if it is to progress. We find that many sports are affected in this way, through no fault of their own. We find, for instance, that we are out of the Olympic Games to-day, and here I want to say that it is a great pity that the International Olympic Committee bowed to certain threats and called for a new vote, the result of which was that South Africa is now excluded from participation in the Olympic Games. We also know <span class="col_6243-6244" refersTo="page_0326"/>that football in South Africa to-day is completely cut off from international competition. We know that repeated attempts have (been made to have other sports like tennis, weightlifting, wrestling and athletics barred from international competitions. I mention this because obviously these particular sports will have to find funds somewhere either to send members overseas or to invite other teams or individuals to compete against them. I believe that the Government should give a lead in this matter. It has been shown already that there is an opportunity of getting money from commercial and industrial concerns, and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to give this matter of donating money on a rand-for-rand basis his very serious attention.</p>

<p>I see the hon. member has a guilty conscience. He did not object at that time, but I notice that he is still feeling ashamed of the way in which his colleagues behaved themselves. I say we are grateful for the change that has come over that side of the House; apparently the winds of change have affected them as well. I find it interesting that the hon. member should actually plead for a contribution to be made by the Government on the rand-for-rand basis during the ensuing year in respect of contributions such as, for example, this one of R150,000 and contributions made by other business undertakings.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I support this suggestion and I am very grateful for it, but I want to ask the hon. member, who is so arrogant, whether he conferred with the hon. members on that side of the House who spoke about financial matters earlier this year. They said the Government was spending too much and the hon. member now pleads that the Government should spend more. I say it is gratifying that we have had this change of attitude. It reminds you of the old saying, &#x201C;Experience makes fools wise&#x201D;. I am glad the Opposition has now reached the stage where it is beginning to appreciate good sense.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) also raised a few other matters. The tenor of his remarks was more or less the same as that of certain English newspapers when commenting on the fact that the date for the South African Games was changed from 1970 to 1969. He reproached the Government and the hon. the Minister as if the latter had virtually taken matters in their own hands and had decided to change the date. All of us regret the fact that South Africa may not participate in the Olympic Games in Mexico City this year owing to the pressure exerted by certain people. It is also a fact that our sportsmen, while they were hoping that it would, in fact, be possible for us to participate in the Olympic Games, achieved better results during the past year than they have ever achieved before. We have in mind, for example, the achievements of Paul Nash, Karen Muir and several other athletes, not to mention the sportsmen who will be honoured early next month in Cape Town when the State President&#x2019;s awards will be awarded to them. These athletes achieved (better results than ever before and we are proud of them. Should we have waited until 1970 for these athletes to have the opportunity of showing the world and South Africa on a national level what they and their country are capable of?</p>

<p>Who should decide?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>That is precisely the point. The hon. member mentioned the South African Olympics and National Games Association and said they had decided that the Games would take place in 1970 and that the Games would be for Whites and non-Whites. However, that decision had been taken before it was decided that South Africa may not participate in the Olympic Games. Should that decision have remained in force regardless? Should the Government not have taken the lead? After all, is it not one of the functions of this Minister and the department to establish liaison with sports organizations and to guide them? I think the hon. the Minister has provided sensible guidance in this regard. Should we have sat back with folded arms until 1970 before we held our national games?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>But the Minister should not have arranged it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The question of arrangement is quite a different matter. To my mind the hon. member does not quite appeciate this matter. The difficulty with this hon. member is that he always wants to drag politics into these matters and this is why he objects to the fact that the Minister announced that the games which will take place in Bloemfontein next year will be for Whites only. He complained about the fact that the games would not (be for both Whites and non-Whites. Anybody who is interested in sports, knows that good facilities are provided at Umlazi for nonWhites and that this is not the case in Bloemfontein. Does he want an inferior sports meeting to be held for our non-Whites simply because it was decided at that time that the games for non-Whites would take place there as well?</p>

<p>We have read in the newspapers about the frustration among our non-white sportsmen as a result of the decision that we may not participate <span class="col_6245-6246" refersTo="page_0327"/>in Mexico City. Such an athlete as Humphrey Khosi said that he simply could not understand the decision taken by the Olympics Committee; that he could not understand how they could shunt South Africa aibout in such a manner. He said that it actually hurt him to think that it was black people who were responsible for the fact that South Africa and people such as he could not participate in the Games. For that reason the best opportunity should be created for them as well, and the best opportunity according to the South African pattern and an opportunity which the non-Whites will appreciate, will not be an obscure sports meeting held at the same time as the South African Games in Bloemfontein, but their own sports meeting held in Umlazi, where the necessary facilities for the nonWhites exist.</p>

<p>I do not want to say anything more about this matter. I want to associate myself with hon. members, <i>inter alia,</i> also with the hon. member for Von Brandis, who congratulated the Minister and his department on this report which they have been able to furnish in the short period of two years, and on the enormous field which this young department has to cover. It is evident from the report how active the department is and over what wide field it is making its influence felt. I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet, who said it was time to think of expanding this department so that it will no longer be a department which is subordinate and neglected. In view of the position which is developing in the Republic where we have greater concentrations of people and also young people in our cities, this serves as the very reason why the activities of this Department should expand. Personally, it would give me much pleasure if the staff can also be expanded and if the department can be given a higher status. In the times in which we are living we need the large variety of activities which the department is at present undertaking and which the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet described. I make bold to say that if we succeed in activating our young people both in the field of sport and in a wider field of recreation and if we could help them to get away from the force of our expanding urban populations which is hemming them in on all sides, we would not have the conditions which are developing in our countries of origin in Europe at present.</p>

<p>I also want to say something about the necessity of sports centres. We have advanced a plea for such centres before now and the hon. member for Von Brandis also mentioned this matter this afternoon. If the idea to establish one or more sports centres in our country can be put into practice, I think the Department will be in a much better position to fulfil its function as regards the training of coaches and sports administrators. Our sports activities will then be placed on a firm and sound basis, and the result will be that sports organizations will be less inclined to come to the Department for financial assistance, but that their own activities will seize the imagination of the people and that they will become financially strong as a result of that.</p>

<p>Allow me to say a few words about the State President&#x2019;s sports award. This was also referred to by the hon. member for Von Brandis. These awards for 1967 will be presented in about four days&#x2019; time in the Castle here in Cape Town. Last year these awards were presented at the State President&#x2019;s residence, on which occasion the acting State President was present. Having particular regard to the circumstances which developed in respect of the Olympic Games and since we want to honour our sportsmen who have achieved great things and since we want to encourage them to continue to do so, we should see to it that when these particularly fine awards are presented, the representation thereof should also be something special. When the presentation takes place early in June at the Castle, the services of even only a small group of members of our Defence Force may also be used at the ceremony. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not wish to follow the line which the debate is taking at the moment, except to say I think the hon. the Minister is making a mistake to have the Sout&#x2019;i African Games at Bloemfontein and at Umlazi.</p>

<p>I believe that the correct procedure is that the Department of Sport should leave the organizers to run the show and to do what they want to do with it. I believe it is a mistake for the Government in the long run to interfere in any way because, after all, the organizers do know the requirements of the sport which is affected. They also know the laws of the country and the problems under which we suffer. I would therefore lend my support to the plea that the hon. the Minister should leave the sporting bodies to run the show and, in plain English, to mind his own business.</p>

<p>The other point which I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister is one of long standing between him and me. It is the attitude of the Department of Sport towards the other races in this country, namely the Coloureds, Indians and Bantu. During the previous session I raised this question with the hon. the Minister under this Vote and he gave me a very unsatisfactory reply. He said it depended on the Ministers of the Departments concerned to make application to him for any financial support which may be required for non-Whites from the Department of Sport. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether that approach is also not an incorrect one. As the Minister for Sport he should initiate action and take the lead in dealing with the other departments, because I am convinced after the past 12 months, that there is a crying need and a necessity for races, other than white, to enjoy the financial support of the Government <span class="col_6247-6248" refersTo="page_0328"/>in sporting activities in this country. There are many non-white sportsmen of very high calibre and competence. In nearly every case they have to leave the country, before their merits are really acknowledged, and before they get any reward at all for their skill and diligence. I believe that if the hon. the Minister would be the patron&#x2014;if I may make that suggestion&#x2014;of the movement in connection with non-white sport, he would take a tremendous step forward in this country, and at the same time rid ourselves of half of the sociological problems, with which we are faced because of the inability of Coloured persons, Bantu and Indians to enjoy organized sport and other individual sports. One has only to look at the schools, and Coloured schools in particular, to see the woeful lack of sporting facilities. As the hon. the Minister knows, I have had a lot of experience in one particular city where this problem was tackled. I believe that if we were to tackle the problem of the occupation of our youth, to let them work off some of their surplus energy chasing tennis, cricket and footballs and to let them take part in athletics and swimming, we would begin to see some daylight in this big problem, with which we are faced in regard to the non-white people. It is a matter of deep concern to those of us who work and move among these people. We see the way they struggle to form sports clubs and to get money together to finance their activities. It is quite rewarding to see that when they do get assistance, they do not only play very well, but that they also become better citizens. I think that this is the line which the hon. the Minister of Sport should follow. During the time that this portfolio has been in existence the hon. the Minister has confined himself exclusively&#x2014;and I hope that he will say that this is not so to-day &#x2014;to white sport. With that I have no complaint. South African sportsmen excel in all fields and I think it is problematical, as to whether or not they do need the financial assistance which they get. All sports among Whites in this country, which are conducted properly and organized on a satisfactory basis are money spinners, with one or two minor exceptions. The same does not apply in regard to the Coloured community. In terms of Government policy, townships with areas set aside for the benefit of their youth are established. The sporting facilities for youths which existed in the old areas, which they occupied, do not get transferred with them during their removal to new townships. I do not suggest that this is a function of this Minister. But what I do say is that it is his function to intercede and plead with his colleagues who, when approving the transfer of communities, should ensure that adequate facilities exist before these people are moved and that they do not have to travel miles, most of them on foot, to attend a football or cricket practice, or play a game of tennis far from where they are housed and settled. I believe that the hon. the Minister could do the country a service and himself a lot of good, if he would act as the intermediary between these other departments and the communities concerned. I am inundated with requests from Coloured persons all over the province, and not only in the province, for financial assistance. Hon. members know the old gag: &#x201C;Make him the vicePresident&#x201D;. Well, I am now the patron of most of these sporting bodies, and so I am in fairly close contact with them and the difficulties under which they suffer. I want to repeat the story I told the other day, when the Minister of Community Development evaded me. Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira, the cricketer, came to play cricket in this country before and with his own people and, thinking to make a few rand, they asked for a ground in an area which happened to be a private ground in a white area, in order to play a cricket match. There were many white sportsmen, as the hon. the Minister well knows, who admire and appreciate a good batsman or a bowler. They wanted to see this gentleman playing. To their confusion the permit arrived the day before the match. We shall not go into the details; that is a sad enough story on its own, but it stated that the match was for Coloureds only. So there we found ourselves with the Coloured community in this quandary. A side, which would include this gentleman, had been selected to give everybody an opportunity of seeing him play and perhaps seeing what an example he is of how to play cricket. But they were denied the opportunity. I do not want to make a political speech on that sort of thing, because this is not the occasion. I have dealt with that aspect before. But I do appeal to the hon. the Minister to realize that the whole country expects him to be a Minister of Sport, and not a Minister of Sport for one section only. That is how it appears at the present moment. I hope to-day that he will rise and tell me that I am wrong, that he does take care of all the other groups of people, that he does have plans, that he is giving consideration to certain aspects of matters which affect them, and that there will be an improvement within the next 12 months. If he can do that, I would be a very happy man. What is more important is that the Coloured community will be happy too. That does not only apply to them; it applies to the Indians and to a greater extent to the Bantu. I suggested to the hon. the Minister a year or two ago, that he should visit the city with which I am very familiar, and see what that local authority actually has done for the provision of sporting facilities for non-Whites. I have listened to the debate here this afternoon, only to find that there is mention only of Whites. I believe that these other people are entitled to a share of the cake, even though it be a small topiece to begin with. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was indeed a pleasant experience for me this afternoon when the hon. member for Von Brandis brought a refreshing atmosphere into this House during the debate on South African sporting affairs. It was, of course, a great <span class="col_6249-6250" refersTo="page_0329"/>pity that the hon. members for Johannesburg (North) and Karoo made a few inept remarks which detracted from this refreshing spirit. If the hon. the Minister of Sport had failed to realize the necessity for games to be held as soon as possible after we had been denied participation in the Olympic Games, and had not set up our own Games in Bloemfontein for our people, it would have been a great pity. On the other hand, the hon. member for Karoo maintains that very little or nothing is being done for our non-Whites by this Department. It is a great pity that the hon. member should have made such irresponsible remarks here, because just a few moments ago mention was made here of the large-scale Games which are going to be organized for our non-Whites in Umlazi. He also knows about the large-scale Games which are going to be organized for the Republic Festival in which non-Whites will also have an opportunity of participating.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it will cost them practically nothing. And yet he comes here now to try to antagonize our non-Whites once more. I wonder what people he is serving now? But I shall leave the matter at that. We hear that story quite often from the hon. member for Karoo. I think he is doing the people whom he is supposed to serve a very great disservice.</p>

<p>Sport is accepted in the civilized world as a very extensive phenomenon. This is the position to-day throughout the civilized world. I think we can mention no better example of this than Germany, where sport enjoys tremendous interest among the German nation, so much so that they say that in 1963 there were as many as 28,000 well-organized sports clubs with a membership of 4f million. Over and above this number 5 million pupils participated in the annual federal games. I am just mentioning this phenomenon as an example of the tremendous importance which sport is occupying in the civilized world. In my own modest opinion this wide interest in sport in modern times can be attributed to the fact that the nations of the world have to a large extent actually become urban nations, to such an extent that where the urban population of the world came to approximately 21 million 100 years ago, an estimated number of more than 500 million people inhabited the cities of the world in 1950. It is a fact that this pattern was also followed in South Africa. Where ours used to be a rural population who enjoyed the revelry and advantages of rural games and rural relaxation, these things have practically died out altogether or have changed altogether. That is why I think that our people in South Africa see in the activities which sport and recreation in modern times offer them, the satisfaction of their emotional and social needs. That is why sport and recreation have become so deep-rooted in our South African way of life. I do not think I can put it better than one of the well-known sports writers did the other day under the title &#x201C;The Romance of Sport&#x201D;, when he said: &#x201C;Loyalty, courtesy, courage and humour are all part of sport and in its finest exponents I find the qualities which can make my world a saner one.&#x201D; I think that with these words he clearly expresses the importance of sport and the immense benefit and influence which it has on the lives of all people. Therefore I want to say that we can accept the fact that as far as modern man in modern cities is concerned, sport can satisfy the needs of our people. But we cannot leave it at that, because sport must be channelled in the right direction and only then can it be of lasting value to our people.</p>

<p>It is a fact that all South Africans were very pleased when the establishment of this Department was announced on 1st July, 1966. They were not only pleased about the establishment of the Department, but also about the elevated objectives embodied in that establishment, because it was said at that time that it would be the task of this Department to promote sport and recreation in South Africa, in order that the South African nation could always remain a strong one. The <i>modus operandi</i> which was suggested was the modern one which is followed by most of the civilized countries of the world. It covered various facets, but the most important facets were on the one hand the promotion of training and coaching projects and on the other hand the promotion of the sound administration of sport. Since the Department has now been in existence for approximately two years, it is interesting to note that this Department has also operated along these recognized lines and that the Department places the emphasis in the first place on coaching projects on the one hand and on the promotion of the sound administration of sport on the other hand. It is true that these two facets go hand in hand. If one neglects one of them the other suffers. A sports club may have a very good coach but if its administration leaves something to be desired, it will not accomplish much and it will not achieve much in the way of results. Therefore these two facets must go hand in hand: The one in the first place to make provision for and to render assistance in regard to the establishment of good coaching and training projects, and on the other hand the promotion of sound administration. Along these lines our Department has, as I have said, followed the fine example which is followed in well-known Western countries which have already gone far along this road. It is also interesting, when one considers how young this Department is, just to mention a few examples of how far they have already progressed along this fine road. In this connection I want to refer to the best-known instances of assistance rendered by this Department. I am referring to our gymnastics, netball, the South African Paraplegic Association, and so on. If we want to go into <span class="col_6251-6252" refersTo="page_0330"/>details it is perhaps desirable to refer to one good example only. As far as gymnastics is concerned, no less than 17 coaching courses were arranged. Through the agency of the Department a Swedish gymnast could come to South Africa to provide the necessary guidance. This is the course which the Department has followed in respect of virtually all our well-known sports, but they did not leave the matter at that. They have also been giving the necessary attention to the other important aspects, namely the training of sports leaders for our sport. It is a fact, and everyone knows this, that a good sports leader and a good sports administrator are in point of fact synonymous. The one cannot be separated from the other. It was essential that the Department never left these two aspects in abeyance. In this connection I want to associate myself with what the previous speaker said, and that is that as a result of the great achievements of the Department and the correct directing principles which the Department has been following, I believe that the necessary status will be given to this Department and its officials within the foreseeable future. If our Department trains sports leaders, then surely it goes without saying that these people will carry their skills and knowledge not only into their sports associations, but also into their sphere of work or the community of which they are members. In this way we shall systematically build a well-ordered sports organization and a well-ordered recreation organization. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. B. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has had three votes running consecutively&#x2014;Forestry. Tourism and Sport&#x2014;and I was wondering whether next year he could not reverse the order so that we may have sport for tourists in the forest. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) was the last speaker on that side of the House and I do want to say again that I do not think hon. members on this side introduced anything of a political nature in their speeches. They were speaking as sportsmen. I am glad he mentioned how many million sportsmen there were overseas, especially in West-Germany, to show the importance of sport in the world. Sir, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the games that will be played at Umlazi will be open to all non-white races? Did I also understand the Minister correctly that his Department put up the cash for the Umlazi stadium? I ask this because we have no annual departmental report from his Department and we are therefore in the dark. Sir, I would like to put forward a plea this evening on behalf of a group of sportsmen and sportswomen who seem to be forgotten officially. I am referring to the members of rifle clubs, pistol clubs, clay-pigeon shooting and air rifle clubs. These people do not only practise for self-defence purposes, but more and more of them turn to this type of sport for recreational purposes, and they should be given some encouragement by giving grants to properly vetted clubs. To quote an example. A large town like Pietermaritzburg does not even have a rifle range at the present time for practice purposes. Not only do the members of these clubs become expert marksmen but they serve a dual purpose. By learning how to handle firearms expertly they could be very useful to the country in the event of any hostilities. Rifle clubs throughout South Africa usually arrange South African championship meetings annually, and clay-pigeon shooting clubs do the same. They occasionally send teams overseas to compete in international events. They have done exceedingly well at these competitions, quite apart from the fact that they have acted as South African ambassadors. Sir, it is an expensive pastime to compete in these events, and these people should be assisted financially.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I would like to support one aspect of sport which the hon. member for Von Brandis mentioned and that is big game hunting.</p>

In view of the fact that the animal population of our game reserves is rapidly increasing, to such an extent that it is becoming a problem, thanks to our conservation officers&#x2014;the Natal Parks Board, for example, has managed to preserve the famous white Rhino&#x2014;is it not possible to set aside game areas adjoining the game reserves where oversea hunters can shoot trophies under expert supervision?

<p>Botswana has proclaimed a very large game reserve around the Okavango swamps, and adjoining that they have these shooting blocks which are used by professional oversea hunters to shoot trophies. This has proved a great financial success to that country. Sir, this would attract wealthy tourists and sportsmen from overseas. The countries to the north of South Africa are no longer protecting their game herds for this purpose: on the contrary, they are allowing the unnecessary destruction of their game herds through lack of proper control. On account of this South Africa should grasp the opportunity of attracting hunters from overseas who would otherwise have gone to the Central African hunting grounds.</p>

<p>In conclusion, is the hon. the Minister satisfied with his oversea advertising campaign? I am given to understand that everything is controlled from Pretoria and that the adverrising <span class="col_6253-6254" refersTo="page_0331"/>campaign is very often unsuitable for the oversea country concerned.

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, has played his own game and I leave him in the competent hands of the hon. the Minister. In the few minutes at my disposal I should like to request the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention for a specific kind of sport, a sport which has developed dramatically in South Africa in the past four or five years. I am referring here to the colourful sport of boating in all its various facets, a sport which is increasingly succeeding in drawing hardened old landlubbers to our lagoons and larger dams over the weekends. Our ordinary people, especially in the family context, are to-day discovering in increasing numbers the pleasure and the challenge which a small boat on a large dam of water or a lagoon can offer one. In addition it is a fact that all the new synthetic materials which have come on the market recently and which have brought the construction of these smaller boats and also of sails within reach of the ordinary man, are causing this sport to be practised on an ever-increasing scale. At most of the large dams and lakes in our country, active sailing clubs are to be found in ever-increasing numbers to-day. As against fewer than 30 clubs ten years ago, there are 55 recognized sailing clubs in the Republic today, with an estimated membership of more than 10,000. The total value of pleasure craft in South Africa to-day amounts to more than R15 million, and about R8 million is spent on this sport every year. In South Africa to-day there are an estimated 10.000 ordinary small motor-boats. There are 4,500 sailing boats and more than 500 yachts in our country. There are altogether about 130 boating clubs in South Africa alone. Mr. Chairman, at the recent national yachting regatta held at the Langebaan Lagoon it was noticeable what large numbers of people turned up for this sport. At this national regatta about 300 different yachts competed, and the yachts which were used there differed in value from about R300 per boat to R6.000 per boat. Apart from this, it is also true that in the past few years South Africa has made its name internationally in the sport of sailing. I think that at the past six Olympic Games South Africa was strongly represented and made a name for itself.</p>

<p>I want to plead here for one matter in respect of this rapidly expanding sport. The Department of Planning established a standing committee at the end of last year in respect of the planning of lakes in South Africa, a permanent so-called lakes committee, which at this stage is charged with the planning of our lakes at places such as Knysna, Langebaan, the Verloren Valley and others. I am aware of the fact that this committee of the Department of Planning is at the moment giving its attention to these lakes. I think that we should see to it that in respect of this particular sport we have representation on this lakes committee of the Department from the very beginning. At the recent national regatta which took place in March, it struck me that at least four international yachtsmen took part, one from West Germany, two from the United States and one from Denmark. I had the privilege of talking to all these persons at this particular occasion and they all focused attention on the tremendous potential of especially certain lakes in South Africa for this particular kind of sport. Therefore I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that he should see to it that the Department of Sport will have permanent representation on this lakes committee of the Department of Planning with a view to planning this type of sport correctly from the beginning. There is, for example, the question of quay facilities and slipways for the drawing out of the larger boats and numerous other aspects affecting this particular kind of sport. I think that, as far as this developing sport is concerned, it would be a good thing if we planned correctly from the beginning and if the Department took another look at all our lakes in South Africa. Here is a colourful sport which, in our beautiful country with its abundance of sunshine and space, can be planned at an early stage and can become one of our greatest assets. I think that we must attend to the matter at an early stage, because it would be a tragedy if we again had to come along with planning after the event as regards this rapidly developing sport. Therefore I want to make a kind appeal to the hon. the Minister to see to it that the Department of Sport will be very well represented on this standing committee of the Department of Planning.</p>

<p>At the outset I should like to add my appreciation to that which has already been expressed to the hon. the Minister and his Department for the very fine work which has been done in the course of a short period. I also want to congratulate them on the good annual report which will shortly be available in its official form and which will give us a very good indication of what has lately been done by this Department. To-night I want to predict that this Department of Sport will still be called on in the future to make a very important contribution to making especially the youth of South <span class="col_6255-6256" refersTo="page_0332"/>Africa able-bodied. We must never underestimate or disregard this important task of theirs. We want to express our appreciation to the Department for the very sympathetic reception one gets from them when representations for aid and assistance are made. From the nature of the case it is not always possible for them to comply with all the requests which they receive, but in spite of that I do not know of a single organization which has not at least been satisfied, even if only by a long-term promise.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the annual report is concerned, I should like to point out one matter which is of great importance to all of us and which is near to the heart of all of us, and that is the question of adventure projects. The position at present is that children in our cities are at present denied the privilege of giving expression to their thirst for adventure along properly controlled lines. When one consults the annual report, the fact that a very small contribution, as against what it should have been, was made in this regard in the past, is a source of some concern to one, and I trust that for the next ensuing year and for the years to come, the Department will find it possible to an increasing extent to devote more money, attention and time to this aspect.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which I still have at my disposal I should like to refer to another matter and I should like to pose a question which is relevant to this matter, and that is whether the time has not arrived for the Department of Sport to broaden its outlook as regards a particular matter. I am referring to the question of foreign universities coaxing fine sportsmen and sportswomen away from South Africa by offering them attractive bursaries. I want to ask whether the Department cannot do something in order to combat this state of affairs. I say combat, because this type of thing can, on the one hand, have many advantages, and I should like to view it in that light, but on the other hand it surely has many disadvantages which we must never overlook. I should like to draw attention to two possible evils in particular.</p>

<p>In the first place it robs South Africa of its young sportsmen and women at a time of life when they would actually have been able to make their greatest contribution to the enrichment of the South African sporting scene. They are taken from us at the prime of their sporting careers. I do not want to say anything more in this regard, although one can say a great deal more about this matter.</p>

<p>But a second evil may attach to this, and that is that when these people arrive at those foreign universities, it may happen willy-nilly that they are estranged from those things in which we as Whites in South Africa believe. Although this is a Department which is not dogmatic in its attitude, I think we must not lose sight of the dangers of indoctrination overseas. But now I should like to ask, in the light of what I have just said, whether the time has not arrived for this Department to give consideration to the question of bursaries for prospective students so as to enable them in the first place to study preferably at South African universities. I am convinced that at present the South African universities can offer young students every opportunity, also as regards their sporting activities, to realize themselves to the full, and consequently there is no real compelling reason for these people to go overseas. But if they have to go, let this Department, on a very selective basis, give consideration to the question of bursaries for these people to study at overseas universities, but on the very clear understanding that upon their return to South Africa their services, and especially their services in the field of sport, will be available to this Department.</p>

<p>Poor old Vause Raw! He must try to save the bacon. But I want to come to a serious part of the debate which was introduced by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North). He raised a matter, supported by the hon. member for Karoo, this hon. member who two years ago said that Fascist Italy established a ministry of sport and Nazi Germany established a ministry of sport. That was the language that hon. member used. Both those two hon. members raised the matter of my behaviour in regard to the sporting bodies, and I want to reply to it. The hon. member for Karoo said I must mind my own business. He says that to a Minister of Sport! Obviously sport has nothing to do with me. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) took me to task because he said I had issued an unfortunate statement. I have that unfortunate statement here, and I will read it. The hon. member should not just go by Press cuttings because they are very misleading. I know that the hon. member is out to cause a little mischief. That is all he is out to do.

<p>I want to read exactly what took place and I want to show this House in what way the hon. member maintains that I was using the big stick. Listen to this. I want to show hon. members, including the hon. member for Johannesburg (North), what took place, immediately the situation arose that this money was made available. Before that, the South African Olympic Committee announced they were going to hold the South African Games in Bloemfontein in 1970. When this sum of money became available I approached the Government and the sporting bodies to try and sort out the position. Many sporting people and sports administrators in South Africa contacted me and my Department and said, &#x201C;You know, 1970 is too late.&#x201D; I just do not understand the hon. member. He said I must do everything possible for the young sportspeople of South Africa who could not compete in the Olympic Games. My attitude and that of the people who approached me was, as I said, that 1970 would be too late and that we should hold the South African Games as soon as possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Just let me finish and then the hon. member can ask me as many questions as he likes. What did I do? I spoke to them and I arranged for my Department to speak to Mr. Frank Braun and tell him about the representations we had received and that we were in the position to assist him. I also interviewed the Shell people, and although they had stipulated the money should be for a sport festival, I asked them whether they would consent to some of the money being used for the South African Games? I eventually persuaded them to allow R50.000 of the money to be spent on the Games. I approached the Government and it also consented to contribute R50.000 towards the Games. I then went to Mr. Braun and asked him whether the Games could not be held in 1969 because 1970 was too long ahead, we could not expect our young people to wait so long because they wanted something immediately. That is what I said here. I have a Press cutting which says the South African Olympic Committee decided unanimously to have the Games in 1969 and not 1970. Do hon. members know why? Because they are interested in our sportsmen and sportswomen. When they got assistance of this nature they were able to carry on and prepare for 1969.</p>

<p>Oh, I must only finance. Let me tell the hon. member something he should in any case know. In the past, before this Department was established, when the South African Games were held here in 1960, they called on the Department of Education, Arts and Science for someone to assist them in organizing those games. They again called on the Department in 1964, and they will call on the Department again now. I say, regardless of the sneers of hon. members opposite, we know how to run these matters and we will give them every assistance they need. But the hon. member tries to create an atmosphere of suspicion here; he tried to make out that this terrible Department was following the lines which they thought it would, namely to control sport in South Africa. Mr. Braun is the chairman of the committee which is organizing the 1969 Games. The executive committee members who are appointed to this committee will act on it. Mr. Braun said he had given the assurance that the Bloemfontein Town Council would be represented on the committee. Also on the committee will be representatives of the South African Swimming Federation as well as the Athletics president. The Secretary of Sport will also be on the committee. Is there anything wrong with this state of affairs? Should the Secretary not be on it?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as these sport centres are concerned I want to say that I and the Department are very anxious to see them established, but I do not have funds to establish them. It is not one of the functions of the Department, as outlined, to establish these sport centres. I heard that the Federation of Sports is thinking of establishing a sport centre in Pretoria. I was very happy to hear of this, but this will not be done with Government funds, because there are no Government funds available for sporting centres. I would like to hear from the hon. member where such a sporting centre should be situated. Should it be in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town or Durban? Who is going to make the choice? This is not for the Government to decide and that is why I say that the problem is not as simple as the hon. member thinks. Hon. members also said that more attention should be paid to recreation. I quite agree with this. I am trying to develop the forest reserves into recreation centres, because I believe that they offer natural scope for recreational centres. On the other hand, one of the main features of this Department is that the Department should assist in developing sport in this country for the physical benefit of our people. The hon. member said that sport is buttressed by sporting associations. That may be. Sport is buttressed by some very fine sporting associations, but nevertheless the whole idea was to give them the opportunity of increasing the numbers that are participating in the various sports. I think that the Department has succeeded in this <span class="col_6263-6264" refersTo="page_0336"/>respect. More and more people are taking an interest and are participating in sport and I think it will be an asset to the country. There will be far less money spent on medical expenses and I have no hesitation in putting the case forward that this is a very good investment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Graaff-Reinet talked about our natural South African love of the soil and nature and the need for people in the crowded cities to go into the countryside. I fully agree with him and I would like to see the extension of our forestry reserves to be such that it can accommodate more people. The department is also trying to make an assessment of what one would call the major recreational parts of the country. We realize that, although we live in a vast country, there may eventually be a shortage of such areas. He talked about a playground which was being closed at Claremont to make way for a parking area and I also agree with him in principle that we have far too little open spaces. That is not one of the open spaces which should be used for parking facilities. The hon. member for Karoo talked about me minding my own business. As one can expect, he also spoke about non-white sport and it seemed that he thought they were neglected. I can assure him that the department has actively assisted in creating various opportunities for non-white sport. The Department of Sport has been in close contact with, the departments concerned with the well-being of the non-Whites and plans are being made. It is not my function to announce all these plans, but I can only reiterate that every possible aid in the technical sense is given by us as a department and will be given in the future. I might also mention that a course was run for Indian sports administrators. There were plans for a sports festival for Coloureds. We also assisted the Bantu groups through the Department of Bantu Affairs in certain aspects. We are going to have the non-white South African Games in 1969. I think that shows us the attitude of the Government. The Government is quite prepared that the non-Whites should have their games at a centre such as Umlazi, or a place where the facilities are very good. The finance required to assist those gamts will come from the Board of Trustees. We laid it down that the funds collected were not to be used only for white sport, but that they should also be used to finance, not only the South African non-white games, but also, when we have the Republican Festival, the sporting festivals which the non-Whites will have at the same time. He said that I should initiate the situation. I say that the initiation as regards financing lies with the departments concerned, as I explained to the hon. member, and the Government has no intention of changing that policy. He said that all we did was confined exclusively to white sport. That is not true, and the facts are not as he stated. He may say that it is not sufficient, but it is not true that they are exclusively directed to white sport.</p>

<p>Then I go on to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central). As I have said before when he speaks about sport it is a language that I understand. I am always very happy to listen to him, because he, as I see it, has the same outlook that I have. He appreciates the physical fitness of people which can be attained through sport. I myself think that the basis on which he laid out his philosophy is one which I understand.</p>

<p>I was not too sure whether the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) was talking about tourism or sport, because he drifted on to what I should do overseas with regard to publicity. I do no publicity about sport overseas. I only do what I can in South Africa for South Africans. He also talked about rifle clubs, pistol clubs, and clay pigeon shoots, and said that these were neglected as far as the department was concerned. I think the hon. member should know that the department gave a grant of R2,000 to the South African Rifle Association. It is not a big grant. I do not want to pretend that it is such a large amount. But the spirit and the idea of assisting a body like that was a principle the department accepted. He talked about big game hunting as a sport. I do not want to fall foul of the Leader of the House, but as far as I am concerned, it is still a low priority. There are many other matters we have handled up to now in which I am more interested.</p>

<p>Maybe. The hon. member for Moorreesburg talked about the boating sport on the inland dams. I might tell him that the South African Yacht Racing Association received R1,800 from us, the department accepting the principle that we should encourage it. The Rowing Association received from us some R350. In that respect, we appreciate the value of that as a sporting activity.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs spoke about adventure projects. He knows that we have a number of adventure projects, which have been a great success. They have not been projects that could be handled easily by people. They were for youngsters, who had to suffer trial and tribulation. They walked through the Fish River Canyon for three days. But, nevertheless, it was an adventure project which was a great success. We have had others along the coastline and in the Tsitsikamma Forest, and they also have been successful. He talked about the department being able to offer bursaries to our sportsmen. I would say that there are bursaries available from an educational point of view, but they are not specifically directed at people who have attained great achievement in sport and not the great achievement as far as knowledge is concerned. But those bursaries are definitely available through the Education Department. My department does not issue bursaries from a sporting angle.</p>

<p><span class="col_6265-6266" refersTo="page_0337"/>I think that I have now replied to all the hon. members who spoke on this Vote. I personally feel that progress is being made. I am sure that the latest awards, as mentioned by the hon. member for Von Brandis, have been popularly received. There is a cricketer, a women&#x2019;s hockey captain and two tennis players, Bob Hewitt and Frew MacMillan who won the Wimbledon doubles championship, which was an international match. As these awards are intended for people who achieve international status in sport, in this case for 1967, I think that they were well earned. I am sure that the congratulations of our people are extended to these sportsmen and women on both sides of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the half hour?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we believe that it is vitally important to South Africa that we revert to a position of normality again soon in our relations with the rest of the world. We believe that our well-being and our security make this a priority matter. By &#x201C;normal&#x201D; I do not mean that we should suddenly become the blue-eyed boy of every country in the world. No government in the world has been as lucky as that. By &#x201C;normal&#x201D; we mean that we move out of the category of international problem countries and. that the countries that matter to us stop considering us as a case for special attention. Quite honestly, we on this side of the House do not believe that it is within the resource of the present Government to accomplish this for South Africa. As far as they are concerned it is a case of too late: as the proverb has it, a wounded reputation is seldom cured. In any case we shall get nowhere while our system is such that we have cases, as for instance last week, where the Security Police swooped on a few boys playing a ball game, the news reverberating around the world and washing away all the neat philosophical treatises about separate development. I say categorically that unless we eliminate factors which constantly weaken our country&#x2019;s position, we will never progress internationally. That is why we on this side believe that South Africa&#x2019;s interests demand a change of Government and nothing less than that. We shall continue to work ceaselessly for that change.</p>

<p>At the same time we are always prepared to give credit where credit is due. I have said before in this House and I wish to say it again, that we have a distinct regard for the present Minister of Foreign Affairs and the hard-working body of men here and abroad who labour day and night to overcome the handicaps under which South Africa suffers and which their own Government is constantly creating for them. We are always anxious for South Africa&#x2019;s sake that the Government of the day should have success in the field of foreign relations. Therefore we were greatly heartened when about five months ago, just before we gathered here for the present Session, the Prime Minister stated confidently that 1968 might see, as he put it, &#x201C;an end to unreasonable international pressure on South Africa&#x201D;. Therefore it came as a very unpleasant shock to our people when, in the first place, the British and American attitudes hardened in respect of the delivery to South Africa of arms for external defence and when the spirit of Simonstown appeared to collapse. This was quite a massive setback for our diplomacy. We have since been looking to France, and as things have been developing there one wonders whether we have not landed on extremely risky ground. We watched with great concern the open sympathy which terrorist attacks on South Africa aroused in high quarters abroad and the extreme demands made on us by the United Nations, the membership of which costs our country R678,600 for the coming year. In the past year there was again the same show of solid determination on the part of the major powers to terminate our administration of South West Africa. It was a very welcome sign that the U.S.A, again expressed itself against the use of force as a method. But the enforcement arm of the United Nations, namely the Security Council, has been called upon to take, what they call, appropriate measures in regard to the South West Africa question, and the United Nations continue to treat South West Africa as a question of the highest priority. Finally there was the staggering ease with which international pressure groups succeeded in reversing our initially successful effort to enter the Olympic Games. While this certainly cast a very bad light on some of the people with whom we have to deal, at the same time there was no joy in it for us, because it tended to show that the climate abroad is still so politically unfavourable to us that it remains relatively easy for the &#x201C;hate South Africa&#x201D; group to muster general support for action of some sort against us. All this is very disconcerting, the more so when at the end of March this year the Prime Minister announced at Calvinia that:</p>

<block name="quote">Suid-Afrika het nou voor sy grootste be-dreiging te staan gekom. <i>(Die Burger</i> 1st April, 1968).</block>

<p>One Government newspaper saw the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech as a warning that &#x201C;our darkest hour had come&#x201D;. A day or two later the Prime Minister went further and said in Pretoria:</p>

<block name="quote">Die Kommunistiese wereld soek Suid-Afrika se ondergang en die nie-Kommunistiewe wereld trag om horn te verander &#x2026; U sal die ontwikkelinge gade slaan wat in die volgende maande gaan kom. Dit sal kom op alle terreine. Laat ons geen illusies daaroor he nie &#x2026; <i>(Die Burger</i> 2nd April, 1968).</block>

<p><span class="col_6267-6268" refersTo="page_0338"/>This was indeed a very sombre view of South Africa&#x2019;s international position. It is certainly a very far cry from the more confident tone we heard from the Prime Minister only five months ago. I think that the time has come that the hon. the Minister should put our position in perspective and that he should tell the country exactly where we stand as regards our international position and what we are to expect, as the Prime Minister put it, &#x201C;op alle terreine in die maande wat voorle&#x201D;. I know that there are people who believe that the Government is overdramatising the position and that it is doing so for party-political purposes. Let me say that if that were true it would certainly be a very serious position. We are looking to the hon. the Minister to put the matter into proper perspective for us.</p>

<p>For the department the past year seems to have been an exceptionally busy one in the field of publications. I have here several publications distributed by the Department of Foreign Affairs this year. Naturally it is the right thing to do. Accusations should not be left unanswered. I wish that I had the time to comment on each of these publications, because there is room for improvement and certainly room for criticism. The criticism we have and which applies to all the publications is that the idiom employed in the political section is the idiom of the &#x201C;ism&#x201D;-state and not that of the democratic state. I am not suggesting that this is deliberate and that it is a calculated move on the part of the department, but I believe that it remains our most serious mistake in the representation of South African affairs abroad. Let me explain what I mean. In a democratic parliamentary system like ours the state, the country, South Africa, is permanent. Policies, parties and governments are impermanent and subject to change. In authoritarian countries state and political doctrine go together. In these publications the emphasis is constantly on what is termed &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s policy of separate development&#x201D;, as though state and doctrine were one. In other publications the following term is repeatedly used: &#x201C;South Africa believes that &#x2026;&#x201D; This is done, as though party and country were one. I say that there, is. an authoritarian flavour about the publications which should be avoided in dealing with matters which go abroad. The emphasis should be on the friction of ideas in South Africa, which forms the essence of our parliamentary system. Government point of view should be pronounced as Government policy, as is done in all democratic countries, and not as South Africa&#x2019;s policy, for the simple reason that the opposing policies and points of view, the minority points of view, are as much South Africa&#x2019;s as those of the Government. I have here a booklet entitled &#x201C;South Africa and the Rule of Law&#x201D;. There is a whole chapter which is entitled &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s Policy of Separate Development&#x201D;. Tucked away, right at the end, there is a very short chapter, which starts as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is no offence in South Africa to oppose the policy of separate development. It is opposed by the Opposition party in the South African Parliament itself.</block>

<p>Quite right, but a few paragraphs later this curious statement follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite all efforts by foreign instigators to counter them, South Africa&#x2019;s policies &#x2026;</block>

<p>Again the words &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s policies&#x201D; are used, although it had just been said that the Opposition, which forms a big part of South Africa, is opposed to it. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; South Africa&#x2019;s policies enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of its peoples and are achieving increasing success &#x2026;</block>

<p>This second paragraph completely contradicts the first paragraph, and underlines the very thing I am complaining about. I would advise the department to make a comparative study of publications issued by democratic countries like Britain, America, Holland, Belgium and others, and those issued by authoritarian countries. They can go into our reading room and they will see several such publications, such as the publications of Bulgaria. They will find that there is a marked difference between the one and the other. We should take note of this. When South Africa is portrayed the picture of South Africa must be given truthfully, as it is. One side alone does not represent South Africa. [Interjections.] Time and again foreign visitors who have been to South Africa have told me that before they came to South Africa they only knew South Africa in terms of one policy, namely apartheid. What impressed them most after they had been here, was the friction of ideas and the fact that South Africa was not in fact the monolithic race doctrine state which they quite wrongly believed it to be, but that here they found a healthy divergence of view, widespread opposition to the Government and a changing pattern even on the Government side itself. One foreign visitor after another will tell you that this is the most commendable part of what they find in South Africa. It was because of this situation that they left South Africa with more sympathy and understanding for our country than before. [Interjections.] The picture of South Africa must be presented as it is, as all democratic countries do.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was interested in the official use of the terms &#x201C;Whites&#x201D; and &#x201C;Africans&#x201D;. The term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; is also used, but I think that the Minister of Bantu Administration should take note of this matter. Here we have the official use of the terms &#x201C;Whites&#x201D; and &#x201C;Africans&#x201D; and &#x201C;White nations&#x201D; and &#x201C;African nations&#x201D; in South Africa. I want to ask the hon. the Miinister: Are the Whites not also Africans? Are we not all South Africans? .1 appreciate the fact that the term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; is not always understood abroad, but we should <span class="col_6269-6270" refersTo="page_0339"/>avoid the impression that we, the Whites, are &#x201C;indringers&#x201D; or non-Africans. Admittedly this is not an easy problem, but the department should set language experts to work to find or create or adopt terms which will avoid colour appellations like black and white, and yet make it clear that we are all Africans.</p>

<p>Coming to Africa, the past year saw some very interesting developments in Southern Africa. There was the arrival of the first black diplomat and some very realistic and cooperative statements from neighbouring African leaders. At the beginning of this Session, in February, I asked the Minister of Information a question in regard to the so-called diplomatic suburb in Pretoria. We wanted to know the price paid over and above the initial price of R395,000. I hope that the hon. the Minister can now give us the full details. I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister whether similar purchases for the same purpose in other cities are contemplated, and if so in what cities, and what steps have been taken in this direction. I must say again to the Minister that we do not like this idea of a diplomatic suburb, because it is bound to be viewed with misunderstanding. We have something like this in Brazilia. [Interjections.] I am coming to that. But Brazilia was built from scratch as a new capital rising out of the veld. As such it was planned from the start in every detail.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the only other places where you have diplomatic suburbs are the Communist capitals and this, as we all know, is for purposes of restriction. Our advice to the Minister is to drop the idea. Against our political background of separation the idea would be viewed with suspicion. We believe that it would be far better for the Government to deal with each case individually and to help newcomers to acquire land and accommodation in the place and area of their own choice, and according to merit. After all, Sir, we have had consular representatives here from non-white countries for a long time, and I am not aware that accommodation for them caused any particular problems. Sir, there is one matter in which we must ask for the intervention of the hon. the Minister. We do not believe that it is healthy for South Africa that the position of non-white diplomats should be in any doubt at all or become the subject of party political wrangling. For instance, at a meeting at Montagu, as reported in <i>Die Burger</i> of 26th March this year, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development (Mr. Vosloo) said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Swart diplomate van Afrika sal nie hier in blanke swembaddens swem nie. As dit verlang word, sal die nodige swembadge-riewe vir nie-blanke diplomate geskep word.</block>

<p>One would like to know whether this is indeed Government policy, coming from a Deputy Minister of the Cabinet. But to go further, at the end of last year there was a meeting at Waterkloof where Mr. Tom Langley was present. I quote from <i>Dagbreek</i> (3.12.67)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Mosie is selfs ingedien waarin gevra word dat die voorgestelde woongebied vir nie-blanke diplomate &#x2026;</block>

<p>Listen to that! Already the impression is that this is a suburb for non-white diplomats&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; dat die voorgestelde woongebied vir nie-blanke diplomate nie aan Waterkloof moet grens nie, maar aan &#x2019;n bestaande nie-blanke woonbuurt.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not think that this kind of thing is a good thing for South Africa, and I think that a stop should be put to it. The only way in which we can put a stop to it is by getting a categorical statement from the hon. the Minister and from the Prime Minister that all foreign representatives&#x2014;White, Black and Brown&#x2014;will be treated on exactly the same footing and that no one will have better or fewer privileges, because of his colour, than the other, and that the non-white diplomats will have absolutely the same freedom of South Africa as the white diplomats. I sincerely hope that this matter will be cleared up once and for all by the hon. the Minister and by the Prime Minister when he speaks again and that politicians will learn to place the interests of South Africa above the interests of their party in vital matters of this kind.</p>

<p>Fortunately our commercial links with African states seem to be growing in a healthy manner. Already we have an air link with Malawi, Madagascar, Botswana, Swaziland and others. Ibis is ah excellent development. But <span class="col_6271-6272" refersTo="page_0340"/>again the question will arise of offices, residential accommodation and general facilities for staffs as these links grow, and already at this stage the air hostesses are black hostesses. Sir, we would like to know what the policy of the Government is in respect of the developments which must inevitably follow upon friendly political relations, because if we do not handle matters of this kind carefully we will endanger continued friendly political relations. We believe that the time has come for us to leapfrog our immediate neighbours and try to make friends with African states further afield. As we have pointed out before, we believe that if there is one country with which we should try to forge closer political links it is Madagascar. The Republic of Malagasy is so strategically placed in the Indian Ocean that close relations with that country is a natural for South Africa. We were therefore pleased to see that what looked like an important delegation from Madagascar recently visited South Africa, and we would like to know if the time is opportune for the hon. the Minister to make a statement and whether he can hold out any hopes for us in respect of diplomatic ties with Madagascar.</p>

<p>Sir, before my time expires I want to put a few further questions. The first concerns the treaty sponsored by America, Britain and Russia to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. While in principle we should be amongst the first to support a non-proliferation treaty, we believe it is quite right that we should press for adequate safeguards for ourselves and others and that we should reserve our position until the matter is fully cleared up. We are aware of the fact that important discussions have been taking place in South Africa in the last few days and we should like to know if the Minister is in a position to make a full statement to-day.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, South West Africa is still a major target for attacks upon us. I have here the text of the letter which the Minister sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, on 27th March of this year. In this letter the Minister stresses the fact that in the early stages of the dispute between South Africa and the United Nations, &#x201C;the Government was voluntarily prepared to seek the solution for the problem of South West Africa by negotiation with the United Nations.&#x201D; I should like to know whether it is still the opinion of the Government that the matter of South West Africa should be settled on the basis of negotiation with the United Nations and the finding of a basis of agreement mutually acceptable to the United Nations and South Africa. If that is so, we would like to know whether the Government&#x2019;s opinion is that there would have to be a give-and-take approach on both sides. If this is not the opinion of the Government, then may we ask what is the Government&#x2019;s long-term approach to the question of a solution of the South West Africa issue. I think it is important that we should know what the long-term approach of the Government is and that we should understand it. We therefore look forward to the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this connection.</p>

<p>We would also like to know how many envoys of Governments accredited to South Africa made use of the Minister&#x2019;s invitation early in 1967 to visit South West Africa and to see conditions for themselves. Then finally it is interesting to note that countries like Canada and Malawi have been calling on the United Nations to reopen dialogue with South Africa. We would like to ask whether there has been any new development in respect of a personal representative of the Secretary-General visiting South Africa for talks with the Government.</p>

<p>Then there are a few items on the Estimates on which we should like to have a little more light. Firstly, there is the contribution to the Foreign Affairs Special Account of R500,000, which I know is in the nature of a secret account; we accept it as such. Secondly, a short while ago we passed the Economic Co-operation Promotion Loan Fund Act under which R5 million was set aside for direct aid to developing countries, particularly in Africa. But then I come to the item in which we are interested and that is &#x201C;Assistance to and cooperation with foreign countries, R350,000,&#x201D; which represents an increase of R100,000 over last year&#x2019;s figure. I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister would explain that particular item to us. Then, Sir, the case at The Hague is mentioned again in the Estimates, and I wonder whether the final figure of the cost of the case to South Africa is now available.</p>

<p>Then a few final questions: I recently read that we had now reached the stage where women are also to be trained as diplomats in South Africa, and I wonder whether the Minister can tell us what we can expect in that direction. Sir, at the end of last year two members of the Cabinet posed the question whether South Africa should not rather become an &#x201C;uncommitted&#x201D; country and form its own little world next to the &#x201C;third world&#x201D;. Mr. Schoeman, the Leader of the House, very seriously posed that question and the hon. the Minister himself later posed the question whether it would not be wiser for South Africa to become an uncommitted country and not stand so clearly on the side of the West. I got the impression that a sort of pattern was developing here, and I would like to know whether the Minister has had further thoughts on this idea and what he and the Government think of the idea at this stage.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I have previously pleaded here for what I called a more relaxed attitude in respect of our foreign affairs. I refer here to the continuation of the practice of not attending some of the national festivals of important countries in South Africa. I would like to know from the Minister whether the time has not <span class="col_6273-6274" refersTo="page_0341"/>come for us to drop our objections and attend these national festivals. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at this stage I do not want to enter fully into all the matters raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I just want to remark in passing that he started off on a particularly low level to-night, much lower than usual, and that he maintained that low level throughout. I want to inform the Committee very Firefly to-night about one matter touched upon by the hon. member, and that is the question of non-proliferation and the talks held in connection with it this week. I want to begin by pointing out that South Africa is in favour of the principle of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. This explains why South Africa, as one of the major uranium-producing countries of the world, decided long ago to do nothing in respect of uranium sales to the outside world which might lead to proliferation. At the general conference of the International Atomic Energy Commission held in 1966, the South African representative, the leader of our delegation, gave the following assurance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is acutely conscious of her special responsibilities as a major uranium producer in relation to the problem of nuclear proliferation, and I should like here to repeat the assurance we have given elsewhere, that it is South African policy, in the context of uranium sales, to do nothing which might conceivably add to the number of powers with nuclear bomb capacity.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, South Africa still subscribes to this principle. You must bear in mind, however, that we occupy a special position in this regard as one of the major uranium producers of the world, and on account of the fact that the production of uranium is linked to our gold-mining industry. We have quite a number of problems as regards the draft treaty in connection with non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which is before U.N. at the moment. It is very clear to us that one cannot realize its full implications at this stage, and that one will not be able to do so until the safeguards have been finalized and announced by the International Atomic Energy Commission. Incidentally, I may point out that South Africa is not the only country which has problems and misgivings in this connection. As regards these safeguards, which, <i>inter alia,</i> entail inspection, it is not quite clear to South Africa how they may affect our gold-mining industry and how they will affect the processing of ore. Nor is it clear how they will affect our programme for the development of nuclear power for domestic use for peaceful purposes. You will agree with me. Sir, that these are important matters to South Africa. South Africa&#x2019;s representatives at U.N., in taking part in the general debate last week, said that South Africa strongly supported the objects of non-proliferation and would continue to do so whether a treaty was concluded or not.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s attitude in regard to this draft treaty will be decided after a thorough study of the final terms of the treaty has been made and in the light of the safeguards decided upon in due course. We sincerely hope that these will enable us to sign the treaty eventually. But before Ambassador Botha spoke at U.N., we had already been studying the draft treaty in connection with non-proliferation for quite some time, and there are many things in this treaty which are not clear to us. We also held talks on it, both in South Africa and elsewhere. Talks were held with, amongst others, the U.S.A., which is one of the states which took the initiative in this matter. We held these talks in an attempt to obtain their interpretation of the treaty in its draft form. Now, I must say that this is of course a highly technical matter, and accordingly South Africa suggested, shortly before Ambassador Botha spoke in New York, that the U.S.A, sent experts to South Africa to hold talks in the Republic with our experts. The reply we received to this from the U.S.A, was a favourable one. They responded by sending out a team of scientists shortly afterwards, and this team has held talks with our own experts this week. I may say that the talks that have been held were very useful and will help us a great deal in arriving at our evaluation of the draft treaty. I may point out in passing that the contract is not something about which the Government need decide at this stage. These talks, as I have explained, were held at South Africa&#x2019;s initiative and must be seen as an attempt to obtain a better interpretation of the draft treaty. They must not be regarded as an attempt to exert pressure on South Africa. In fact, the question of the resolution before U.N. was not discussed with these experts at all, and as far as the resolution is concerned, the Government will take a decision on it within the next few days.</p>

<p>I hope that from what I have said it will be clear that non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is a matter of serious import to South Africa and to the Government, and that we are not standing aloof and adopting an indifferent attitude in the matter, but are studying and investigating it very thoroughly.</p>

<p>To my mind the hon. Minister who has just spoken, has been more than extremely courteous as regards the speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.

That was not done by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Only people who have been brought up well, can display good manners, and as far as this matter is concerned, I want to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to take a leaf from the book of the Leader of his party. It shows good breeding; it shows where one oomes from. [Interjections.] Do you have an interjection to make?

<p>I was discussing it. Now I want to discuss mini-apartheid in regard to our foreign policy and the mini-apartheid of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout accused us. I should like to know what he means by &#x201C;mini-apartheid&#x201D;. I only know about mini-skirts. But what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout meant, was the separate entrances and exits for the various races, and the hon. member for Prinshof gave us a very good explanation here of what mini-apartheid means, the point of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout failed to see, nor is he capable of doing so. But the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;and this is foreign policy, because when he was abroad, and he said so here under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, he felt that he could not defend the mini-apartheid of our country.</p>

<p>Sir, if a person from this country goes abroad and does not advocate the policy of this country, is he or is he not a traitor? I merely ask this; I do not say it. [Interjection.] Now I want to leave the hon. member for Bezuidenhout for a moment and I want to address the hon. member for Yeoville. I think he is making too many interjections. Our foreign policy is in the very good hands of a Minister who knows what he wants to do and where he wants to go and all this yapping on the part of the Opposition will never put him off his stroke, but all these speeches made by hon. members opposite in regard to foreign affairs are, as the Prime Minister said, simply and solely designed &#x201C;to shine in the papers&#x201D;. And not only that, but they also damage our country. I want to warn them to-night that one can only be a patriot of this country if <span class="col_6277-6278" refersTo="page_0343"/>one endorses the policy of the people of this country; otherwise one cannot he a patriot.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not going to endeavour to reply to what was said by the hon. member for Jeppes who has just sat down. Apart from making a poisonous attack on the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, whom I think is quite capable of looking after himself, he did not say one word about foreign affairs. I will, therefore, ignore him. I am only thinking that it was a tragic day when that hon. member was elected to represent the Jeppes constituency.</p>

<p>We want to thank the hon. the Minister for the statement he made and for the wording in which he put it in regard to nuclear proliferation. I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister will make his speech available to us. If not in pamphlet form it will certainly be in the Press. We will then be able to deal with it in the morning when we proceed with this Vote. The hon. the Minister has made it clear that South Africa has time to decide on the issue and that it will depend on the wording and the terms of the agreement itself. Under those circumstances I am not in a position to deal with it any further at this stage.</p>

<p>In dealing with the Vote, there are a couple of questions I want to put to the hon. the Minister. I am referring to the contradictions, irregularities or it may even be misprints which appear in the Vote. I would like to begin with the heading &#x201C;Greece; Athens&#x201D; and point out that there is an increase of R 17,000 on the Budget for this year with the same personnel in exactly the same categories as there were last year. I want to follow on and say that in Italy, also with the same personnel and the same categories, there is a reduction of R2.000. In the case of Italy; Milan, there is an increase of R 10,000. Again the same personnel was used and the currency and rate of exchange was identical. I will be glad if the hon. the Minister will reply to these aspects. Last but not least, we find that in the United Kingdom under the heading &#x201C;Other Staff&#x201D; the figure for 1967-&#x2019;68 is 252 and for 1968-&#x2019;69 179. Presumably this is a misprint, because last year these figures were 11 and 11 under the same heading.</p>

<p>As far as our trade and allocation in regard to our representation in the United Kingdom are concerned I want to say that the last census of statistics of foreign trade figures that I can get shows that a third of our export and import trade is still done with Great Britain. Thinking in terms of the disturbed world that we are living in at the moment with near social revolution, if not approaching industrial revolution in certain of our European countries, I want to suggest for the consideration of the Department of External Affairs that it is a golden rule and proverb to preserve your good friends of many years standing and also the trade and good association with them, regardless of what the government of the day might be able to do or indicate that they might like to do. The fact remains that as far as Great Britain is concerned if one translates the figures &#x2026;</p>

<p>I will then leave commerce and say that as far as our personnel for foreign offices is concerned, it is important that we should strengthen our representation in the United Kingdom. For years I have been pressing for the opening of more offices in more countries, particularly in those countries where representation could serve the purpose of South Africa well. Over the last year we have extended our representation to Finland, Hong Kong, Uruguay and Malawi. Having set our hand to the plough as far as dealing with Malawi is concerned, Mr. Chairman, may I put a question to the Minister, if he is in a position to reply to them at this stage?</p>

<p>The hon. member may put questions on diplomatic representation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with diplomatic representation. I mentioned Malawi and the diplomatic representation which we now have established with Malawi. Then I would like to put this question pointedly to the Minister. As I said, having set our hands to the plough, has the time arrived, and is he in a position to reply to the question, that we should further our cause in international good relationships by now also establishing diplomatic representation with Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland and maybe even Zambia? Having dealt with those four countries, that have now received their independence, it is very important that we should endeavour to establish representation with these countries by virtue of the fact that we have undoubtedly gained a <span class="col_6279-6280" refersTo="page_0344"/>lot of international goodwill by establishing diplomatic representations with Malawi. I think it is very important that we should carry on at this stage, if the Department sees its way clear and is able to do so. Even if we do it gradually and one at a time, it will indicate that the direction in which we have set out is now progressing to the extent that our near neighbours, who have obtained their independence, would be brought into line with Malawi.</p>

<p>Then I would like to follow on what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was referring to, namely the Republic of Malagasy and its importance in the Indian Ocean. I would like to go beyond that point by putting the following to the Minister. I noticed that in this morning&#x2019;s editorial in <i>Die Burger</i> the same question was put, or the editor stated the same view. I think, with the enormous representation of Jewry in this country and the essentiality of endeavouring to establish good relations and diplomatic representation with the State of Israel, the time has arrived when we should endeavour to establish relations with them also, taking into consideration their important position in the Middle East and our important position as guardians of the shipping lanes of the world around the southern tip of Africa. If the Minister is in a position to reply to this particular suggestion, we would very much appreciate it. I might mention the fact that to an outsider it would appear as queer that we have an office in Lebanon. I pleaded for this office over a period of two or three years. We now have diplomatic representation in Lebanon, but we have not been able to establish diplomatic representation with the State of Israel. I consider it as extremely important, by virtue of the fact that Jewry is represented in such large numbers in this country, and the fact that Israel at this stage is so important as a guardian of Western civilization in the Middle East, that every endeavour should be made to establish diplomatic representations with Israel as well. I would be pleased if the Minister could see his way clear to reply to these points.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow up what the hon. member for East London (City) said, but I should like to refer to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, and the statements he made. He said: &#x201C;It is important to know what the long-term approach with regard to South West Africa is.&#x201D; I think the hon. member is well aware of what the long-term policy of the Government in regard to South West Africa is. The policy was laid down as far back as 1948 by Dr. Malan, and it was clearly stated to the hon. member in person. In 1948 the hon. member was secretary to the United Party during the negotiations which were held with the then Prime Minister in connection with constitutional changes. In those negotiations they agreed on certain conditions. The National Party subsequently complied with those conditions. The hon. member afterwards joined the National Party. According to the record it is clear that he attacked the United Party in this House because they had not complied with those conditions. One of the conditions laid down by the then Prime Minister Dr. Malan, was that he was not going to throw South West Africa to the wolves. It is a policy which has been clearly stated by successive Prime Ministers. I do not think any change has been made in that regard. That hon. member left South West Africa owing to circumstances which he was unable to endure there, and then sought refuge here in the Republic. I am certain that if the hon. member was still in South West Africa to-day, he would have joined with us in saying that the Whites should remain there. But to-day he is the champion of a policy which will place U.N. in command of South West Africa, an event which will of course sound the death knell for the Whites of South West Africa. It is his party who, together with Mr. Carpio, said &#x201C;You exert pressure from the outside and we shall exert pressure from the inside&#x201D;. That is the tragedy of the United Party of South West Africa to-day.</p>

<p>But I want to leave it at that. I want to express my appreciation for the standpoint which the hon. the Minister adopted towards the nuclear power experts who visited our country, and towards the discussions which are being held there. I want to express my appreciation for the standpoint which the Government has adopted for the protection of the interests of our gold mining industry. This proves once again the prestige and status which our mineral wealth affords South Africa and of the significant role which uranium affords South Africa in the international sphere.</p>

<p>Actually I want to talk about the importance of communication routes linking our neighbouring states, particularly with South West Africa, as an integral part of the Republic. I call South West Africa &#x201C;an integral part of the Republic&#x201D;, because this is in accordance with the conditions of the mandate. I want to point out the importance of communication routes between ourselves and Botswana, ourselves and Angola, Mozambique and Zambia, as a means of promoting our foreign policy. I am thinking in particular here of routes of communication between Gobabis and the Gaberones, where it is possible for these to link up with the traffic routes through Rhodesia to South Africa. It is not necessarry for me to elaborate on the advantages which such a route would entail for South West Africa and Gobabis, but it can result in tremendous benefit to our cattle farming industry there because it would consequently represent a shorter route to the meat market in the heart of South Africa, i.e. the Johannesburg-Pretoria complex. In addition there are the advantages of development which such a route would entail for Botswana itself. But apart from that, this will offer a shorter route to a harbour on the West Coast for the Republic. Common benefits for all countries are therefore involved in this matter. Of course <span class="col_6281-6282" refersTo="page_0345"/>it requires close co-operation between all concerned.</p>

<p>Another route I want to mention is a route linking Grootfontein with Livingstone in Zambia where this will link up with the route to Rhodesia. There are overwhelming reasons in favour of such a project. I am aware of the fact that the Minister of Transport may react by saying: &#x201C;Guarantee the capital and the operational costs, and the railway lines and roads will be constructed&#x201D;. But must we always think in materialistic terms? Is it not time we realized that a bridge over the Okavango, or a bridge over the Quando, or over the Zambesi is in reality a bridge to better relations with our neighbouring states, whether they are White or non-White? In the Seventies of the previous century a Dorstlandtrekker paved his own way across the Okavongo into the unknown, across the Zambesi, via the Congo to Angola. We in South Africa are accustomed to undertaking pioneering work, on the Continent of Africa as well as on behalf of the entire world. Should we not in this case as well make the present boundaries of separation from our northern states, the boundaries which which divide us from our northern neighbouring states, points of contact in a pioneering spirit, in a spirit of renewal? Should we not regard a road or a railway line as an act of goodwill to strengthen in that way the spiritual viability of the Republic in regard to the world? By way of motivation for this I want to point out that in spite of all the propaganda against South Africa, hostile countries, amongst which I include communistic countries, are still purchasing a great deal from South Africa. This gives the lie to the propaganda against South Africa. But one of South Africa&#x2019;s most effective weapons against the campaign against it is that it is the economic power source for the needs of Africa, and beneath the surface of world politics this weapon is a very valuable one. It is for that reason that we should give added impetus to the development of this power source by combating Communism to the north of our boundaries on a peaceful and economic basis, and to circumvent it by means of this economic power source via the proposed routes of communication. As an example of what economic strength can achieve on a peaceful basis, I have only to refer to the large amounts which are still ploughed into South West Africa in accordance with the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission. On the surface we do not always realize what benefits that will entail for us. However, I want to state that the implementaion of the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission is the most important bulwark against communistic influences. It serves to prevent bloody conflicts &#x2026; (Time expired.)</p>

I say that whatever the causes may be for the existing confusion in the world to-day, and whatever the causes may be for our running into difficulties at present, these things do not have any bearing on the fact that it is essential that we as South Africans should view this matter soberly, and that as genuine South Africans all of us should forge ahead in the same harness.

<p>That word renegade (hanskakie), has caused this counrty a great deal of damage. When we were in the army the words &#x201C;renegade&#x201D; and &#x201C;red louse&#x201D; caused South Africa much more damage than the colour question is causing to-day. I hope hon. members opposite will realize that they are Afrikaners and not party-political agents. Just as England has perhaps gained experience in the world diplomacy, we in South Africa have over the past 300 years been living with the problems of the world virtually in micro-cosmic form. Providence has placed us here, exactly half-way between East and West. After previous attempts at civilizing Africa had failed. Providence afforded us the opportunity to make a second attempt at civilizing Africa in the way in which we believe. By trial and error we have made more progress than those who tried before us. We were thrown together here Whites and non-Whites&#x2014;the Whites composed of two different language groups&#x2014;the Coloureds, the Asiatics and the Bantu. As I said, for 300 years we have been living with the world&#x2019;s problems in micro-cosmic form. I believe that we have learnt something during that period of time. In the past other states used black men as a commodity and they were exported to other parts of the world, even to America. Some people believed in the total annihilation of the black man. Other people again adopted the opposite course, people such as Van der Kemp and Philips, persons who believed in fraternization and total integration. To-day we can afford to laugh at those experiments. Over the years we as a nation have come to realize that the best <span class="col_6283-6284" refersTo="page_0346"/>policy for all our races is one of separate development.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall say &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; along with you. I am referring to a certain separate development which is the traditional apartheid of South Africa. Let me make this very clear. [Interjection.] Would the hon. member kindly realize that I am making a serious speech; this is a serious topic, and, surely, this is no time for flippancy and caterwauling. We may differ as regards separate freedoms, but we most certainly do not differ on separate development. That is why I say that when the hon. the Minister addresses the outside world, he is entitled to saying that all responsible political parties in South Africa are grateful for and appreciative of his attempts and those of the hon. the Prime Minister at giving South Africa an outward-going policy which, it is hoped, will bear good fruit in the future. Over the past 300 years we have been gaining experience, such as no other country has done, of the world problem which is so acute to-day, namely the problem of various races having to live together in one country. We have been living with this problem for hundreds of years. We may have made mistakes, and we probably did make mistakes, and we shall probably make more mistakes in the future. But nobody can have any doubt about the sincerity of the attemps made by all South Africans at solving those problems. We are running into major difficulties to-day. Sometimes this is the case because our position is not being understood, but all too often it is the case because wilful people are trying to extract poison from the same flower from which the bee extracts its honey. Perhaps our major problem as regards the near future is that of South West Africa. A moment ago the hon. member opposite said that we in the United Party wanted to surrender South West Africa. He says we in the United Party told Carpio, &#x201C;Exert pressure from outside and we shall exert pressure from within.&#x201D; That is not true.</p>

<p>The United Party of South Africa did not say that. The United Party of South Africa were the people who took South West Africa when a rebellion broke out there. We took it for South Africa by force of arms. Whenever we felt that South Africa&#x2019;s interests had to be served, we never hesitated to take action. Let it not be said by anybody that as far as South West Africa is concerned, the past of the old S.A. Party and the United Party was one of betrayal, because that is not true.</p>

<p>I am speaking about this Parliament, about the South Africans that are being represented in this House. They will in any case be the people who would have to bear the brunt more than anybody else if things go wrong there. When we read the newspapers, we see what is happening at the U.N. Irresponsible people make all sorts of demands on us in regard to South West Africa. Now I wonder whether the time has not come for us to let those people have their way. They find it so easy to talk about a right of self-determination. Has the time not arrived for us to ask this world body whether they really want the right of self-determination for South West Africa? Has the time not arrived for us to hold a referendum to ascertain whether the inhabitants of South West Africa want to be incorporated with the Republic or whether they want to stay as they are? I do not think the world is serious when it comes to this matter. I do not think that certain black states would like to see such a referendum. We who are familiar with the facts of South West Africa know that the lot of the black man in that territory is much better than that of the black man in many of the so-called independent Black African states. One only wonders what would happen if the citizens of South West Africa&#x2014; White, Black, and Brown, should prefer to be incorporated with us. Would the U.N. then want us to give effect to the wishes of the inhabitants of that territory?</p>

<p>Is the hon. member aware that there was in fact such a referrendum in General Smuts&#x2019;s time, that 33,520 people vated against it, and that the U.N. did not want to accept that result.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am aware of that referendum. I also know that to a large extent its result was in favour of incorporation with South Africa. I also know that the objection was that the referendum had been held in such a way that it did not really represent the will of the population. I think those objections can be overcome. I think if all the races in South West Africa were to participate in an honest and genuine referendum, if they were asked, &#x201C;Do you want to remain as you are, do you want to go to the U.N., or would you rather be incorporated with the Republic of South Africa?&#x201D;, their reaction would be, &#x201C;Rather the devil we know than the devil we do not know.&#x201D; I think the same U.N. which has such a great deal to say to-day about the right of self-determination for those people, would be first to say, as they also did at that time, that it should not be permitted. I really wonder what the world actually wants. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout have common surnames, but the two Bassons do not speak with one tongue. In the old days I was told that two heads are better than one, even if the one is <span class="col_6285-6286" refersTo="page_0347"/>that of a sheep, but to-day I am confused because these two Bassons had a lot of strange things to say. The one became absolutely aggressive on a very low level to-night against our foreign affairs which ought to be discussed on a high level, and the one who did so was none other than the front bencher Basson. The back bencher acted differently.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, the middle bencher Basson&#x2014;I am a back bencher&#x2014;tried to give out that his party supported our policy of separate development. But that is untrue. Nothing like that exists. If we were to look at old Hansard reports we would see how the same hon. member for Sea Point has opposed and agitated against separate development in a way which has never been equalled. The United Party has been one of the biggest saboteurs of the policy of separate development there has ever been.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Separate development is not under discussion now; we are dealing with foreign affairs at the moment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. P. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to state very explicitly that our foreign policy is based on this national economy which is being safeguarded by the policy of separate development. Let us understand very clearly to-night that this nation and this country has, during the past twenty years, taken its place on the international financial level alongside the biggest nations in the world. By this means it was possible for us to enjoy international recognition. Let us have no illusions about this; let us accept it as a recognized fact that a country cannot influence other states if its national affairs are not in order. In South Africa we are dealing with a national economy and a currency which can be compared to that of any country in the world.</p>

<p>I believe that our trade with the African States will lead to the development of greater ties of friendship between the Republic and the African States. Many foreign powers built up empires here in Africa in order to exploit Africa. However, that has never been the aim or the ideal of this Government. If it were our policy to derive financial and materialistic benefits from other parts of Africa, we would fail. We are striving to realize an ideal, and that is to grant all peoples a place in the sun.</p>

<p>If one looks at Africa to-day then one is amazed that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout could have acted in the way he did tonight. With the abolition of the various empires in Africa, we are now dealing with independent countries which were not ripe for independence. We are dealing with a growing communistic danger, as well as with the danger of terrorism. These dangers are very close to the threshhold of the Republic of South Africa. It is without doubt the duty of every citizen of this country to make the defensibility of this country felt abroad. Where it affects us directly, I want to make use of the opportunity to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department on the large-scale breakthrough which has already been made to the African States. The trend is one where communism is no longer as popular amongst the leaders of African States as it was several years ago. In other words, there has been a change in direction on the part of the African states.</p>

<p>Throughout the world to-day we are faced with the germ of anarchy which is directly influencing the students. We find that the students in Europe and on the Continent are taking anarchic and liberalistic steps. Let me state at once that I have every confidence in the students of South Africa. I now want to ask courteously whether it is not possible for our students, under strict control of the Government, to move outwards in a co-ordinated way in order to fulfil a task in the interests of the Republic of South Africa. I am convinced that the spiritual viability of South Africa is strong enough. I believe that with the correct guidance from the Government our students, because of their background and because we have been through the process of evolution and the suppression of a revolution, will be able to make a major contribution to African states. The basic difference between us and many other countries is the following: We have never tried to sell our policy or to have our policy accepted by any other African states. All that we are asking is that we in South Africa should be able to move in an outward direction, with this condition that there will be no interference in the policy of separate development.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing my disappointment at the attitude expressed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in his speech here to-night. Last year, during the discussion of this Vote, his attitude was on a much higher level than it was to-night. I cannot understand how he can advocate a &#x201C;change of Government&#x201D; as the only solution to foreign problems as far as the Republic is concerned.</p>

<p>Democracy exists in the right to survive. If that Party had been in power for the past twenty years we would have had no foreign affairs. If we scrutinize their policy we see that South Africa would have had no say in the international sphere. South Africa would have been sold down the river, there would have been a conglomerate mixture of colours here. The hon. member for Houghton need not sit here so piously to-night. If that had happened she would have left a long time ago. They are inciters; we know them, and that is our problem. The future and salvation of South Africa lie in an honest and upright policy, the policy which we have <span class="col_6287-6288" refersTo="page_0348"/>always propagated, namely to be able to move in an outward direction.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am astonished when we discuss foreign affairs to hear Government members say that any criticism which strikes at the heart of the problem in connection with foreign affairs is directed against the welfare of South Africa. I should like to remind Government members that this country had a long and honourable record when General Smuts and men like him were in command. Now hon. members opposite say that, while we are in our present sony state to-day, we must all defend what is going on, that we must not utter a word of criticism, and they say we are not patriots if we do not keep quiet. I think the time has come for us to have some plain speaking. I say quite frankly that we are in this position and the hon. the Minister is facing a most difficult task because of the policies of the Government. The policies of the Government have brought us to this sorry state. That is why we are being asked to defend the policy of the Government and to accept it as the policy of the country and as an ideal. There are many of us who disagree with it, and we disagree violently. There is only one way to change it, and that is to change the Government. Then we will have a new era, a new spirit. There is quite a backlog to be made up because we are in an unholy mess. Indeed, we have not got a friend in the world. We are struggling right, left and centre to get people who are well-disposed towards us to side with us. We are pleading that we have a case. When anybody gets up and says his piece he is accused of not being a patriot and of being un-South African. I think it is time that all came to an end. When one hears the hon. member who just resumed his seat say that if the United Party was in power we would have been a &#x201C;bonte nasie&#x201D;, he is speaking absolute nonsense. I sympathize with the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, because I think that he has a difficult task to defend. He must lay awake at night and worry himself sick about some of the statements made by hon. members on the Government side when they get onto the platteland. It is all very well to plead that everybody must try to understand, but we are dealing with people. I want to tell him of the sort of thing which gives us the bad name we have. We see in this morning&#x2019;s paper that the emigration of Coloureds to Canada has come to an end. Some of us have known for some time that the Canadian Government was attempting to introduce a team of two officials, coming from Beirut in the Lebanon, to screen prospective immigrants to see whether they qualify. The backlog of persons wanting to go from this country to Canada were in the main Coloured people. When we consider the attitude in this country towards the Coloured people one wonders why they do not let them go. They all get good jobs, hold up their heads and are regarded as people. It is now 1968 &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that the questions put by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout should get a plain straightforward reply, particularly in regard to the black diplomats and other black personnel who will be coming to South Africa from time to time. People, and especially coloured people, want to know what the situation is going to be. I think that the hon. the Minister owes it to this country and everybody in it to enunciate clearly and definitely exactly what the policy of the Government is and is going to be. At the present moment we only have a few, but this number is going to multiply. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also suggested that we should skip some of our immediate neighbours and go further afield. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what steps, if any, are being taken to sell the idea which he feels is the idea he wants to sell in these black countries. I have raised this matter before. I see some additional amounts being voted in the Estimates this year for far off places. What is being done in regard to the black states to the north of us? How do we go about attempting to make friends? When we ask that they should come here and see for themselves, we want to know what the conditions and circumstances are under which they will come and be treated when they get here. These are the points which are exercising the minds of people outside and this is the place to ventilate them. I would like to say that everybody in this country is just as concerned as the Government about the bad reputation that we enjoy in the outside world. I was very disappointed this evening when I heard the hon. the Minister say in his opening remarks that the debate was on a very low level. This is not so.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. P. S. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to-day to plead for a little more realism in world politics. I think no one will deny that the world finds itself in difficult crises all over the globe to-day. Just think of Vietnam; think of the crisis in the Middle East; and think of the general nutritional problems of the world. It is calculated that within the next two or three decades we shall have world starvation because we shall not be able to provide the population of the world with food. If one considers the armament problems as well, one arrives at the conclusion that there are great problems in store for the world, problems which indeed require a little more realism to-day. Mr. Chairman, in recent times we have also had various demonstrations in various parts of the world, demonstrations which sometimes started at universities, such as in Berlin and everywhere in Germany, in France and in Britain, and even in Eastern countries. One does not know whether these demonstrations, which are usually led by young people, are merely student pranks which are creating &#x201C;crises&#x201D; in the normal course of events and bringing student leaders to the fore and which can to a certain extent serve a good purpose in that sense. Neither does one know whether these demonstrations amongst the youth of the world are aimed at obtaining a greater share in the social and political order for themselves. Neither does one know whether they are leading to normal evolution, to new freedoms and a rebellion against the existing order of conservatism on the world front. But there are three things we do know.</p>

<p>In the first place we do know that all these disturbances promote a certain measure of chaos and that this can test good order to the utmost. Secondly, we also know that this confusion and the existing disturbances can only promote Communism, and that it is not only Danny the Red&#x2019;s hair that is red, but that It goes deeper and that there are essential differences which must put the Western world on its guard. Thirdly, we know that these disturbances which have broken out especially in France to-day, may occur in Rome or in London or in Washington or in any place in the world to-morrow. They are not limited to one particular place. Therefore I plead that greater responsibility should be displayed by the Western world and that we should resort to wiser statemanship and that the West must try to consolidate itself in this confusion. I think the Western world must begin to make a revaluation as to who are its real friends and must not simply accept that those who pat it on the back are good friends, but must bear in mind that it might be someone who is just looking for a soft spot to put a dagger in later. Therefore I say that it is in the interest of the Western world to-day to consider these things and to make a revaluation. It is time that the Western world asked itself whether its actions everywhere in the world, at the U.N. or elsewhere are really promoting the true Western ideology and the freedom it must serve. I want to address my speech to the great powers of the world such as France, Britain, Italy, Greece, America, etc., and I want to plead especially for better relations between South Africa and the United States of America, and for a better attitude. We cannot get away from the fact that past occurrences&#x2014;one calls to mind the <i>Independence</i> incident and that of the <i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>&#x2014;have caused trouble between the two countries, and it causes concern that it is between two Western countries that these unnecessary incidents have led to estrangement. It is true that in the U.S.A. there are certain elements which would seek South Africa&#x2019;s downfall. This cannot be disputed. It is also true that there are those in South Africa who take delight in the fact that America has great responsibilities in Vietnam and elsewhere to-day, because they accept that America is a great danger to us at present. But I want to ask the question whether these differences existing between us and other powers, and especially between us and the U.S.A., are not merely normal differences which occurr in world politics in any case from time to time.</p>

<p>I think that we should really have perspective in these difficult times in which we are living to-day, that we must take our perspective towards the U.S.A. into review and that we must acknowledge in the first place that America is to-day one of the greatest obstacles in the way of communist world domination. In the second place, we must acknowledge that in the U.S.A., both amongst the population and in the Government, there is an enormous amount of goodwill towards South Africa. Thirdly, we must acknowledge that there are striking similarities which one can emphasize in the relations between these two countries. I want to mention a few of them. I want to mention the fact that both South Africa and America are nations which are in the modern sense of the word relatively young to-day. If one considers the history of the <i>Mayflower</i> and the <i>Dromedaris,</i> one sees that there is not much difference. Both countries have their racial problems and, indeed, each of them believes that it is capable of solving its own problems <span class="col_6291-6292" refersTo="page_0350"/>in its own manner and in the best way. Both have fought shoulder to shoulder in two world wars and in Korea as well. Both are strongholds against Communism. Both maintain judicial administration of a high order, freedom of speech, etc. Both abhor the policy of interference. Both have enormous economic strength. South Africa has 70 per cent of the gold in the free world. Both can be regarded as nuclear powers to-day. Therefore I say that if we emphasize these similarities between these two countries, it might lead to better relations between them.</p>

<p>I believe that now is the time to do so. I want to mention the following points in particular: In respect of missile research, in respect of our strategic position, as a result of the Suez crisis, and in respect of the U.N., where there is at present a new representative in the person of Mr. George Ball, and especially in the light of the presidential election, I believe that a period may now arrive in which (better relations can exist between these two countries. And I am addressing myself to America especially. But I want to emphasize that better relations can be established in one way only, and that is that we must accept that the racial problem in America can be solved by the population of America only, and that they must accept that the racial problem of South Africa, as we have it to-day, will not be resolved in the councils of the U.N. or at international conferences, but by the population of South Africa and by no one else; also that the South West problem, as it is before the U.N. to-day, will not be resolved at the U.N. or elsewhere. It will be solved by the population of South West Africa. If we accept this, I think that the opportunity exists for these two powers, which must play such an important part in Western politics in the future, to find a great deal of common ground, and that they can develop this to the benefit of the Western world.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is gratifying to find the hon. member for Middelland adopting a somewaht different attitude in regard to our relations with America. I think that this approach may in fact bear fruit in the future. I am really rising to say a few words in connection with the development which has taken place abroad since we met here last night. It is a development which can place the Government before very difficult decisions, and potentially it has many dangerous complications for South Africa. I am referring to the unanimous resolution of the Security Council in connection with mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia. We have not yet seen the full text of the resolution. At this stage we therefore want to do no more than inquire whether the hon. the Minister is already in a position to inform the country about the standpoint of his Government. I should like to add&#x2014;and I am doing it on behalf of the Opposition&#x2014;that, as hon. members know, we have always adopted the attitude in the House that there are certain matters of an external nature which are of such serious import to South Africa that the Government and the Opposition should try to reach the closest possible agreement on them. It is common knowledge that this has always been our attitude, as for example in connection with South West Africa. The fact that the Government took a different view of the position is of course its responsibility. We have always felt that the initiative for an informal dialogue in such matters should naturally come from the side of the Government. It cannot come from the side of the Opposition. If the Government does not want to consult the Opposition in what we regard as an extremely important matter, it is naturally its rightful responsibility. Then the Opposition is free to act independently. We feel that here, as in the case of South West Africa&#x2014;I am again referring to the mandatory sanctions, as decided upon by the Security Council&#x2014;we are also faced with a matter which may have such drastic consequences for South Africa that it may eventually affect our entire relationship with UNO. It is a matter which eventually may even affect our membership of UNO. Because we regard it as a matter which is potentially so fraught with danger, we want to say that it is also a matter in regard to which we are prepared, if the Government so desires, to conduct informal discussions with it with a view to trying to find a common approach to the problem.</p>

<p>I just want to refer briefly to last night&#x2019;s debate. I want to say personally to the hon. the Minister that we on this side have a particularly high regard for him. We regard him as the best man the Government has available to fill the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. But we feel that the hon. the Minister is a little weak when he should take action against persons on his own side who say and do things which are detrimental to South Africa and his own case. I say that I find it a pity that we sometimes gain the impression that the hon. the Minister is a little afraid that he will be regarded as someone who is not a good party man and that for that reason he does not take action. Therefore I want to say in all seriousness to the Minister&#x2014;and when I have finished saying it, then, as far as I am concerned, the matter is closed &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; but if the Government wants to resume the matter, then I shall do so too. However, I am prepared to regard the matter as closed then. If the sort of thing which took place here last night in this House continues under a Vote which is the responsibility of this Minister, then I want to say that we shall implicate the Minister&#x2019;s position in the matter and we shall find means of registering our protest even more strongly.</p>

<p>We have documents before us in which the Government, the Minister and his Department did their best to cause UNO to change its views. We know that UNO is constantly attacking South Africa and saying that people in this country are not allowed to criticize and to attack the Government&#x2019;s policy. In <span class="col_6293-6294" refersTo="page_0351"/>their resolutions they constantly refer to the &#x201C;victims of apartheid&#x201D;. Now the hon. the Minister himself is issuing publications and writing replies to UNO to prove that that is not the case and to prove that people in this country are free to criticize the Government and apartheid. But what must happen now if the Hansard of last night should get to UNO and be placed alongside the &#x201C;Rule of Law&#x201D; and the publications issued by his Department? Last night we had the position that a man was denounced as a traitor for criticizing the Government.</p>

We may have been astonished this afternoon to see that the two hon. members were still members of the same party, but upon reflection one finds that that is the United Party as we know it.

<p>It was with a fair amount of malicious joy that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred last night to the diplomatic suburb which is to be established in my constituency. I want to extend to the hon. the Minister my hearty congratulations on this brilliant solution he has found for the thorny problem of housing for diplomats as such, which is a world problem. It is precisely the problem of housing that has been solved, and there are no strings attached as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout wanted to have it.</p>

<p><span class="col_6297-6298" refersTo="page_0353"/>The fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is opposed to it, bears testimony to the fact that this decision was taken by a sober-minded and sensible person in possession of all his faculties. He tried to drag me into his argument by referring to a meeting which I had allegedly attended and where a certain motion was introduced. In this ease a newspaper furnished him with incorrect information, for which he fell. The tenor of his speech was that he did not want to be associated with this Government&#x2019;s attempts at correcting South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad&#x2014;distorted through ithe actions of his party as well. All he really revealed about himself last night, is that he is an embittered man. He is embittered about the success and the breakthroughs the National Party has achieved under the leadership of this Government. He is particularly embittered because to this day not one of his prophecies of doom have come true. He spoke of tourists who visited South Africa and were then astonished at finding in South Africa an image different from the one they thought they would find. That is so because they came to South Africa with a U.P. created impression. Then they leave. South Africa with a N.P. made fact. Last night he tried to dictate to and tell this Government how to act in Africa. This Government started to move outwards of its own accord and without his dictates. That party has never moved outwards, but only inwards, into England.</p>

<p>I do not wish to devote any more of my time to the U.P. We in South Africa are irrevocably bound up with Africa. We who speak Afrikaans and call ourselves Afrikaners, prove this by the fact that we are the only people who have a language rooted in Africa as regards its name, and who as a nation are bound up with Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks me who the Africans are. The Africans are Africans, just as the Europeans are Europeans. Just as we are bound with Africa, so we also have age-old ties with Europe. Since we are on the point of moving into Africa and. forging ever closer and more and more ties with Africa&#x2014;a line of action which I support fully &#x2014;I want to express my conviction that I believe that we should at all times retain our Western ties and should, in particular, strengthen and extend our ties with Europe.

<p>Yes, if they want to be that. If you want to remain an Englishman, you can do so. I believe that one of the ways in which we can prove that we are in earnest about the retention of European ties, is by learning other European languages. I believe that our Department of Education, industrialists, businessmen and others should tackle this matter in earnest. One stands amazed at seeing what doors are opened to one if one has a command of a European language. Spanish, for instance, is a European language which, apart from being spoken in Spain, is also being spoken in 20 Latin-American countries; to put if differently, it is the official language of the whole of Central and South America, including Brazil. In addition Spanish is also being spoken in the East and in Africa. In fact, it is being spoken by 200 million people. As for French, it is a language which is being spoken by 150 million. people all over the world. These 150 million people are scattered over 31 countries of which 24 have French as their official language and the other seven are conducting their higher education through the medium of French. French is the official language of 18 countries in Africa alone. It is in addition the Administrative and cultural language of Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Cambodia and Laos. In the same way I can elaborate on German, Italian, Portuguese and other European languages. I just want to say that it is my conviction that by having a command of European languages we could gain friends for ourselves and for our country and open doors which have up to now remained closed to us in Africa and in the outside world.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Waterkloof stated in his speech that the word &#x201C;African&#x201D; in relation to Africa meant the same as the word &#x201C;European&#x201D; in relation to Europe. I would like to know from the hon. member whether he would take it amiss if I were to refer to him as the hon. African member for Waterkloof. The hon. member for Waterkloof has stated that his party is responsible for the outward policy in South Africa and that the United Party has always been looking inward. I would like to challenge the hon. member to mention one slightly or largely outward-looking aspect of policy adopted by this Government which has not been suggested by the United Party in the past. We do not agree, of course, with all the outward aspects dealt with by the hon. the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I noticed that according to a S.A.B.C. news report he stated some time ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Minister van Buitelandse Sake het verklaar dat dit die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering se doel is om &#x2019;n einde aan rassedis-kriminasie te maak. Hy het op &#x2019;n nuuskonferensie <span class="col_6299-6300" refersTo="page_0354"/>gese dat die voile uitvoering van die Regering se beleid &#x2019;n toestand sal skep waarin diskriminasie sal verdwyn.</block>

<p>I think that he should explain this to the people in his constituency in Beaufort West. They will be interested to know exactly what he meant by that.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with what the hon. member for Middelland has said. He spoke about improving relations with the United States of America. I cannot agree more, but I want the Government to ask themselves to what extent they are to blame for the worsening of relations between our country and America. I want to mention one example. If the Government were to say that the United States of America was using millions of. dollars through its secret service organization to undermine and indoctrinate South Africans, would that then be making friends with the United States of America? Because that is actually what has been said Iby a Minister of this Government. He accused the C.I.A. of spending millions of dollars in supporting the American Field Service to get our children to go to America for the purpose of indoctrinating them there against &#x201C;hulle vaders hier in Suid-Afrika&#x201D;, to use the words of the present Minister of Health. We want improved relations with the United States of America and I think the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs should get up and tell us whether he agrees that the Secret Service, the C.I.A., of the United States of America is being used, as stated by his colleague, to indoctrinate, through the American Field Service and other organizations, the youth of South Africa. That statement was made by the hon. the Minister of Health at Ermelo last year and it was repeated by him in effect this year in Parliament.</p>

<p>Sir, I actually stood up to deal with a matter which I believe is of a less contentious nature, and that is the question of closer diplomatic relations with Israel. To me it is an anomaly that we have in South Africa a Consulate General of Israel while South Africa has not got diplomatic representation in Tel Aviv. To me it is an anomaly that South Africa has representation in Beirut but not in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. Sir, there are reasons for this. They are based partly on misunderstanding and partly on the failure to appreciate that diplomatic tactics are not always similar and are not always completely comprehensible. My purpose in suggesting a closer rapprochement with Israel is to see whether we cannot remove some of that misunderstanding. I believe that the reasons for this closer diplomatic relationship are important, and in the short time available to me I should like to mention at least eight of them.</p>

<p>First of all, Israel and South Africa are both young and robust nations. They are facing great odds and hostility in. the rest, of the world, whether at the United Nations, or against the communist bloc or against the Nasser League. Secondly, there is a great deal of natural, traditional sympathy between South Africa and Israel. I could go back to World War I. It might have been a General Smuts and noit a General Allanby who liberated Jerusalem in World War I if there had been a few changes in the decisions at the High Command of those days. The name of General Smuts is perpetuated in many localities in Israel to-day. The Nationalist Government was one of the first Governments to recognize Israel as a new state&#x2014;and all honour to them.</p>

<p>Let me mention a third reason, a strategic reason. Israel and we in South Africa occupy important strategic positions in relation to die route between the West and the East. Suez and the Cape are supplementary to eaoh other on that route; South Africa controls the one and Israel the other. Surely there are matters of common concern that we can discuss. Surely there should be more diplomatic representation between the two countries. Fourthly, it is in our interest to have Israel remaining a stabilizing force in the Middle East as a bastion of the West. When the recent war broke out, however neutral and correct our Government&#x2019;s attitude may have been, the hearts of the people of South Africa were not neutral and we were indeed very pleased when we saw the Israeli Army reaching the Canal and establishing peace again in the Middle East. Fifthly, both Israel and South Africa have interests in the countries bordering on the western Indian Ocean, particularly now that the British influence in Aden has been removed. Again these are matters of common concern which we could discuss through greater diplomatic representation.</p>

<p>Sixthly, we have to-day no person to speak officially on South Africa&#x2019;s behalf in Israel itself. We have many personal friends there and we thank our personal friendly ambassadors, South African citizens, in Israel, but that is not enough. We should have the official voice of the Government in Israel itself, and here I also have support from the hon. member for Krugersdorp and the hon. Senator Loock who were in Israel recently and who said almost the same thing there that I am saying now. Sir, the seventh reason is this. There are in Israel at least 5,000 to 6,000 South African citizens. Some of them are coming back; some might intend to stay there, but do not let us look at the very small number, who are not allowed to return to South Africa; they are not representative of the South African citizen in Israel. There are these other people&#x2014;amongst them tourists, intending immigrants and people who are coming back&#x2014;who need a South African consul or a South African representative in Israel. The eighth reason is that the economic ties between Israel and South Africa are increasing; our trade is expanding; we have a regular international airline operating between the two countries; the volume of trade is growing, and <span class="col_6301-6302" refersTo="page_0355"/>all these matters make it necessary to have closer contact with Israel.</p>

<p>Sir, these are the interests between South Africa and Israel which overlap&#x2014;economic, cultural, social, traditional, historical, strategic, religious, and the issue of national independence and self-preservation. I know that negotiations of that nature are delicate and it would be wrong to expect a reply from the Minister of a definite nature, unless of course he wishes to give such a reply at this stage, but I do feel that it might encourage the hon. the Minister to know that we on this side of the House are interested, and sympathetically interested, to see a closer rapprochement with Israel with some form of diplomatic representation. It might be by means of a Consulate or something more than that. If our assurance can in any way strengthen the hon. the Minister in such negotiations which he may have started or intends starting with Israel we gladly give him the assurance of our support on this issue.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove. I believe that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will do so himself. I should like to confine myself to our relations with the black states of Africa. It is an unfortunate fact that, but for the exception of our neighbouring states, there is very little affection for us on the Continent of Africa. In fact, we have grown accustomed to regarding the black states of Africa as our enemies. I do not want to place the blame for this state of affairs on the shoulders of the black states, as I hope to indicate, but I want to emphasize that we may not acquiesce in this state of affairs. That hostility arises from their approach to our domestic policy of separate development, but that hostility is based on a total misconception of our domestic policy. Therefore I want to approach this question from the angle of the realism of our domestic situation, and I think that once the realism of this situation has penetrated to the black states of Africa, we shall have made a great deal of progress towards eliminating these misconceptions in regard to our policy. What is the realism of our domestic situation? It is that South Africa has a multi-national, in contrast to a multi-racial, character. Apart from the White nation, there are in South Africa at least eight Bantu nations which differ in regard to language, culture and traditions, eight Bantu nations each of which wants to retain its own identity and work out its own salvation. In spite of the liberalist view taken by the hon. member for Houghton and in spite of. the integration story of the United Party&#x2019;s &#x2014;i.e. that we are a multi-racial state, that we are one state and one nation&#x2014;the realism of the situation in South Africa remains that the Xhosa want to remain Xhosa and the Zulu want to remain Zulu, that the Tswana want to remain Tswana and that the White nation wants to remain White. Our policy of separate development is based on the realism of multinationality, and it is not a race policy. Our aim is to retain and develop this multinationality, and that is why we grant each nation its own right of self-determination. This realism of the multi-nationality of South Africa is also the realism found on the Continent of Africa. The unrest and the wars we have on the Continent of Africa at present, are the after-effects of the fact that the former colonial powers did not have due regard to this multi-nationality. Within arbitrary borders they tried to build one state out of different nations. Our endeavour to develop each nation in South Africa in its own state, and our policy to grant the right of self-determination to each nation, is in fact the endeavour of the black nations of Africa as well. That is what they demand for themselves. The awakening nationalism of Africa is in fact our best ally and our best bulwark against the surging communism which threatens the multi-national character of Africa with obliteration. Then the question that remains is how can we make the necessary contact with those nations, for if we have this common premise between us and the black states of Africa, I believe that we with our technological skill and our rich resources can counterbalance communism in Africa.</p>

<p>We are fortunate in that we have very friendly relations with our immediate neighbours and with Malawi. To us and to the nations under our guardianship this contact is of inestimable value for gaining a better understanding of our objectives and aims in Africa. This better understanding cannot be effected without diplomatic relations on an inter-state level. However, there is in our country quite a number of misconceptions about black diplomats, and the whole matter is being obscured by side-issues. In this regard I want to mention and emphasize the following two points in our relations with foreign envoys.</p>

<p>The first is that these diplomats have been accredited in South Africa to the white nation in the White state of South Africa, and not to the non-White nations under our guardianship. I do not expect my guest to play with my children in the nursery if I want to entertain him in my lounge, or to move in with my wards if he is my guest. The second point I want to emphasize is that non-White members of the nonAVhite nations under our guardianship find themselves in our White homeland for the purpose of rendering service there. They do not form part of the White state, but part of the nations under our guardianship. I do not expect my guest to associate with my servant in the servant&#x2019;s room if he is being entertained by me as my guest. On the basis of these two points we have already in the past blamed foreign embassies for trying to enforce integration in our country through their receptions and for not obeying the said two rules or urbanity, but we realize that we do not, have first-class, and <span class="col_6303-6304" refersTo="page_0356"/>second-class diplomats or envoys in South Africa, and we do not want them either.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to have our foreign inter-state relations prejudiced. I believe that through our friendly black states, with whom we have already entered into relations, we may promote other relations. Once black Africa realizes that our aims and objectives are the same as theirs, it would also be possible for us to counterbalance communism in Africa.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. VAN L. FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not have the time. In conclusion I want to ask this, i.e. that consideration should be given to appointing an itinerant envoy in Africa, and that through the goodwill and good co-operation of our friendly black states we should also try to create contacts where we do not have them at the moment. On a visit I paid to our northern neighbouring states last year, it became apparent to me from talks with certain black politicians that there were certain states which regard us as enemies today, but which are becoming concerned about the rise of communism amongst them and would like to liaise with us as Malawi is doing at present, with this basis as the approach, namely that we grant each nation the right of self-determination. This could serve as a common basis, and then I believe that we can find in that a basis enabling us to make new contacts, and this should also be utilized.</p>

<p>I am not going to try to reply to the hon. member for Heilbron, because he is really giving us an expose of racial policy, and I feel that there will be another opportunity to do that. I just want to point out to him that if he really wanted to have friendship with the other states in Africa, there is a much easier way to do it than the way he has suggested, which was to try to explain certain Government policies to them in terms of developing African nationalisms within South Africa, and that is simply to start removing race discrimination. He will then find that the way to friendship is very simple and we will have no trouble in building up good contacts with the other African states. I would say, too, that he could perhaps do a little cross-examination of some of the millions of Africans in the urban areas in South Africa, to find whether what they are yearning for is tribal nationalism or whether what they are yearning for are all the manifold advantages that Western civilization can bring to them, with higher standards of living, etc. I would also like to point out to the hon. member, and while I am at it to the other hon. members who have taken part in this debate last night and this afternoon, that a far greater service is rendered to South Africa if this country presents the image of having people disagreeing with the Government, and not simply people who are bleating praise of the Nationalist Party, which apparently to the hon. members is synonymous with patriotism. By far the greatest asset that South African can produce is indeed a picture of a country with diversification and people who not only object, but are seen to object, to Government policy. The hon. the Minister will know what I am talking about when I say that the assets in this country are not the people who go overseas fulsomely bleating praise of this Government, but those who quite openly criticize it and are able to come back to South Africa and to continue criticizing it. When people go away from South Africa, having visited this country, the one thing that strikes them, and which perhaps gives the lie to any exaggerations about this being a police state, is the fact that there is a free Press in South Africa which is openly critical of this Government, and that there are people in the Opposition who speak out quite openly and maintain their point of view&#x2014;far more, I can tell the hon. member for Jeppes, than people simply accepting that the Nationalist Party Government is synonymous with South Africa. It is no such thing. The Government has been put into power by a very narrow majority vote. [Interjection.] This is a fact. The Government has a great number of seats, but this does not mean in any case, even if the Government had come in by a huge majority instead of a narrow one, that the Government is synonymous with the people of this country, because the ability to replace the Government is surely the hallmark of democracy &#x2026; [Interjection.] I represent a very considerable body of opinion in this country, and indeed, I might say civilized opinion.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>And do we represent the uncivilized opinion?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, a great deal of it is not civilized, and if you listen to hon. members talking nonsense the way they did last night, it is a highly uncivilized point of view to imagine that because the Government is in power anyone who disagrees with it is thereby not patriotic. That is utter nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="col_6305-6306" refersTo="page_0357"/>I want to know whether hon. members have heard Tories who have come to South Africa, and whether they have listened to them criticizing the Labour Government. Are they traitors to their country, or are they anti-Wilson people? That is all they are. In fact I heard one of them on the S.A.B.C. the other night. He was a well-known Tory who visited South Africa. He was given time by this Government on our radio to criticize his own Government in England. What on earth is the Government thinking of&#x2014;giving a &#x201C;traitor&#x201D; to England time on the S.A.B.C. to criticize the Wilson Government? It is exactly the same analogy.</p>

<p>I want to get away from that point. I just wanted to dispose of it because it was so rritating to have to listen to all those nonsensical speeches last night. I want to ask the hon. the Minister one or two questions. Could he tell us whether there have been other countries that have submitted notes of objection to South Africa, as Finland has, which note was publicized, on the actions of the Government in regard to South West Africa and the recent Bill which was passed in this House? Have there been any other objections to the powers taken to divide South West Africa up into Bantustans?</p>

<p>Then I want to follow upon the point which was raised right at the end of last night by the hon. member for Karoo, namely the question of the barring of the Canadian mission from coming into South Africa. This, I believe, will come under this Minister&#x2019;s portfolio. Canadians do not need visas. That I know. They do not need visas to enter South Africa. Therefore they must have applied to somebody. Presumably they would apply to the Foreign Office in this country, otherwise I do not know how they knew that the mission would not be welcome. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will clear this matter up for us, because this is clearly just an indirect way of making it impossible for Coloured people who wish to emigrate, to leave this country, since Canada is one of the few countries to which they can go, and since now under Canadian rules, an interview is required with applicants who wish to leave the country. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can clear this up. It is a mystery, because if they did not apply to his Department, I cannot imagine to which Department they did apply, since, as I have said, visas are not required by Canadians entering this country.</p>

<p>The third point I want to make is that the hon. the Minister yesterday made mention of reports which were put out by the United Nations on South Africa, which are inaccurate, which are out of date and which contain statistics which are not correct. I have no doubt of course that there are such reports. I have seen them myself. They do contain exaggerated statements and they contain statistics which are out of date. But may I say that we are by no means blameless in this regard. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout touched on this matter. I want to go a little more specifically into this new publication entitled &#x201C;South Africa and the Rule of Law&#x201D;, which we have just put out. I must say that if we are criticizing other people&#x2019;s inaccuracies we should be very careful indeed that all the information that we put out under the auspices of our Foreign Office should be beyond reproach and should be absolutely clear in so far as presenting the truth and not half-truths is concerned. There are numerous statements in this document which are so open to criticism. Indeed I see that the London <i>Sunday Times</i> of 12th May has already come out with some of the very obvious criticisms of this document. I want to point out one or two such instances, and say that we do not do our case any good by presenting a case which is obviously full of pitfalls. For instance, there is a statement on criminal procedure that when the accused pleads not guilty he puts at issue all the allegations contained in a written charge and the onus of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt is placed upon the State. We have numerous statutory provisions, and everybody knows about them, in our law under the Suppression of Communism Act and various other Acts which places the onus fairly and squarely on the accused. I think that if we say this we ought always to qualify the statement and explain that this may be a fairly general rule in South Africa, but that there are many exceptions to this rule. Of course this is one of the first points which will be picked up by any critic of South Africa. There is also a statement on page 12 of this document that if an accused is found not guilty, he is acquitted and that is the end of the matter. As far as our ordinary courts of law are concerned, that is the end of the matter, but it is certainly not the end of the matter as far as the Minister of Justice is concerned and it is not even the end of the matter as far as the Minister of Prisons is concerned, because we have laws on the Statute Book which enable people to be kept in gaols long after they have served their sentences. We have had very many examples in South Africa where, after a person has been acquitted of a charge under the Suppression of Communism and other so-called security laws, they are immediately placed under bans by the Minister of Justice. So it is not the end of the matter at all, not as far as the individual is concerned. That is the sort of obvious thing that anybody is going to notice immediately. If it were true that once one were found not guilty in a court of law and were set free, that was that, it would be fine, but nothing like that happens to a great number of people who have been accused and acquitted of charges under so-called security legislation.</p>

<p>Then we have something here about the Criminal Procedure Act making imposition of certain sentences compulsory in certain cases. That is absolutely true, but there are large numbers of other compulsory minimum sentences which of course are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to waste my time on the hon. member for Houghton, except to say that it is a very great pity that she has tried to run down a very good publication. Of course she has been true to herself and has tried to get her information from the London <i>Sunday Times.</i> She has tried to suck poison here in South Africa for the use of people overseas.</p>

<p>Sir, I wish to come back to the question of our relations with the United States of America, as mentioned by the hon. member for Middelland. It must be admitted, unfortunately, that certain serious problems and difficulties have arisen in the course of the past few years as far as our relations with the United States of America are concerned. These are differences and problems which we did not create or desire and which we seriously tried to avoid. It must also be admitted that these differences and problems caused a considerable amount of tension in the relations between these two countries. This is a great pity. We find to-day that there is a growing anti-American feeling in South Africa which never existed before. This unnecessary and unwanted tension between two countries which have co-operated very well for many years is a great pity.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that there is no other nation in the world with which we have so much in common as the United States. Because of that, Americans understand our problems much more easily than other nations do. Not only did our ancestors originally emigrate from the same European countries, but there is also a very close similarity between the histories of the two countries. The covered wagon of the American pioneer played the same important role there as the kakebeenwa of the Voor-trekker played here. It has been their task, as it has been ours, to cultivate and civilize part of a vast uncivilized continent. They also have a colour problem for which there is no easy solution, as we have. For many years it was their national policy and their firm conviction that no other nation had the right to interfere in their internal problems. We also believe in that policy of non-interference.</p>

<p>South Africa and the U.S.A, have a very long and happy history of close co-operation. Side by side we fought through two World Wars, and again in the Korean War we fought alongside them against the communist onslaught. We also played our part in the Berlin airlift. In the field of science there has been very close co-operation. We have assisted them as far as satellite tracking is concerned. Most significant from their point of view is the fact that we are perhaps one of the only countries, if indeed not the only one in the world to-day, which has never criticized or reprimanded the Government of the U.S.A, for their Vietnam policy.</p>

<p>On 19th February last year our Prime Minister expressed our nation&#x2019;s view in the following words:</p>

<block name="quote">We have appreciation for the stand President Johnson and the U.S. are taking in Vietnam. We were glad to show our appreciation to those who faced the perils of war in that part of the world.</block>

<p>But we have even more in common with them. We also have in common with them the fact that our two countries form part of the new world, a new world with a different task and a different duty towards mankind. There are signs that the old world is passing away and that a new world has to take the lead. Together we stand side by side in the struggle against Communism, which is endangering and (bedevilling their way of life as well as ours. The U.S.A. is to-day generally accepted by the free world as the undisputed leader in the struggle against Communism. Seeing that we have aligned ourselves firmly on the side of the West, it is most important that we have good relations with them. We do not overlook the fact that while other western nations sometimes have a very lukewarm attitude towards Communism it is the U.S.A. which is involved in a very bitter struggle against the encroaching Red army. We do not overlook the fact that thousands and thousands of young Americans have died in that war. We acknowledge and indeed salute the U.S.A. as the chief protector of the free world. We do this in spite of some very nasty blows that have been aimed at us by the U.S.A. Some of those blows were indeed very much below the belt and very painful to us because they were dealt out by a very good friend and ally. One of those painful blows was the unfortunate incident during the visit of the <i>Franklin D. Roosevelt</i> in 1966. More than anything else, this fiasco caused a feeling of uncertainty and ill-will against the U.S.A, in this country <span class="col_6309-6310" refersTo="page_0359"/>and even caused South Africans to speak of the U.S.A. as a danger and an enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Goldberg, the U.S.A, representative in the United Nations, made some very unfriendly, one can even say irresponsible, statements about South Africa and surely contributed more than anybody else to the deterioration of good relations between the two countries. Indeed, when reading some of his condemnatory speeches one wonders whether good relations were at all possible between the two countries. We sincerely hope that his successor, Mr. George Ball will have a more realistic approach towards South African affairs. Basically, however, the cause of tension and trouble between the two countries boils down to a different approach to the colour problem. They believe that they can solve their colour problem by means of forced integration. We believe that we can solve our problem by means of separate development. We believe that this policy is morally justifiable. We believe that in the light of our own special circumstances and our experience over a period of more than 300 years in this matter we know how to solve this problem. Ultimately we have the same goal, namely freedom and self-determination for all nations. I firmly believe that if the true picture of separate development can be put before the people of the United States objectively they would accept it or at least regard it as an experiment worth looking at. Unfortunately this would be an almost superhuman task because of distortions and smear-campaigns against South Africa carried on for many years. Many responsible people in the U.S.A, to-day realize that integration is not the solution to the colour problem&#x2014;at least not for South Africa. If one views the American scene and observe what a struggle and how much bloodshed and tears their efforts to integrate only 11 per cent of their population have brought about, it stands to reason that it will be an insurmountable task for South Africa to integrate more than 82 per cent of her population, this 82 per cent consisting of people with vast differences in cultural background, religion, civilization and way of life. But whatever is right or wrong in this matter we expect them to accept our honesty. We firmly believe that it is the inalienable right of every nation to solve its own problems in its own way. We believe that international co-operation and friendship should be based on mutual respect and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries. On this basis we wish to co-operate with the U.S.A. Our Prime Minister stated on 19th February last year:</p>

<block name="quote">We look upon the U.S.A, and accept her as the strongest leader of the free world, and we want to stand as close to the U.S.A. as honour will permit.</block>

<p>We stand together with the U.S.A. in the struggle against Communism. Together with them we believe in freedom and self-determination for all nations. Together we have an enormous task on the continent of Africa, to restore peace, order and stability and to dissipate suffering, ignorance and anarchy. If this is so, one certainly has the right to ask: &#x201C;Why then is the U.S.A, not with us in the struggle against terrorism and Communism? Why is this uncertainty and tension being allowed to develop between two friendly nations? Why do they refuse to sell us the weapons we need to defend the Cape route and to make sure that this most strategic bastion of the South will never fall into the hands of Communists?&#x201D; To these and many other questions it is sometimes most difficult for us to find an answer. Nevertheless as in the past we will in the future strive with dignity and self-control to maintain friendly relations with the U.S.A. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member dealt with our relations with America in a very responsible way, as did the hon. member for Middelland. I just want to say to both these hon. members that if this represents a change in their point of view, we welcome it. If it does not represent a change in their point of view, I am surprised that they have been so quiet about this in the past.</p>

<p>I too should like to make a small contribution to this discussion which I hope the hon. the Minister will see as a positive attempt to be constructive. I believe that if you look at the international situation at the moment vou find that there are certain trends and developments which are of great consequence and might affeot our whole approach to the international situation.</p>

<p>The first development of consequence is that since the war there has been a tendency to revert more and more to a system of multilateral diplomacy rather than the bilateral system which prevailed before the war. There are very obvious reasons why this should be so. The second development that I think is of consequence is what the technical people would call &#x201C;regionalism&#x201D;. Immediately after the war there was a tendency for nations to hive off. There was a process of fragmentation. Since then they have learnt for various reasons that it is necessary for them to group them&#x2019; selves in alliances or economic unions and alt sorts of other forms of international togetherness. As a result of this there might also follow a third tendency, namely a tendency towards decentralization in international affairs. I believe that there may be locked up in this idea certain decided dangers as far as South Africa is concerned. It is known that the United Nations Organization for various reasons is not an effective body. Quite apart from that it has become so cumbersome that it cannot handle many of the problems that come before it. There are very many knowledgeable people who believe that this body will tend to decentralize some of its activities to some of the smaller regional agencies. Could we, for example, <span class="col_6311-6312" refersTo="page_0360"/>imagine what would happen if the United Nations Organization were to decide to delegate the problem of Rhodesia or South West Africa to a body such as the Organization for African Unity? If this were to happen the voice of calm reasoning would be excluded. Wiser counsels would not prevail and the more sober judgment which we might find in other bodies would either be lacking or completely stifled. Certainly if this development were to take place, it might lead to conflict, and set the whole of the African continent alight.</p>

<p>But I think that there is also a fourth important development and that is what I would like to refer to as &#x201C;leapfrogging&#x201D;. Israel is a typical example of how this principle is applied. Hemmed in by a solid ring of hostile Arab states Israel has tended to jump over this ring to try to establish goodwill and proper relationships outside. They have done this by means of technical and other forms of aid. As far as Israel is concerned, this has had effect because whenever the Israel/Arab issue comes before the United Nations, Israel can rely on a pretty solid chunk of support from some of the African States.</p>

<p>I believe that certain of these principles apply also to South Africa. At the moment we have a diplomatic offensive to the north of us. This is proper and it is necessary that it should be done. At the same time we must be realistic about it because we are going to run up a pretty hostile ring; but this is where the principle of leapfrogging comes in. Already there is significant diplomatic activity on the part of South Africa in South America. Yesterday the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also mentioned Malagasy. I think we could be more ambitious. What about the Far East? Here I think particularly of places like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and possibly even Indonesia. Here I might also suggest to the hon. the Minister that the ground there might not be as unfertile as it might appear at first glance. The situation in that part of the world is changing. One can notice that in Indonesia, where five years ago they kicked the Dutch out and yet to-day the Dutch are streaming back there. This is a part of the world which is of real consequence. The communists have always maintained that the road to world communism runs through the East and it is certainly true to-day that the Indian Ocean, this tremendously important strategic ocean, is being controlled from three points: From South Africa, from Australia and from Singa pore. One is surprised by the success Australia had had in that part of the world. They have managed to establish active trade relations and direct diplomatic links. In many cases these things stem from small factors. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, for instance, once studied at an Australian university and consequently there is much goodwill from that part of the world towards Australia.</p>

<p>It does not seem to me that we are doing enough in that part of the world. It is true, of course, that we have consular representation in Hong Kong but this is only a free port; it is not a country; and it is not of international consequence. I want to suggest that there are unlimited opportunities for trade with that part of the world and once trade relationships have been established things may develop into something more significant.</p>

<p>Yes, but I was thinking more of the Singapore complex and the area further south. But, as I see it, the great difficulty we are going to encounter in our moves in that part of the world is certain rigidities in our domestic situation. I am not trying to make political capital out of this but I think it is necessary that I should say it. I regret the fact that I have to draw myself into it but last year about December I happened to be in Indonesia. One day there came the news of the heart transplant by Professor Barnard. This was given front page treatment. It was featured by every newspaper, including the communist papers. IBut on the back page one could find a further instalment of the sad case of this little girl, Sandra Laing, who is neither white nor non-white. Our own people play tennis against India and the fact that South Africa had beaten the Indian team in the Davis Cup was featured in all newspapers in the East. But if you read further you could also read about the South African born ship&#x2019;s captain who is married to a Japanese wife but cannot bring her to South Africa. The image created of South Africa is that of a technologically advanced society but an inhuman one. We all want to see the Minister having success in this field. I do not know what his influence in the Cabinet is&#x2014;I hope it is considerable. I want to tell him that as long as we have these pinpricks he will have very limited success. In this modern world people do not understand how we can say that a Japanese wife cannot live in South Africa. It is not understood. After all, we have made them honorary Whites. In this case we have decided that pig iron is more important than pigmentation but when a Japanese wife wants to come here, she cannot be allowed in. That also is the answer to the hon. member, as far as America is concerned. They do not expect us to follow suit always. I have been told this a hundred times. They say it is like driving along a road; we do not expect you to drive at the speed at which we do. You can even stop from time to time to effect repairs to your car, but why must you drive diametrically in an opposite direction. That was the point of view I wanted to put to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, for a few moments only I shall return to the debate conducted here in regard to the question of Government policy and South Africa&#x2019;s attitude in that connection, and whether the policy of the Government is in fact South African policy, and so forth. I want to start by saying that there may be a difference in regard to the official implementation and practical application of this policy of separate development as such, but that it has been the traditional South African way of life for more than 300 years, and that there will not be one unit in this sphere, but equality along individual lines. This is South African policy, and not merely Government policy. That is where the difference comes in, and that is where I agreed with the hon. member for Sea Point last night Our policy of being separate as such, is not necessarily linked with this party only; this has been the case for more than 300 years. The outside world did not revolt against this party and its policy. The outside world and especially U.N. revolted against the traditional South African way of life. I want to illustrate this very briefly. I think I can illustrate this very well. In 1947, before the National Party came into power, before there was any talk of the concept of apartheid as government policy, when General Smuts was Prime Minister and when South Africa was very popular with the world because it had just emerged from the Second World War on the side of the victors, U.N. was addressed by one of its foundation members, namely General Smuts. Even at that time, without the policy of apartheid, he was in disfavour with India and with the whole of U.N. owing to our traditional way of life in South Africa. Therefore it has nothing to do with the policy of apartheid as it is being implemented now. It has to do with our traditional way of life. The world of to-day and U.N. simply did not want to accept it. But I think that we have made a great deal of progress. It was in particular the responsible, calm and collected action taken by this Government. and pre-eminently by this Minister, that was largely instrumental in showing the outside world and illustrating to them that our traditional way of life could be implemented domestically without deviating from principles in any way, and was nevertheless reconcilable with the twentieth century world without being a discordant note to them. This is possible, because our domestic policy is based on the question of the equality of people, each in his own sphere. There is, therefore, no discrimination in our policy of separate development. We grant everybody equal benefits in his own territory. That is why this policy is acceptable to the world. We have only to be afforded the opportunity of conveying and bringing it home to the outside world. That is why we thank this Minister and his Department very cordially for all the publications which appeared in recent times and to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also referred; the publications in which it is being indicated plainly, practically, straightforwardly and by means of facts what our position in South Africa is, what we are doing in regard to these matters, and how everybody is being afforded his opportunity in South Africa on an equal basis. I want to invalidate this argument in one single movement: I say that all of us, whether we are Nationalists or United Party supporters or Progressives, can, in the first instance, be faithful and loyal South Africans abroad. We can differ with the Government on the implementation of its policy, and we can criticize it abroad with the greatest pleasure, but we dare not do an injustice to the traditional South African way of life or pretend that it does not exist, because then we would be untrue to ourselves and to South Africa. That is what the Whole matter is about, not about the question of whether or not the party&#x2019;s policy and the policy of South Africa is uniform. Mr. Chairman, what is the primary task of the Government of South Africa, also in respect of foreign affairs? Its primary task is to maintain law and order inside South Africa. It is the basic, primary task of any government to maintain internal law and order, i.e. stability and a good way of life for everybody. If that is our fundamental task, then I say that it does not matter what means we employ in order to do so; basically that is our primary task. Once we have done that, even though those measures may be incomprehensible to the world, even though they may be unpopular abroad, then I say that it is nevertheless our fundamental duty to say that South Africa and her interests come first, to set matters right here first and then to bring home our policy to the outside world and to explain to the outside world why we are implementing it and why we are implementing it in this way, in spite of the fact that sometimes they do not understand it or do not want to understand it.</p>

<p>The whole situation in this regard is very clear to me. Once we have set matters right domestically and once we have created for all the population groups in South Africa opportunities of their own, as we are in fact doing, it is the task of our country&#x2014;and it would be foolish not to present the other side of the picture&#x2014;also to set right the image of our country abroad and to develop it there so that it will be possible for the outside world to understand us as well as all our problems, and so that it may also become acceptable to them. Mr. Chairman, we have made a break-through in a certain sphere, and I want to say at once that this is not a specific situation which has arisen now; it was the logical, obvious consequence of our policy, namely that we now have liaison with Malawi. For the purposes of the record I want to read out here a report on an interview conducted by President Banda of Malawi with Dr. Germani, a correspondent of <i>Die Welt,</i> a German publication, just to show you, Sir, how much goodwill this leader of black Africa already has towards South Africa <span class="col_6315-6316" refersTo="page_0362"/>and the objective view he takes of the whole matter. I want to read just a few thoughts from this report. The German journalist put the following question to Dr. Banda: &#x201C;But your country does not believe in boycotts.&#x201D; President Banda&#x2019;s reply to this was: &#x201C;No, I do not believe in boycotts. Of course, it will not work. Boycotting South Africa will not work; I repeat that.&#x201D; Then the German journalist asked the following question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do you think the European powers could do something?</block>

<p>This was Dr. Banda&#x2019;s reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes. I think I mentioned that before. You European countries, particularly Britain, Germany and France must be realistic. You must not say the white man has no business in Africa. There is nothing you can do about South Africa. You cannot wipe them out. The Afrikaner will not go back to Holland, I can tell you that, so you will have to accept them just as part of the population of Africa, just as you accept the Arabs in the north as part of the population of Africa. That is all. You must not take the attitude that everything the Whites do is wrong and that therefore you will always have to support the Africans. You must judge every individual case on its own merits.</block>

<p>Sir, where would one previously ever have found a Black African leader adopting this calm, sensible and responsible attitude, at which even certain European countries might as well look with respect. Dr. Banda adopts a very distinct attitude in this regard, but I want to add at once: Various appeals were made here to the hon. the Minister by members on that side, appeals to the effect that he should, without any delay whatsoever, start entering into diplomatic relations with a number of black states; the names of certain states were mentioned. Madagascar, for instance, should be drawn in as soon as possible, and last night the hon. member for East London (City) said that all the former British Protectorates should now all of a sudden have ambassadors here. To-day this request was extended in all directions, even Zambia, etc., was included. Sir, I want to make a very serious plea to the hon. the Minister, i.e. that we should act calmly, composedly and responsibly in this regard, as we have done up to now, and that we should not act precipitately. The appeal I want to make to the Minister is that in this regard we should uphold the principle which has rendered the agreement with Malawi possible, namely that diplomatic relations will be established when the time is ripe and that we should not force this issue artificially; secondly, that we shall do so exclusively on a basis of unconditional friendship on both sides; thirdly, on a basis of non-intervention in each other&#x2019;s affairs. If these factors are not present, then I say that the time is not ripe for us to enter into diplomatic relations with such states. I think that we should be calm and collected in this regard and that the State should act in a responsible way, as it has done in the past. I want to implore the Government to continue to act in this way. Mr. Chairman, what are the aotual facts of the matter? The actual facts of the matter are that the Whites in South Africa occupy a very special position. The Whites of South Africa ought to be the link between Western Europe and Africa and not the fly in the ointment, for the Whites of South Africa know the traditions, the culture, the customs and the civilization of the Western countries, but the Whites of South Africa have primarily been inhabitants of Africa for 300 years and they know Africa. That is why they ought to be the key to Africa and not the fly in the ointment. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a coincidence that you should call me immediately after the hon. member for Rand-fontein, who has now just resumed his seat. I should like to say a few words about a matter which he touched upon here. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation towards the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister for the work the Government has done and for what has been achieved as far as our relationships with our black neighbouring states are concerned. I also want to point out at the same time that we are doing South Africa a disservice when scoring cheap debating points in connection with what happened when the Prime Minister of a Black neighbouring state visited us and when certain Ministers of another Black neighbouring state visited South Africa. I am referring to the suggestion which was made here across the floor of the House to the effect that a permit had to be obtained in order to entertain them in the Mount Nelson Hotel. I want to warn hon. members that they are doing South Africa a disservice by making this kind of statement. They are merely supplying our enemies with ammunition and they are merely succeeding in prejudicing and presenting in a bad light those persons who have good relationships with us.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to Malawi in particular. I know the country fairly well. I was there for quite a time during the war years, and I have a sound knowledge of many aspects of that country. I feel that it is my duty, pursuant to what the hon. member for Randfontein said here, to pay tribute to-day to those forgotten ambassadors who made it possible and who laid the foundations for South Africa to maintain friendly relations with Malawi today for us to have a friend in the person of the president of Malawi, namely those missionaries of our church who have gone to that country since earliest times. We are to-day reaping the fruits of their labours. I want to refer particularly to the educational work which was done there. It all began at a ministerial <span class="col_6317-6318" refersTo="page_0363"/>conference held at Cradock in 1886, when a number of ministers of religion came together and declared their intention of dedicating themselves to mission work. The place which they chose was Nyassaland. There were no funds and they had to build up funds out of their own salaries with which to do mission work. The first missionary was the Rev. A. C. Murray, who went to Nyassaland in 1888. The following year the Rev. Vlok also went. They collaborated with the Scots who were there already. The first Dutch Reformed Church mission station was established in 1889 at Mvera, which means &#x201C;obedience&#x201D;. I knew the country during the war years, when it was to a large extent a wild and fierce country, but in those years the Acewa were the subject of the Angoni. Raids were executed; wars were waged and the missionaries were in the midst of it all. The people pursued heathen practices, but the missionaries continued with their work. In 1889 the British Colonial Administration achieved a measure of orderliness when British administration was established there. The synod of the Dutch Reformed Church only took over the mission there in 1903, and more funds were made available. In 1922 there were five mission stations in Portuguese East Africa. In 1922 the Portuguese authorities closed down those five Dutch Reformed Church mission stations and the Afrikaner missionaries were driven out. I think that they regret that fact to the present day when they see what is happening in Malawi compared with what is happening in the Portuguese territory. I say this notwithstanding the fact that they have our sympathy.</p>

<p>To-day there are still 1,000 members of the Dutch Reformed Church or Presbyterian Church in Portuguese East Africa. The missionaries went there to teach the people about God and His Commandments but the missionaries found that one could not teach a man about God and His Commandments if he was illiterate and could not read and write. The mission work was based on a system of education and a fine system of education was established there. I say proudly that it was our Afrikaner missionaries who went to Malawi and who were responsible for the fact that Dr. Hastings Banda was educated in one of their schools, as were some of the Ministers who were here in South Africa.</p>

<p>In 1961, when the church there seceded, the educational properties, hospitals and so forth were worth R660,000. During 1967 the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa, without laying down any conditions, granted R167,710 for educational work in Nyassaland. The main station, Mkoma, which I know well, has a hospital, a training centre, a theological school, a trade school and a printing press. Magnificent work has been done there. Just imagine what those people sacrificed and suffered. Children died there of tropical diseases. Their children who did survive were taken away from them at 7-8 years of age and sent to the south, and they only saw them every five years because there were no educational facilities for white children. My wife was one of them. My father-in-law was there for 40 years.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to apologize here for something I did a few times in my life when there was turmoil in Africa. Whenever countries in Africa became independent one had chaos and disorder. When the independence of Nyassaland appeared on the horison, and I frequently said to my wife: &#x201C;Why did the people go there to waste their intellects, their time and their lives; look what is happening now; what have they got for it?&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, I want to withdraw those words here, because to-day we are reaping the fruits of their labours; of the sacrifice which they made. At the time when I was there my father-in-law&#x2019;s motor car in which he travelled and which is still in our possession to-day, travelled for the most part on chains because the roads were not negotiable. The Whites there never saw their own children, and to-day we are reaping the fruits of the work which they did there. Sir, it has almost been said jokingly in my presence that the conditions prevailing in our black neighbouring states to-day are only attributable to circumstances. That is not so.</p>

<p>If it were merely a question of circumstances, then an Afrikaner by the name of Louw Pretorius, who was principal of the high school at Mkoma during the time when I was there, would not have been appointed by President Banda a few months ago as chairman of the Censor Board of Malawi. I think that we as South Africans can feel proud of the fact that so much faith is placed in South Africans that a South African is appointed to such a responsible post. In other words, there we have an example of a sensible man with a sensible government which draws on the experience which we have gathered here in the south with the civilization and system of government which has been built up here. I think that we can pay tribute to those people who sacrificed their lives and careers and everything else. We are reaping the fruits of that to-day and I want to congratulate the Government and say only this: Go forward carefully but go forward on this road; carry on with the good work and the good relations which have already been established.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House have noted with appreciation the Opposition&#x2019;s standpoint in regard to Rhodesia and the responsible spirit in which it was stated. Of course, the Government&#x2019;s standpoint in respect of Rhodesia has been crystal clear since the beginning of Rhodesia&#x2019;s independence. The Government&#x2019;s standpoint has remained unchanged since U.D.I. It amounts to this, that the Government does not believe in boycotts, and especially not boycotts in Southern Africa, where the economies of all the states are so very closely interwoven and where so many serious attempts are in faot being made at the <span class="col_6319-6320" refersTo="page_0364"/>present moment to expand the economy of Southern Africa. The Government has believed all along that the Rhodesian dispute is a matter between Britain and Rhodesia, and not a matter for the U.N.; that it is a matter in regard to which Britain and Rhodesia themselves must and ought to find a satisfactory solution. The Government sincerely hopes that in spite of what has happened at the U.N. now, these two parties will nevertheless succeed in finding a solution to this dispute. I have still to study the text of the resolution adopted yesterday by the Security Council of the U.N. This is of course a matter which one should not discuss precipitately. I think hon. members opposite will agree with me that I should not comment upon it at this stage, particularly in view of the unanimity existing between the Government and the Opposition in respect of Rhodesia, particularly of late.</p>

<p>Amongst the speeches made under my Vote, there were good ones from both sides, speeches to which I could listen with appreciation and interest, and I am certain that some of them will be read with interest and will find a response in many parts of the world. It is not my intention to comment on all the speeches, but I shall confine myself to replying to questions that have been put to me. I must honestly admit that I was disappointed with the speech made by the main speaker of the Opposition yesterday. After my first reaction last night I pondered the matter again and I must say that I can find nothing or very little in his speech which was really useful and constructive. The hon. member need not be concerned about the utterances and actions of members on this side of the House. They will not embarrass me. I think he should rather concentrate on his own utterances and those of his fellow party members and see to it that those utterances do not prove an embarrassment to South Africa and to me.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout again discussed the unacceptability of South Africa&#x2019;s domestic policy to the outside world. This is of course a very old theme which we have debated <i>ad nauseum</i> in this House, and to repeat those debates is quite fruitless. I have a great deal of proof and I can quote many resolutiions of the United Nations to you from which it appears unequivocally that the policy of the United Party is also unacceptable to the extremists at the United Nations, that it is as unacceptable to them as the policy of the present regime in Rhodesia, or the policy of the Portuguese. No, this is a case of the pot not being able to call the kettle black, and our position in the outside world does not depend upon concessions in respect of our policy either. The attacks which are being made on South Africa are aimed at the Whites here. The non-White extremists and the communists in the world want South Africa for themselves as a sphere of influence, and all of us in South Africa are opposed to that, not only we and our Opposition, but also the non-Whites and the responsible leaders of our non-Whites. In this regard there should be no suggestion of any disunity in our ranks.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also discussed the publications which were recently compiled by my Department with the assistance of other Departments and which we distributed abroad. I find it a pity that he made no constructive comments. I find it a pity that he expressed no appreciation for this work. I know these publications are not perfect, but I do think they are particularly useful and I think a word of appreciation would have encouraged my own officials and the officials of other Departments who gave such valuable assistance, and would have meant a great deal to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton also referred to one of the publications, but it is very clear to me that she had not read that publication herself and that she had only read reviews of it. She thought that she had come across certain misrepresentations in that publication in regard to our court procedure. It is only natural that we would set out the normal court procedure in South Africa in a document of this nature. We did this, but we also went further. If the hon. member would take the trouble of looking at page 38 of this publication, she would see that we deal there with the extraordinary procedure in the case of communism and the special measures taken to protect our safety; and if she would read page 49, she would see that special procedures in our courts in regard to terrorism are dealt with there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton asked whether any other objections had been received by the Government in regard to our legislation on South West Africa. The reply is yes. The hon. member also wanted more information in regard to the proposed mission to recruit immigrants for South Africa in Canada. I must inform the hon. member that although the application was dealt with by my Department, it is a matter which does not fall under me and that a question in regard to this matter has already appeared on the Order Paper, which will be replied to next week.</p>

<p>But to return to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout: He launched a vehement attack in regard to the diplomatic residential area. However, the hon. member was not well-informed, or perhaps he was simply being wilful. He said that this type of diplomatic suburb was only to be found in communist countries, except in the case of Brazil. But we must remember that Brazil was planning a new capital where it was possible for them to introduce this advantageous system. There are other non-communist countries as well which <span class="col_6321-6322" refersTo="page_0365"/>have diplomatic residential areas, such as in New Delhi in India, and Canberra in Australia. Are they communist countries? No, the hon. member was trying to sow suspicion on the basis of facts which were not correct. As regards the cost of this diplomatic suburb, a question in this regard was replied to in the House of Assembly in February of this year. Unfortunately I cannot furnish final figures. At this stage negotiations are still in progress in regard to the price of the land.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked me to make a full statement of the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to diplomats from Africa. What is the purpose of that question? Is the purpose perhaps to cause friction or incidents in South Africa while there is no friction and while everything is functioning normally and smoothly? I need make no statement in this regard. What has been said, is quite adequate. All that I can say in this regard, is that nowhere in the world are there first and second class diplomats, not here in South Africa either. I have said this before, and I have repeated it, but apparently the hon. member does not want to accept it, i.e. that all diplomats, regardless of their colour enjoy the same privileges and immunities everywhere in the world, and in South Africa as well. What is more, the hon. member must not concern himself about air-hostesses from Malawi. In the first place they are not diplomats, and in the second I have received no complaints that their affairs have not been properly arranged. In fact, my information is that completely satisfactory arrangements have been made in their case.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City), as well as the hon. member for Karoo, also discussed diplomatic representation. The hon. member for Karoo asked why we were exchanging diplomats in the case of distant countries, but not with our immediate neighbours. The reply is that this is so because it is impossible to communicate directly with those distant countries as we do in the case of our two neighbouring states, and incidentally, this direct method is much cheaper. Do hon. members realize how much it costs to open an embassy? If hon. members would take the trouble of paging through this book in which our Estimates appear, they would see that in the case of merely consular missions in Mozambique and in Angola, the cost of salaries to staff and allowances alone amounts to between R50,000 and R75.000. This does not make provision for the expenses in regard to the accommodation of these people. Where must our neighbouring states get the money from? Must we give it to them? And suppose they did have the money, could they not spend it much more profitably in their own countries on essential services and on the development of their own territories? Is that not a much more sensible, realistic and sober thing to do?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also referred to Madagascar. Now, there has been a good deal of speculation about the Malagasy Republic. I think hon. members know by this time that I am not unnecessarily secretive in regard to such matters, and that I take them into my confidence whenever it is in any way possible to do so. In this case, as in many similar cases&#x2014;and there are many&#x2014;there is no statement to be made at this stage. I hope the hon. member will accept this.</p>

<p>As regards South West Africa, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked me whether we were prepared to try to find a solution by continuing the dialogue. The reply to this question is contained in the document from which he quoted, namely a communication from myself to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In fact, the reply is contained in the same sentence; he just omitted that part. I should like to read the entire sentence to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is likewise forgotten that before the proceedings were instituted South Africa repeatedly indicated that while, in fact, she was voluntarily prepared to seek a solution to the problem by negotiation, she could not submit to demands for United Nations supervision.</block>

<p>There is therefore no question of give and take, as the hon. member insinuated. Our object with this kind of discussion in the past, and at present, is to convince the world that South Africa is best able and equipped to undertake the development of South West Africa and the emancipation of its population. That is the purpose of these discussions. It is to prove to and to convince the world that we can do it better than anybody else or any establishment or institution. We are continuing with discussions of this nature. Recently, for example, we held discussions in this regard both here and in the United States of America. These discussions are continuing. A question was asked in regard to what had happened about the invitations to heads of missions to visit South West Africa. Several of them have already visited the area, but unfortunately not all of them have gone there. A question was also asked in regard to the reaction of the Secretary-General to South Africa&#x2019;s offer to receive his personal representative here. We have not received an official reply yet, but as hon. members have probably noted in the Press, certain circles and certain states are interested and are attaching value to this particular proposal. The hon. member for Karoo asked how African states were actually to know what treatment their people would receive in this country if they came here, whether officially or unofficially. Such persons from quite a number of African states are continually paying visits here. I want to point out that as far as official visits are concerned, an average of more than three such official visits <span class="col_6323-6324" refersTo="page_0366"/>from various African states were paid to South Africa per month in the past 12 months, while an average of more than four official visits from South Africa were paid to various African states per month. However, that is not all. During the past 12 months there were no fewer than 136 cases of Ministers from African states either visiting or passing through the Republic and making contact with us. I hope that hon. members on the opposite side will take note of this. I may also tell them that in all these cases we received only the highest praise and appreciation for the treatment accorded these persons here in the Republic. I hope that hon. members on the opposite side will cease to alarm potential visitors by insinuating that they will not meet with a good reception when they visit the Republic.</p>

<p>As far as mixed receptions in South Africa are concerned, the policy of the Government is very clear, as it has been ever since the late Dr. Verwoerd stated it here in this House. When both white and non-white South Africans&#x2014;please note, South Africans&#x2014;are invited to receptions held by foreign organizations, we do not attend those receptions, and we do not approve of them. That is the policy. But let me add at once that there has never been any objection on the part of the Government to such functions which were attended or even given by non-white diplomats, of whom we have for many years had several here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Reference was made to statements which my colleague and friend, Minister Schoeman, and I had made in regard to the possibility that South Africa should in future adopt a neutral attitude. Sir, what I said was that it was no wonder that many South Africans were beginning to ask themselves whether it was in South Africa&#x2019;s interest to stand unconditionally by the West at all times. That is what I said, and nothing more. All I want to add to that to-day, is that the Western countries are and will remain our natural friends. It is a pity that our loyalty to and faith in the cause of the West do not always receive the necessary appreciation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) has apologized for not being able to be present here. Both he and the hon. member for Orange Grove referred to the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with Israel. Let me say at once that we do have diplomatic relations with Israel. The possibility of exchanging diplomats with that country, just as in many other similar cases, is a matter which is constantly receiving the attention of the Government. It is true that we have no mission in Israel. Israel does, however, have a mission here. They have many interests in South Africa. There is a large, prosperous and happy Jewish community in South Africa. But then hon. members must also bear in mind that for several years Israel has not appointed an envoy to the post here, and that the post of head of their mission has for several years been filled here by a temporary charge d&#x2019;affaires. Besides, Israel&#x2019;s spokemen at the U.N. and elsewhere are inclined to try to win the favour of others by making hostile statements on South Africa&#x2019;s domestic affairs. Sir, I hope they realize that this will not benefit their country and that it is not (the right procedure to win friends.</p>

<p>While I am on this subject, I may perhaps just say that the rest of the world would also do well to take note of this. There was a time when it paid the West to condemn South Africa left, right and centre, and when this was a sound political investment. If is also common knowledge that many Western governments have made it their aim to create the impression that they are the champions of the so-called &#x201C;underdog&#x201D;. It enables them to make a strong emotional appeal to the voters. But when they fail to improve the position of the &#x201C;underdog&#x201D; on their own home front, they look for a scapegoat. Then they look for a lightning conductor. When that happens they come forward with their attacks on and condemnations of South Africa. But those times are rapidly passing, if they are not already past. The time has come when more and more African states and African statesmen who have recently come to know us better are helping to rectify the distorted image of South Africa abroad. I need not refer you to a number of newspaper reports in this connection which have appeared recently, in the past week or two. I predict that this will happen to an increasing extent in future. I hope that it will also find an echo outside Southern Africa.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about our relations with Africa. I listened to this with great appreciation. I want to say a few words about one of the most important states in Southern Africa, namely Zambia. The President of Zambia knows precisely where he stands with South Africa. Our Prime Minister and others have repeatedly stated our attitude towards Zambia quite explicitly. We have repeatedly warned him against the dangers of terrorism. We have made the aims of our Defence Force, i.e. defence and not aggression, very explicit, and have also pointed out that if it should become necessary, South Africa can hit back hard. The President of Zambia also knows very well what our policy is in regard to our neighbouring states and to co-operation, and on what conditions we are prepared to co-operate with others. But I think it is high time he begins to realize that he is sounding a discordant note in Southern Africa, where good neighbourliness is being practised, where the principle of non-interference in the affairs of others is being respected, and where we do not dictate to others how they should solve their internal difficulties. I think that it is in Dr. Kaunda&#x2019;s interests to reconsider his attitude&#x2014;in the interests of his country and all its people. The time has come for the leaders of Africa to realize that it is no longer always possible to win the favour of others by inveighing against South Africa and condemning <span class="col_6325-6326" refersTo="page_0367"/>us, or to take the lead in the vendetta against South Africa, as in the case of the so-called liberation of others, or to provide headquarters or other forms of assistance to terrorists. If Dr. Kaunda wants to play the role of a statesman in Southern Africa&#x2014;and I believe that he is capable of doing so&#x2014;and if he wants to promote the interests of his own people and his own country he should rather abandon the methods of Dr. Nkrumah and should take his cue from other African leaders who are co-operating with us, and who do not hesitate to tell the world that they are co-operating with us and that they believe in peaceful co-existence. He should do this rather than try to stir up feelings against us. It is true that Dr. Kaunda has in fact tried to rectify what he said last week, but I want to say to him now that he must reconsider his position. He must reconsider whether he should not play a more constructive role in Southern Africa, and whether he should not follow a policy of good neighbourliness towards us and others.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Etosha, who has also apologized for his absence, rightly pointed out the importance of railway links between neighbouring states to the development and the promotion of good relations. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the possibility of constructing a railway-line between Livingstone and Grootfontein. Such a scheme would affect a large number of countries. For some it would entail great advantages as well as disadvantages, and for others perhaps disadvantages only. Before something of this nature could ever be considered, all the parties concerned would have to be consulted, and the co-operation of all of them would have to be obtained. But I think the hon. member will not expect the South African Government to become enthusiastic at this stage about such a scheme if Dr. Kaunda persists in the attitude he adopted last week.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point tried to be constructive. I appreciate that. He pleaded for a referendum to be held in South West Africa. But the extremists and the communists at U.N. have already shown repeatedly that it is not the wishes of the inhabitants of South West Africa that weigh heavily with them. They have proved quite clearly that it is not the interests&#x2014;I think the hon. member referred to self-determination&#x2014;of those inhabitants about which they are concerned. Their main objective is to expel South Africa there, come what may. On a previous occasion when a referendum was held they paid no heed to it. There is conclusive proof at the moment that virtually all the national groups in South West Africa are still on our side to-day. The leaders testify to this regularly and openly. They did so only last year when our Prime Minister visited most of them there. But these ring-leaders at the U.N. pay no heed to this either, because it simply does not suit them to do so. They will only be interested in the result of a referendum as long as that result will further their interests.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout put a question in regard to the expenditure of funds under the item &#x201C;Aid to and co-operation with foreign countries&#x201D;. This expenditure is of course not of a secret nature, and is subject to scrutiny by the Treasury and the Auditor-General. But I can inform the hon. member that these funds are being utilized mainly for technical aid, for example the provision of experts in many fields, the combating of diseases and plagues, the supply of drugs and medical equipment, the training of staff and experts, the rendering of assistance in regard to planning in general, and so forth. The hon. member also asked what the position was in respect of the final account in connection with the court case in The Hague. I may say that the costs amount to approximately R98O,OOO. I can only furnish an approximate amount, because all the accounts have not yet been finalized by the Paymaster-General.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) asked why there had been such a large reduction in the staff of our mission in London. In this regard I want to explain that the expansion of State purchases on the Continent of Europe in recent years has necessitated our having to expand our staff for this particular purpose on the Continent. Paris was chosen for this purpose. This entails a reduction in the number of administrative staff members who were previously used for this purpose in London. I may add that the diplomatic staff in London remains the same, and the mission in London remains one of the largest as far as purely diplomatic staff is concerned. The hon. member also referred to certain increases and decreases in expenses in the case of missions where the number of staff members remained the same. The explanation in this case is that the salaries of individual officials falling in the same grade vary quite considerably, because the scales are long ones. Some receive much more than others, although they are on the same scale. In addition, the allowances, which are included in this amount, depend upon factors such as the sizes of the families concerned, which fluctuate from one case to another.</p>

<p>Since I am now dealing with officials, I should like to make an announcement in regard to officials stationed abroad. I also want to avail myself of this opportunity to convey my sincere thanks to the Secretary of my Department and his staff, at head office and abroad for the hard work and faithful service which they have rendered under great pressure during the past year. My Department has indeed worked under very great pressure. They have acquitted themselves of their task very well indeed. Accordingly I am pleased to be able to announce here that officials stationed abroad will in future qualify for home leave in the Republic after three years of uninterrupted service abroad. The period used to be four years. The additional costs in this regard are exceptionally low. It amounts to R 18,000 for this year, because there are considerably more people who now qualify. But in future.</p>

<p><span class="col_6327-6328" refersTo="page_0368"/>once the scheme is in full swing, it will be considerably less. In addition I can announce that the existing concession as regards the travelling privileges of children studying in the Republic is being expanded to cover two return trips per child per financial year, provided that during the financial year in which the parents visit the Republic on home leave, the concession in respect of the children will be restricted to only one return trip per child. In view of the fact that exceptional circumstances may sometimes arise which will necessitate the presence of one of the parents in the Republic, provision has also been made for one annual visit to South Africa by one of the parents, in lieu of one of the annual visits of the children to their parents.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to statements which had been made by my respected Leader and Prime Minister in regard to the international position of South Africa. Let me say at once that the Prime Minister as well as I, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other members of the Government, have pointed out the encouraging progress which we have made in recent years in regard to our foreign relations. I think that hon. members will all agree with us that such progress has been made and is still being made. The entire world is impressed by this. But both the Prime Minister and I warned very specifically that as we progress, the onslaughts against South Africa will be intensified, that our enemies will become increasingly desperate and that their actions will become increasingly irresponsible. This is precisely what is happening. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to it. I must also remind hon. members of the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s international difficulties are of course in many cases being aggravated by factors which are entirely beyond our control. In view of all this, the hon. the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet have all along emphasized the need for us to resist onslaughts from abroad more firmly than ever before, and the need for us to display a united front to the outside world. I want to repeat that warning here to-day. I want to appeal to members on the other side to make it possible for South Africa to face these onslaughts unanimously. Only when this unanimity exists can we go to meet our uncertain future with determination and with confidence.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to bring two main headings to the attention of the hon. the Minister in the form of questions. First of all what is the Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to private enterprise and what is the Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to the Board of Trade report on retail price maintenance. I propose to deal firstly with the Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to private enterprise. I want to deal with this matter firstly in regard to the Industrial Development Corporation and secondly in regard to overseas businesses investing money in South Africa. I shall deal with the I.D.C. first. I would remind the hon. the Minister of the objects of the I.D.C. as set out in section I of Act No. 27 of 1942 which provides&#x2014;</p>

<p>The objects of the corporation shall be&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) with the approval of the Governor-General to establish and conduct any industrial undertaking; and</li>

<li>(b) to facilitate, promote, guide and assist in the financing of&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) new industries and industrial undertakings; and</li>

<li>(ii) schemes for the expansion, better organization and modernization of and the more efficient carrying out of operations in existing industries and industrial undertakings,</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">to the end that the economic requirements of the Union may be met and industrial development within the Union may be planned, expedited and conducted on sound business principles.</block>

<p>The Minister will see from these objects as set out in section 3 of the principal Act that the emphasis is on industrial development. I should like to say at the outset that I have no criticism of the directors of the I.D.C. and the I.D.C. itself in so far as it has assisted the development of industry. I think that there are many industries in this country which would not be where they are to-day had it not been for the Industrial Development Corporation and the expert advice given by their technical officers and the men in administrative positions. I do feel that the I.D.C. in recent years has had the tacit support of the Government in going beyond this main object of industrial development. As I have said the emphasis is on industrial development. Yet how can the hon. the Minister justify the I.D.C.&#x2019;s investment in mutual trust funds? How can the Minister say that it is in the interest of the country that the I.D.C.&#x2019;s management and technical staff, and as the hon. the Minister knows they have great difficulty in getting technical staff, should be used in the field of mutual funds and take a prominent part in funds of this kind? I do not want to mention the names of particular funds. The Minister will know the funds to which I am referring. I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister would at a later stage indicate whether he approves of this development of the I.D.C. entering into the field of every industry whether there is room for development or whether the development is adequate or not. One gets the impression that the I.D.C.&#x2019;s investigating staff, and they have young technical men qualified <span class="col_6329-6330" refersTo="page_0369"/>to investigate various schemes, are seeking to become executive officers and subsequently directors in the new companies taken over by the I.D.C. I cannot blame young men who wish to aspire to these executive positions but one gets the impression that the I.D.C. is empire building. Particularly in regard to the textile industry some of the leading figures in the textile industry fear that the I.D.C. can become one of their greatest competitors. I do not deny that the I.D.C. by its initiative has done a great deal to develop the textile industry. The textile industry would not be where it is to-day if it were not for the I.D.C. But has it gone far enough or has it gone too far? We do not get all the information. We get complaints from industry and when industry comes to us with these complaints there is a certain amount of fear on their part. They say: &#x201C;This is the information and we can assure you that it is correct but please do not mention our names.&#x201D; That is the unfortunate position in which the Opposition finds itself. On the other hand one does not want to mention the names of individual firms in this House. But that there is unrest and a certain amount of fear is obvious from the discussions we have had. When one goes overseas one is concerned about this position. As most South Africans who have business do, we encourage overseas firms to come and invest in South Africa. One is surprised on occasion when one hears what is said. They say: &#x201C;We have been advised by the overseas staff of various embassies that the best way to get our business into South Africa is to contact the Board of Trade and the I.D.C. If you can get the I.D.C. interested in your company and give them a share in your company and preferably give them a seat on the board you generally have a very clear field afterwards.&#x201D; That is another tendency which I have noticed in recent years, namely the tendency of the I.D.C. to demand a share of the equities. I do not think that it was ever intended that the I.D.C. should remain in many of the companies they have assisted. Companies come to them for a loan, the loan is granted after proper investigation and then the company goes about its business and subsequently repays its loan. I know of many companies which have been successful in this regard. In some cases the I.D.C. takes a quarter of the shares. In recent years there has been the tendency on the part of the I.D.C. to demand a share of the equities. My submission is that that is not their job. I submit that they should be mainly concerned with financing industry so that industry can get onto its feet. The I.D.C. is in recent years obviously being used as the instrument for putting into effect the Government&#x2019;s policy of border industries. I submit that the I.D.C. should only be concerned with economic development. In one particular case they have been used to clear up a mess. I know that in the case of Hammarsdale it was not the choice of the I.D.C. to have industrial development in that area. Industry had come to that area. It was badly planned and the facilities for industry there were not as they should have been and eventually in order to clear up the difficulties in that area the Government called in the I.D.C. After several years they were able to clear up the area. Now one of the last things being introduced into that area is Bantu housing whereas housing should have been one of the first things to be established when the factories were erected there. I will not go into that matter because it can be raised again later under the Bantu Administration Vote.</p>

<p>I do feel that it is time that the Minister should indicate whether he is satisfied with the present policy being followed by the I.D.C. or whether he does not think that he should review the situation because the policy followed by the I.D.C. in recent years indicates beyond any doubt at all that they are going beyond the original objects of the I.D.C. There is also a tendency to empire building which should be discouraged.</p>

<p>I come now to the next sub-head, namely the question of overseas concerns investing in this country. There have reoently been suggestions in the Press that overseas concerns which invest in this country should make a portion of the equities available to South Africans. Suggestions have been made along those lines and I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether that is the Government&#x2019;s policy or whether it is intended to be the Government&#x2019;s policy If there is any suggestion of forcing oversea countries to give equity to South African companies, I think that should be discouraged. I want to make it quite clear that I think oversea companies should give an equity to South Africans but it should not be by compulsion. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Notwithstanding everything which the hon. member for Pinetown said here this afternoon, things about which I disagree with him, it was still very gratifying to hear the hon. member for Pinetown also saying at this stage, &#x201C;Where would our industrial development in this country have been without the assistance of the I.D.C.&#x201D;. The fact of the matter is that since the days of the first Hertzog Government we have always encountered opposition from this Opposition and its predecessors to the establishment of our own industries in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>For that reason we are very gratified to hear the hon. member for Pinetown speaking with appreciation of what the I.D.C. has done to establish and promote our own industries in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member complained that overseas companies which want to establish industries in South Africa at the present time are actually being forced or that pressure is being brought to bear upon them to give a part of their equities as well as representation on their board of directors to the I.D.C. Sir, I have <span class="col_6331-6332" refersTo="page_0370"/>no fault to find with the I.D.C. obtaining a share of such industries. On two occasions we have witnessed that when such industries get into their stride, the I.D.C. is prepared to hand over its share to South African investors. We first witnessed this in the case of Industrial Selections, and we have just witnessed it again in the case of National Selections, and I can find nothing wrong with South Africans obtaining a share in this way in overseas companies which establish industries here. After all is said and done, it seems to me as though the obtaining of a share in those industries by the local people, is a very sound economic principle.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also complained about the assistance given by the I.D.C. to border industries. I can also find nothing wrong with that, because were it not for these border industries, we would easily have had a quarter of a million more Bantu in and around our cities in the past seven years. This is in exaot agreement with our policy that the influx of Bantu into our cities should be arrested as far as possible. I therefore find nothing wrong with the fact that everything is put into operation, including assistance from the I.D.C., for promoting those border industries as far as possible in order to arrest the influx of Bantu into our cities.</p>

<p>I now want to leave the hon. member for Pinetown at that, and I want to express my very great appreciation to the hon. the Minister and his two Departments which are under discussion at the moment, for the excellent progress which we have made with our exports. Over the past few years all kinds of measures have been applied by the authorities for assisting and promoting our exports, and these measures are now beginning to bear fruit. The latest import and export figures have just become available, and from these figures it appears that our imports during the first four months of this year amounted to R626.2 million and that our exports amounted to R527.6 million, which leaves an unfavourable trade balance of R98.8 million only as against R264.5 million for the. same four months last year, a tremendous improvement of R165.9 million on the position last year. This means that our imports last year were covered by exports to the extent of 61.1 per cent only and this year to the extent of more than 84 per cent. In view of the fact that our unfavourable trade balance is R98.6 million at the present time and that our gold production for the same period exceeded R250 million, it is clear that our balance of payments position is very favourable. We want to express our sincere gratitude to the hon. the Minister and his two Departments on this account and for all the measures for promoting export which were taken, in order to obtain this very favourable position.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to proceed and say a few words about the amount of R4 million which is being voted for the Department of Commerce as compensation to exporters in respect of the British devaluation in November 1967. I want to say in all modesty that I think that that R4 million will be too little, but I have every confidence that we may safely leave the matter in the hands of the hon. the Minister and the Government because they understand the position very well. I want to point out that I do have the figures for this year&#x2019;s exports, but because they have been given to me in confidence, I do not want to make use of them here across the floor of the House. For the purposes of my argument I shall therefore use last year&#x2019;s export figures. In the case of our deciduous fruit crop, a net amount of R30 million was earned in the United Kingdom last year. From that must be deducted R9 million in respect of freight and other charges between South Africa and Britain. This leaves a net amount of R21 million. If we take the 14.3 per cent devaluation into account, we find that the industry suffers a loss of R3 million through devaluation. For canned fruits, wine, brandy, etc., we can add another R3 million which brings the figure to at least R6 million, and this only relates to the export industries of the Western Cape which have, of course, been most severely hit by devaluation. This position will naturally improve in due course in view of the fact that the cost of living price index in Great Britain has already increased by 3.9 per cent since 18th November, the first six months after devaluation. This has the effect that prices increase so rapidly that we may expect that these price increases in Great Britain will eliminate devaluation losses after a few years have elapsed. But at present the exporters are very hard hit, and that is why I am courteously bringing these matters to the attention of the Minister. It is a fact that when we call upon our farmers outside not to be obsessed by Government aid alone, but rather to put everything possible into operation in order to improve efficiency, the accusation is hurled at us from the side of the Opposition that we are unsympathetic towards our exporters. This is not so, Sir. We want to appeal to the Opposition rather to assist us when we call upon our exporters to take efficiency to the highest level because a much greater threat than devaluation awaits us,, and. that is the possible entry of Great Britain into Euromart. That is a much greater threat to us, and in that case the Opposition will not >be able to reproach us that the Government is to blame for South Africa not devaluing and for exporters suffering a loss as a result.

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl who has just sat down seems to have been living in dreamland. I want to point out to him that the Industrial Development Act was first introduced in 1940, and to suggest that we have criticized the Industrial Development Act is, of course, sheer nonsense. What we have criticized is the fact that they <span class="col_6333-6334" refersTo="page_0371"/>have gone beyond their object, namely economic development. We reserve our right to criticize when we feel that the I.D.C. is going beyond its object of promoting economic development.</p>

<p>Sir, when I was interrupted by the time limit, I was dealing with the question of oversea concerns investing in South Africa. I hope that the hon. the Minister does not intend to compel firms which establish industries in this country to give some of the equity to South Africans. I hope he will encourage them to do so and I hope that he will encourage companies to invest in this country. We do not want to see oversea companies coming to this country, floating a company here with a token investment of R1,000, getting a large bank overdraft on the basis of a guarantee and then getting assistance from the Industrial Development Corporation so that they are virtually in a position of having very little real investment capital in this country. Thereafter when profits are made they repatriate those profits overseas, and if profits are not made they liquidate their liabilities. It may have the effect of disrupting the conomy when they leave suddenly after finding that their venture is not successful. That kind of development is not healthy for the country. Sir, I mention this because one gets the impression sometimes that the Government&#x2019;s object in recent years has been to go in the direction of self-sufficiency. We would like to know whether that is the Government&#x2019;s object, because we do not want to see industries developed in this country which cannot eventually stand on their own feet against the outside world. Companies which have to be subsidized or unduly protected for an indefinite period because their products cannot compete in the world markets, can in the long run become an embarrassment to this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I am surprised to read in the report of the I.D.C. that they recently started a venture in tea production in this country. On page 23 of the report they say that they started in the northern Transvaal but suffered a setback because of the severity of three years&#x2019; drought. Then they started another scheme in Zululand where they have had similar difficulties because of droughts. Sir, anybody who knows anything about tea will know that there have been many failures before in this country in the tea market. The world&#x2019;s leading tea people have never regarded South Africa as a teaproducing country because one of the main essentials for a teaproducing country is cheap peasant female labour, and in the areas in which the I.D.C. has established this industry, the required factors are not present, apart from the climatic conditions.</p>

<p>Then one sees later on in the report that they have ventured into the chemical industry, through Sentrachem. They have acquired the entire issued capital of Carboohem. Klipfontein Organic Products, National Chemical Products and Synthetic Rubber Company. Our surprise is based on the fact that the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor was very eloquent about the necessity of disposing of Klipfontein Organic Produots and handing it back to private industry. Klipfontein Organic Products was started by the United Party Government during the war years, and afterwards the Government persuaded us that it was necessary to sell it to private enterprise and now we find that it is an industrial Development Corporation venture. When does this beoome private enterprise and when does it become a Government venture? Then we find the I.D.C. interested in a new oil company, in developing oil with Iran and Total. If that is for strategic reasons then I can understand it. Is it for economic reasons that the I.D.C. is coming into this or are there not enough petrol companies? I hope the Minister will give us the reason for that venture.</p>

<p>But Sasol is in it. That is where we lose the string. The I.D.C. holds all the shares in Sasol, but of course it is not the I.D.C. we cannot get the end of the string under this remote control where we have no control by Parliament. That is what concerns us. When things go wrong, we do not know anything about it. Then things can be covered up. Talking about things going wrong, some years ago I put it to the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor whether he was considering a reexamination of the capital structure of Sasol. In the early years of Sasol a lot of capital was lost, some R25 million, I think it was. I asked whether the time had not arrived for the capital structure of Sasol to be reexamined with a view to writing off that capital which was lost and which had been experimental.</p>

<p>I come now to the other matter to which I referred in my earlier speech, and that is the, Minister&#x2019;s policy in regard to retail price maintenance. We have had a Board of Trade report and the recommendations were, in regard to retail price maintenance, that it was opposed to it because&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It limits the degree of competition which would enable customers to express a preference for a different price at the distributive level, and prevents some dealers and manufacturers from passing on the benefits of cost reductions to the public; (b) on balance it raised prices and profit margins and,promotes over-trading; (c) it impairs the efficiency of the individual firm and of the I economy as a whole; (d) it has the effect <span class="col_6335-6336" refersTo="page_0372"/>of slowing down the development of new methods of distribution; and (e) it has discriminating effect in so far as consumers who do not want certain services, mostly the lower income groups, have to subsidize those who want them, or in the case where the services are not rendered, the retailer.</block>

<p>This report refers to retail price maintenance, but what is the Minister&#x2019;s attitude to other price arrangements with regard to certain industries? I do not want to mention the industries, but I think it is well known that in certain industries they have a price arrangement, and the price arrangement is either known to the Minister&#x2019;s Department and is tacitly approved or it is encouraged by the Minister&#x2019;s Department. I should like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is in regard to not only retail price maintenance, but price agreements which keep a price within a ring and all those in the ring benefit and all those outside the ring are discouraged or squeezed and are eventually eliminated from business. I think those are matters which concern the public, particularly at a time when people are complaining about increased costs, and I suggest that if the Minister is opposed to retail price maintenance we would like to know by what logic he supports other price maintenances in other fields, and to what extent he regards this as being in the public interest.</p>

<p>Ten minutes is a very short time and I do not think the hon. member for Pinetown will expect me to follow up his arguments.</p>

<p>I want to deliver a serious plea to-day for the further economic development of the border areas of the Transkei and the Ciskei, in other words, as it is called in English, the Border, i.e. the area of King William&#x2019;s Town. Queenstown and East London.</p>

<p>I shall still come to that hon. member. He must just exercise a little patience. The Transkei is the first Bantu homeland which we placed on the road to self-government and it will be followed to an increasing extent along that road by the Ciskei. I think that it is very important for the success of our policy that political development go hand in hand with economic development. I think that the political development will be so much more successful if there is comparable economic development, in other words, if there is work for these people, if there is an income for them, and if there is satisfaction.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>We want to keep as many people as possible in the Transkei and the Ciskei. That is our policy. We must in any case try to accommodate the natural increase in the population within the homeland and also within the white neighbouring areas. Now I want to say that the towns of the border are to-day experiencing a very great, and I can almost say a tremendous, pressure of numbers. I come from there and I know what I am talking about. There are many black people. We are trying to keep them there as much as possible, but they are increasing rapidly and, not that it is the Government&#x2019;s fault, but opportunities for employment are not keeping pace with the labour needs in those parts. My clear, direct and very serious request to the hon. the Minister to-day, is that the Government should help us in this area and that additional industrial incentive measures should be introduced for this area. The present measures were sufficient in other areas where the other additional circumstances were favourable, such as at Pretoria and in Natal, to launch border area development there. It has also helped in our area and we are grateful for the development which there already is, but I should like to tell the Minister that a special effort is necessary to establish and develop really strong industrial complexes in the Border. [Interjection.] The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town is really very impatient; I am coming to him. This incentive must especially, in my opinion, be aimed at giving assistance as regards the transportation of industrial goods to the major consumer centres. Experience has shown that the present 10 per cent rebate is not quite sufficient for that area, which is so far removed from our large consumer centres. This is actually my entire request and I just want to repeat that I am to-day pleading for the border, for Queenstown, King William&#x2019;s Town and East London, for that whole area. The need for that exists and the time, in my opinion, is now very ripe. I think that this can only be achieved in one way and that is that for a shorter or a longer period strong additional incentive measures must be applied in order to attract industrialists there. I am asking for this because other persons who ought to do so, are not doing so. That is why I am now delivering this plea. What do they do? The hon. member for East London challenged me and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town laughed at me, but what do they do? They make fun of it. They decry those efforts. They run down what has been achieved and make fun of it. They discourage the industrialist from going there and they make the white worker on the Witwatersrand apprehensive. [Interjections.] They delight in the so-called failure.</p>

<p>I shall come to that as well. The hon. member for Yeoville stood up in this House this year and this is what he said, and I find it a great joke. He said (Hansard. 1968, Col. 82)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(Then I went to the actual reserves; I went to the Transkei. There I stayed for a week with my hon. friend, the hon. memher <span class="col_6337-6338" refersTo="page_0373"/>for Transkei, and we looked for one border industry, one border town, along the borders of the largest, the only consolidated Bantustan in South Africa, and guess what we found? Nothing.</block>

<p>And then the hon. member for Transkei spoke and he said (Col. 94)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this development of border industries has then been so successful, name one such industry.</block>

<p>He said: &#x201C;Just name a new industry which was started in East London,&#x201D; and then the hon. member for Yeoville said: &#x201C;Why are you so inarticulate now?&#x201D; Here it is on page 95 of Hansard No. I of this year. Those hon. members for Transkei and Yeoville rode around for a week and they did not find one industry, but they had so little confidence in the hon. members for East London (North), East London (City) and King William&#x2019;s Town that they did not go and ask them. He rides around for a week and cannot find one industry and he challenges us across the floor of the House to name one. Here is a letter from the Town Clerk of East London in which he says that in

1964 four new industries were established, and he mentions their names, in 1965 two&#x2014;time will not permit me to mention all of them&#x2014; in 1966 six, and in 1967 five. Then he says: &#x201C;The value of building plans passed for extensions to existing industries&#x201D; is as follows, and then he gives the figures for 1962, 1963 and 1964, when it was more than R1 million: in 1965 it was almost R2 million; in 1966 it was R1.25 million, and in 1967 it was R616,000. He said that they sold land to 25 existing industries for development, but as far as new industries are concerned, the industries which those hon. members could not find in a week, in connection with which they had so little faith in their two colleagues there that they did not even go and ask them, because they probably did not know about it, there were 17 industries &#x2026;</p>

<p>Look, the Transkei and the Ciskei complexes are continuous and this industrial area of which I am speaking is situated nearby. Here the hon. member mentioned Queenstown, but Queenstown is not a border industry area of the Transkei. [Interjections.] If the hon. member says that, he knows nothing. Queenstown is a border industry area on Glen Grey, which forms part of the Ciskei. The Transkei and the Ciskei are in one area and the border industry development in that area is one concept. I am pleading for that area because the hon. members who sit here and should do so, are not doing so; because they try to run down the concept and make South Africa apprehensive about it, not only the industrialists, but also the white workers; and because they try to ridicule it and delight in what they call failures, while there has already been considerable progress and while the <i>Daily Despatch</i> wrote a month or two ago about &#x201C;East London&#x2019;s Golden Mile&#x201D;. Since this policy was introduced, something is at least happening in East London, King William&#x2019;s Town and Queenstown to a certain extent, but I repeat that it is not enough. Therefore I am pleading to-day for a major and strong step forward for the establishment of an industrial complex in that area, in the interests of that area, in the interests of the inhabitants of the Transkei and the Ciskei and in the interests of the policy which we want to implement in respect of the non-Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is with great pleasure that I welcome the conversion of the hon. member for Queenstown, or shall I say reconversion. It is with great joy that we hear him pleading the case of the United Party, the case which we have put over and over again, namely that of finding jobs for people who are displaced as a result of Government policy. The hon. member referred here to a speech by the hon. member for Yeoville. He ought to have known that the hon. member for Yeoville was dealing with the Transkei and that he was speaking of a tour of the Transkei when he asked the question: Where are the border industries on the borders of the Transkei? Are the people going to live in the Transkei and work in East London every day&#x2014;this never-never idea of living in your own country while every morning you cross the border to go and work in the white man&#x2019;s land and then again at night you go and sleep with your family. Are they going to work in East London and sleep at home every night? Is that his idea of border industries for the Transkei? What he said is of course right. There are many other people who agree with him. I want to quote from a Chambers of Commerce journal of March, 1968&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The appeal was to support fully our claim that the removal of Africans from various areas to areas such as ours should be closely followed by a workable plan to employ these people, as thousands are moved to these areas without any provision for work or means of subsistence.</block>

<p>How often have we been saying that? How often have we been warning of the danger of moving people out of places where there is work and creating a workless proletariate with nothing to do. At last we have a convert. We have a member who supports us in our pleas. I remember some five, six or seven years ago when I spoke in East London. I warned that this dream of the Nationalist Party of solving the problems of development by their border area scheme would not work. I warned that this was pie in the sky. And who attacked me? That hon. member and his colleagues, plus the Chamber of Industry, the Border Development Corporation, the East London City <span class="col_6339-6340" refersTo="page_0374"/>Council, the <i>Daily Despatch,</i> and everyone else.</p>

<p>I was hammered and particularly by Robbie de Lange. I was hammered, hammered from every quarter because I dared to suggest that the border industry scheme would not solve the problems of economic development in that area. And now I get the hon. member for Queenstown supporting that which I got hammered for saying five or six years ago. It is now simply proven that what we have said all along is a fact. Listen to what another spokesman for industry says in the &#x201C;Commercial Opinion&#x201D; of September, 1967. I read the following short extracts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The border area development programme is being hampered by red tape &#x2026;<br/>&#x2026; the complicated procedure involved in obtaining recognition as a border industry, including the preparation of voluminous memoranda.</block>

<p>These were the things complained of. I go on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said that the formalities were so complicated that they could be regarded as a formidable deterrent to the establishment of border industries.</block>

<p>I have other quotations here. It is not working and it is not solving the problems. And I am glad that that hon. member realizes it and comes out now ana admits it.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the moment or two that I have left I want to make two pleas to the hon. the Minister. The one is for a simplification of the customs tariff. When we raised problems with the hon. the Minister of Finance, the Deputy Minister correctly pointed out that the tariff schedules are drawn up by the Board of Trade. They recommend protection and the Departments of Finance and Customs simply take over those definitions and incorporates them into the Customs Act. But this Customs Act has become an impenetrable jungle, as I have said under a previous vote. And I plead with the hon. the Minister to take steps to ask the Board of Trade to reconsider the whole position and to try and simplify the whole issue. I know the problems of the Brussels Agreement. I know the problems of protecting specific industries. But I also know that it should be possible to overcome these problems. I therefore plead with the hon. the Minister to tackle this problem of a simplified customs tariff. In the second place I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to intercede with this Government. An industrialist to-day is absolutely throttled by a multiplicity of controls. If he wants to start a factory he has to go to the Department of Planning, he has to go to Bantu Affairs, to Labour, to Community Development for a building permit, to Commerce and Industry for water and other things, and to the Minister of Finance if there is any exchange control. He has to go to department after department and official after official. And to-day industrialists are becoming intimidated by this multiplicity of control. I want to congratulate the few industrial leaders who have had the courage to come out and criticize the things that are harming industry in South Africa. But equally I want to criticize those that are so darn scared of opening their mouths that they have allowed themselves to be treated like doormats and to be trampled on by the regulations, rules and the myriad army of officials who to-day control the life of industry. I think that those who have come out deserve our congratulations. I believe that industrialists themselves should speak up for their rights and try and oppose this slow strangling of free enterprise in South Africa by the growing monster of bureaucracy which is to-day taking over the whole of our economic and industrial life. There is no industry in South Africa to-day which is not dependent for its very existence upon the whim of officialdom, whether it be job reservation, labour regulations, or whether it be one thing or another. From morning to night whole staffs of clerical people have got to become experts in the millions of regulations which cover them. And if the hon. the Minister really wants to see industry go forward, if he really wants to see progress, then he should take a stand with his own Government. He should take a stand with his own Government and fight, not for more restrictions, more regulations, but for the removal of restrictions and the freeing of the spirit of true private enterprise. Finally, the hon. member for Paarl said that this side of the House has always opposed industrial development. I have here a circular issued on the 2nd February, 1968, by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. It lists 14 Acts administered by his department in regard to industry. Of those 14 Acts 12 are the work of the United Party. The Monopolistic Conditions Act is a new one. There are a number of consolidated ones, re-enacted from previous Acts. In fact the only new one is the Monopolies Act. The others were all United Party legislation. In other words, the whole structure on which industry to-day exists, namely 13 of the 14 laws under which industry functions and operates to-day, were the work of the United Party Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to bring a certain matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Because my time is so limited, I cannot follow the example set by the previous hon. member. However, I shall try not to blow up a minor matter to such an extent that the Minister can cause it to burst by pricking it with a pin as was the case with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. I want to speak in pursuance of an article which appeared in <i>Tegniek</i> and which dealt with Iscor and the export of pig-iron and in which it was alleged that approximately 500 million tons of pig-iron will be exported during the next 30 years from the Sishen-Postmasburg complex, where it is alleged an estimated 4,300 million tons of reserve deposits exist, as well as in pursuance of a report which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> and in which it was stated that Iscor wanted to convey ore to the coast by means of a pipeline. In view of these ore deposits and the possibility of exporting pig-iron, we naturally have to look for methods or means to convey such pig-iron to the coast or to a port. One way of conveying this ore, is of course to rail it. Another alternative which is now being investigated, is conveyance by means of a pipeline. The hon. the Minister himself said that this aspect as regards the conveyance of pig-iron by means of a pipeline in which water would be used, was still being investigated at that stage. There are three places where the ore could possibly be conveyed to by means of a pipeline, namely Richard&#x2019;s Bay on the east coast, Saldanha Bay and also Buchu Berg Bay. But if we listened to the speech made by the Deputy Minister of Water Affairs in which he said that South Africa would have exceeded the total potential of its available water sources towards the year 2000, one asked oneself whether there was an adequate supply of water in South Africa to convey the ore in this manner. Another aspect as regards a pipeline, is the fact that it is an expensive undertaking as well as the fact that no secondary development can take place along this pipeline. For this reason I should like to make out a case for the conveyance of the pig-iron by rail. This will not only be a method of conveying the pig-iron, but it can promote the development of the country at the same time. This is probably the best alternative. When thinking in terms of the conveyance of pig-iron by rail, one thinks of ports on both the western and eastern side of our country. When considering the Sishen-Post-masburg complex one finds that the latter is connected with a port such as Port Elizabeth, which is already overcrowded to-day. It is felt that a port must be found somewhere along the west coast and I am aware of the fact that a deep-sea port has to be found. Saldanha Bay was also mentioned as a possibility. If the pipeline cannot be used as an alternative method of conveyance, one thinks in terms of conveyance by rail. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister this friendly request to-day, and that is that Luderitz Bay should also be considered when this matter is being investigated. I should like to advance my reasons for this request. When consideration was given to ports along the west coast, the name of Buchu Berg was mentioned. But the hon. the Minister of Transport gave a clear reply to the effect that it would be too expensive at that stage to establish a port at Buchu Berg. He mentioned the amount of R170 million in respect of the railway line and R30 million in respect of the port. This amounts to approximately R200 million, which is very expensive. But when one thinks in terms of an alternative port along the west coast, I think Luderitz Bay is a very suitable place. In the first place, I just want to mention that Luderitz has very deep water. At Sheer Water Bay, for example, one finds deep water within a small distance from the coast. The second aspect I want to stress, is the fact that when Postmasburg is to be linked with Upington, a railway line 120 miles long will have to be built. This is much shorter than a linking-up with Buchu Berg. From Upington a railway line goes directly through South West Africa to Luderitz. Over and above the fact that such a railway line will be able to convey the pig-iron, it may also bring about enormous secondary development for those parts in the south of South West Africa and the North Western Cape. The other argument which was advanced, namely that such a railway line would not be economic because it would have no return traffic, can be ruled out because development is going to take place there. Because a larger area can be served, there will be return traffic. Another advantage attached to this project as far as South West Africa is concerned, is that the route from South West Africa to Johannesburg will be shortened by plus-minus 150 miles. For this reason I should like to avail myself of this opportunity of stressing the fact that Luderitz should also be taken into consideration when this matter is investigated. There are sound reasons for doing so. In summary, we already have a railway line there. The aspect of costs will therefore be much less. Such a linking will serve a larger area. From a strategic point of view, <span class="col_6343-6344" refersTo="page_0376"/>with a slightly larger port and more development Luderitz will mean a great deal more to the west coast because it is centrally situated on the coast. For this reason I should like merely to mention this to the hon. the Minister and to make representations to him in all friendliness that Luderitz should also be considered as a possible alternative, as a port to which this ore may be transported, together with all the advantages attached to it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to comment on the appeal of the hon. member for Karas for certain local interests, which he quite rightly brings before this House, but I do want to say the following. We, like the hon. member, are becoming concerned about the question of our iron exports. We believe that we are losing ground to other countries, particularly perhaps to Australia, on the long-term supply of iron ore to the Far East. We believe that to a large extent this is due to the fact that our rail rates are high, and that adequate facilities for moving the iron to port of export are not satisfactory. Port facilities leave much to be desired if we are going to really develop, over the next 10 to 20 years, large exports of iron ore. I hope the hon. the Minister will use his influence with the Minister of Transport, particularly to see if this matter cannot be planned on a longterm basis. We shall deal with this more fully when we come to the Mining Vote, when we will take up the matter with the bon. the Minister of Mines.</p>

<p>But I want to turn to a completely different issue, namely the question of the Kennedy Round. On the 15th March this year the hon. the Minister issued a statement on the Kennedy Round negotiations, in which we were told that the British Government had informed the South African Government, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That it intended to expedite, in collaboration with the Governments of other leading trading countries, which have also undertaken to grant tariff reductions in the Kennedy Round negotiations, the implementation of its concessions in an effort to persuade the American Government not to revert to the introduction of import and other trade restrictions in order to alleviate the pressure on the United States&#x2019; balance of payments. This accelerated implementation of the British tariff reductions would, therefore, have been subject to an undertaking on the part of the American Government not to introduce import and other trade restrictions which may seriously jeopardize British export earnings and, indeed, the world trade in general.</block>

<p>That statement, as I say, was issued by the hon. the Minister on the 15th March. We know that during the Kennedy Round discussions which took place last year, the participating countries agreed to tariff reductions by two alternative methods. The first was a reduction by five equal annual instalments, beginning on the 1st January, 1968; or alternatively, two-fifths of the reduction on the 1st July, 1968, followed by three annual reductions, beginning on 1st January, 1970. It seems quite clear from the statement issued by the hon. the Minister, to which I have already referred, that Great Britain chose the second formula. In other words, she would have introduced tariff reductions commencing on July, 1968, with the final reduction in January, 1972. Now we are told that in an endeavour to get the United States not to reintroduce import and other trade restrictions, Britain and other leading nations have offered to reduce their tariff by 40 per cent as from the 1st July, 1968, which of course was Great Britain&#x2019;s original intention and the remainder, 60 per cent of the reductions, by 1st January, 1969&#x2014;that is the 1st of the coming year&#x2014; thus anticipating the final reductions of tariff, based on the Kennedy Round negotiations, by nearly two years. Now, Mr. Chairman, it is nearly two months since the hon. the Minister issued his statement. Since then we have heard nothing further, at least not to my knowledge. I have seen no further reports or statements. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon whether there have been any further developments in this matter. Has the United States accepted the offer from Britain and the other leading nations to expedite tariff reductions in exchange for the United States agreeing not to go ahead with her re-imposition of restrictive trade measures?</p>

<p>I think the House would also like to know who are the other leading countries, to whom the hon. the Minister referred. He mentioned Great Britain &#x201C;and other leading countries&#x201D;, but we are quite in the dark as to whom the &#x201C;other leading countries&#x201D; are. I presume the hon. the Minister and his advisers have taken cognizance of the GATT rules and regulations and that they are satisfied that What the United States proposes to do is consistent with article 12 of GATT&#x2019;s rules. Of course, we all know that the GATT regulations seem to be very strange within themselves. It seems that practically anybody can do anything they like under GATT&#x2019;s rules, and then another nation has the right merely to inquire why they have done it. There does not seem to be any stronger remedy, particularly in reference to this type of restrictions, but perhaps the hon. the Minister could tell us that he is satisfied that the spirit of GATT is being adhered to. Now we know that the United States have a balance of payments problem, and GATT makes provision for this. But we would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he is satisfied. as I have said, that the spirit of the agreement is being adhered to.</p>

<p>Another matter I would like to inquire from the hon. the Minister is how we stand in relation to Great Britain in regard to bound <span class="col_6345-6346" refersTo="page_0377"/>preferences which we have with the British Governmènt. How are we affected if this new situation arises? The hon. the Minister, when he spoke on the Commerce and Industry Vote last year, said the following in Hansard (volume 21, column 5951)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most important implication these negotiations has for South Africa (this is the Kennedy Round negotiations), apart from the possible benefits that may be derived from the tariff reductions of the developed countries for our export trade, is the reduction of preferential tariffs on the British market, which will result from the British Government&#x2019;s linear tariff cut. It is clear that any reductions in the British mostfavoured-nation customs duties will bring about a narrowing of the margin between these tariffs and the lower preferential tariffs. The attitude we adopt to this matter has already been stated clearly and fully to the British Government. Our approach to this matter is, that, if the British offer of a linear tariff cut were to lead at the negotiations to a reduction of those preferences which are valuable to our export trade with Britain, the British Government has to support us in our attempts at obtaining adequate compensation for these preferential reductions by way of reducing the customs duties in respect of other developed countries or products essential to our export trade.</block>

<p>That is a good statement, and one which we subscribe to fully. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether we are to receive compensation from the British Government as. he mentioned last year, and furthermore. if these tariff reductions are going to be anticipated by two years, as mentioned in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement, whether he is going to ask the British Government for further compensation. Because, as I understand, the Kennedy Round was an arrangement made by all the nations who were present, and it seems to me that this is a radical change by one of these parties to the negotiations.</p>

<p>I think the House would also like to know, irrespective of whether the conditions mentioned in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement will come about or not, whether the hon. the Minister is satisfied that we in South Africa have taken sufficient steps to meet the conditions which we will have to face as a result of the Kennedy Round reductions. We would like to know this whether the reductions are going to be anticipated by two years, or whether they are going to take their normal course. They are obviously going to affect us. I know that the hon. the Minister and his Department has been in touch with industry in this regard. But there are two aspects to this matter as the hon. Minister rightly said. The one concerns what we will lose by the loss of our preferences with Great Britain, but secondly and perhaps as important are the benefits we may gain by a general reduction in tariffs. I should like the hon. the Minister particularly to tell us what steps we are taking to see that South African goods are going to get into those countries where we will enjoy new benefits.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown will probably excuse me if I do not follow him. The Minister is in a far better position to reply to the questions the hon. member put to him. It really is a pity that every time we have a debate on economic affairs the debate is not used to promote economic affairs throughout the Republic. The Opposition only wants to try to concentrate the economy of the country in certain parts of the Republic, particularly in those parts where such concentration is already aggravated by traffic congestion which causes much disruption and where we are already finding it very difficult to-day to establish proper routes of communication, where our electricity supply already cannot provide in all the needs and where our water supply so creates many problems. When the National Party comes forward with a policy which is applied not only in the Republic, but also in all the major Western countries, namely to decentralize industries, the United Party always tries to belittle this great task, which is definitely not an easy task, and to look down upon it and to cast suspicion on it. We had the point of view of the hon. member for Durban (Point) a moment ago. The hon. member said that no progress was being made as far as border industries were concerned. In this connection I would like to read an extract from an article entitled &#x201C;Demand for Border Area Sites&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development of South Africa&#x2019;s border areas&#x2014;the Government plan for developing regions where the large African population can have employment near to their homelands&#x2014;is progressing well, says the Netherlands Bank in its &#x201C;Economic Bulletin&#x201D;.<br/>During 1964 the permanent committee for the location of industry and the development of border areas&#x2014;which was formed in 1960&#x2014;received 127 applications for sites in the areas of which 61 had been approved by the end of the year. Since mid 1960, 60 new industrial undertakings have been established while 33 have expanded their activities.</block>

<p>It is stated further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Combined they represent a fixed capital investment of more than R65 million and provide additional employment for about 24,000, of whom 19,000 are Africans.</block>

<p><span class="col_6347-6348" refersTo="page_0378"/>When we go further, we find that this year that fixed capital investment amounts to R220 million in 12 of those areas. Is this not progress? Is this not sufficient proof to the hon. members that the Government takes a serious view in respect of this problem? When the hon. member for Queenstown points out to the Government where a bottle-neck exists in that area, he is sneered at instead of our coming forward to help the Government in this matter.</p>

<p>Not all of us are satisfied with the progress which is being made. But if we want to bring this to the notice of the Government, it must not be construed for one moment that we are running away from our policy, because it is our task to bring those bottle-necks to the notice of the Government. I would like to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his department on the excellent report of the I.D.C. I also want to congratulate them on the excellent report of the permanent committee for the location of industries and the development of our border areas. In this report the officials do not hide their troubles. They state that something more should be done about this matter. Where else should this matter of obtaining this greater assistance be discussed than here in this very Parliament? Now I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. It is stated in the report that since 1960, 706 applications were received for assistance in connection with the location and the development of industries in the border areas. The report states that 706 applications were received, 326 of which were either withdrawn or rejected; 342 applications were approved while 38 applications are still under consideration.</p>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister to tell us why these 342 applications were withdrawn. Were they withdrawn because these people did not meet the requirements they had to comply with for them to go to a border area, or were they located in another area which did not qualify as a border area? I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me the reason for this. I also notice from the report that there are certain places in the border areas which are receiving the maximum assistance from the department to-day. The places mentioned were for example East London, King William&#x2019;s Town, Queenstown, etc. But has the time not come that, in the light of the knowledge and information the permanent committee has today, the assistance which is being offered to these areas is probably not enough and that we shall probably have to look for other means to make sure that we can attract the industries to those areas? I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that we should not concentrate too much on one particular place, even if it is a border area with industries, but that we should carry out a thorough investigation of all our industries throughout the Republic. We must also create growing points and not only at one place, but in all of the 62 areas which were proclaimed border areas. If those means are not sufficient and if better inducements have to be given, we would like to ask the Minister to introduce such inducements because the future of South Africa depends on the development of border areas, i.e. whether South Africa will be able to develop in an orderly fashion as an industrial giant. We cannot allow one area to develop at the expense of another. Neither can we allow one area to receive greater benefits than another.</p>

<p>We want to plead with the hon. the Minister that if he thinks it necessary for greater inducement to be given to, for example, Queenstown or Indwe such inducement should, in fact, be given. But if we consider the example we have in Natal, we do not think that Natal needs any encouragement because, and I want to be quite emphatic about this, in my humble opinion Natal has everything. Natal has the labour and the material and it is well situated. [Interjections.] Natal also has a Sap Provincial Administration. I want to be serious about this matter. We should not treat this debate as a political football, but should rather put our minds together to ensure that our country will be developed properly in the interests of both Whites and non-Whites. We can develop only if we have a satisfied labour force, and if we take the factories to the labour force, as we are doing in terms of our policy of the development of border areas, we shall, in fact, establish a satisfied labour force. This is important. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Mr. W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan has done exactly the reverse of what was done by the hon. member for Queenstown. The latter started off with a most interesting speech and in the course of it said many things with which we can agree. He at least has heeded the warning given in this House by my leader when he warned the Government that they should be beware that eoonomic development in the Bantu areas does not outstrip political development. I am very pleased that at least the hon. member for Queenstown now subscribes to this view. But thereafter the hon. member started to play politics. The hon. member for Brakpan started off with that and yet later made a plea for us to make this a responsible debate in the interest of South Africa. He started off by saying that we on this side of the House had opposed all principles of decentralization. Let me say here and now that that is not true. On the contrary&#x2014; the United Party has always stood for decentralization provided, of course, it was economic. We stand for decentralization where it is economically politic. But unfortunately the Nationalist Party has come with decentralization where it is politically economic. The hon. member referred to the reports of the Netherlands Bank in which reference is made to the permanent committee. I shall deal with that report a little later. The hon. member, however, said that this report showed that for an investment of R65 million employment had <span class="col_6349-6350" refersTo="page_0379"/>been created for 19,000 Bantu. These were the 1964 figures. He went on to refer to a capital investment of R296 million. That, I think, must be the 1966 figure at which time we had an employment figure, as far as Bantu were concerned, of 44,000. He also mentioned that it was time now to do a comprehensive survey to decide where any new development should take place. Well, I submit this is what should have been done at the beginning, in 1960, before starting all this haphazard development, because this development has in fact been haphazard, unplanned and unco-ordinated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan asked why so many applications were withdrawn or discarded. That is a question I too should like to put to the hon. the Minister. But to the hon. member for Brakpan I want to suggest reasons for at least some of those withdrawals, and should like to ask the hon. the Minister to say what his plans are in this regard. Here I want particularly to refer to Hammarsdale. Industrial development in Hammarsdale started in 1959 and has gone on apace since then until two years ago. Plus-minus 5,000 Bantu are in employment there at the moment. But, as I have said, for the past two or three years there has been no development there&#x2014;no more industries and no further employment opportunities. When I investigated this I found that the I.D.C. set out to create 5,000 employment opportunities at Hammarsdale.</p>

<p>This was based on a survey carried out in 1957-&#x2019;58, which showed that there were approximately 5,000 employable people in that area. They have now attained that target, but what has happened in the meantime as a result of this Government&#x2019;s policy? We find that the Bantu population, according to the figures of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, have gone up from 12,500 to over 45,000. Does the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs know this? Is his department aware of this? I believe that they have no intention of allowing any further industrial development in that area. This has been said to me and the rumour is very strong. I want to know from the hon. the Minister to-day what his policy is in regard to Hammarsdale. Is that border industrial area going to be expanded any further? We have the position to-day that there are over 20.000 employable Bantu of whom 15,000 are looking for jobs. They are people who have been attracted to that area by this Government&#x2019;s policy and for whom the hon. the Deputy Minister, who is making so much noise, is providing housing. He is not making provision for only 45.000, but for 60.000 Bantu. This is what I mean when I say that it is unplanned and unco-ordinated. Here are the Three Blind Mice going ahead and bringing more people into the area, while this hon. Minister, if rumour is correct, has stopped any further industrial development. There are no plans for any further industrial development. I would like to have an answer to that question from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan also referred to the report of the Permanent Committee. I am horribly confused by authoritative reports which have been given by this Government. The report of the Permanent Committee which was issued last year on its activities from 1960 to the end of 1966 gave as employed in the border areas a total of 57,100 people of whom 44,600 were Bantu. I, as many other people, accepted this as being the authoritative figure. The <i>South African Digest</i> of 12th April, 1968, reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1960, 55,000 Bantu were employed in the industrial sector in border and Bantu areas. Since then this figure has increased by 49,000 compared with an increase of 161,000 Bantu in the industry of the country as a whole.</block>

<p>That brings the total to 104,000 Bantu who should be employed in the border industries to-day according to that report. In the report I received to-day from the department of the hon. the Minister it says on page 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1960, 55,000 Bantu were employed in the border and Bantu areas. This figure has since increased by 49,000, compared with an increase of 161,000 for the country as a whole.</block>

<p>This is the same statement as is made in the <i>South African Digest,</i> but which is completely in conflict with the facts as given to us by the report of this same committee last year. Last year they said that at the end of 1966 there were only 44,600 in employment. This report now says that in 1960. six years before, there were already 55,000. Who are they misleading? Why are they misleading? Are these statements deliberately designed to mislead the people outside? These are the answers we want. Everybody is quiet now.</p>

<p>The date of the <i>Digest</i> is 12th April, 1968. These are the questions which require answering. I want to go further and say that this policy is failing and has failed. In the same report on page 2, it is said that the potential of additional Bantu males coming available in the Bantu areas for the labour market during the period 1960 to 1970 is estimated at an average of 35.000 per annum. That should be the target of this hon. Minister and the hon. the Deputy Minister. The target should be 35,000 jobs per annum, <span class="col_6351-6352" refersTo="page_0380"/>that should have been created since 1960. At the moment we have a backlog of over 150,000 jobs in the border areas. We have heard hon. members say how pleased they are at the development which is taking place. Admittedly, some development has taken place. Can they sit complacently by, however, and say that they are pleased and congratulate the hon. the Minister for the development which has taken place?</p>

<p>No, not necessarily. What other employment opportunities are there in the border areas? I know that the hon. the Minister will come with the same story as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and say that these jobs generate others. He arrived at a figure of something over one million at one stage when he really was eloquent and got carried away with his own verbosity on this subject. He claimed that there were over one million employment opportunities created by these border industries. I deny this categorically. I have seen them and I know that there are very few other employment opportunities in the border areas.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) asked certain questions in connection with figures and I do not want to reply to those questions. What he did say and what was new to me, was that the United Party, who opposed border area development so vehemently throughout the years they have been sitting here as Opposition, was also going to act as champions for the policy of border area development. There was a debate which lasted for days last year when the Physical Planning Act was under discussion. The whole object of that Act was in point of fact to empower the Government to restrict the further extension of particularly non-white labour in white cities, and to stimulate border area development along those lines. Therefore it amazes me that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) as one of the new young minds of the United Party informed us here to-day that now the United Party too was in favour of the idea of border area development. I think that he is on the right track, however, and he must only see to it that when the Planning Vote comes under discussion, and specially the effect which that Act had during the past year and which it will have in years to come, he will strengthen the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hand and that he will plead for the rapid development of border areas.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to a discussion which took place here in connection with the Industrial Development Corporation. The hon. member for Pinetown suggested that the Industrial Development Corporation was entering fields in which it did not belong. It often occurs to one that hon. members of the Opposition are afraid of the Industrial Development Corporation becoming too great a factor in the industrial sphere in our country. What I am concerned about, however, is a certain perceptible trend to-day as regards the establishment of new, smaller companies. With the establishment of the unit trust schemes and with the conversion of small shareholdings of the general public into units in those open trusts as well as with the existing schemes through which the ordinary salary earner places the money he would normally have saved in the hands of the open trust, a large source of risk capital has been lost to new undertakings. With the experience I myself have gained in numerous companies, I have often found that the young company which sets out with not too much capital is the very company which virtually finds itself before a closed door to-day. The large undertakings, the large insurance companies, adopt the attitude to-day that they would rather control R10 million through one trained official if it is channelled into one or two undertakings, than to control the activities of possibly 100 small undertakings to some extent for which more officials are required. One can understand that merely from a security point of view as well as from a business point of view this is sound business on their part. This is also the position as regards the unit trust as it invests in quoted companies only. This means that the large insurance companies which are amongst the largest investors are now chanelling virtually all the capital which used to be also available as risk capital for new undertakings into the existing, or the large companies only. One often hears from investing officials who have to investigate new undertakings, and who have to look for new fields of investment, that they do not know where to invest their money. We therefore find that the prices of stock are forced up to such an extent to-day that the gilt-edged stocks only yield a return of approximately 2 or 3 per cent. One asks oneself what this is going to lead to in future. I think it is in this respect that the Industrial Development Corporation with the establishment of its small industry division in 1962 entered a very good field for the industrial development of our country. I see that according to its latest statements, namely those dated 30th June, 1967, that its total investments as regards smaller industries amount to R829.000 spread over approximately 52 undertakings. This is as against a total investment of far more than R500 million. If one looks at all its investments falling into the R 10,000 category, the R20.000 category, and the R50.000 category, one finds that as regards, its total investments, it has invested approximately 42 per cent, or a total amount of approximately R7 million, in those three categories. This represents approximately I to 1&#x00BD; per cent of its total investments. I think the direction the I.D.C. has taken is a very good one. The question which I ask myself is whether this is being developed with a sufficient measure of purposefulness, not as regards the number of applications dealt with, but as <span class="col_6353-6354" refersTo="page_0381"/>regards the method of dealing with applications and the approach to applications which are made to the I.D.C. I realize that they, like any other investor, have numerous problems and that it may be new undertakings do not undertake sufficient research in the first place. Secondly, adequate steps are perhaps not taken as regards the question of succession in the management of small undertakings. If one should ask a large banking concern to-day whether it would have assisted an Anton Rupert in 1950 when he started his Rembrandt factory, the answer is that they would not have done so and they would not even have given him any thought. For the same reason many companies find themselves in the extraordinary position to-day that they simply cannot invest in what they would like to invest unless they do so at prices ten, twenty or thirty times higher than that at which they could have done so originally. The small industrialist who wants to start an undertaking to-day cannot always go to existing economic family groups and investors, because he often spoils his own market by doing so. If he, as newcomer, wants to enter any particular field and if he associates himself with one particular group for his financing, he often finds that by doing so he has to do without a very large part of the market. In that process he also loses, when it comes to private financing, his own identity and initiative to a large extent. In the role played by the I.D.C. I see again the importance of this small industries division. This meets what is in point of fact the greatest need, because there we create the opportunity for the entrepreneur to remain independent in the sense that he is not absorbed into other groups and as a result his own initiative is not suppressed. I want to make an appeal to-day. in view of the small amount of capital which has been invested up to this stage, that this large undertaking should display some daring and that the formalities which have to be complied with when undertakings make applications, should be reduced to the absolute minimum. I believe that if this division of the I.D.C. could be developed systematically and with a certain degree of daring, it would be possible to lay better foundations for the future industrial development of South Africa and that we might find after a decade or so that a sufficient number of new undertakings had been established in the meantime so that investors who have to invest their money to-day in gilt-edged stocks at 2 per cent only, would have a greater field of investment at their disposal.</p>

<p>I want to refer also to one other field the I.D.C. has entered with the establishment of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in view of the fact that this specific industry might have been established because of the force of circumstances, what future he sees for the Atlas Corporation and whether a South African light passenger aircraft of our own should not possibly be considered at this early stage?

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to explain to that hon. member the difference in this respect between the Government&#x2019;s policy and our policy on this side of the House. The main emphasis in the Government&#x2019;s policy to-day is that, when it comes to the decentralization of industry, industry should be drawn towards the borders of the reserves. We on this side of the House have always stood for the decentralization of industry, but we say that industry can be decentralized and that economic incentives should be given to enable industrialists to set up industries in areas which are lagging behind economically, even if they are not very near the borders of reserves. Sir, I want to give that hon. member an example. The hon. member for Queenstown has talked about the border area from East London to Queenstown, an area which to-day, under the Government&#x2019;s plans, qualifies for border industry benefits. Under the Government&#x2019;s scheme an area like Grahamstown, for example, although it has a very large pool of unemployed Bantu who are not newcomers in that area&#x2014;in many instances they have been there for generations&#x2014;simply because it is some 30 miles away from the nearest reserve or Bantu homeland across the Fish River, does not qualify for the Government&#x2019;s border area benefits. Sir, I say that this is crazy economics and that we have to view the country as a whole and not merely pay attention only to those areas which adjoin the homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to a matter which was raised here by the hon. member for Paarl, namely the amount of R4 million which is being voted here for assistance to exporters hit by devaluation. The hon. member said, amongst other things, that exporters had to become more efficient. I agree with that. Of course, it is necessary for exporters, whether they are primary producers or manufacturers, to strive for efficiency. But that hon. member should remember that if something of the magnitude of a 14.3 per cent devaluation hits any industry, then the people engaged in that industry simply cannot push up their efficiency by the same margin overnight or even within a short period. They have to be given time and that is one reason why they have to be given assistance to enable them to cope, by means of greater efficiency over a period of years, with a situation like that which has suddenly arisen. Sir. ever since the British devaluation of sterling in November, we have had statements by various hon. Ministers, firstly, by the Minister of Finance and also by the Minister of Economic Affairs and by the Minister of Agriculture, that exporters are going to be compensated for the losses that they had suffered as a result of devaluation.</p>

<p><span class="col_6355-6356" refersTo="page_0382"/>When the hon. the Minister of Finance introduced his Budget, he said that this amount of R4 million was to implement the undertaking which he had given last November. But, Sir, we have had very little indication from any of these hon. Ministers as to what sort of formula the Government is going to apply when they compensate these people. We have merely been told that we have to wait until the end of the season, until all the accounts are in, and that they will then have a firm basis on which to calculate the compensation to be paid. We have not even had an indication as to whether the formula that is going to be applied, is going to be applied equally to all the different classes of people who have been hit by devaluation. The nearest we got to it was a statement by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture during the Budget debate when, in referring to what the Minister of Finance had said, he said (col. 3515)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But in his Budget speech the Minister announced that the farmers would be compensated for the losses suffered owing to the devaluation of the British pound to the extent to which prices were being affected by it.</block>

<p>Sir, the end of the season in many cases is either at hand or is very rapidly approaching, and I think that the time has come for the hon. the Minister to give us rather more detail as to what he has in mind in this regard. Is this R4 million merely a provisional amount or is more going to be voted in due course and, if so, when will it be voted? You see, Sir, if there is to be a 100 per cent compensation on the basis on which the Minister of Agriculture said that compensation would be paid, then it is at least open to doubt that this amount of R4 million is nearly enough. The hon. member for Paarl agreed on this point; in fact he said categorically that it was not enough. Sir, as long ago as December the President of the S.A. Agricultural Union, Mr. De la Harpe de Villiers, estimated that probably the devaluation losses for agriculture alone would be something of the order of RIO million. The hon. member for Paarl mentioned the loss which the deciduous fruit industry expects to suffer. He mentioned a figure of R3 million. That is a figure, of course, which has been confirmed on various occasions by the General Manager of the Deciduous Fruit Board and also by members of that Board. Sir, there are other minor sections of the fruit industry which are in the same position. For example, the pineapple industry, which does not make out a big section of the fruit industry, is going to suffer some quite considerable losses. I take my figures from volume I of the Foreign Trade Statistics of 1965, which may be out of date, but will nonetheless give us some idea of the scope of the problem. If we make allowance for insurance and freight, we find that in that year fresh pineapples brought in something iike R 147,000. The actual loss will probably be of the order of R21,000 due to devaluation. Pineapples in air-tight containers on the other hand, i.e. canned pineapples, after making an allowance for freight and insurance, brought in something of the order of R2,100,000, and there the loss is going to be some R300,000. In the pineapple industry, as far as the canned product is concerned, the growers have hitherto not been hit to the full extent because canners have not dropped prices to the producer, except in the case of one cannery which had various other difficulties, and there they dropped prices by R2 per ton. But the fresh fruit exporting industry in regard to pineapples has been exceedingly hard hit, because not only have they had to cope with the effect of devaluation immediately but also with the freight increases which were imposed last year, and with various harbour increases. I had a telephone call only to-day from some of these people, and their position is really becoming desperate. If we take various other commodities, we find much larger amounts involved. If we take pears, peaches, guavas, apricots and grapes in cans, the amount of the actual loss is probably some R2.1 million. If you add all these amounts to the R3 million of the Deciduous Fruit Board, we come to a figure of some R5.4 million. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>A considerable number of matters were raised in the course of this debate, but in the time at my disposal I want to confine myself particularly to certain aspects raised by the hon. member for Pinetown. He raised four aspects. I should like to confine myself in the first place to the aspect in regard to which we have the most common ground. The hon. member asked me what our attitude was in connection with foreign investments in South Africa and whether the possibility existed of any force being brought to bear by us in future on firms with investments in this country to give a share interest to South Africans. This has never been the policy, nor is it the intention to compel foreign investors to make shares available to South African interests. The element of compulsion has never been mooted or insinuated. What is correct&#x2014;and this was also said by the hon. member&#x2014;is that we welcome the fact that foreign undertakings make shares available to South African interests and that they do not use domestic loans only for financing their undertakings. The public at large is strongly urging that these foreign undertakings, some of which have been established here for many years, undertakings which are large ones and which are capital-intensive and make large profits should make shares available to South African interests. Over the past few years some of them have been making shares available to South Africans, and this trend is heartily welcomed. Strong pleas in this regard were delivered at the recent congress of the Handelsinstituut. Therefore this is a trend which we welcome. No compulsion <span class="col_6357-6358" refersTo="page_0383"/>or pressure is being exercised, but we are in agreement that this is the right trend.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to I.D.C. matters and to price maintenance in particular. He asked what we were going to do in connection with price maintenance. I recently Tabled the report of the Board of Trade and Industries, and after due consideration we have decided on certain steps. I should like to indicate which of those recommendations we accept. I have set this down in writing as the public at large has considerable interest in this matter. In its report No. 1220 of 8th December, 1967, which I Tabled in both Houses of Parliament on 20th February of this year, the Board of Trade and Industries recommended that the enforcement of prescribed resale prices be prohibited, but that suppliers should be given the opportunity of applying for exemption from such a prohibition. After the report of the Board had been Tabled, organized trade and industries were given the opportunity of submitting their views in regard to the recommendations of the Board prior to any decision being taken in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. Since that time I have given careful consideration to the report of the Board as well as to the representations submitted by organized trade and industries, and I should now like to announce that I have decided to accept the recommendations of the Board. The Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, in terms of which the Board instituted its investigation, provides that a prohibition such as that recommended by the Board, shall only be promulgated with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. In addition the Act provides that exemptions from such a prohibition should be included in the notice containing the prohibition. Therefore it will be impracticable to promulgate the prohibition first and then to give consideration to possible exemptions as parliamentary approval will have to be obtained every time for any amendments to the notice containing the prohibition. Consequently I have decided to announce at an early opportunity by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> that I intend asking for parliamentary approval for the promulgation of a prohibition on the enforcement of prescribed resale prices, and that suppliers who are of the opinion that in their particular cases the enforcement of prescribed resale prices is justified in the public interest, should, within a fixed period, submit motivated applications for exemption from the prohibition to the Department of Commerce. The Department will then refer such applications for exemption to the Board of Trade and Industries for investigation and for making the necessary recommendations to me. Exemptions recommended by the Board and accepted by me, will thereupon be included in the notice which I intend submitting to Parliament for approval as exceptional cases in respect of which the enforcement of resale prices will not be prohibited. It is hoped that it will be possible to submit this notice to both Houses of Parliament before the end of the 1969 session.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown also asked whether we had any knowledge of certain practices such as the formation of rings, etc. It is our policy, whenever we receive complaints of this nature from the public, to refer such complaints for investigation to the Board of Trade and Industries. Should there therefore be other aspects, the matter will be referred to that Board. I must say that the Department has received complaints about certain industrialists refusing to supply certain articles to all sections of the retail trade or supplying certain articles very exclusively. This is a complaint which we received recently, and it is an aspect which we shall definitely investigate.</p>

<p>As far as these articles are concerned, there are no price determinations. Price maintenance does not apply as regards these articles. That is why the hon. member would have noticed in recent times, from November or December last year, that there has been very strong competition indeed as regards these very articles, i.e. refrigerators, stoves, etc. As far as these articles are concerned, there has in fact been a price war, and if there is a price war, why should the Board of Trade and Industries investigate the question of price maintenance?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown referred to certain practices of the I.D.C. and in particular to the direction in which this Corporation was going. He also read out the task of the I.D.C. as stated in the 1940 Act. He will concede that the operational scope as contained in that Act is very wide. I want to say that conditions in South Africa are completely different to-day to what they were in 1940 when that Act was passed. At that time South Africa was virtually in its infancy as regards its industrial development, and since that time South Africa has developed in an unprecedented way. But the terms of reference are wide, for the very purpose of stimulating industrial development. Within those terms of reference the I.D.C. has played a very important and often a decisive role in bringing about the establishment of new industries here in South Africa over the years. This is an aspect in regard to which the hon. member and I do not differ. The difference of opinion relates to financing and to certain directions in which the I.D.C. has invested. His objection related mainly to <span class="col_6359-6360" refersTo="page_0384"/>the I.D.C. investing in the growth funds. The I.D.C. has invested in one growth fund only, and that is the National Growth Fund. We should get the record straight as regards this matter. In the first place the I.D.C. had an interest in the Accepting Bank. The Accepting Bank for Industry was established earlier on and it was established within the framework of one of the tasks of the I.D.C. as defined in article 3 of its Articles of Association, namely the financing of industries. It was felt that the available capital should be mustered and that it would be possible to provide better finance facilities if the capital of other undertakings were to be combined in one undertaking such as the Accepting Bank. For that reason the Accepting Bank was established, and the I.D.C. had an interest in that Accepting Bank in that other capital was mustered as a result of financing by the Accepting Bank, so that it was possible to grant increased assistance. Therefore the I.D.C. has had an interest in the Accepting Bank from the outset. Then at a later stage the Accepting Bank combined with other interests to establish a growth fund.</p>

<p>Only one other growth fund, namely Sage, existed at the time when this growth fund was established. Therefore the I.D.C. was involved in the second growth fund, i.e. the National Growth Fund. That was at a stage when this was still a new movement, when there was still uncertainty as regards its growth possibilities and potential. Because the Accepting Bank as a whole was involved in this matter, and as the I.D.C. had an interest in the Accepting Bank, the I.D.C. consequently obtained an interest in this growth fund along with other bodies and persons, but the direct interest of the I.D.C. represented a small percentage only. That was at the beginning. If the I.D.C. as an organization with an interest in the Accepting Bank, would have withdrawn itself from this movement, it could quite easily have created the impression that the I.D.C. had no confidence in this new movement which was in progress. On the other hand this was something which might have had growth possibilities. The predominant factor was, however, the fact that the I.D.C. had an interest in this Accepting Bank, and in that way it became involved in this growth fund. Since that time other growth funds have been established. They have attracted more capital and have become large undertakings. The objection is that the I.D.C. has interests in such an undertaking. Now hon. members will notice from the latest annual report of the I.D.C. that the I.D.C. has sold its interest in Fund Advisers to Industrial Selections. Industrial Selections has been made available to the public so that the I.D.C. today no longer holds these interests which it held before. On the contrary. Industrial Selections holds those interests. Industrial Selections is a separate company to which a considerable number of the interests of the I.D.C. has been transferred, and industrial Selections has made 40 per cent of those interests available to the public, with the result that the public at present has an interest in the share which the I.D.C. used to have. Seeing that this is a separate company which manages its own affairs, it is for this company to take the further decision whether, in the interests of its shareholders, it still wants to retain these interests in growth funds or whether it wants to dispose of them and buy other interests. At this stage this is a matter for the board of directors of Industrial Selections and they too have an obligation towards other shareholders. Hon. members know that when these shares were made available to the public, they were greatly over-subscribed.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Is Industrial Selections controlled by the I.D.C.?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have indicated that 40 per cent of the interests are held by the public. Therefore 60 per cent of the interests are still held by the I.D.C. As regards the board of directors. Dr. Van Eek and one other person serve on the board of directors on behalf of the Accepting Bank. This is the connection which exists in respect of the board of directors. But the fact of the matter is that it is still a very small share. In point of fact the amount invested by the I.D.C. in shares of this growth fund came to R59,000 only. This was the amount invested by the I.D.C. in this growth fund and these are the interests which it sold. And this is what this dispute is about. The share of the I.D.C. in this undertaking represents a very small portion of its total investments.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member wanted to know why the I.D.C. had to go in certain directions and whether it was the policy of the Government that we should become self-sufficient. As regards the manufacture of strategic supplies, we are obviously trying to become self-sufficient. It is not always possible, however, to achieve this completely, because no matter how large the percentage of South African materials used may be, there always is a certain percentage of materials which have to be imported from abroad. To be completely self-sufficient is therefore virtually impossible for any country in the world, unless it is a country which has a very primitive economy. It is true that we have been giving attention to import-replacing industries over the past few years, especially with a view to saving foreign exchange. But with the improvement in the position as regards our balance of payments, this consideration has been pushed into the background to a certain extent, and when it comes to the question of protecting new industries, this consideration no longer carries as much weight as it used to carry.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the growing of tea, and asked why this should be undertaken by us. He was of the opinion that <span class="col_6361-6362" refersTo="page_0385"/>we would never be successful as regards the growing of tea in South Africa as labour played such an important role in the growing of tea. The fact of the matter is of course that as far as our supplies of tea are concerned, we used to be completely dependent on imports from abroad. In addition tea represents a large import item. When the question of various boycotts and sanctions against our country was mooted, the question arose whether we should not give consideration to this particular matter. The I.D.C. has played an important role in starting this new important industry. Tea is being grown in an area with a very high rainfall and in which many Bantu labourers are available. It is calculated that four labourers are required to cultivate every three acres of land. At the present time more than 1,800 acres have been put under tea. When these plantations have reached full production, there will be employment for 2,400 labourers, most of whom will, of course, be Bantu. We are therefore at the same time creating additional employment opportunities apart from the fact that the more tea we produce ourselves, the less we will have to import. This therefore is another example of the I.D.C. having done pioneer work as regards the development of a new industry.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked why the I.D.C. was so active in the textile industry. It is true that the I.D.C. has a very large interest in the textile industry. As a matter of fact, this has been the position for years. Over the years this industry has developed many facets and for that reason the I.D.C. is still involved in this industry to a large extent. The I.D.C. has also invested large amounts in border areas. Its investment in the textile industry in the border areas amounts to nearly R30 million and is spread over various undertakings. In eight of those undertakings the I.D.C. has a share interest, and in virtually all of them a minority interest, whereas others were only financed by the I.D.C. But when it comes to the question of providing employment, the textile industry probably is one of the industries which is the biggest source of employment for non-Whites. But in addition to that the textile industry processes quantities of South African raw materials. Because of that the industry supplies in its own requirements to a large extent.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this industry is one of the industries which have showed a very high rate of growth over the past few years, and it still has great possibilities for the future. The I.D.C. has already relinquished its interests in some of the sectors in which it has invested, and in some cases it has decreased those interests. It has, for example, made its shares available to the public through Industrial Selections. But there is also National Selections. These two undertakings have made 40 per cent of their shares available to the public. In other cases the I.D.C. has offered its shares to the public directly, for example, in undertakings such as the Accepting Bank, and Safmarine. As a matter of fact, last year the public had a second opportunity of buying shares in Safmarine on the market. In addition there are many other undertakings, such as Phalaborwa Mining, Sentrachem and Central Accepting Bank, which have already been developed successfully, and in which the I.D.C. has decreased its shares interest, and this process is likely to continue. When we have regard to the fact that the I.D.C. has already recovered R180 million of its investments or of its reinvestments over the years, we see in that some indication of the important role which the I.D.C. has played in the financing of industries.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that he was not in favour of the I.D.C. taking a share in industries in the form of equities. He said he preferred them to invest money in, for example redeemable preference shares or loans. This, however, is not always possible. It often happens that the I.D.C. has to take up shares, particularly in the case of young undertakings. In such cases it has to accept co-responsibility for the risks which there are. How can it then be expected of the I.D.C. to run that risk at the beginning and to relinquish its shareholding as soon as the particular undertaking starts becoming successful? The I.D.C. feels that it is entitled to retain its shares until it can sell them at a profit or until such time as they are remunerative so as to increase its revenue. My information is that the I.D.C. has recovered more money in the form of repayments and dividends over the last six months than the amount which it has given out on loan. This is an indication that the I.D.C. has lately been less active as regards new investments; that it has been more selective. In that way the I.D.C. has remained true to the Government&#x2019;s policy that new enterprises should not be undertaken where it is not absolutely essential to do so. In this way we want to check an inflationary rate of growth. Therefore the I.D.C., as one. of the State&#x2019;s undertakings, has also played its part in decreasing economic activity and decelerating the tempo of development.</p>

<p>Therefore I maintain that the I.D.C. has played a very important founders&#x2019; role in all these undertakings which I have mentioned, and in so doing has given new direction to industrial development in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister treated the hon. member for Pinetown in a very courteous manner, because the hon. member had made a few statements, which were not quite true. The hon. member began his speech by saying that he wanted to discuss two matters, namely the policy of the Government towards private enterprise and, secondly, price maintenance. He continued and suggested that &#x201C;The I.D.C. is empire building&#x201D; and &#x201C;It demands a share in equities&#x201D;. Allow me to deal with this statement for a moment. What are the facts? These facts are <span class="col_6363-6364" refersTo="page_0386"/>contained in the report of the I.D.C., a report which was also available to the hon. member. Incidentally, this report is a fine piece of work. It is evident from this report that the I.D.C. has assisted 861 undertakings over the years. In the first few paragraphs of the report it is stated that the I.D.C. has financial interests in only 239 undertakings, i.e. about one-quarter of the undertakings which were assisted by ithe I.D.C. financially. But now the hon. member comes along and says: &#x201C;The I.D.C. demands a share in equities&#x201D;. Surely, this is not so. The hon. member furthermore alleged that &#x201C;We cannot get to the end of the string&#x201D;. He was referring here to the fact that Sasol was also partaking in the refining of oil. The hon. member tried to create the impression that the I.D.C. was a monster that was taking over private enterprise in South Africa, in other words, that South Africa was becoming socialistic in that the State was gaining control of the economy of South Africa through the I.D.C. and its instruments. However, what is the truth of the matter? The truth is the following. When the gross domestic product amounted to R7,226.1 million in 1965, private enterprise contributed R5,554.8 million, i.e. 76.9 per cent of the total amount. As against this, public corporations contributed only R253.7 million, i.e 3.5 per cent. However, in spite of this hon. members on the other side are trying to create the impression that the Government is socializing the South African eoonomy through the I.D.C. and its agencies. Surely, this is not so. The State, including the South African Railways, contributed R1,417.7 million, i.e. 19.6 per cent of the total amount, to the gross domestic product in 1965. Let us oompare this position to the one which prevailed in 1948, i.e. the last year in which the hon. the Opposition was in power. Let us compare the position now with the position which was prevailing at that time to see whether the situation changed materially. What do we find now? We now find that of a total domestic gross product of R1,965.6 million private enterprises contributed R 1,547.9 million, that is 78.7 per cent of the total amount, as against 76.9 per cent in 1965, which is a drop of only 1.8 per cent. What contribution was made by private public corporations? Which of the public corporations existed in 1948? Sasol and Phoscor, for example, did not exist at that time. What is more, the public corporations which did exist at that time, were only at an early stage of development, because the Act to establish the I.D.C. was only passed in 1940. But in spite of this public corporations contributed R28.6 million, in other words, 1.5 per cent to the gross domestic product as against R389.1 million, i.e. 19.8 per cent, contributed by the Government, including the South African Railways. We find, therefore, that the contribution private enterprises made to the gross domestic product dropped from 1948 to 1965, by 1.8 per cent. As against this, the contribution made by public corporations increased by 2 per cent during that period while the contribution made by the Government, including the South African Railways, dropped by .2 per cent. But in spite of this state of affairs the Opposition tries every year to create the impression&#x2014;and the hon. member for Pinetown tried again to create this impression to-day&#x2014;that the Government is socializing the South African economy through the LD.C. and its agencies. But the figures I quoted confirm the fact that South Africa has an economy which is preeminently free, in other words an economy which is free from any control and that this is so in spite of the fact that it is becoming increasingly important for the State to enter into the economy of the country for the sake of order. Nevertheless, the position as regards the contribution made by private enterprises to the gross domestic product, remained virtually unchanged as we inherited it from the time when the United Party was in power. If they nevertheless want to make an issue of the fact that there was this drop of 1.8 per cent, then all I can say is &#x201C;small things amuse small minds&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then the Opposition also suggested that &#x201C;In this country we are breaking and bending economic laws.&#x201D; It is true that they did not make this allegation to-day, but they actually adopted that attitude. But let us analyse this allegation briefly. In 1924 the manufacturing industry contributed R38.7 million, or 7.6 per cent of the total amount to the gross domestic product; in 1933, that is, after nine years of National Party rule and a period which coincided with severe drought and the depression, the contribution made by the manufacturing industry to the gross domestic product already increased to R53.5 million, or 10.1 per cent of the total amount; in 1939 it was R 106.2 million, or 12.1 per cent. Then followed those years in which we had the war and the State had to stimulate spending in cases where provisions could not be obtained easily and where shipping space was limited. The Government, therefore, was forced to make the country more self-sufficient by means of State spending. What do we find now? We find that the contribution made by the manufacturing industry to the gross domestic product increased to R317.9 million, or 16.1 per cent of the total amount, during the nine years subsequent to 1939. What was the position 10 years later? We find that there was a enormous increase to R818.4 million, or 19 per cent of the total gross domestic product. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#lindsay">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on Thursday we witnessed the amazing spectacle of the complete somersaults by the hon. members for Queenstown and Brakpan in their pleas for development to take place in the Ciskei-Transkei Corridor area. It is amazing because for years we on this side of the House have been doing just that, with no support whatsoever coming from that side of the House, and all the Hansards will testify to it. On the contrary, we have had opposition from them in their defence of the Government&#x2019;s border industry policy. In this case, too, we saw the hon. member for Queenstown spoiling his plea by again trying to defend the Government&#x2019;s policy. He mentioned industries in East London, but he knows very well that there are industries and industries. He did not tell us that many of those industries which he mentioned employed only eight Bantu and that in fact the total of all Bantu employed by the industries he mentioned was less than 800. But, Sir, we welcome the support he gave us and we also welcome the admission that the Government has neglected this area long enough.</p>

<p>I want to return to the disparity that there is between the border areas. The disregard of inherent differences gives certain areas a terrific advantage over other areas. Sir, an area with a geographic disadvantage of which the Ciskei-Transkei corridor area is a typical example, finds itself at a big disadvantage in relation to markets and raw materials, and it has nothing whatsoever to cancel out the advantages which areas such as Rosslyn, Pietermaritzburg and Hamm rsdale have over it. Sir, this area has been neglected in the past because of the very fact that it is so remotely situated and the least development has taken place there, and all this despite the fact that the pre-conditions for industrial development have been provided. We have, firstly, a harbour, with railways and roads developed and being extended, but the harbour is operating far short of capacity and is very heavily laden with dues which have to be paid. Secondly, there is the question of water. At the moment there is a shortage of water because of abnormal circumstances, but there too water supplies are being supplemented. The Bridle Drift dam has just been completed and the construction of the Fairways Dam has been approved and is to be started soon. But vast sources remain which are still untapped&#x2014;the Kabusi and the Kei Rivers for example. We have power supplied by Escom but again at a very high premium because of the high cost of the transportation of coal. We have labour; indeed, Sir, we have too much labour. The labour position is set out very clearly in the latest report of the permanent committee. The report gives the number of Bantu coming on to the national labour market from Bantu homelands alone as no less than 35,000 per annum. With the Ciskei and the Transkei Bantu populations constituting no less than 47&#x00BD; of the total number of Bantu in the homelands, you will appreciate, Sir, that according to the figure given by the committee, we require no fewer than 17,000 jobs per annum, and what do you find? In the same report it is mentioned that since 1960, that is to say, over the past seven years, the number of additional Bantu given employment was only 10,500, and that in spite of the fact that no fewer than 119,000 jobs had to be provided over that period. Sir, that still does not take into account at all the Government&#x2019;s policy of repatriation, which is affecting the situation very greatly. Because of its labour position, this area is one of the most crucial border areas in South Africa. Sir, with a large Bantu homeland as a hinterland, such as we have, this area is left without any major markets, and the lack of raw materials makes it impossible for any heavy industry to be developed there. Light industries, on the other hand, where the locational requirements are less rigid, have to overcome the pull from established markets such as the Rand and other border areas which are more advantageously situated.</p>

<p>Sir, this pull is so great that but for the capital costs involved and but for the existing legislation, many of these industries would in fact have moved to new locations. We all know that considerable artificial stimuli are required to entice competitive industries from the natural advantages of established areas, and this is particularly applicable in the case of the corridor area where there are so many disadvantages still to be overcome. Sir, even the permanent committee recognizes this. They have placed this area on the highest priority as a growth point and maximum assistance is given to it in terms of existing measures.</p>

<p>But there again the report goes on to say that, despite all this, the anticipated growth has not been achieved. When we come to look for the reason we find of course that the reason is the cost of the basic services and the insufficiency of the rail rebate. All these are basically a matter of transport costs. The 10 per cent rebate, for which R230,000 is allowed this year, is but a drop in the ocean. If one considers the distance, the delays in deliveries, <span class="col_6367-6368" refersTo="page_0388"/>and also the surcharge on the express goods service, one finds we are going nowhere at all. I therefore plead with the Minister, firstly to increase this rebate substantially, and secondly, to make it also applicable to raw materials coming into the area as well as coal which we use to such a great extent. I would ask the hon. member for Queenstown to support me fully in this matter. We all know that concessions alone will not induce industrialists to locate their factories where there are no complementary industries. Thus far factory resources have favoured textiles, because they are labour intensive, but they do not have the linkage rating which is required for industrial growth. We require something on a much bigger scale, something on the lines of Sasol or Iscor, and this would be the cause of diversified industrial growth. I trust that the hon. the Minister, when considering the site for the third Iscor, will still keep the corridor on his short list and not be persuaded to put it elsewhere.</p>

<speech by="#van_tonder">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town will probably forgive me if I do not follow up on his argument, but I did note with interest that he agreed with the hon. member for Queenstown. I now want to predict that after the next election the hon. member for Queenstown will have a very good neighbour in the King William&#x2019;s Town constituency.</p>

<p>I should like to bring another matter to the Committee&#x2019;s attention, namely the financial assistance which is being rendered to the local motion picture industry. In this year&#x2019;s Estimates an amount of R400,000 is given under the South African motion picture industry. Last year this amount was R518,500, and for the year 1966-&#x2019;67 it was R450,000. This is of course a considerable amount. Hon. members will probably recall that the hon. the Minister informed the House in reply to a question by the hon. member for Kensington that R399,900 had been paid out to the South African film industry during the year 1967-&#x2019;68.</p>

<p>To realize the potential value of our motion picture industry, particular attention should be given to the following. More than R20 million is being paid annually to our cinemas by approximately 60 million cinema goers. An average of 50 million feet of cinematographic film is being imported each year. At least 75 per cent of the imported films are sausagemachine productions. These are films which the studios manufacture according to formula, and which can be labelled as rubbish. Only a very small percentage are really good, outstanding films, and even some of these are tainted with all kinds of deviations such as homosexuality, integrationistic propaganda, etc., which are offered as so-called psychological films. Nobody can deny that the motion picture is a medium which exerts a powerful influence, and since 1961 all these films have been imported into this country tax free. Monetary assistance to the South African motion picture industry is both essential and laudable therefore. However, I and many others would prefer to see this being financed from import duties on imported films, and not out of State Revenue. This would provide the industry with twofold protection.</p>

<p>The history of the subsidy scheme is briefly as follows. From 1957 to 1961 the manufacturer of the South African motion picture recovered approximately half of its production costs from entertainment tax. After 1962 the scheme was amended. It was amended again in 1964, according to which amendment the manufacturer can in theory now recover far more than only half of his production costs. Except for R22,500, he can now recover all his costs, subject to certain conditions. However, the difficulty lies with these conditions. Before the motion picture can be taken into consideration for the subsidy, it must first hand over R50,000 in box-office revenue before it can qualify for that subsidy.</p>

<p>Subsequently, if it has collected R50,000 by way of box-office revenue, the manufacturer receives 44 per cent of the amount above R55,000 minus R22,500. Since February this year the subsidy ceiling has been raised. The intention of the State is an equally favourable one in regard to the restriction as it is in regard to the subsidy itself. It must serve as a deterrent against bad films, for if the motion picture does not meet with the approval of the public, it is not supported. I do not want to go into the question of public taste, because my time is too limited, but taste does in fact differ. As a result of the subsidy scheme conditions in respect of the R50,000 box-office revenue, South African manufacturers are dependent upon bilingual films so that they can draw a larger number of cinema goers. It is here where Afrikaans, and I want to emphasize this, is not coming into its own. Afrikaans is the language of South Africa. No other country has Afrikaans for an official language. This is a treasured possession only South Africa has, and which should be protected to the full by every South African, whatever his home language might be. This expresses our own unique South African way of life the best.</p>

<p>But what do we find in some South African motion pictures? Afrikaans is being presented, alongside English, as being subservient to English, as being the language of ridiculous &#x201C;back-velders&#x201D;. Such films earn a great deal more in State subsidies, while purely unilingual Afrikaans films, with a cultural value, such as the outstanding &#x201C;In die Lente van ons Liefde&#x201D; by Louis Wiesner, will receive little or no subsidy, with disastrous results for the manufacturers. Just as it is the duty of the individual it is the duty of the State to protect and promote Afrikaans in the South African film industry. Deficiencies in the subsidy system must be rectified without delay, and if this is necessary, with retrospective effect. If this is not done Afrikaans as a motion picture language in South Africa is doomed. The scheme rests on an economic basis, and does <span class="col_6369-6370" refersTo="page_0389"/>not take the cultural factors or considerations into account at all. Why is it not being planned on a culturo-economic basis? The subsidy ought to be paid to a body such as the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, by way of recognition for meritorious manufacturers. As matters stand at present, no independent manufacturer of purely Afrikaans-language motion pictures can have any hope of economic success.</p>

<p>His enterprise is being smothered by another subsidy condition, namely that motion pictures should be distributed through commercial channels. There are only two such undertakings which can distribute films on a country-wide basis, namely Twentieth Century Fox of America and the South African Ster Films Organization. Together the two companies own approximately 200 theatres. But as the contractors for the most important and most American and British films they have the distribution rights in South Africa of almost all imported films. In that way they also have general control over the approximately 450 independent theatres. It is customary that exhibitors receive an average of 50 per cent of the box-office receipts, and the distributors the other 50 per cent. In the case of exceptional films, the distributors insist on approximately 70 per cent of that amount. The exhibitor can only obtain the few good films from the distributors if he agrees to take the very bad ones as well.</p>

<p>In the case of a South African manufactured motion picture, the box-office receipts are divided up as follows: The exhibitor receives 50 per cent, the manufacturer between 25 and 35 per cent, and the distributor 15 to 25 per cent. Thus hon. members can see that no distributor would be interested in the South African motion picture because it earns him between 15 and 25 per cent of the proceeds, whereas he can earn 50 per cent on the imported film which is brought in free of charge. There are in fact distributors who have interests in motion picture manufacturing. And it is only their films which have a chance of being subsidized. The films of the independent manufacturer have no hope of success, because they are being smothered by the distributor. I can mention an example. &#x201C;In die Lente van ons Liefde,&#x201D; which cost approximately R180,000 to manufacture, will earn box-office receipts for the manufacturer of approximately R17,500, whereas he has absolutely no hope of a large subsidy. His loss is estimated at between R150,000 and R160,000. The same applies to the film &#x201C;Hoor my Lied.&#x201D; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will not dwell on the speech made by the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. It is something which really does not concern me and my particular area, or the problems facing the area which I represent.</p>

<p>But I was particularly interested to listen to the speech made by the hon. member for Queenstown last Thursday afternoon. To me it was a complete about-face for the hon. member representing that particular area. I say &#x201C;about-face&#x201D; because I cannot recall&#x2014; and I have gone through Hansard&#x2014;when the hon. member pleaded with the Government for industries in the Eastern Cape. When one asks for industries on the borders of the reserves or the Bantustans, let us clearly see and imagine what the borders actually are. While we do plead for industries in those particular areas, where exactly is the border of the Native reserves? I do not regard Queenstown as being a border area. I do not regard King William&#x2019;s Town or East London as being border areas; they are in white areas. The border areas, as I see the position, are the areas in fact adjoining the reserves, for example the Kei River area. But the hon. member for Queenstown last week accused members on this side of the House, and I think he mentioned us by name, that we have never asked the Government for border industries. In fact, he said we have gone out of our way to ridicule the Government&#x2019;s policy of border industries. Here is a speech which he made last year, a speech in which he warned us on this side, and me in particular I presume, in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to promise them that I am going to Queenstown during the recess. I am also visiting King William&#x2019;s Town and East London, and I shall go there to tell the people what they will get as a result of the policy of that side of the House&#x2014;nothing, literally nothing.</block>

<p>These were his own words. In that same speech he also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to tell hon. members that during the recess I shall make a point of attacking them on this matter&#x2014;East London (City), East London (North), King William&#x2019;s Town and Queenstown, until we have chased them all out of those places.</block>

<p>Well, I waited very patiently for the hon. member to visit these places, to tell the people that the policies of this side of the House mean literally nothing, to use his own words. Let me quote from a speech I made during my first year in Parliament. On 16th September, 1966 Col. 2297 I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can mention some industries which have come to East London only recently &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown rightly mentioned these industries in his speech on Thursday. However, I already mentioned them in 1966. I will not repeat them again now, I went on to say on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My appeal to the hon. the Minister and to this Government this afternoon is to seriously consider using its influence to promote industrial development in the Eastern <span class="col_6371-6372" refersTo="page_0390"/>Cape and Border areas. We will welcome it. We only hope that in future, with all the talk we have heard in this House, the Government will now cast its eyes to the east where we can provide for those industries and all other Government projects which they might wish to bring to the North Eastern Cape and Border areas.</block>

<p>This is how we pleaded with the Government. Yet the hon. member in his speech said we had never asked for border industries. I mentioned these industries in my speech, as did the hon. member. Consequently, I do not want to repeat them all here now. The hon. member in his speech scratched around in the dustbin in my backyard. I wonder why he does not concern himself more with his own constituency? You know, Mr. Chairman, when the hon. member was elected member for Queenstown there were two industries there&#x2014;a furniture factory and a slipper factory. And today? To-day there is only one. The slipper factory had to close down because the hon. member did not help them. So, I do not blame him for casting his eyes to the East London area, the area which I represent, because we have improved conditions there during the past 24 months. Industries there have doubled whereas industries in his area have been halved by 50 per cent.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. member to explain to us what he means by &#x201C;border industries&#x201D;; which are these particular areas? I have not been successful as yet in drawing this information from the Government. But the hon. member represents the Government and ought therefore to know. I should also like to know whether he is prepared to support us on this side of the House in obtaining work for the thousands of jobless Natives already in the Ciskei and border. I should like to know whether he is prepared to oo-operate in establishing more industries so as to create work for all those Natives who will be repatriated under his Government&#x2019;s Policy, from the Western Cape to the Ciskei and border. I am very worried about this, especially in view of the fact that we cannot even cope with work for the natural increase of Natives in the Ciskei and border. How do hon. members opposite propose to find work also for the Natives who will be repatriated from the Western Cape and Western Province, according to them 5 per cent every year, to the Eastern Cape? The prospects are quite depressing to us in this area. Will the hon. member for Queenstown be prepared to support me and my colleagues on this side of the House in exploiting the coal fields of that area? I mention the coal fields of Indwe particularly, where there are thick seams of coal. Granted, the quality or grade of the coal can be queried but in any event it is not worse than the low grade coal already exploited in the Klerksdorp area. I have all the information here. The quality of coal mined in the Klerksdorp area is no better than the quality of coal available in very large quantities in the Queenstown or Indwe areas. This is in the hon. member&#x2019;s own constituency. We could use this coal to generate power. As I have said, we have seams of coal which compare as well as those in the Klerksdorp area. With the modern method of burning coal, by means of which coal in powder form can be blown into the furnaces, this can easily be done. The hon. member opposite sighs&#x2014;he seems to be tired. I know hon. members opposite are getting tired, but we on this side of the House are getting sick and tired of having to listen to all this talk about border industries and very little being done. Let me tell hon. members that we on this side of the House support decentralization and border industries&#x2014;as a matter of fact, we are supporting the establishment of industries anywhere in South Africa. But the difference is this &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I think we can congratulate the hon. member for Queenstown on his speech last week, because it has been a long time since I last saw hon. members of the Opposition in such difficulties over a speech as in this case. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, wanted to know where the border areas supposedly are, and what is actually being done in that regard. He also wanted to know whether the hon. member for Queenstown would see to it that the unemployed Bantu there are provided with work. But surely the reply to that is obvious. If the hon. Opposition is maintaining that they support border industries, let them support the removal of factories to those areas as well, and then there will be enough work for the Bantu. But the fact of the matter is that the Opposition has never up to now supported border industries.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The United Party, as a party, has up to now consistently opposed border industries. The hon. member&#x2019;s speech may be an exception. I challenge the Opposition to support border industries from this moment on and to take active steps to ensure that expansion takes place. Only if they have done that can they discuss this matter here. But in the past they have opposed the Government&#x2019;s policy in this regard throughout. I can quote one example after another from Hansard reports.</p>

<p>But the matter I actually want to broach, is our foreign trade, with special reference to the European Common Market. On 25th March, 1957 this market was established, with six countries, i.e. Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Germany, Italy and France participating. This market therefore represents a total of 185 million <span class="col_6373-6374" refersTo="page_0391"/>people. We know that their steel production to-day is equal to 70 per cent of the steel production of the U.S.A., and they are producing motor cars equal to 60 per cent of the production of the U.S.A. In addition, we also note that the annual exports of this European Common Market amount to R22,000 million, and this equals the exports of the U.S.A. If we take into consideration the fact that England may possibly enter that E.C.M., and she could be followed suit by a few other European countries, this community would have a total population of 280 million people, which is a great deal more than America&#x2019;s 200 million, or Russia&#x2019;s 220 million. In 1966 South Africa&#x2019;s imports from the E.C.M. were R328.7 million, whereas our exports were R223.1 million. If we compare this with the exports by the United Kingdom to South Africa, i.e. of R449.2 million as against our exports of R409.3 million, then one can see that there is still a tremendously great difference between our imports and our exports. If we consider that the population of England is only 55 million as against, as I have already said, the 185 million of the E.C.M., it is an indication of how we can trade with them on a large scale, and expand that market even further. Surely it is not necessary for me to point out the importance of this Common Market. South Africa now has ties with this organization, but we shall have to go very far to expand our imports as well as our exports in this country. Now my question is to what extent we are utilizing all the means at our disposal of expanding our trade with Europe? If we do not do so, we are going to suffer in future. All of us know that money talks, whether it is at home or abroad, but if we do not expand our trade with Western Europe a great deal more, it will not have that value for us which we should like it to have. That is why I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how far we have succeeded by means of exhibitions, overseas or local, in expanding our trade; secondly, how far we are making proper use of our businessmen who undertake overseas trips and businessmen who return from there, to expand our trade; and thirdly, how far we are utilizing the foreign Members of Parliament who come here, as we had last year from Australia and New Zealand, and formerly from other countries such as Canada. To what extent have we used these opportunities to organize matters properly, so that when those persons come to South Africa, we can bring the position to their attention properly, and do something positive to expand our trade?</p>

<p>In addition I want to point out that since some of our Members of Parliament will go abroad this year, it should be one of the priorities that attention should be given, not only in those parts, but also in other parts, such as America and the East, for the expansion of our trade. There are many things to which we can give attention. There are several things which definitely require attention, but I think that our trade with the outside world should receive top priority. If we could succeed in doing so, it could only be to our benefit.</p>

<p>I think we owe the Government a sincere vote of thanks for the tremendous amount of R4.1 million which has been set aside under this Vote this year to promote our exports, but the question still remains as to whether we will be able to co-ordinate all our strength, or whether we will be able to throw everything into it, and whether there is nothing more to be done. We owe the Government a vote of thanks for everything it has done, but we may never&#x2014;and I think the Opposition would agree with me here&#x2014;say, as a country, that we have now done enough to expand our trade. We have heard a great deal about our gold mines declining, and that one thing or the other will happen. Well, I see no danger in our gold mines declining in the very near future. It will quite probably take another 20 years before we reach that danger point, but as a result of new gold mines which may be discovered, as happened in the past, we may still have a major gold production, in spite of the fact that these dangers do exist. That is why I should like to advocate that the hon. the Minister give this matter his special attention, and I should also like to ascertain whether something more is being done. I want to let that suffice, and I just want to say that we are aware of the fact that major concessions are being made in respect of our taxation tariffs, etc., to afford our exporters the opportunity of expanding their exports. We are aware of all these tremendous concessions, but I want to repeat that we cannot leave it at that.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Sunnyside pleaded for increased trade with the Western world, and in this we clearly support him. Everyone in his senses would wish to see that we have as favourable a balance of trade as we possibly can. But I think we should be more ambitious; I think also of the Far East. I might just mention that if we want to begin trading with those areas, some of our businessmen will have to change their points of view. Last year I happened to be in Singapore and I was talking to very senior Chinese gentlemen there who wanted to trade actively with the rest of the world, and I asked them why they did not trade with South Africa. They said: &#x201C;But we have been there. We went to South Africa and when we got there we established contacts with some of our colleagues and they said to us : ‘Well, do not come to the office; it might be a bit awkward for you. You stay at the hotel and we will negotiate with you by telephone&#x2019;.&#x201D; These men went back and said that they had never encountered this in their lives before, i.e. to do business over the telephone in that way. I think it is very unfortunate that some of our businessmen should have reacted in this way, because Singapore is one of the thriving business centres of the world and there are very great opportunities for trade.</p>

<p><span class="col_6375-6376" refersTo="page_0392"/>But I want to turn to something else. Hon. members opposite always confront us with an either-or choice. In the field of race relations, for example, they tell us that in South Africa we can have either apartheid or integration, but there is nothing in between those two things. I want to extend those same tactics to the field of economics, and I want to suggest that in economics you have either a <i>laissez-faire</i> approach, a &#x201C;laat-maar-loop-benadering&#x201D;, or you have State capitalism. Now in contrast to the hon. member for Wonderboom, I do not use the term &#x201C;socialism&#x201D;, because socialism presupposes that you have extensive social services. I deliberately use the term &#x201C;State capitalism&#x201D;. If we accept that this is the choice before us, then I am also going to suggest that in South Africa at the moment there is every indication that we are moving rapidly in the direction of State capitalism, and I want to indicate two or three fields in which I (believe this manifests itself. It does so, first of all, in the massive proliferation of public corporations, like Phoscor, the Bantu Development Corporation and all the others, bodies which are clothed with the authority of the State but which have the operating flexibility of private enterprise. Some of these bodies were established by statute, but some of them have been brought into being merely by means of an executive decision. There are now more than 20 of them operating at the national level and in 1965 they were responsible for more than 25 per cent of gross capital formation in the public sector. These bodies have become State monopolies. Whereas ordinary industry is subject to the prescriptions of the Monopolistic Conditions Act of 1955, these corporations stand completely outside those provisions and they are growing all the time. They are becoming more and more massive and they are operating in fields where they were never intended to operate. Recently Mr. Roux, who is probably one of the foremost public administration scientists in South Africa, and who is on the staff of the University of South Africa, did a survey of these public corporations. In dealing with the National Development Corporation and with Iscor, and to illustrate the point I have just made, he wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And almost in total defiance of the principle of parliamentary supremacy &#x2026;</block>

<p>He should have added &#x201C;also of public accountability&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; some corporations like Iscor and the N.D.C. have been allowed to create and acquire, and their creations in turn have been allowed to create and acquire in their turn, organizationally obfuscating proliferations of. semi-autonomous enterprises of diverse kinds. Iscor, basically a primary producer of iron and steel, has its tentacles in and around various commodity-producing concerns, engineering enterprises, farms, hunting resorts, country clubs, hotels and sales companies, etc.</block>

<p>Sir, this surely was not what was intended. But I think the worst indictment of the whole system also comes from Mr. Roux, and this comes not from a politician; it comes from an objective outside scientist. In dealing with the whole system of public corporations in South Africa this is how he concludes his article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The existing control system comprising unverifiable annual reports, rudimentary annual financial statements, and part-time ministerial supervision, has proved to be totally inadequate in preserving and honouring the basic principles of public administration in a democratic society.</block>

<p>I do not think there has ever been a worse indictment of this system than this particular one. He, of course, also prescribes the remedies, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept these remedies which he indicates as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we need in South Africa is first of all a thorough appraisal of our whole public institutional network; next, a special evaluation and perhaps rationalization of existing public corporations, and finally, periodic efficiency auditing of all public corporations, not by some new body, but by personnel of existing State Departments&#x2014;for example, the Controller and Auditor-General&#x2019;s Department.</block>

<p>I am doubtful, Sir, whether the hon. the Minister will accept this advice because from what I can gather from the 1948 manifesto of the party on the other side, they said, amongst other things, that ultimately all economic power must be in the hands of the State, and it seems to me that this is precisely what they are heading for. Indeed, in terms of the draft Republican Constitution they went even further.</p>

<p>But there is a second way in which this tendency towards State capitalism manifests itself and that is in all the controls which emanate from the Government as far as industry is concerned. There is no doubt that the industrialists in South Africa to-day have to contend with a greater degree of labour rigidity than obtains in any other free enterprise system in the world, because every single thing that affects the non-white worker in South Africa is subject to Government control. In the manufacturing industry 80 per cent of the workers are non-white; in mining it is 90 per cent and in agriculture it is 90 per cent, so practically everything that happens in industry is subject to Government control. If you want to employ one additional Bantu in the Western Cape, you have to go to four different Government Departments or some of their ancillary services. So we have here a system of industrialization through bureaucratic <span class="col_6377-6378" refersTo="page_0393"/>control; we have a system of economic development on the triplicate system.</p>

<p>As a result of all this you find that the number of people in South Africa who are taken up by the State and its ancillary services is also growing. Experts estimate that at the moment in the civil services, all the public corporations and all the ancillary groups to which I have referred, there are about 500,000 people working. If you assume that each and everyone of these has at least one dependant, then it means that over a million people in South Africa are dependent for their livelihood upon the Government and its ancillary services. Our total voting strength in South Africa is 1,900,000. More than half of the voters in South Africa are thus dependent upon the Government for their livelihood, with results on their political independence that one can only speculate upon. Sir, the challenge I pose to the hon. the Minister is to mention one other free enterprise system in the world where 50 per cent of the voters are dependent upon the Government because they work for the Government. We find in South Africa that a bigger slice of our national income is being channelled through the Government and its ancillary services than in any other free enterprise system in the world.

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity of lending the argument made by the hon. member for Queenstown, my whole-hearted support. On the other hand I cannot omit to state emphatically how concerned we are about the attitude which the hon. member for East London (North) was still adopting this afternoon. Over the years the attitude of the United Party has consistently been to oppose border industry expansion on the one hand, and to present it in a ridiculous light in South Africa and in the outside world on the other. It is with the greatest contempt that I want to mention the methods they used&#x2014;and I know what I am talking about&#x2014;when they intimidated the industrialists in South Africa in regard to the removal to the border areas. I regret having to admit this afternoon that they did so with a large measure of success, but thank the Lord there were industrialists in this country who undertook the pioneering work, and who were able to indicate to South Africa and to the world that there was in fact something to say for border industrial development. Mr. Chairman, the party on the opposite side went further; because it suited their purpose, they stirred up the white worker against this idea. Hon. members on the opposite side told the white workers of South Africa that a process was under way here which would deprive the white workers of their work. They succeeded in that as well. Whether I should congratulate them or abhor them, I do not know. But fortunately there were in this case as well industrialists and workers who did not allow themselves to be intimidated with this idea and who continued along this course in a way which really does not redound to the credit of hon. members on that side, and which in point of fact represents them in an unfavourable light. Hon. members of the Opposition told us with extravagant gestures that they believed in decentralization of industries but that it should take place on a purely economic basis.</p>

<p>I also say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, but let hon. members on the opposite side demonstrate to me where decentralization has taken place in any country in the world on a purely economic basis. I agree with the hon. member for East London (North) and other hon. members on the opposite side that it should take place on an economic basis, but it cannot take place on a purely economic basis. We want to have industrial decentralization take place on an economic basis&#x2014;and I am going to say something about that in a moment&#x2014;but we also, with this policy of ours, want to safeguard the traditional way of life in South Africa, now and in the future. We want to admit, because economic factors play a role, that it is easier to establish border industries in certain areas than in others, and in those areas where it has been easier to do so, we have already achieved success on a tremendous scale. Sir, it is at this juncture that I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Queenstown. Where he pleaded for his area, I am pleading for the area from which I come. We are situated adjacent to the homeland of Herschel, and my plea is that border industrial development should also take place there. No, as a result of socio-economic circumstances, border industrial settlement must take place. We want to admit that it should take place economically, and that it will not be as easy to do so as it was to establish the border industries at Rosslyn and Hammarsdale, but with the determination of this Government we will ultimately succeed in doing that as well. We want to make this one important statement, which was also made by the hon. the Minister of Finance, not so long ago. We in South Africa are prepared to bend certain economic laws, but we can give hon. members on the opposite side the assurance &#x2014;and we can give the world outside the same assurance&#x2014;that this Government will never be so foolish as to bend an economic law to such an extent that it breaks; we will not even bend an economic law to such an extent that it breaks. We have testimony to the effect that our development is of such a nature that it is a model for the rest of the world. We shall continue along our course; we shall maintain it steadily. We want to inform the citizens of South Africa that they can have every confidence in this Government, as they were also able to do in the past. They can know that its policy will be implemented with the greatest circumspection. Our traditional way of life <span class="col_6379-6380" refersTo="page_0394"/>will be implemented both now and in future, without South Africa suffering economically.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to plead, as I have already done on former occasions, for backward areas in South Africa where, owing to circumstances over which nobody had any control, a steady white development is taking place, and I am referring here in particular to the south-eastern Free State. Border area settlement in those areas offers a solution to the problems existing there.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members on that side, including the hon. member for Smithfield, seem to confuse two principles in their minds. One is the decentralization of industries and the other is the establishment of border industries; one includes the other. If at a certain place there is a favourable atmosphere for the establishment of border industries, then by all means establish them, and I presume the hon. member for Smithfield would like to have Smithfield included in the decentralization of industry. It is not only for border industries that we want decentralization, but we have to follow the modern world in decentralizing generally. That is what we had in mind.</p>

<p>I should like to raise two points, and I shall try to be brief. One is I should like to ask the Minister what progress has been made in the introduction generally of the metric system of weights and measures. We have received this excellent report from the S.A.B.S. dated 1965, that is three years ago, and the atmosphere for the introduction of a metric system was much more favourable than I ever thought was possible; it was exceedingly favourable. What surprised me especially was that the engineering industry were quite prepared to adopt and introduce a metric system of weights and measures. I should like to know what the hon. the Minister has done. I see there is provision in the Estimates for subsidies to be granted for the introduction of the metric system. I should like to know how far we have gone. Of course, introducing a metric system of weights and measures has certain advantages over introducing a decimal system of coinage, because in a decimal system of coinage one has to have a D-day, but in introducing a metric system of weights and measures we can introduce it over a period. I should like to know what progress has been made, because three years of that period have now elapsed. That is my first point.</p>

<p>My second point deals with the local film industry. Here I should like to refer the Minister to Sub-head J on page 257 of the Estimates. We had a speech here this afternoon from the hon. member for Germiston (District)&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here now&#x2014;on the film industry. I am also interested in a way in the film industry, not as a producer of films but in the money that is granted in subsidies. What are we doing here? We are voting money, the ancient privilege of Parliament. The reason really for the creation of Parliament was the right to vote, or withhold, money. We are being asked to vote money here. Well, if we are voting money, we like to know how the money is to be spent, to whom are we granting funds, where are we spending it? I refer to item &#x201C;J&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Financial Assistance to the Local Film Industry&#x2014; R400,000&#x201D;. Last year it was R518,500. I put a question on the Order Paper the other day, and this is the question: &#x201C;What was the amount paid during 1967-&#x2019;68 in subsidies to the local film industry?&#x201D; I think that is quite fair. This was the answer: About R400,000 (that is correct to three figures). I asked the further question: &#x201C;To which firms were subsidies granted, and what was the amount in each case?&#x201D; This was the reply: &#x201C;This information concerns individual firms and is considered confidential. I am, however, prepared to furnish the information to the hon. member on request on a confidential basis&#x201D;. I do not wish to have any information in this House on a confidential basis and I sincerely trust that hon. members on the other side are not receiving information on a confidential basis, under the lap, because that is contrary to the whole tradition of Parliament. That was my question. In other words, that was the information the Minister was not prepared to give. I then asked this: &#x201C;To which firms is it proposed to pay subsidies in 1968-&#x2019;69?&#x201D; That is the R400,000 appearing on the Estimates to which I referred. I am accustomed to the Estimates for Education, and there we are told to which institutions the money is to be paid. I want to know to which film firms is this money to be paid? I ask that as a member of Parliament; this House is in Committee of Supply, and I want to know. This is the answer I got: &#x201C;I regret that it is not possible at this stage to furnish the required information, even on a confidential basis, except that it may be mentioned that the provision asked for for this purpose on the Vote of my Department for 1968-&#x2019;69 is based on information thus far furnished by eight firms&#x201D;. Who are these eight firms; who is going to get the money? I want the Minister to tell us frankly this afternoon who were the firms that got the money last year and to which firms does he intend to give a subsidy this year? That is fair. Moreover, why are they being subsidized? The hon. member for Germiston (District) made an appeal for assistance to industries. I am not discussing that. I am not discussing whether his appeal is justified or not; what I am asking is this: It is the privilege of Parliament to know, when we vote money, for what reason we are voting it and who is the recipient. I should like to know this afternoon the reply to my question.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS.</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Kensington must excuse me now if, in the first instance, I do not react to his speech, since I should like to refer to another subject in the debate. I want to refer to a subject which was recently touched upon again by the hon. member for Simonstown, <span class="col_6381-6382" refersTo="page_0395"/>i.e. the False Bay situation, if I can call it that. From time to time the hon. member raises that subject, and it is one of the matters which he spices slightly with politics to try and attract a little attention in that specific area. At one stage an arrangement was laid down in respect of the False Bay situation, and we thought that we would all respect the two-mile arrangement. Recently the hon. member for Simonstown&#x2014;and I find it a pity that he is not here now&#x2014;came forward once again and said something in this regard. I find it significant that he involved another hon. member, the hon. member for Kimberley (North), with him. I found it admirable that brothers can sometimes live so amicably together. They insisted that a new regulation be laid down in respect of the False Bay situation. Now I am glad to say that after discussions were held by both parties, the Department made an admirable arrangement in respect of this situation. Provisional discussions were held, and an arrangement was made which is known to both groups at this stage.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the mutual arrangement which has now been agreed to, is the arrangement to which we will in future have to adhere. In respect of that hon. member I should like to mention these two basic matters. I know that it was a question of give and take here. Seen from their side, the trawler fishing industry was not unwilling to compromise in this situation. The hon. member for Simonstown and his people must bear two basic facts in mind. The first is that the scientific evidence in the past in respect of this situation does not favour them. It was significant that the former directory of Sea Fisheries, and also the present Director, as far as I know, gave evidence which did not support the False Bay people. In spite of that I maintain that we have a situation here which has to be met. The trawler fishing industry is prepared to make certain concessions in this regard.</p>

<p>However, I want to mention a second basic point, which is one that presents a danger. I do not think we in South Africa should arrive at the position of trying to zone our long coastline. If we zone our 2,000 mile long coastline, I think we would be creating a precedent which will simply cause us to find ourselves in an unenviable position. When we ponder this situation we must keep these basic facts in mind. I should like to inquire therefore whether any finality has been reached in this regard and whether the arrangement will be of such a nature that both groups will try on their part to adhere to it.</p>

<p>I should also like to make a few further remarks about the fishing industry in general. I want to thank the hon. the Minister and bis Department for what has been achieved in the past few years in regard to fishing harbour facilities along our coastline. In respect of places like Saldanha Sandy Point and others, the Department has in the past few years really been doing their best. We can look back with pride at the earnestness with which the hon. the Minister and his Department looked after the interests of our fishing industry in respect of this specific facet in the past. But I want to go further this afternoon and enter this plea, that we will in future place more emphasis on the Sea Fisheries section. One cannot escape the impression that this section is under the present circumstances, not always keeping pace with the present tempo of the sea fisheries industry. I want to enter a plea to the effect that we will in future allow greater emphasis than ever before in the past to fall on this specific section, which I shall call research. I am saying this for two reasons.</p>

<p>In the first instance it is true that our fishing industry, and to take a broader view, our marine industry, comprises one of our most important economic facets in our country today. Here in the Western Cape it is one of the three pillars on which our entire economy rests. Now there are people who are becoming pessimistic about this industry and its future. It has been said from time to time that certain facets of this industry are going downhill, and that we are exhausting fish resources of this part of the world. But if one makes a global analysis of this industry over the past few years, then it is obvious that there has been a growth in scope and in intensity. I want to quote a few figures to prove my statement. As far as pelagic fish are concerned approximately 82,000 tons were caught in 1948. In 1956 this amount had increased to 421,000 tons and in 1964 to 1,229,800 tons. In 1966 1,183,557 tons were caught. In 1948, 46,610 tons of trawler fish were caught. This increased to 140,450 tons in 1966, which is the most recent figure which I have been able to obtain.</p>

<p>As regards the snoek industry, there has never been a situation where this industry was completely on the downgrade. On the contrary, there were clear signs of growth, also in regard to the smaller facets of the industry. In 1948 we caught 17,280 tons of crayfish, and this increased to 21,000 tons in 1966. I want to make a remark in passing about this specific facet of the industry. I also want to congratulate the Department in this regard on what has been achieved in the past few years in respect of the control of this specific industry. I think our crayfish industry has during the past few years been placed under sound control and we can be proud of what has been achieved. There are a few minor proposals in this regard which will have to be considered. To a large extent our coastline is being protected to-day against those fortune hunters who, from time to time, flocked to these areas and caught crayfish there. I think we will have to think further along these lines so that we will at least <i>get</i> the smaller crayfish dinghies licensed. I think that will be one <span class="col_6383-6384" refersTo="page_0396"/>method of effecting better control over this facet of the industry.</p>

<p>I want to point out that the collection of abalone has increased during the past few years. The catching of sharks has also increased. Taken in general our marine industry has not decreased in importance. In 1963 there were 85 bottom-trawlers in our waters, and this increased to 162 last year, when a catch of 138,407 tons of trawler fish, to the value of more than R7 million, was made. Progress was made in regard to marine products as well. Since 1948 the total value of processed marine products grew from R8 million to approximately R75 million last year. In general therefore all signs point to growth and progress in this specific industry. I want to repeat therefore that our marine industry is to-day one of the most important cornerstones of our economy.</p>

<p>In addition there is a second reason why I am pleading for greater scientific support to be given to this specific industry. It is obvious that the foreign powers are, in spite of high operational costs, finding it increasingly lucrative to keep large fishing fleets operative in our waters. The figures indicate that in 1965 Spain, Russia and Japan, together, caught more than 500,000 tons of fish in the South East Atlantic Ocean. Good results since indicate that these foreign fishing fleets are from time to time achieving greater success than ever before. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say to the hon. member who has just sat down, that his remarks about the hon. member for Simonstown are quite unwarranted. I think the hon. member would be well advised not to spoil contributions such as he has just made, by making personal references suggesting that other hon. members are raising matters purely for political ends.</p>

<p>I should like to raise the question of the development of the Northern Cape region of which Kimberley is the main city. In doing so, I want to go back a little, into history, and support the plea made by the hon. member for East London (North). While the war was at its worst in 1942, public figures in that part of the country put their heads together to try to find ways and means of entering the brave new world, which the war was going to produce. They decided first of all that what they would have to have was a plentiful supply of cheap power.</p>

<p>They had reasons advanced by the authorities that there was no suitable coal. I mention this to emphasize the point made by the hon. member for East London (North). We advocated and urged, that the low-grade coal, known as the rubbish coal in those days, at Klerksdorp, at Vierfontein to be exact, should be utilized. It is now acknowledged that it was not only feasible but has been utilized, and that a vast network of power lines radiates from that power station to-day, bringing power to Kimberley, 300 miles away, and taking power to Postmasburg and to Hotazel. The railway line has also been electrified. A power line is presently being constructed to Upington from the same source, and there is another major power line going through the Western Orange Free State, where the junction is at Perseus near Dealesville. That line will be extended further south. I raise this matter because it goes to show that there are men who are not in the political world and who are concerned about the development of various parts of the country. Kimberley and its environs are just as much in difficulty, as are the people in East London. There are over 40,000 Bantu in the city and 26,000 Coloured people. Although the city is described as a growth point by Government spokesmen of whom the hon. the Minister has been one from time to time, nothing happens. We have urged and pleaded, that a steelworks should be established in the region, and we selected a site at Barkly West. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why the reports in connection with these projects are not made public, so that whatever the disabilities or disadvantages may be, the people on the spot can look at them. The position of the Northern Cape has reached such a stage that seven Nationalist members of Parliament, namely the hon. members for Vryburg, Kimberley (North), Kimberley (South), Kuruman, Gordonia, Prieska and De Aar, came together and discussed the matter with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I would like the hon. the Minister to know that the entire region is most bitterly disappointed at the lack of action on the part of the hon. the Minister to the representations made by these hon. gentlemen. When a group of members of Parliament of the governing party, makes representations to an hon. Minister, who is well-acquainted with the difficulties and the details of what is wanted there, and gets a refusal by means of a letter, which was concise only in its vagueness, one realizes that the Government has neglected that part of the country most shabbily for 20 years. My plea to-day is that the hon. the Minister must tell us, whether we can expect anything at all, or whether the region must look after itself and perhaps ask for a little bit of separate development. Information as recent as last Monday, is that the Railways is carting away 60,000 tons of iron ore and manganese a day for export. Surely we have not reached the sorry stage that a country like this, which is bursting at its seams can allow raw materials to be moved out on that scale and be exported to countries, which manufacture the finished article and then sell it back to us? The hon. the Minister has failed in his duty in regard to the development of the Northern Cape region in no small way.</p>

<p>As long as 20 years ago, the cities and towns there started to plan on the assurances of various spokesmen from the Government. They planned their cities, cleaned up the slums, overhauled the water and power supplies, <span class="col_6385-6386" refersTo="page_0397"/>built roads, made the place habitable and decent and did everything that was possible and which was urged upon them to do. I now see in the correspondence which passed between the hon. the Minister and those seven M.P.&#x2019;s that social considerations are going to be taken into account when the decision in regard to the steelworks is finally made. I am not concerned about the actual site of the third steelworks, of Iscor, but I think that it is time, that the Government should make known what the reports of the Development Corporation and the other corporations which investigated propositions put forward by local authorities in their region, are. We should know what is happening, and also the whys and wherefores of it. I say, quite plainly, that we can no longer accept the statement made by the hon. the Minister in his letter to these gentlemen that the matter is being further investigated. I do not think any further investigations are necessary. I think the hon. the Minister is bucking the decision. He has to make a decision. We have heard so much this afternoon about industry. We are great believers; and always have been, in decentralization. But let us see some decentralization, and let it be genuine. Let it be the sort of thing, which will make for prosperity for all concerned, and not in pursuit of a political ideology. These are the matters which exercise the minds of the people in the region for which I now speak.</p>

<p>I believe that the proposition, as put before the Government, for the extension of the railway&#x2014;from a point Postmasburg to Sishen to a suitable port on the West Coast&#x2014;is not a fairytale. It is not something which is so high in the clouds that it is beyond possibility. I believe that it has to be looked at in the same way as Mr. Harold Morris, to whom I now pay a tribute, was responsible for the whole idea of developing the Vierfontein low-grade coal, to provide a network of power for the whole of the Western Free State, much of the gold fields in the Free State and all of the Northern Cape, enabling the mining companies that are there to-day, to mine on a scale and at a price which makes it competitive. Therefore I ask the Minister, when he replies, please to say, once and for all, whether Kimberley and the Northern Cape regions can expect anything from the Government in any shape or form, or whether they must now rely entirely upon their own resources, and get on as best they can, with what they have, where they are. I believe that the departments responsible are far behind public opinion, and I think the Minister should see the signal, when it becomes necessary for eight members of Parliament of his own party, to wait upon him and plead with him as to what should be done. The hon. the Minister knows quite well what the feelings and the ambitions of that part of the country are. He will recall appearing on a public platform with me, at the opening of the Northern Cape Development Congress in Kimberley about six years ago. He made a brave speech. He told them that everything would be investigated. Matters would be looked into. Utopia was at hand. Happy days were ahead. Prosperity was round the corner. Well, it is a long road that has no turning, and we are hoping that to-day we shall see the turning and will meet up with this prosperity, which is around the comer.</p>

<p>Kimberley has a long and proud record in this country. It has been the centre of tremendous mining activity. It has produced untold wealth, which has been the foundation of the development of this country as a whole, dating back as far as 1871. From the Government we have had little or nothing over the years, and over the last 20 years even less, with the notable exception of the Minister of Defence, who has made a start.

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>I can reply in two sentences to what the hon. member for Karoo has said.</p>

<p>In the first place I am delighted to know that, when he speaks on behalf of the Opposition, there is at least on the part of the Opposition as well now, a little enthusiasm for the manufacture of steel in South Africa. I can recall only too well what a struggle there was when a steel factory had to be built, when Iscor had to be established. I can recall the terrible resistance on the part of the Opposition, but now, fortunately, they are enthusiastic about the erection of a second Iscor. But, in the second place, I now want to ask the hon. member, who is an old and experienced member, and who has advocated that a decisive reply should now be given and that a site should be determined on in good time for the establishment of the second Iscor, where he gets his sense of responsibility from to propose a thing like that. On the contrary, I want to say that I think the entire country ought to convey its thanks to the Minister and to the Government precisely because of the fact that they have not paid any heed to the appeals from all sides to determine where the site should be. Can the hon. member imagine what would happen if this Government was to state that this steel factory would be erected in the vicinity of Witbank, experience has taught us what will happen. Land prices will soar, and there will be speculation which will not be to the advantage of the State, and capitalists will exploit private people for their own gain. I believe that the way in which the Government acted is the only correct mode of action, and that this future planning of Iscor should only be made public when there will be no opportunity for exploitation or speculation, which will prejudice land owners there, which can prejudice the State and which will benefit only that handful of people who have large resources of capital.</p>

<p>I want to leave it at that and request the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s friendly attention for a matter which is arousing a little concern at the moment amongst local authorities in certain regions. This is the activities of the electricity control board and the way in which the planning<span class="col_6387-6388" refersTo="page_0398"/> of its work is being carried out. I want to say that I welcome it gladly that the Electricity Control Board and the Electricity Supply Commission is undertaking the utilization of electricity in our country on the scale on which they have done during the past few years. I think this is the kind of work which is done without publicity, but which brought about an enormous change in our country, i.e. the fact that electricity has been supplied cheaply to smaller towns and communities and the fact that electricity as an essential commodity is to-day being made available on farms where it is essential for proper development. When I say that there is a little concern, I want to state in the first place that this is not intended as criticism of the way in which expansion is taking place, but in any case as a suggestion which in my opinion deserves consideration, when thought is given to future planning.</p>

<p>As an example I want to take what is happening in the vicinity of Pretoria and in the vicinity of Bloemfontein. Escom is asked to supply a specific area with electricity, and it is perhaps impossible for a local authority, at such a stage, to comply with the wishes of the people in its vicinity. Then the Electricity Control Board steps in and electricity is supplied to such a region. But there is a second possibility, and that is that such a local authority was perhaps merely temporarily incapable of complying with the wishes expressed by the people in the vicinity, but that it could in fact do so at a later stage. This results in there being two suppliers in a specific area, whose work is overlapping, which is prejudicial to both, as well as to the community.</p>

<p>To return to Bloemfontein, people on the smallholdings are asking for electricity to be supplied to them, and Escom is supplying it. At any given time Bloemfontein is capable of supplying that area from its own generating plant. Now it must be able to do so for individual consumers in competition with a State undertaking, with the result that friction arises between a State Department and a local authority, something which is absolutely unnecessary. I am aware that the question of the provision of electricity by local authorities is also part of the investigation undertaken by the Borckenhagen Committee, which still has to make its report, but I believe that because of the long time this inquiry is taking the Electricity Control Board and Escom should at this stage go into this matter seriously, before an undertaking is given to supply an area with power, and that proper negotiations take place with the local authority or whatever body has generators in the immediate vicinity which they can possibly utilize for such distribution.</p>

<p>Linking up with this I want to ask in the second place whether it is possible to give consideration to a change in the system whereby local authority areas give Escom and the Electricity Control Board the right to grant preferential tariffs for the sale of electricity to industries at a lower rate than the local authority. There are justified complaints, I think, that local authorities expect to undertake the network for consumers, such as house owners and other small consumers, whereas the major supply of electricity, in which the actual profit lies, i.e. to such as industries and mills, etc., is being retained by Escom. Now I am aware of the fact that this agreement can only be cancelled with the consent of both parties under the old contract, according to the old way in terms of which the supply of power was undertaken, but I feel myself at liberty to ask that thought be given to this matter of having an amendment of the act which would at least make it possible for local authorities, when they take over the supply of electricity in their area of jurisdiction to take over all supply of power, including the supply to industries, even if they have to decide on a preferential tariff which they can grant to large consumers.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I will leave the plea of the hon. member for Witbank with the hon. the Minister, because I want to discuss with this Minister a subject with which I think this Government has been toying. I speak of containerization. I know that the hon. the Minister will tell me that he has appoined a committee, but what a wishy-washy manner in which it has been appointed, and what a wishy-washy statement was put out to the Press in connection with its appointment! Let me just give hon. members an insight into the statement which was given to the Press&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Government has announced the appointment of a technical working group to consider the question of containerization at South African ports. The group will consist of representatives of the Department of Commerce, the Railways, the Perishable Products Export Control Board and the South African Conference Lines.</block>

<p>And this is the important point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of the group is to investigate and report on the trends in containerization over the main sea routes of the world and the feasibility of introducing containerization to and from South Africa. Because of a large and relatively low-paid non-white labour force, costs of handling cargo at South African ports are much lower than at European ports.</block>

<p>What a shocking statement, Sir! First of all, does not this committee or this Government believe that we are on one of the main sea routes of the world? It wants to investigate the main sea routes and loses sight of the fact that we are on one of the main sea routes of the world, the link between East and West. Then it says that we need not hurry, because we have such a large non-white labour force which works so cheaply that we do not have to worry about these modern methods which might cost money. I want this Minister to <span class="col_6389-6390" refersTo="page_0399"/>realize one thing, that the pace in containerization will be set, not by his Government and his Department, but by the other countries of the world with which we trade. This Government has been very lax in its approach to this matter. Look what trouble even our own South African companies have taken. Look what one of our coaster companies has done. They have put out a complete brochure to encourage their people to package their goods properly, to containerize them so that they can be conveyed cheaper and more expeditiously up and down our coast. Here Mr. Grindrod has put out a paper, which I hope the hon. the Minister has read, because when I communicated with his Department to find out whether we were represented on certain world bodies, the lack of knowledge of containerization was so great that it shocked me, and I realized that unless some special steps were taken, we in South Africa are going to be left right behind. This is the world trend, as shown in this book put out by the Port of New York authorities. The headlines are: &#x201C;Container shipping; full ahead&#x201D;. And what does it say? It gives extracts from the Press all over the world, all dealing with containerization. I hope the Minister has some of this literature. I hope he has studied it, and I hope he is going to decide to speed up containerization. Sir, I hope the hon. the Minister is listening to me. No, he is not even listening. You see, Sir, that is why we in South Africa do not get any further. [Interjection.] But unfortunately my time is limited and it is being wasted at the moment because the Minister is not listening to me. South Africa should welcome containerization and South Africa should get with it as quickly as possible, because in containerization might well be the solution of many of our problems. It might be a solution to the congestion of our ports, because one of the main objectives of containerization is to save time in the turnaround of ships. Let me quote from the Cunard Line, which has gone into a big combine with four other world shipping companies. This is what was said by Mr. Bates, the container manager. Talking about containerization, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In it alone we see the ultimate rewards of a real improvement in service to our trade, the promise of stable freight rates, and finally a reasonable return on our assets. In the Midlands we are already reaping the first fruits of such a policy.</block>

<p>I can go on quoting from book after book on this whole question. This is what Mr. Perkins, the Director-General of the Port of London Authority, had to say. He started his speech by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an age when the majority of general cargo will travel in containers, the cost of sea transport will be substantially reduced.</block>

<p>He accepts it here. I cannot read it all, because I do not have the time. But let us come nearer home. Let us quote Mr. Bamford, the chairman of Safmarine, in an address in Johannesburg on 20th May, 1968. I hope the hon. the Minister will take the trouble to get the whole of his speech. If he has not got it, I will let him have a copy of it. He says this. It is a long speech and I cannot quote all of it, but he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will also mean that containerization in strength will be attempted sooner than expected on trade routes not so readily offering themselves for this kind of business in the earlier stages. South Africa, therefore, is likely to come into the picture sooner than would otherwise be the case. Cargoes to and from our shores are not entirely homogenous, but the volume is great and containerization is said to be suitable for some three-quarters of traffic in both directions.</block>

<p>So I can go on and on, and I can quote from authority after authority, but the point I want to make with the Minister is that we do not have to, as is said in this Press statement, &#x201C;investigate and report on it from time to time&#x201D;. Those are the words he used when replying to a question I put to him. But here is a most important conference, a symposium taking place in London in May, the International Container Symposium. We in South Africa are represented, but not because of the Government. It was just because Mr. Kurt Gundelfinger was going to be there on another job. He is protecting our interests, but I am quite sure the Minister&#x2019;s Department was not there. Yet he has a committee supposed to be investigating this matter. I think he has slipped on a dozen things on which he should have been represented.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder whether that is so. When the hon. the Minister gets up, let him show me that he understands anything about containers, because up to now, and this is not the first time I have raised the matter, I have not been able to get one word in regard to the plans of this Government in regard to what they intend doing about containerization. The only news, and the latest news, I have had from this Government is this Press statement in which they say that this committee will report from time to time on the feasibility of introducing containerization to and from South Africa. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that if his Government does not catch up with containerization, if it is not in the forefront, our exports from South Africa are going to suffer on the world markets, because the shipping companies are looking to this type of handling of goods, whether it be fruit&#x2014;because containers are also refrigerated, as the hon. the Minister knows&#x2014;or any other of our exports, excepting <span class="col_6391-6392" refersTo="page_0400"/>bulk cargoes. Unless we are in a position to enter into the container trade when others do we are not going to be able to compete on the world markets. This is why I am raising the question of containerization, not because it is perhaps an «unusual subject in this House, but because it is one of the most important things that is happening in the world of transport to-day, whether it ibe at sea, on land or in the air. The hon. the Minister will know that in the new transport aircraft, goods have to be containerized in some form or other, whether it be on a special pallet or whether it be in a special container. Otherwise in the case of transport by air, by cargo planes, one line cannot compete with a line which properly packages goods before they are loaded on to the aircraft. Sir, I am not talking just about ships; I am talking about every means of transport in every country in the world, whether it be by sea, by air, by road or by rail. Time is important; time is the great factor and that is what I am trying to impress upon the hon. the Minister. You do not just bring these things to the port and pack them into containers. The packaging of goods of a like kind must be done inland or where they are produced, and whilst this appears to be a disadvantage it is in fact a great advantage because you can decentralize the congestion which usually goes with a port or a place of despatch and you can spread that over the country far better than you can without containers.

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>I listened very carefully to the hon. member for Umlazi, but I must honestly say that I do not think his speech contained very much. I shall therefore leave it to the hon. the Minister to see whether there is anything in that little tin can of his.</p>

<p>I should like to broach another matter with the hon. the Minister, which is the complaints which are being received to an increasing extent from consumers to the effect that new domestic articles are being delivered in a very defective condition. Owing to the system of mass production in operation in the country and the growing market in South Africa, the tendency exists amongst certain factories to neglect the proper finishing off of their articles. In this way the public is being shamefully exploited by certain manufacturers, and I wonder whether it is not time the Government began protecting the public in some way or other against exploitation as a result of articles which are very poorly finished off, and which are then delivered in that condition to the client. Mr. Chairman, over the years this tendency has also cropped up in Britain, particularly in respect of false and misleading descriptions of and advertisements about consumer articles. Such false claims will now be prohibited by a new Bill which was introduced this year into the British Lower House, namely the Protection of Consumers Bill. I would just like to mention a few examples to you of faulty domestic articles which I have heard about. One of my voters told me that the shelves of a new refrigerator which he had just bought, did not fit, and that some of the shelves had collapsed with foodstuffs and all. An automatic washing machine which breaks down at frequent intervals, while the automatic part was out of operation for a long time, is another case. A friend bought a set of flyscreens, for example, but the frames were so defective that hundreds of flies, moths and other insects continued to come in through the screens. When he wrote to the company about this, he was informed in a letter that his best solution would be to buy himself a good insecticide.</p>

<p>Another question which irritates the public is the so-called guarantees which are provided with new motor cars and which are causing a great deal of dissatisfaction. The owners of new motor cars must make their complaints to the dealer from whom they purchased the motor car, and if he cannot iron out the defects and faults properly, one is then left holding the baby. I know of a case where a man purchased a new motor car and had to take the motor car back to the dealer six times to have a door repaired which would not close properly. Only after the sixth attempt was the door satisfactorily repaired. If one takes a new motor car to a different dealer of the same company then he often refuses to repair the defect because the motor car had not «been purchased from him. If one takes the motor car to one&#x2019;s own, trustworthy mechanic, one forfeits the guarantee. Then there are also the guarantees which are given on new household items. An electric stove of one of my voters began to give trouble precisely 12f months after it had been purchased, just after the guarantee period had elapsed. I know that all mechanical equipment must ultimately wear out, but it is strange that a factory could display such engineering skill, so that the stove began to give trouble only after the guarantee period had elapsed. The Government ought to do something about these manufacturers who so readily give long-term guarantees, to try and hold them to such guarantees. Then I want to refer to what the Americans call built-in obsolescence. This is also a serious charge which is being levelled against manufacturers. I know of a case where a person purchased a floor polisher. The housewife used it for quite a while and it was still in an excellent condition, but then she had to replace the brushes. She tried everywhere to find replacements and ultimately she learned from the company that they were no longer manufacturing that model of floor polisher and that the spare parts were therefore unobtainable.</p>

<p>Then I should also like to broach the question of the repair services which are offered by some agents of electrical equipment. Many of these are simply terrible, and I wonder whether the Government cannot introduce <span class="col_6393-6394" refersTo="page_0401"/>some form of protection or other for the public.</p>

<p>While I am talking about repair work, there is another matter I want to raise and that is the question of motor repairs. I think this is something which got out of hand in this country a long time ago. The public seldom receives repair work to-day which can be regarded as entirely satisfactory. If one takes it up with the garages, then the blame is continually being put on the shortage of manpower. Some garage owners say that as a result of the former low tariffs for repair work they could not afford to appoint capable and good motor mechanics because they could not pay them enough. That was the time when repair work still cost R1.50 per hour, but now, in urban areas such as Johannesburg, there are garages which are virtually all charging R4 per hour for motor repair work, but despite this the service has not improved. What often happens is that one mechanic works on three or four motor cars at the same time. What happens is that the Bantu assistant at each motor car is simply told what is wrong and then the Bantu begins to loosen this and tighten that, and the white motor mechanic returns from time to time to see how things are progressing and to give advice and tell the Bantu assistant what should be done further. I think the only way of eliminating this poor service is to grade the motor repair shops in the country according to a classification system, in the same way as the hotel board grades hotels. If we grade the garages doing repair work, I think we will receive better repair services.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Government could not now at last adopt a firm line of action to induce South African motor car manufacturers to see to it that Afrikaans is also accorded its rightful place on the indicator buttons and the dashboards of motor cars. This is a matter which has already been broached in the past. There is a strong feeling amongst the public in regard to this matter, and I can inform you that the Afrikaans-speaking public who support the overseas companies, are gradually becoming incensed at the fact that they have to drive their motor cars in English. It is a disgrace that our language should be neglected to such an extent in the motoring world and this matter ought to be rectified. We have been asking for this for a long time, and I wonder whether pressure cannot be exerted on these overseas motor car manufacturers by the Government.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not intend to follow the hon. member. I felt that South Africans had outgrown this childish attitude which pertained in the past. I want to speak to-day to the hon. the Minister in connection with the Act which consolidated the laws relating to the licensing of trades and occupations. I refer to Act No. 44 of 1962. We find that subsection (3) of section 1 provides a blanket exemption for all &#x201C;charitable, religious or educational institutions of a public character&#x201D; from the necessity to obtain a trade licence. I want to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister two rackets which have developed out of this blanket exemption as provided for in this section. Sir, we have found in past years that groups of individuals have formed themselves into so-called welfare organizations and given themselves names such as National Christian Education and Benevolent Society, Christian Revival Team and Welfare Organization, Mother Hubbard Christian Youth Crusade and various other very high-sounding names. I must admit that some of these organizations are registered under the Welfare Organizations Act. There are others which are not registered welfare organizations. What happens is that these organizations are hiding behind this blanket exemption. They work in two ways. Either the organizers themselves sell certificates, which are typed out, to individuals, reading that &#x201C;So-and-So is hereby empowered to trade and is exempt from the necessity to obtain a licence and is free from prosecution&#x201D;. It is then signed by the chief organizer of this particular welfare organization.</p>

<p>The first racket which has developed is that these people, after forming themselves into such a group, then proceed to sell these certificates to unsuspecting Bantu who buy them in good faith as trading licences. They pay R10 a time for them. These unsuspecting Bantu, having now established what they call a shop within their residential premises, are then prosecuted by the police. It has been found by the police, when they have investigated, that these organizations with these high sounding names are not true welfare organizations and that they are not making any contributions to welfare and other such organizations. The other operation which is carried out under this blanket exemption which is provided for in the Act, is that other organizations empower, under certificate, certain persons to trade in the name of that organization. They are then there as employees. All the proceeds from this trading go to the central group who are pocketing it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein raised the matter of the protection of consumers. I must say that he put a very good case. I think, however, that he missed one point and that he might have issued a word of advice to his constituents, namely to deal only with reputable firms. We have had the development of &#x201C;mushroom&#x201D; firms in this country which spring up from nowhere. These firms are guilty of all the malpractices enumerated by the hon. member, but there are still a number of reputable firms in this country. If the hon. member is looking for some advice, I want to say that he should advise his constituents to deal only with these reputable firms. With regard to his suggestion that garages should now also be graded—from 1 to 5-star garages, I assume, the same as for hotels—I think that I will leave him to the tender mercies of the Motor Trade Association. I do want to say, however, that I support everything that he said about the poor service which is received by the motor car owner to-day when he goes to these garages, and particularly people who purchase cars which are under guarantee. Once again I want to say that he should advise his constituents who complain, that, in regard to new motor cars, there is only one answer and one recourse that they have, and that is to have the work done and to submit the account to the factory for payment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not think I owe the hon. member who has just resumed his seat any apology in not following up his argument, because there is nothing to follow up. However, I want to express my displeasure at the hon. member’s shocking reference to the hon. member for Turffontein’s plea for justice to be done to Afrikaans in the motor industry. I say that it was shocking to have witnessed here this afternoon the contempt once more displayed by the United Party for Afrikaans. Such action on the part of the United Party must not be allowed to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not give the Committee an indication of what progress has been made with the investigation into <b>oil</b> polution<b> along our</b> coastline. I think this is a matter which is causing great concern to most hon. members, and such an indication would therefore be very welcome.</p>

<p>The matter to which I should very much like to refer this afternoon, relates to the take-over bids by certain undertakings which <span class="col_6397-6398" refersTo="page_0403"/>are at present the order of the day, as it were, take-overs not only on a horizontal plan, but also on a vertical plane. These take-overs are more and more leading to the creation of monopolistic conditions, which also cannot be allowed to pass unnoticed. I think that this Government has shown itself from the earliest times as being a Government with a very great interest in this matter. The position now is that more and more bids are being made to take over forms. In actual fact there are only two ways to combat this tendency. The one way is that of intervention on the part of the Government. However, I do not believe that such action would meet with general approval, nor do I think that the Government itself would like to adopt this method. The only alternative is to create a climate in which the smaller undertakings can come into their own. In this connection I want to express sincere appreciation this afternoon for the work which the I.D.C. is doing in order to allow small industries in our country to come into their own. If one looks at the statistics, one sees that between November, 1962, and June, 1967, i.e. over a period of five years, 102 small industries were assisted by the I.D.C. to an amount of more than R2 million, which means that each industry was assisted by R20,234 on the average. For this reason I want to express very sincere appreciation towards the I.D.C. this afternoon. The small entrepreneur, however, has two problems. One is the lack of the necessary knowledge, the preparedness of that entrepreneur in respect of business management, acumen and so on, and the other problem is that of capital. The latter problem can easily be solved, because the entrepreneur can be assisted by the I.D.C. But the real problem is: Where does the man obtain administrative knowledge? I want to ask very earnestly this afternoon if much more cannot be done to convey this administrative knowledge, this acumen, which is so necessary to the success of the undertakings, to the entrepreneurs concerned. Can the I.D.C. itself not have a greater share in it instead of only providing the capital? Cannot the I.D.C. or the State assist in activating our universities and the Management Foundation to do more in this regard?</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point. If we look at the White Paper, we see that in the current financial year an amount of only R4,000 is proposed for the Management Foundation. Surely this is a negligible amount and I want to ask very earnestly this afternoon whether this amount cannot perhaps be increased indirectly through the intercession of the hon. the Minister and the influence which he can exert with the I.D.C. If this can be done, I am sure that this small industrialist will in future be the actual backbone of industry in South Africa. Then there can be no talk of monopolistic conditions, but then there can only be sound growth and prosperity in the industrial sphere, and surely we are all striving to achieve that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Springs referred to the dangers of State monopolies in South Africa, and if he was not here when the hon. member for Hillbrow spoke then I commend to him that he should read that gentleman’s speech which sets out very accurately what encroachment on private enterprise is being committed by the State to-day. Unfortunately I was called out of the House when the hon. member for Moorreesburg spoke and I therefore only have heard at second-hand some of the remarks he made in connection with attempts by the hon. member for Kimberley (North) and myself to get a bi-partisan approach to the banning of trawling in False Bay. It seems the hon. member for Moorreesburg has been so long in a political organizing capacity that he sees a political motive behind everything done by his political opponents. This has been a genuine effort by hon. members of the governing party and by the Opposition to try to have trawling banned in False Bay because we believe the marine resources of that bay are being systematically exterminated, and there is scientific proof for this.</p>

<p>It might interest the hon. member to know that over one half of hon. members on both sides of this House have already signed this petition to the hon. the Minister asking him to ban trawling in False Bay, and that excludes the members of the Cabinet for obvious reasons. It will be interesting for people who support the False Bay Conservation Society’s efforts to have trawling banned there to know that the hon. member for Moorreesburg considers that people such as the mayors of the Strand, Gordon’s Bay, Simonstown, and Fish Hoek—and their Councils—to be indulging in political activities. Quite apart from that, members of divisional councils, angling clubs, tourist organizations, hoteliers, publicity assocations, all of these have joined forces to try and prevent trawling from exterminating the marine resources of False Bay. They ail are united in believing that bay must be closed to trawling. He says that there is no scientific proof that harm is being done to the resources of False Bay by the trawlers. It appears that he is supported by the present Minister, who as long ago as 1964, long before the Yeats Commission reported, took up a violently partisan attitude in this matter. This is what he said in a letter to the then secretary of an action committee which was formed to try to prevent trawling in False Bay:</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is veral die hengelaars van Valsbaai, sowel professioneel as amateur, wat kla. Hulle het dit teen die netvissers, en veral teen die beursnetvissers, wat sardyn (pilchards) in Valsbaai vang. Die geldigheid van hierdie aantyging kan uit die aard van die saak nie kategories bevestig of weerlê word nie. Dit is so dat bodemvisse soms in beursnette beland, maar dan is dit toevallig en uitsonderlik. Selfs al sou die hengelaars se klagtes volkome geregverdig wees, bly dit <span class="col_6399-6400" refersTo="page_0404"/>&#x2019;n feit dat die vismeelen inmaakbedryf van oorheersende belang vir die Suid-Afrikaan-se visnywerheid en van groot ekonomiese waarde vir die land is.</block>

<p>Then he concludes by saying:</p>

<block name="quote">Ten slotte wil dit my voorkom dat die posisie in Valsbaai sedert die Minister se waarskuwing dat oortredings aldaar in &#x2019;n baie ernstige lig beskou word, reeds heelwat verbeter het, en ek is oortuig daarvan dat daar genoeg plek en vis vir almal is.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, after the Yeats Commission which had been appointed in 1964, reported in 1966, he was supported by the present Director of Fisheries, Dr. De Jager. He made a broadcast recently, in which he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Die neiging in die jongste tyd is om die beweerde skaarste aan veral hengelvisse in Valsbaai toe te skryf aan die bedrywighede van beursnetvissers wat sedert 1956 periodiek daar visvang. Na my mening is hierdie vermoede egter ongegrond.</block>

<p>The Yeats Commission&#x2019;s report, on the other hand, regarded the matter so seriously that it said that there should be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a complete prohibition on the use of any type of net, except crayfish and trek nets, within two seamiles of the low water mark and in a line between Cape Point and Cape Hangklip.</block>

<p>Then it added this rider. This is significant and it underlines my statement that there is definitely proof that the fish are being eradicated by this unrestricted trawling, because that is what the report then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in the course of time it appears that this prohibition (that is the two-mile limit) is not effective, then the whole of False Bay should be closed.</block>

<p>It is hardly likely that a commission of eminent people such as the Yeats Commission would add that rider if there was not a serious danger of the depletion of the resources.</p>

<p>Local people will tell one that when the snoek season recently opened there were more bait fish in the bay than there have been for a very long time. As soon as the boats come back into False Bay these bait fish disappear and with them disappear the summer or the shoal fish.</p>

<p>He went on to refer also to world fish catches and he said that there was an increase. I agree with him. Of course there is. There is better equipment available. Boats are fishing further afield for their catches. But I would like to refer him to the figures for the pilchard catches off the South African coast and the South West African coast for 1966 and 1967. In 1966 the figure for pilchard catches off the South African coast were 181,471 tons and the allied fish to the pilchard, the red eye, 4,978 tons. What were the figures for 1967, the next year? An enormous drop of 100,000 tons in the pilchard catch. During the same period the anchovy catches off the South African coast have increased.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member remember what happened in California? In California they concentrated on the pilchards. The pilchards were practically exterminated, and now they are catching more anchovies off the Californian coast to-day than ever before. The pattern is repeating itself here. As pilchards are eradicated, so more anchovy will be caught. I ask the hon. member for Moorreesburg, who knows so much about the fishing industry, if he does not agree that the pilchard is of more value to South Africa than the anchovy.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the hon. member for Moorreesburg, may I refer to my private member&#x2019;s motion on 7th February of last year, in which I asked the Minister to give his consideration to the establishment of a 12-mile territorial belt off the South African coast, the further establishment of fishery zones outside of the territorial waters, and the appointment of a commission of inquiry. I maintain that the figures that I have given to-day in connection with pilchard catches and the increase of anchovy catches, which is consequential, fully justify the attitude that I adopted at that time that there should be a commission of inquiry because of the danger of the depletion of our marine resources.</p>

<p>As to the international aspect, may I just say this. The Minister&#x2019;s reply was that in 1964 the Prime Minister had made a statement that territorial waters had the previous year been extended to six miles, that there was a fishery zone of a further six miles, in all a belt of 12 miles, and that that was sufficient, more particularly as the South African Navy and the Air Force were being used for special fishing protection services. I want to ask The Minister: How many trawler have been caught within that 12-mile belt since the Prime Minister made his statement in 1964, and more particularly since he made his statement last year in February? How many have been apprehended off the coast of South West Africa or of South Africa? Then he went on to say in his reply to me that instead of the extension of territorial waters, the other alternative was to get agreement with fishing countries utilizing the waters off our coast. How many agreements has he negotiated with fishing countries in respect of their fishing operations for conservation purposes off our coast since he made that statement? He pointed out also that we were a member of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention, and he said that as such we could take unilateral conservation <span class="col_6401-6402" refersTo="page_0405"/>steps. What unilateral conservation steps have we taken? What further steps have been taken to secure their agreement and to prevent them breaking any unilateral steps that we might have taken?</p>

<p>Then he went on to say that there should be research before conventions were entered into between the various countries. Now I ask him: What research has taken place since he made that statement?</p>

<p>Lastly, may I just say that it appears that the Minister, when he made his reply to me last year, was not aware of developments in the international legal field as regards territorial waters since the 1958 Geneva Convention. I would like to point out to him that after that convention of 1958, 28 states had a three-to four-mile territorial sea, 14 had a six to 12-mile territorial sea, and 14 a more than a 12-mile limit. To-day the position is that 19 states have three-mile limits, 20 states have a six to 12-mile limit, and there is a great increase in the number of states with a more than 12-mile limit, namely 25. I suggest that this year he should accept the resolution that I moved last year.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the course of the debate the hon. member for Parktown referred to the Kennedy Round and asked me to what extent changes would possibly be effected as a result of representations Britain had made in this regard. The Kennedy Round made provision for a rebate in respect of certain tariffs. Those tariffs were negotiated on a broad basis. We reduced, or agreed to reduce, certain tariffs on a percentage basis over a period of years. At the same time other countries agreed to grant us certain tariff preferences or concessions. It was not a case of one country doing so towards the others. Every country had to consider what the total benefit was both in respect of itself and other countries, and on that basis every country had to decide whether it would be a signatory to that Kennedy Round Agreement. South Africa also became a signatory. Then the hon. member for Parktown referred to the concessions in so far as they affect certain guaranteed preferences enjoyed by South Africa. The position is that in terms of this agreement some of these preferences were reduced by as much as 50 per cent. Where we had 10 per cent preferences, they have now become 5 per cent. He also referred to those specific preferences, in respect of grapes for instance, where it used to be 8/6 and would now be reduced to 2/s. Therefore this does not only apply to <i>ad valorem</i> preferences, but also to the other cases where a price has been fixed. It was initially agreed that we should abandon these 50 per cent preferences as follows: 40 per cent as early as 1st July, 1968, then 20 per cent on 1st January, 1970, another 20 per cent in 1971, and the last 20 per cent in 1972. These were the proposals on which agreement was reached in the course of the Kennedy Round negotiations. Subsequent to that there were negotiations between Britain and the U.S.A, which affected South Africa as well. South Africa was consulted in that regard. Then the hon. member referred to my statement in this regard in which I indicated that South Africa had raised objections with the British Government in view of the fact that the British Government had suggested to the U.S.A, that they should not continue with certain protective measures which it was expected the U.S.A, would take so as to overcome its own balance of payment problems. To prevent this Britain suggested that this 50 per cent should be made applicable in full as early as the beginning of next year. That would have had an adverse effect on our important exports. Whereas we would otherwise have had the opportunity of adapting ourselves to changed circumstances, we would then have to adapt ourselves to them immediately. Therefore we raised objections in the course of our negotiations with Britain. Britain&#x2019;s proposed action was also conditional, i.e. Britain would only grant these concessions provided that the E.E.C. countries agreed to them. The fact of the matter is that the E.E.C. countries did not agree to them. But the E.E.C. countries have in fact intimated now that they are prepared to accept certain changes, i.e. that the 40 per cent be made applicable now. Instead of the next 20 per cent only coming into operation on 1st January, 1970, it should come into operation as early as January next year; then one year should be skipped and the next 20 per cent should come into operation in 1971 and 1972. Therefore, the duration remains the same, but the next concession will come into operation next year instead of in 1970. Therefore that is the proposal which is being made. Negotiations are still in progress and no finality has been reached as yet. But even if that were to happen, it would probably have affected some of our important exports. That is why we have at this stage already indicated to the British Government that the more rapid relaxation would1 in fact prejudice some of our exports, particularly our agricultural exports. We have also requested the British Government to take this into account in further negotiations and to try to protect us in respect of those specific industries so that we may be granted every opportunity in terms of the original Kennedy Round Agreement.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to our exports. He wanted to know what was being done in general to stimulate our exports. The hon. member for Sunnyside also referred to that matter. The fact of the matter is that there has been a considerable increase in our exports over the past year. In 1965 our total exports amounted to R160 million. Last year they amounted to R 1,355 million. There has been a considerable improvement as far as our exports to Africa, Europe and Asia are concerned. Our exports to Asia have in point of fact more than doubled. The interesting <span class="col_6403-6404" refersTo="page_0406"/>fact is that the statistics available for the past four months indicate that South Africa&#x2019;s exports over these four months were much higher than they were over the comparable four months of 1967. Over these four months there was an increase of approximately R100 million in our exports, i.e. an increase of 26 per cent as against those of last year. In looking at our imports, we notice that there has indeed been an 8 per cent decrease in our imports, which has had the effect that our debit balance of trade, gold excluded, is much smaller than it was in the past. Reference was also made here to the fact that it would be our industrial exports in particular which would have to take the place of gold in the future. That is why it is also gratifying that it is in particular the exports of our manufactured goods which have increased considerably. A comparison of the first three months of this year with the comparable three months in 1967 indicates that our exports of manufactured goods have increased by 15 per cent. This is, therefore, a significant increase. This also applies when the past year is compared with the previous year. Very good progress has also been made as regards machinery and transport equipment, which is an indication that our industrial products are being exported to an increasing extent and can compete with those of other countries. It was also asked what was being done by the Government to promote our trade. Specific reference was made to our export trade. I want to point out that in the division of the Departments provision was in fact made for a department of commerce and a department of industries. The mere fact that this division was effected, is an indication of the importance that is being attached to these matters. The hon. member for Pietermartizburg (District) referred to the statement I had made in this regard when he said that the Licences Act of 1962 would fall under this Department, since I had said in my statement that all domestic trade matters, including monopolistic conditions in the local distributive trade, would fall under the Department of Commerce. However, the heading states explicitly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Economic Affairs announces for general information that the main functions of the former Departments of Commerce and of Industries are being divided as follows &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that there has been a division of the functions this Department had. These are not new functions. Section 14 of the Act to which the hon. member referred, provides that the Secretary for Inland Revenue is responsible for the implementation of the Act. Therefore I do not think that there is much scope for misinterpretation. The fact that the former department has been divided, shows what importance the Government attaches to commerce in itself. Recently there has also been extension as far as our foreign representation is concerned. Last year a trade adviser was appointed in Geneva. In addition new offices were opened in the Argentine and in Brazil, and they are being staffed this year. Our foreign trade service is therefore being reinforced as far as staff is concerned. In these Estimates provision has also been made for more exhibitions than was the case in the past. We are also spending more on articles on conditions in South Africa for dissemination abroad.</p>

<p>Reference was also made here to the importance of contact in the sphere of trade. For instance, mention was made of South African industrialists who go abroad. I want to confirm it, too. The fact of the matter is that our own industrialists who go abroad as well as those overseas industrialists who visit us, are important sources of contact. South Africa has never had as many foreign missions in this country as has in fact been the case over the past year. One mission is followed by the other in increasing numbers. At this very moment a very strong trade mission from Australia is visiting South Africa in order to hold a major exhibition here. This is an indication to us that other countries are showing more and more interest in our trade. The same applies to us as well. That is why we feel that we should receive these trade missions as well as we possibly can, and that we should offer them every facility. At the same time we also want to encourage our own trade missions to foreign countries. A mission of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce is also abroad at the moment.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the Export Promotion Board which has just been established. We have already received the nominations for that board from the seven organizations concerned. As for the five members we are to appoint ourselves, I wish to state that we have already approached these persons. Unfortunately one of them is abroad; otherwise we would have been able to announce their names. We are awaiting his return. It is hoped that this board will meet in Pretoria early in August, and the members who have already accepted nomination, have in the meantime been asked to inform us as to what matters they wish to have on the agenda and what they want to discuss with us in the interests of promoting our exports.</p>

<p>Then I can also refer to the extension of the credit reinsurance scheme, as well as export financing by the I.D.C., which has become a very important factor in enabling our exporters and industrialists to tender for overseas contracts. They have already managed to secure major contracts as a result of this assistance we granted them.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Paarl and Albany also made reference here to another important matter, i.e. the effect of devaluation on some of our export industries, especially some of our agricultural processing industries, and the export of some of our agricultural products. When it was decided that South Africa <span class="col_6405-6406" refersTo="page_0407"/>would not devalue, the Minister of Finance made the following announcement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless, certain of our agricultural export industries may perhaps find it difficult to retain their markets in the devaluing countries without increasing their prices considerably. The Government is aware of this possibility and will consider suitable ways and means, in deserving cases, to assist in solving the problems of these industries.</block>

<p>As a result of this announcement representations have been made from time to time to the Departments of Finance, Agriculture and Economic Affairs, and in these Estimates an amount of R4 million was therefore appropriated for this purpose. In the meantime a very thorough analysis of these requests for assistance was made jointly by the departments concerned. Even the Department of Forestry was concerned in so far as the wattle-bark industry was affected. There was a large group of manufacturers, including those of motor spares, synthetic rubber, elements for kettles, lead products, suitcases, bicycle saddles, caps, etc., who lodged applications, but then there were also the sugar industry. Amcor, the citrus industry, the fruit and vegetable canning industry and the wattle-bark industry. In addition there were individual agricultural producers such as those of sweetmelons and lupin seed. Then there is the problem of the deciduous fruit industry itself. They have not made specific representations to us as yet, but I shall come back to this matter. The fact remains that some of the persons who approached the departments concerned for assistance because of devaluation, did so because although their contracts had already been finalized, they had stipulated that they would have to be compensated in sterling on a future date. In the meantime. after delivery and before payment, the British devaluation took place. It has been decided that no assistance would be granted in those cases, because that is a normal risk. Those who sold their articles in that way, could have insured themselves against that by making the necessary arrangements with the banks. Facilities do exist in that regard. Then there are cases where it was stipulated that payment should be made in sterling but where those contracts were still being executed. In those cases those persons who had stipulated that payment should be made in sterling, could also have insured themselves against the risk, and most of South Africa&#x2019;s exporters did in fact insure themselves against it. since indications of possible British devaluation had been in the air for months, in spite of official denials on the part of the British. This is therefore a trade risk against which they could have insured themselves.</p>

<p>But then we have these other groups to which I referred. As far as the citrus industry as well as the canners of citrus juices and grape-fruit segments are concerned, the Government has already decided to investigate their problem fully. In all these cases where there are organized bodies of the agricultural industry, negotiations were conducted with them in conjunction with the various departments. This industry had to know before the start of this season, because deliveries had to be made to the canning industry and to the juice industry. Some of them are geared for export, and they had to know what the position was. That is why a specific agreement has been concluded with these three groups, and assistance to the total amount of R2,447,999 will be granted to the fresh citrus fruit industry, the citrus juice industry and the grapefruit segments industry. As regards the canning industry, the position is that the price that would be paid to the industry, and the peach industry in particular, was agreed upon prior to devaluation. There is therefore no change. But our canning industry has been struggling over the past year because of competition from other countries, especially from Australia. Therefore the canning industry has its own problems. They have marketed their fruit, and so far they have in fact succeeded in virtually disposing of their entire consignment, but the price it fetched is lower than it was before. The final figures are not yet known, but we have already intimated that we are prepared to help the canning industry as soon as they have calculated the final figures.</p>

<p>As far as the deciduous fruit industry is concerned, the final figures are not available as yet. However, we have already seen analyses. Certain varieties of deciduous fruit have fetched higher prices on the British market than was the case in the previous season, whereas other cases lower prices were obtained. We find that the apple industry in particular suffered considerably, because they have to compete with apples kept in cold storage and specifically because of the high production by the rest of Europe. The apple industry has therefore been faced with major problems in recent times, but before the export season has come to an end, it is impossible to determine what their position is.</p>

<p>Then there is also the problem of the pineapple and fresh beans canning industries. The pineapple industry is subject to a yearly season, but it has its peak periods. More than 70 per cent of this year&#x2019;s production has already been canned, but pineapple canners are experiencing very strong competition not only from Australia, but also from Formosa, Hawaii and the Ivory Coast, which are new entrants to the market. It was agreed that this industry would go on canning pineapples. At the moment they are paying the producer less than was the case in the past, but drought conditions have also had an adverse effect on the pineapple industry. Therefore as soon as this canning season has come to an end and we know what the final position is, this matter can be considered. This matter was negotiated fully with this industry, and last week further discussions took place among the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce, the canners as well as the producers.</p>

<p>May I put a question? The citrus farmers are being compensated for approximately 75 per cent of their losses. Is this a general principle, or is it expected that 100 per cent of the losses will be refunded?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not expected that they will receive 100 per cent. Nor is there a fixed formula as regards the 75 per cent. It varies from case to case. It does not necessarily mean that a basis which has been agreed upon for the citrus industry will apply throughout. As regards the green beans industry, the market has suffered considerable setbacks. A thorough investigation is being made into the extent to which it would be economically remunerative to plant the next crop. The Department of Agricultural Economics is conducting negotiations with the producers in order to ascertain what is to be done in this regard and whether it would not be more remunerative for them to go in for other crops.</p>

<speech by="#bennett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. BENNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister dealt with the question of pineapples for canning, but he has not mentioned the export of fresh pineapples.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The export of fresh pineapples forms a relatively small part of pineapple production as a whole. This matter will also be dealt with. They are aware of the fact that the whole matter will have to be investigated. You will notice that of the amount for which provision is made in the Estimates an amount of almost R2.5 million has already been allocated, and at this stage already it is obvious that this amount will not be adequate and that additional amounts will have to be requested in order that the agricultural industry and the canning industry may be compensated. But until these final figures have been obtained, it is impossible to agree upon a final amount</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington, as well as the hon. member for Germiston (District), referred to the film industry. Owing to indisposition the hon. member for Kensington is unfortunately not here, but he referred to the amounts that had been paid and the fact that we did not want to make those figures available. We feel that in this respect it is a question of a subsidy paid to individual firms, and for that reason I felt, as the Department also did in the past, that it would not be advisable to make that information available. But apparently hon. members of the Opposition do not share this view, and I am quite prepared to indicate what the names of these firms are and what the lump sum was that was paid to them. The following amounts were paid out last year: R351 to Norval Film Productions, R4,671 to Jamie Uys Productions, R485 to David Milne Productions, R28,008 to Killarney Films, R963 to S.A. Film Studios, R149,344 to Cavalier Films, R112.981 to Emil Nofal and R103,109 to Mimosa Film Productions. As far as this year is concerned, it is impossible to indicate what will be paid to each of them, for you will appreciate, Sir, that the year has not yet ended and that they are granted subsidies based on box-office revenue. Therefore, until the figures in respect of this year&#x2019;s revenue are available, it is impossible to indicate how much will be paid to each of them. But if hon. members want to know what the names are of the companies of which we know up to this stage, I can furnish them with that information as well. They are Cavalier Films, Killarney Films, Mimosa, Protea, Panorama, Percival Rubins, David Milne, Emil Nofal and Sven Person Films. These are the ones that are known at this stage</p>

<p>Reference was made here by the hon. member for Germiston (District) to South Africa&#x2019;s own film industry, and in this regard a subsidy scheme was introduced in 1957 in an attempt at encouraging a South African film industry of our own. It is a fact that this subsidy has increased from R21,000 in 1957, to R100,000 in 1961, and to R400.000 at the moment. This is an indication that more South African films are being made, but the complaint is that the exclusively South African film is perhaps not getting its rightful share. This experiment of encouraging the South African film industry by way of subsidies has already reached an advanced stage, and in consultation with the Department of the Interior as well as the Department of Cultural Affairs we have already decided to investigate this whole matter and to see whether it is not possible to employ better and other methods to stimulate the South African film and especially the Afrikaans film to a greater extent</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington also wanted to know how much progress we had made in regard to the metrification of weights and measures, for which an additional amount is being appropriated here. The Standards Council recommended that a metric advisory board, advisory to the Minister of Economic Affairs, should be established. This board was in fact established and Dr. Ben Gaigher was appointed chairman. He is assisted by various members. They have already met a few times and decided to establish three subdivisions: a division dealing with conversion in the industrial sphere, a second division dealing with conversion in the commercial sphere, and a third division dealing with conversion in other miscellaneous services. It was also decided to give priority to certain conversions in the industrial sphere. The Louw Commission calculated that the cost of conversion would possibly amount to R17 million over a period of ten years. Managers have already been appointed for two of these divisions, and negotiations are in progress as regards the third division. I can give hon. members the assurance that a great deal of progress has already been made in connection with the preliminary investigations and that negotiations have <span class="col_6409-6410" refersTo="page_0409"/>already been conducted in connection with the conversion, but unlike the procedure followed in the case of the decimal coinage system, one specific date for the conversion was not decided upon; it will be done step by step and the industrial sector will be the first to proceed to doing so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) wanted to know whether it was not possible to simplify textile tariffs. I can inform the hon. member that such an instruction has already been given to the Board of Trade and Industries. Professor Reynders, who was appointed on a part-time basis, was charged with this investigation. Therefore this is a matter which is already receiving attention.</p>

<p>Various hon. members made reference here to the important position occupied by the I.D.C. and to its functions. Both the hon. member for Wonderboom and the hon. member for Vasco referred to the contribution made by the I.D.C. in respect of small industrial enterprises. From the latest I.D.C. report it is clear that virtually 42 per cent of its applications deals with small industries requiring assistance of less than R50,000. The small industries division of the I.D.C. has only been in existence for a few years, but it is clear that it has in that time fulfilled an important function.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco also wanted to know whether the Atlas factory should not give consideration to manufacturing light aircraft. The Atlas factory is a private enterprise. The I.D.C. also has a shareholding interest in that factory, but it is a minority interest. They have entered into an agreement with the Munitions Production Board to carry out certain repairs and they also partly manufacture or assemble certain aircraft on a contract basis. But the Atlas factory is a completely private enterprise. It is possible that they may be interested in that field, but the Government cannot bring pressure to bear upon them to move into that field. They themselves will have to decide on business principles whether they want to move into that field.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karas referred to Iscor and wanted to know whether it was not possible to investigate the conveyance of iron ore to Luderitz. Investigation work in connection with Iscor is being undertaken by the directorate of Iscor; they have been charged with that task and they will make recommendations to the Government. As far as the pipeline itself is concerned, it is not a foregone conclusion as yet. It is merely a possibility that will be investigated. I shall also refer the hon. member&#x2019;s request in connection with Luderitz to them so that they may include it in their investigations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kimberley referred to the position of Kimberley, and his plea was that the third steel factory should be established there. He made the statement that so far virtually nothing has been done for Kimberley and its surrounding areas.</p>

<p>Yes, I mean the hon. member for Karoo. My confusion is attributable to the fact that an end is possibly going to be put to the representation of Coloureds in this House. The hon. member&#x2019;s plea is very clearly aimed at trying to prepare for himself a niché in Kimberley.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo said that no official statement had been made so far, that we were vague and did not say anything. He went on to say: &#x201C;No investigation is necessary.&#x201D; Just imagine, Mr. Chairman, an enterprise must be established here, a factory on which hundreds of millions will be spent, but the hon. member wants the directorate of Iscor to make a recommendation to the Minister without a prior investigation taking place.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>An investigation was made 20 years ago.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that an investigation was made 20 years ago. As a result of that investigation it was decided 20 or 30 years ago that the first Iscor should be established at Pretoria. As a result of subsequent investigations the second one was established at Vanderbijl. Surely, at this stage, conditions in South Africa are quite different from what they were 20 years ago, but now the hon. member refers to an investigation that was made 20 years ago. There is a vast number of factors that have to be taken into account. It is not merely a question of iron ore; there is the question of coke that has to be used and conveyed there; there is the question of the export potential; there is the question of domestic distribution that has to be taken into account; there is the question of labour, water, electric power, etc. There are many factors that have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Then there is in addition a new factor, i.e. the question of the possible conveyance by pipe-line. The hon. member referred to that and said that we were not saying anything in that regard. The fact of the matter is that the persons who visited countries abroad in order to investigate the implications and all the problems in regard to the use of pipelines, only returned to South Africa last week, but the hon. member expects us to say in advance where the third Iscor is to be established. I can assure the hon. member that Iscor will be the first to know where a third factory is to be established, and subsequent to that they will decide what to do. It is impossible to say in advance where such a factory will be established. That would give rise to all sorts of speculation and in the end it might prove impossible for Iscor, owing to high costs and other factors, to establish it there <span class="col_6411-6412" refersTo="page_0410"/>The hon. member for Witbank referred to Escom, and he wanted to know whether it was advisable for Escom to supply electricity at places where it was also being supplied by local authorities. It was pointed out in the Borckenhagen report that if one organization could eventually supply the whole country, this would entail major advantages. In that case the best use could be made of large nuclear power stations, which could supply much more power at a much lower cost per unit. At present long distance transmissions renders it possible for power to be transmitted over hundreds and even thousands of miles; it reduces coal railage; it saves manpower; and therefore it entails many advantages. The principle of the recommendation contained in the Borckenhagen report is therefore basically correct. But we nevertheless find that at times there are clashes with certain local authorities, particularly when they want to expand in a new direction, and then we have to try to find a solution. Usually the local authority wants to make a profit out of the supply of electric power. Escom&#x2019;s task is that of supplying electric power on a utility basis at the cheapest price, but Escom is quite prepared to supply that power to the local authority in bulk. Then the local authority can see to the intra-urban reticulation and distribution, and if they want to make a profit on that, it is basically their own affair. The hon. member referred to the fact that there were cases where local authorities took over from Escom and where Escom continued to supply the large enterprises. Sometimes it is unremunerative for large enterprises to pay the high prices charged by the local authority, particularly when the local authority wants to make a large profit on the supply of power. They regard it as a source of revenue for subsidizing the taxpayer, and large enterprises are often regarded as a good milch cow for that purpose. But hon. members will appreciate that an industry is often located at a specific place for the very reason that power is cheap there, and when such an industry is a major consumer of power, its remunerativeness and even its continued existence at a certain place may be affected adversely by a higher cost factor. But we shall try to iron out the existing problems. Last year we had talks with the representatives of the United Municipal Executive. They have approached us again for talks later this year, and on that occasion we shall meet in order to see whether it is not possible for us to iron out a few more basic problems.</p>

<p>Both the hon. member for Simonstown and the hon. member for Moorreesburg referred to the problems arising in False Bay. There is a clash of interests, especially between those of tourists and those of the fishermen. It appears that at certain times, False Bay is an important source of sardine catches to the fishing industry. In certain years as much as 17 per cent of their total catches are caught there. I do not wish to go into the clash that has arisen between these two groups. They have made representations to the commission of inquiry appointed in this regard. The Department of Industries had talks with both of these groups, and these groups have now reached an agreement. It is a compromise agreement, and in terms of the agreement there will be more direct lines of demarcation in False Bay. The problem was that certain net-fishermen and even trawlers were forbidden to come within two miles of the coast, but in many cases it was impossible to prove this distance of two miles in a court of law, because a boat does not remain stationary.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>In all cases?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I say it is impossible to prove it. Nobody has ever succeeded in proving it, in spite of charges that were made. It entails too many technical problems. Even in South West, where a case was heard recently, after very good observations had been made, the prosecution could not prove whether or not the boats in question had been within 12 miles of the coast line. It remains a difficult task to prove this, and that is why we proposed that fixed lines should now be drawn between certain points. We hope that the bodies and persons involved in this matter will lend their full co-operation. As I said, the talks that took place gave rise to a compromise being reached, which I regard as an equitable plan. In the main this plan amounts to the forbidden area being demarcated by way of straight lines so as to help the fishermen as well as the patrol service, the complainants and the informers. The object is to include in the forbidden area, in as far as it is possible, the waters that are shallower than 20 fathoms, and then to demarcate this area with buoys, the lights of which it will also be possible to see at night. This area can be defined more or less as follows: A straight line from Cape Point to a point off Simonstown and then from Simonstown to Seal Island; then from Seal Island to Gordon&#x2019;s Bay where it joins a line from Miller&#x2019;s Point to Macassar Beach. It is, therefore, virtually a line from Simonstown to Seal Island to Gordon&#x2019;s Bay. This is the inland line and it is intersected by a straight line outside the point of Pringle Bay up to Macassar and then from Cape Point up to a point near Seal Island. This forbidden strip is approximately two miles wide at Patrys Point, four miles at Simonstown, five and a half miles at Kalk Bay, four and a half miles at Kapteinsklip, four miles at the Strand, five miles at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, three and a half miles at Koeël Bay and one and a half miles at Pringle Bay. It will take us another 12 months to obtain these buoys. We still want to make a calculation of the costs, and the necessary funds will have to be obtained. I trust that these straighter lines will be more satisfactory and that they will enable the parties to adhere strictly to this agreement, <span class="col_6413-6414" refersTo="page_0411"/>whilst at the same time affording us a better opportunity of prosecuting where possible.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will be satisfied with nothing less than the complete closure of False Bay. But that would be unpractical. The representatives of these associations have agreed to this arrangement, and I hope that this will put an end to unnecessary agitation, agitation which at times have no other effect than merely to harm those areas and the people who have an interest in them, because it creates the impression that large-scale extermination of angling fish is taking place. However, our information indicates that there are no grounds for those allegations.</p>

<p>The Department has already obtained the necessary permission to extend inspection activities. Seven new inspectors will be appointed to assist in the guarding and preservation of our coasts.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to international agreements. The fact of the matter is that over the past year or so negotiations have been conducted in regard to an international agreement to limit the catch of pelagic fish, South Africa was also present as an interested observer. Certain steps have already been taken, but until a general agreement has been reached by all the interested parties, it is impossible to disclose all the terms of the agreement. However, I can give hon. members the assurance that a great deal of progress has been made in regard to these parties&#x2019; attempts at drafting a convention in regard to control over pelagic fish.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Groblersdal referred to the problem of the oil pollution of our coastal waters caused by the tankers. I can inform him that there were talks amongst various Government Departments, provincial and local authorities, oil companies, as well as other interests, and that agreement was reached in regard to certain forms of legislation in terms of which certain powers are granted for the purpose of coping with this problem. There is virtually unanimity as to the terms of this agreement, and in the course of this Session I expect to introduce legislation for the purpose of coping with this problem.</p>

<p>Various hon. members referred to border area development. It is interesting to see that the Opposition, too, is almost supporting border area development now. Apparently the hon. members for Pietermartizburg (District), East London (City) and King William&#x2019;s Town are concerned about this matter because progress is in fact being made in that sphere, whereas there used to be a certain measure of coolness on the part of the Opposition in respect of these important developments in their constituencies. They used to adopt an attitude of indifference to this development. The hon. member for East London (North) quoted from his maiden speech, in which he pleaded for industrial development there, but that definitely does not mean to say that he pleaded for industrial development in terms of &#x2019; border area development. His party has consistently opposed that sort of development, but now they, too, are supporting it. They discouraged this development and did everything possible to oppose it. But in spite of that progress was made in this sphere. Three areas have developed, i.e. Hammarsdale, Pietermaritzburg City and Rosslyn, just outside Pretoria. These three areas have now almost been developed fully, or can develop further under their own steam. It was for that reason that the Permanent Committee indicated in its latest report, which was tabled here, that since these areas could now develop under their own steam, the Committee was much more selective as regards the forms of assistance and the concessions granted. Attention is now being given to establishing new areas, because it is a known fact that industrial areas in which there is progress, lures other industries there, whereas backward areas merely remain backward. That is why special attention is being given to certain areas in particular. One of them is in the vicinity of Richard&#x2019;s Bay, where it has already been decided to build a harbour and an aluminium foundry. The smelter is one of the projects which has been placed on the waiting list because of inflationary conditions. It is clear that the proposed harbour and the railway connection to Richard&#x2019;s Bay&#x2014;for which funds have already been appropriated&#x2014;as well as the new smelter, will give rise to major development there.</p>

<p>In addition there is the Tugela basin, where there are a few places which lend themselves to industrial development, and the same applies to East London, King William&#x2019;s Town, Berlin and Queenstown and Pietersburg. Several hon. members pleaded for larger concessions to be made to these border industries. The Permanent Committee is in fact considering this and formulating proposals in terms of which more assistance can be granted to industrialists who wish to establish themselves in these border areas. These matters will be considered shortly. The representations made here to-day, will also be considered thoroughly.</p>

<p>Border area development remains important, since it is industrial development in a white area, it is white capital and white enterprise, but the aim is to make use of Bantu labourers who are housed in their own Bantu areas. By these means the Bantu&#x2019;s own development is also being stimulated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) referred to the following fact mentioned in the report, namely that there is an annual increase of 35,000 in the labour force of the Bantu homelands. He said that we should annually make provision for 35,000 people in <span class="col_6415-6416" refersTo="page_0412"/>our industries. However, I do not think this calculation is correct, because all of them are not always used in South Africa&#x2019;s industries. At the moment our industries assimilate approximately a quarter of them. When we consider, therefore, that provision has to be made for 9,000 or 10,000 as against the average of 5,000 assimilated in our industries in recent years, then this is an indication that progress is in fact being made. When industries of this sort develop on the borders, they will stimulate the economy of the Bantu within their own borders. There will be a demand for certain services, and there will be opportunities for them to act in professional capacities as well, so that it will also have a stimulating effect on their own areas. We are committed to this policy and we shall give more attention to it in future. In future more assistance will be granted to them than was the case in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow quoted from an article written by a certain Mr. Ben Roux in which he made certain accusations. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The existing control system comprising unverifiable annual reports, rudimentary annual financial statements and part-time ministerial supervision has proved to be totally inadequate in preserving and honouring the basic principles of public administration in a democratic society</block>

<p>It is a charge the hon. member here, or he quoted it from what had been written by a certain Ben Roux, who is allegedly an authority in this field. However, I do not think he made a thorough study of the matter, much less of the laws, much less of what actually happens. The hon. member referred to Iscor, Sasol, Escom and even to Foscor. Nobody can allege that the institution of Escom was not the right policy, that it should be on a utility basis and not be undertaken by private enterprise. Cheaper power is being supplied in that way, and by doing so Escom renders excellent service to our country. The statement was made here that Iscor was being protected, that the Government was going out of its way to afford protection to Iscor. But Iscor is experiencing competition to-day. There is, for instance, the Highveld Steel undertaking. Even in respect of the foreign countries, Iscor is not being afforded any protection, because there is no tariff protection as far as steel is concerned. Government policy in this regard has in fact been to supply steel to the South African consumer at the cheapest possible price. Since 1952 there has been no increase in the price of steel, except when an import levy of R4.75 per ton was imposed. That is all. Otherwise Iscor has developed into an industry which has been supplying cheap steel to South Africa. Let us see what happened in other countries. Since 1952 the price of steel in the United Kingdom has increased by 45 per cent, in the U.S.A, by 43 per cent, in Australia by 63 per cent, but in South Africa by merely 5.7 per cent. This is proof that Iscor has succeeded in building up an efficient industry.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to ministerial supervision, i.e. that nobody could expect there to be ministerial supervision and that consequently directors are appointed. But the objection was in fact to too many ministerial powers, and now the opposite is being alleged here, namely that there is inadequate ministerial supervision.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to poor financial statements, to unverifiable annual reports and to rudimentary annual financial statements. The Act makes provision for outside accountants to be appointed annually. This work is being done by private entrepreneurs. These corporations are subject to the same measures that apply to other companies. I really think that a lot of the statements made here to-day cannot be proved, statements which are altogether flippant and which, in fact, do not do justice to the real business approach practised by these private corporations.</p>

<from>Sir. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr Chairman, there are a number of points in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply with which we are not satisfied. Most of them can remain for other occasions, but because of the urgency of the situation I do not think it is right that this Vote should be allowed to go through without the Opposition expressing its keen disappointment at the Minister&#x2019;s statement that compensation for those who are losing as a result of devaluation of sterling, what they will suffer in respect of their exports, is not going to be on a basis of full compensation. The original statements were that in deserving cases suitable steps would be taken to enable exporters who had suffered as a result of devaluation to keep their place in the markets overseas. When one has regard first of all to the assistance being given to our chief competitors, particularly Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and the Argentine, one realizes how unfavourable our exporters&#x2019; position is. One realizes how difficult it is going to be for exporters to keeD their place in those markets in the event of the principle of full compensation not being accepted. The hon. the Minister said auite clearly in reply to a question from me that the principle of a 100 per cent compensation is not acceptable. We know that there may be no fixed formula for the different export products, and it may be that some are going to be better treated than others. It may be that citrus, having got three-quarters compensation promised, and something in respect of canned orange juice, may be better off than the three-quarters compensation would make it appear. But there are going to be other products that are going to find it very difficult indeed to maintain their position in the market as against competition from other countries, which have been assisted by their governments, unless more is done by this Government. The hon. the Minister was at pains to tell us that our total exports were R1,355 million last year, and probably would <span class="col_6417-6418" refersTo="page_0413"/>go up a R100 million this year. What is the value of the exports to Great Britain affected by devaluation? Probably the total will be in the region of R70 million to R80 million. And what is the loss? It seems a small sum to be quibbling about when the interest of so many sections of our agricultural community and our co-operative organizations, particularly the canning organizations, may be involved. Already some of them are suffering as a result of the rises in costs controlled by the Government as opposed to the costs which they can control themselves. Already some of them are very unhappy indeed in respect of the freight contract entered into on their behalf by the Government. So far there has been no indication whatever as to what the position is going to be next year. There are vague assurances that something will be done this year. It will not be full compensation. It will vary tn respect of the different products, and no farmer or canning industry knows where he or it is at the present time. The hon. the Minister said that he believed that, as a result of devaluation, prices would rise in Britain in three or four years&#x2019; time. Some people say it is going to take a great deal longer than that, and they want to know whether this sort of assistance is going to be continued. The hon. the Minister, by his statement to-day, seems to me to place a number of farming industries in great jeopardy and a number of canners in an extremely difficult position.</p>

<p>I do not think it is right that this Vote should go through without the extreme disappointment of the Opposition being expressed in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is one fact which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition basically does not take into account, and that is the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s position as far as the value of its monetary unit is concerned, has remained unchanged. What has changed, is the value of British sterling. They are the ones who devalued. Devalutation is a risk which any exporter must accept. The hon. member is pleading here for full payment. The dollar was under very great pressure recently. Does this mean that, if the dollar is devalued, exporters to the United States and to other countries which devalue along with it, should receive full compensation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. Do not run away. My argument remains that, if you want to use the argument that exporters to Britain must be compensated in full, then it means that in all cases of devaluation, now or in the future, the exporter must be compensated in full should those countries devalue. I consider it an impossible task to give such an undertaking. The fact remains that there are exporters who can insure themselves against that. There are other cases in which it entails hardship, and therefore we shall give attention to it. The hon. member asked here what the position would be next year. But the fact remains that there is already an average increase in prices of 3.5 per cent in respect of certain goods on the market. There are cases in which the prices of certain of our export goods have immediately been adapted to that. In other cases it varies, also in the case of the deciduous fruit industry. As far as grapes are concerned, the price has increased, while that of apples has decreased. Must we now say what our policy in respect of that is going to be next year? Surely that is an impossible task. Now the hon. member links it to the statement issued by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I read it out here a while ago. The hon. the Minister of Finance did not say that the exporters were going to be compensated in full in all cases. Let me just read it to the hon. the Leader again:</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless, certain of our agricultural export industries may perhaps find it difficult to retain their markets in the devaluing countries without increasing their prices considerably. The Government is aware of this possibility and will consider suitable ways and means, in deserving cases, to assist in solving the problems of these industries</block>

<p>That is what the hon. the Minister of Finance said. He did not say that their losses would be compensated in full. Here we have one case which has already been dealt with. It was done in full consultation with representatives of the industries concerned. The case of the canning industry has been investigated very thoroughly, but finality has not yet been reached. However, can one say at this stage what the compensation is going to be, before the picture has been completed? Surely it is impossible to do so at this stage. But they know that they will be compensated. The same applies in these other cases where they are being consulted in conjunction with the Departments concerned to see what their final problems are going to be. But before the final problem is known, it is quite impossible to say what will happen. The hon. member referred to the freight agreements and said that unfavourable arrangements had been made. I should very much like to know whether the hon. member is in favour of the agreement being cancelled? The fact of the matter is that the airlines serving serve South Africa as far as both imports from and exports to Europe are concerned, entered into an agreement in <span class="col_6419-6420" refersTo="page_0414"/>respect of a freight tariff according to which they may not increase the tariffs without the Government&#x2019;s consent. We thereby have a certain measure of protection. They cannot simply increase prices. But they are also only guaranteed a certain revenue, namely a return of 8 per cent on their invested capital. They are therefore restricted in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they are restricted in that regard, but if South Africa as far as the export of fruit is concerned, had not entered into that conference agreement, it would not have been able to rely on the regular service which we have to-day. We are quite prepared to cancel this agreement if it should appear to be in the interests of South Africa. We are not bound by it. It is reviewed every two years. But we think that, as the position stands&#x2014;and the figures are studied as far as possible by cost accountants&#x2014;we are to-day receiving a service upon which we can rely, and a service which adapts itself to our circumstances. I am not at all convinced that we would be better off if we had to rely on irregular services only. It is possible that at times cargo space would be available on certain ships and that they can offer a cheaper tariff, but it is not a freight tariff which they can offer for all our export goods. They could not exist on that. But if it should ever appear that these conference lines are not in the interests of South Africa, we can take the necessary steps. We are not committed to them. But at this stage we think that it is in fact in our interests. For that reason negotiations are entered into from time to time. We are also protecting our export industry so that the lines cannot simply charge tariffs which can decrease our imports and unnecessarily increase our export tariffs. That is why our tariffs on certain of our export goods, for example fruit, are lower. The 7 per cent increase which has been placed on other freight in general, has not been placed on the export of fruit. Protection has indeed been afforded, to our export industry as well, in respect of fruit. I think that the statement which the hon. member made here, i.e. that we did not take into consideration the interests of the industries when we renewed these freight tariffs recently and agreed to increases, is unfounded. Then he must also admit that after devaluation there was a decrease again in certain respects. This is a situation which we are watching carefully, and thus far we think that it is in the interests of the South African exporters in general.</p>

<speech by="#schoeman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we appreciate the attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as regards the problem of the canners. We are all concerned about that, but the Minister of Finance, as the Minister of Economic Affairs has just said, did not make any definite promise at that time. We should bear the fact in mind that the canner must be able to prove his case and to state his losses clearly. There is not a single canner at the present moment who has sold his whole production and who can submit a figure to us. At the moment pineapples are still being canned. I only want the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to be aware of this. I agree with him that the amount may possibly be quite insufficient, but the sympathy which the canners have received from the Department is praiseworthy. Moreover, they trust that the Department will remain sympathetic throughout and will give assistance under the circumstances. At the moment, however, it is impossible to mention any figure as representing the actual losses suffered as a result of Britain&#x2019;s devaluation of sterling. Many of the canners have diverted their products to Western Germany at slightly better prices. The loss is not 14.3 per cent. In many cases the loss is 6 or 7 per cent only. It is an enormous task to form a final and proper picture as far as this matter is concerned. Consequently I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition may be somewhat hasty if he wants a definite reply now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umlazi referred to the problem of containerization. He said that we had dealt with this matter in a very casual way and at a very late stage. The fact of the matter is that the whole idea of containerization took shape in the past year after instructions had been given that new ships were to be built according to these specifications. Some of them were even used to convey war supplies to South Vietnam. The idea of its being used on a world basis has only recently been adopted. A great deal has been written about it and there have been many symposiums, conferences and commissions about it. The commissions&#x2019; reports on it are already available. As far as South Africa is concerned, it is a matter which was investigated by the Department of Transport long ago, because this Department is charged not only with internal transport, but also with our harbours. The fact remains that if containerization is introduced on a large scale, it would mean the rebuilding of harbours, the use of greater cranes and the building of new ships. It would also mean that the railway system would have to adapt itself to it because the articles to be transported by way of containerization must be containerized at the outset if possible. They must be loaded and transported in containerized form. At the destination suitable harbours must also be available where they can be off-loaded. This is therefore a problem which must be considered in its entirety. It also depends on what commodities are to be exported. As far as fruit is concerned, it is perhaps not as easy as in the case of certain of our other export <span class="col_6421-6422" refersTo="page_0415"/>commodities. The hon. member will agree with me that it is a very extensive problem. We discussed this matter before with the conference lines and we pointed out to them that this revolution was taking place in the world and that they should pay attention to it. They then informed us that they were fully aware of it because Union Castle, which is also one of the interested parties, was already introducing it on other lines in the world. They made a thorough investigation, <i>inter alia,</i> on the line to Australia as well. Their advice to us more than a year ago was that the time had not yet arrived for a commission to be appointed to investigate all the facets of the matter. A month or so ago they told us that they thought that the time was opportune. They said that sufficient information was available about the problems in this connection as experienced in other parts of the world. A great deal of progress was made with the Australian report, which indicates that freight which is at present handled by 80 ships, can perhaps be handled by only eight. However, there are many problems connected with this. There is trade union opposition on the part of labour. To sum this matter up, it has been decided to establish a joint committee, because the Railways already has all the required information in connection with harbours and transport. The shipping lines, however, will also have to adapt themselves to it. As far as money is concerned, this switchover will cost hundreds of millions of rands. Very thorough consideration will have to be given as to whether it is economic and practicable to us to go in for it. We have already made a great deal of progress with the composition and the terms of reference of this commission. On the basis of the information already available, it will be able to issue its report fairly soon. As far as the attendance of international discussions is concerned, arrangements have already been made for our trade representative in London to attend that conference.</p>

<block name="quote">At the time when border area development commenced in 1960, an estimated number of 55,000 Bantu and 21,000 other workers were employed in secondary industry in the border and Bantu areas.

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour? To-day I do not wish to fight with the hon. the Minister. I want to invite the hon. the Minister to discuss with us across the floor of the House what is probably the most difficult and most intractable problem that faces South Africa now and that will face it in the future. The hon. the Minister will agree with me when I say that South Africa has to-day reached a peak of development and that it is straining every muscle to leap forward to an even greater future. Yet we find our economy hamstrung and threatened with paralysis because we cannot use our labour resources to the best advantage. The time has come that we in South Africa should face the facts. In facing the facts we should ask ourselves how, in circumstances that must lead to inevitable change in the labour pattern of South Africa, we can best protect the interests of all the workers, but especially of the white workers, who feel themselves embattled and that their security and standard of living is threatened.</p>

<p>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that we have acquired prosperity in South Africa, industrial leadership as well as leadership in the economic field generally in Africa, because we have had the insight and the ability to use all our human labour resources for the development of our country. According to all the economists, including Government economists, we have set ourselves up on an irreversible course. On that course we can no longer think in terms of economic <span class="col_6423-6424" refersTo="page_0416"/>separation, that the things which our manufacturing industry, our agriculture and our mines contribute to the wealth of South Africa can be done without using non-white labour, Bantu labour specifically. One can quote many authorities to support this. There is sufficient authority for this statement to satisfy the hon. the Minister and any person who is objective in his approach to this problem. Take, for instance, the reports on the economic development programmes for South Africa issued by the Economic Council attached to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s department. All its projections are based on an increase, a growing increase, in the proportion of non-white labour, of Bantu labour specifically, employed in industry in South Africa. We must remember that the first economic development programme was published in 1964 and covered the period 1964-1969. In preparing this first programme and in considering all the facts upon which their expectations were based, they had, as intelligent men, to take into account the fact that we have a government in power which tries to follow a policy of separate development in the economic field as well. Thinking on that basis, these experts advising the Prime Minister could not escape the conclusion that our dependence upon non-white labour, and upon Bantu labour specifically, will continue for as long as they can see into the future. About 80 per cent of our total labour force in South Africa today consists of non-whites, and and about 72 per cent of the labour force in manufacturing industry alone consist of non-whites. And all authorities agree that this percentage will grow. As a matter of fact, the facts available to us show that the number of non-whites in employment is growing, thus proving the projections of the E.D.P. in 1964 to be correct. In March this year the hon. Minister of Planning replied to a question which was put to him by the hon. member for Port Natal. The figures the Minister gave in reply to that question are most interesting. These show that white workers employed by private industries and by public bodies&#x2014;such as in the Government service, in the S.A. Railways, in the Post Office, in control boards, in provincial administrations and in local authorities&#x2014;increased during the period 1965 to 1967 by 43,000, 21,328 of whom were absorbed by Government and semi-Government bodies. The number of non-white workers during that same period, however, increased by almost 120,000, 53,000 of whom were absorbed in Government and semi-Government service. This shows that the proportion of non-white workers in our industries and in Government and semi-Government employ is, despite what we may think and protest, growing by the day and that we have not yet found it possible to arrest, let alone reverse, this trend. Looking at the latest report of the Department of Labour one can find equally interesting figures. At the end of 1966, for instance, 1,127,141 workers were employed in industries in South Africa: 289,385 Whites; 186,480 Coloureds; 56,772 Asiatics; and 594,576 Bantu. Three years previously, i.e. at the end of 1963, the total labour force in South Africa counted 903,545: 232,718 Whites; 146,172 Coloureds 44,740 Asiatics; and 479,796 Bantu. This means that while white workers in registered factories increased by 57,000 in those same three years the number of non-whites increased by 167,000. Of this increase almost 115,000 were Bantu. For these figures I have to thank the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department of Labour. They are certainly most revealing. The Government tells us that they are concerned about this. We hear, especially from the voluble Deputy Minister for Bantu Affairs, that it is the Government&#x2019;s hope and intention to make South Africa&#x2019;s economy, and especially South Africa&#x2019;s industry, less dependent upon black labour. In fairness one must say that they do have some suggestions and even laws on the Statute Book to try to reverse the use of black labour especially in our existing cities. One of the major solutions they offer is the employment of black people in industries established and to be established on the borders of our reserves. Does that solve the problem the Government sees? I must concede immediately that the establishment of boder industries and the employment of Bantu labour from the adjoining reserves does assist in alleviating the social problems that arise when one has to bring large numbers of black workers from their existing homelands to the cities where one has to house them and supply them with all the amenities of modern living. There is some degree of relief in regard to that problem in the policy of border industries. It does, however, not solve the political problem. It does not solve the ultimate economic problem, which is the dependence of South African industries on Bantu labour. As we have said so often in this House, whether you house the Natives employed in white industries in Soweto or Nyanga, or whether you house them in the areas adjacent to East London or Pinelands, you do not change the fact that these are white industries depending for their production on the use of black labour. That is the first fact I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Labour that we should face. I want to say to-day, and I know that I cannot be contradicted, that the more the border industry policy succeeds, the greater the speed at which we employ black labour in industry will become. You might recall that we looked at this aspect very acutely quite recently when we discussed housing on the vote of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. We discussed the question of prefabricated buildings with him, and he said that one of the solutions to the labour problem in the building industry was to erect prefabricated houses, but to let the prefabrication take place in factories on the borders of the reserves and then to bring these semi-prepared houses to sites in the white cities and to have them erected there by white labour. The effect of this will be that when you take the building industry as a whole the proportion of black workers to white workers will increase in favour of the black <span class="col_6425-64266425_6426" refersTo="page_0417"/>workers. You may shift them to the border industries, but they will still be working to erect houses in the white areas. Housing in South Africa will still be dependent upon black labour. That, I think, is the essential fact that we have to face. The policy in pursuance of which the hon. the Minister of Planning and the hon. the Minister of Labour are now prepared to bend our economy as was threatened years ago, is not the policy that will make South Africa&#x2019;s economy, prosperity and growth less dependent on black labour than it is to-day.</p>

<p>The other solution that we have heard, but which we do not hear so often these days, is a solution that was much loved by the hon. the Deputy Minister for Bantu Administration. I am not sure whether he consulted the hon. the Minister of Labour before he made these speeches, because it concerns the hon. the Minister of Labour. That solution was a greater degree of automation. I think that we must be careful in dealing with this matter. Automation cannot be taken very far in South Africa unless we develop a very large internal market which will make the methods of mass production applicable to the South African economy. Unless one uses more and more black labour in better jobs and pay them better, one cannot create an internal market in South Africa which will make automation possible. The very thought of automation becomes impossible if one wants automation at the expense of the use of black labour. This is not a solution. It would be wiser for us in South Africa to stay with the facts and not to indulge in dreams and fantasies.</p>

<p>One of the resultant facts from this major fact which I mentioned is that the line of demarcation in industry in respect of the work done by white people because of the conventional or statutory colour bar is going higher and higher. As it goes higher the proportion of white workers becomes smaller and smaller and the proportion of black workers and other non-white workers doing semiskilled work is becoming larger. We have seen this phenomenon taking place before our very eyes, namely in the South African Railways. The hon. the Minister of Transport has had to confess in this House that under his administration 16,000 jobs formerly done by white workers are now being done by non-white workers. We have recently seen this in the mines. After there were tremendous difficulties with the Mine Workers&#x2019; Union, those problems were overcome and as a result there has been a re-allocation of jobs on the mines which makes it possible for Bantu workers to do work that they could not do before. We have seen this in Iscor and we have heard Mr. Lukas van den Berg express great concern over the fact that he himself has had to agree that more non-white workers should be used in jobs formerly done by Whites. He expressed the expectation that this will be a temporary arrangement. This is a futile dream. The work will never go back to the white workers. Once it has been taken over by black workers, as I will show in another context, the takeover is final. This is also happening in the Post Office. We see white postmen delivering letters in Johannesburg, but black postment delivering telegrams. That is the logic of it. We recently saw it in the huge agreement on behalf of more than 350,000 workers which was entered into by the steel industry of South Africa, through the Industrial Council for the Steel Industry. There was an agreement completely re-allocating and redemarcating jobs, with the result that a large number of jobs that have been traditionally reserved for white people have now been graded at such a low rate of pay&#x2014;this is a point that should be noted&#x2014;that no white man can do that work and live at a white man&#x2019;s standard. In other words, these jobs have gone to non-Whites and even if there was to be a depression to-morrow, there jobs will not go back to the white people because the white man cannot live on the wage that has now been determined. We have seen this in the building industry, Government and municipal departments and in every sphere of South Africa&#x2019;s activity. More and more jobs are being taken over, necessarily and inescapably because of the shortage of manpower, by non-white workers in our industries. Indeed, we are getting a strange phenomenon in our labour relations in South Africa, namely that the rate for the job is disappearing in favour of a new principle that I can only call the rate for the race. Jobs to-day are determined in such a way, and wages fixed in such a way by the Wage Board, that a job is only available to and can only be filled by a particular race. Once you have a job where the rate for the race has been fixed, it becomes a rate for that race and no other race, and certainly not for a race at a higher standard of living.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I think that we have to accept that these changes are coming about under a Nationalist Party Government, under an apartheid government, and under a separate development government and that they are coming about in a form which makes them a permanent and an immutable part of the economic organization of South Africa. These jobs are permanently lost to the whites. The only time that whites may want to do those jobs again will be in a time of depression. But in a depression there is a tendency to cut wages. No employer will then raise wages in certain jobs in order to employ unemployed whites in them. We have to face up to this, and hon. members opposite may squirm in their seats and grumble and complain as much as they like, but this is a fact that they cannot escape. It is a fact as large and solid as a ball which one can feel and touch.</p>

<p>Another interesting result of this change in the labour pattern of South Africa is that, certainly in the opinion of the leaders of the <span class="col_6427-6428" refersTo="page_0418"/>white trade unions, the bargaining power of the white man is decreasing. We have to face up to this fact. They fear that they are weakening in the power which they wield when it comes to facing their employers across the table in the process of collective bargaining. That fear is expressed in various ways. Some trade union leaders see a great conspiracy to-day on the part of the employers to emphasize the shortage of manpower with an ulterior motive. The ulterior motive they see is to compel the greater use of the cheap black and other non-white labour in the place of white workers. This attitude is part of the insecurity the white worker has to-day. It is part of the fear he has for his job, because he appreciates that his bargaining power is decreasing. This fear was well expressed recently in the annual report of the Engine Drivers, Firemen&#x2019;s and Operators Association through Mr. Ken du Preez, the Secretary. I do not want to quote what he said, but anyone who is interested can see how they feel. It was published in a newspaper on the 15th May and the psychological insight it gives one into the insecurity of the white worker as his bargaining power decreases, because he is becoming a smaller and smaller proportion of the total labour force in South Africa, is something that has great educational value for all of us. This has of course been stated much more directly by other trade union leaders. Mr. E. H. McCan of the Amalgamated Engineering Union cannot be called a liberal. He is a conservative trade union leader and this is what he said on the 9th or 10th May&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As more and more non-Whites are employed in industry where our membership is presently employed, the trade unions become less representative and in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act will no longer be representative of the workers in the industry for the purpose of negotiating agreements</block>

<p>This has happened almost completely in certain industries like the furniture industry and the garment industry. It is becoming more and more difficult for white trade unions to bargain in the interests of white workers, because their employers and the Minister can simply say to them in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, that they are not representative of the workers in that undertaking, industry or area. That is another problem which we have to face realistically.</p>

<p>Against this background one of the most dangerous features of the labour situation is the Government&#x2019;s policy to internationalize labour negotiations in South Africa. It is the Government&#x2019;s policy, to have our industries in the white man&#x2019;s area on the borders of the Bantu areas and then to have a labour force domiciled on the black man&#x2019;s side of the border where, eventually, there will be independent governments so that labour negotiations between the workers and employers will not be between the trade union and the employers organization, but between government and government. Once the Government allows that to develop&#x2014;and develop it they must because it is their policy&#x2014;the position of the white man in the process of collective bargaining will be powerless and pitiable indeed. It is a most dangerous policy which this Government is contemplating. That is why, even among trade unionists to-day, there is a growing demand that the Bantu should be allowed to organize themselves. This does not only come from the Trade Union Council of South Africa, but even from members of the Confederation of Trade Unions. Even a conservative man who is well-known to the hon. the Minister of Transport, namely Mr. Liebenberg, suggested that they should be given media and organizations through which they can bargain with their employers. He has recently stated that it is an impossible situation that these people cannot bargain. I do not want to go into this, however. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>What is the worry of hon. members opposite? They make very much noise, but they look most miserable to me. I think the Minister should react to the suggestion of Mr. Liebenberg, which greatly appeals to me, and that is that our Settlement of Bantu Disputes Act may be due for revision and that the works committees in the various factories should be reformed so that they can take part in the processes of collective bargaining. It would be interesting to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to a thought like that. The point that the Minister has to face is this, that as the Minister of Planning succeeds in stopping new Bantu from coming into our industrial areas, the existing industrial areas, so there will be a premium placed on the value of the work of the Bantu who are in our white industrial areas, and obviously it would pay their employers, because of their scarcity value, to use them more efficiently. That is about the only good thing I can see as a result of the Minister&#x2019;s policy. And the employers will train them better and use them better and will use them more efficiently and give them more opportunities. But then they will become a more efficient labour force and they will know that they are entitled to greater rewards and they will ask for them. What is the attitude of the Government to that? We know what the attitude of the Government is in regard to the border industries, but what is its attitude going to be in regard to the growingly sophisticated labour force that will remain in the white cities of South Africa as their policy progresses? Looking at the hon. the Minister of Planning, it is obvious that he has never given this matter a thought. But I think it is time for the Minister of Labour to give these matters a thought, because the Minister of Planning and the Minister of Bantu Administration are running away with the Minister of Labour. They have a firm hold <span class="col_6429-6430" refersTo="page_0419"/>on him and we do not know where they are taking him, and I think the time has come for the Minister of Labour to have a serious discussion with them about these things. I should like to know from the Minister what his attitude is going to be. When I spoke just now about organizing black labour, there were exclamations of horror from the other side, but I want to ask the Minister what happens if, as the Bantu areas develop to self-rule, they are granted, in accordance with the philosophy of the Government, everything in their area that the white man can wish for himself in his area. One of the things that they will wish for in their area is the right to form complete trade unions after the model of those of the white people in white South Africa, unions which can bargain with the employers on the other side of the border in terms of the laws of their own country. What will the Minister say to that? What will be the effect of that internationalization of our labour relations in South Africa?</p>

<p>What is the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to the fact that the low wages being paid in these border industries are lasting so long? We have had the excuse for paying low wages in the border industries, much lower than the wages paid for the same job in the white area, namely that this labour is raw and unskilled and has to be trained until it is sufficiently productive. But the type of work they do, does not remain unskilled and unproductive for ever, and some of these border industries have been carrying on for years. It is a long time since Prof. Sakkies Fourie first raised the question of the low wages paid in factories in the Eastern Transvaal. When are these wages going to be revised? The trade unions are asking that there should be a regular revision of the wages paid in these border areas to prevent unfair competition between those industries and the industries in the white area and also to see that we shall never be open to the accusation that we are using sweated labour in South Africa. What is the Minister&#x2019;s policy on this matter? I shall be very glad if he will tell us.</p>

<p>I think I can assume, because of the undoubted intelligence of the Minister, that he agrees with this side of the House that changes in our labour pattern are inevitable. I know the hon. the Minister of Transport agrees with it because he acts accordingly; he is doing a great deal to change the labour pattern in South Africa by setting an example on the S.A. Railways and Harbours: he cannot help himself; he is just being sensible. I know it is a strange thing for a member of the Cabinet, but I want to pay tribute to the Minister of Transport for being sensible in accepting the position and in co-operating with the inevitable. But I want to know what the attitude of the Department of Labour and of the Government is in this matter. This pattern is changing, and we know that job reservation is a dead letter. I do not think we have had a single new job reservation during the past years; there was none in 1966 or in 1967 as far as I can remember. I know there are more exemptions than there are groups of people affected by the job reservations which are in force to-day.</p>

<p>I want to make some suggestions to the Minister and I shall be grateful if he will react. I want to know whether he will agree that as this labour pattern inevitably changes, stimulated by the example of the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and others, like the Minister of Community Development&#x2014;will he agree with us that that change must be so organized that all the workers of South Africa will derive benefit from the fact that productivity in South Africa must increase as the result of those changes? Will he agree with this side of the House when I say that we should educate our white workers to see this change (and here I am glad to have on my side a very prominent South African like Mr. Hugo, the General Manager of Railways; I do not like quoting officials here, but he did make a public statement on this issue) not as a threat to their security but as a tremendous and wonderful opportunity for their progress and their advancement as human beings; and whether we should not see to it that opportunity can be taken by our white workers by making their education and, where necessary, their reeducation, possible; that we must end the unhappy phenomenon in South Africa where we reap our human corn when it is still green and drag young children into the labour market when they can still benefit from further education? We must end the shortage of teachers; the bottlenecks in the training for artisans should end in South Africa. What is the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to that? What is his reaction if we say to him from this side of the House that we should prevent any opportunities for unscrupulous employers to exploit the situation by bringing into an industry workers at a low rate of pay at the expense of workers who are accustomed to a higher rate of pay? And when we say that whenever competition is possible between worker and worker, we should observe the principle of the rate for the job, what is the Minister&#x2019;s reaction? What is the Minister&#x2019;s reaction when I say to him that we should consider, as Gen. Smuts did in the case of the Natives Building Workers&#x2019; Act of 1946, where the white workers concerned were given a guarantee that for a certain period of years they would be guaranteed employment at real wages in the national interest &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>We listened attentively to the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville in which he tried again to-day to make a political debate of this debate on the Labour Vote. The hon. member for Yeoville tried to alarm the White workers by maintaining that the National Government was depriving them of their jobs by placing non-Whites in those jobs. But we have become accustomed to these tactics of his. Every year he presents us with this black picture of our industries becoming blacker. But in the end the <span class="col_6431-6432" refersTo="page_0420"/>hon. member said that he wanted to make a few suggestions to the Minister; he said that the workers shall listen to what Mr. Hugo had told them, that they should avail themselves of this opportunity to make progress now, but is the hon. member not the one who, the moment any concessions are made as on the Railways for example, makes a great fuss about those concessions? The Opposition makes a fuss about it if Bantu are employed by the Railways. They do not regard that as progress in this country; they only regard it as something which makes the labour market in the Republic of South Africa blacker. Sir, if there is one Department of which we can be proud in this country of ours, it is the Department of Labour. The Minister of Finance announced a few weeks ago that our reserves had exceeded R1 billion for the first time, and for that we owe not only the Minister of Finance and his Department a debt of gratitude, but the Minister of Labour and his Department an even greater debt of gratitude, because the Department of Labour is the very Department which in these times has brought about the labour peace which we are experiencing to-day. Had it not been for the labour peace prevailing in the Republic, we would not have been able to boast to-day about the wonderful progress we had made in the field of industrial development, and then the Minister of Finance would not have been able to boast about the reserves of R1 billion which we have to-day. Sir, how did we obtain this labour peace in this country? Was job reservation not the very means of doing so? Is job reservation not one of the mainstays of labour peace? What else is it if not that? But the hon. member wants to tell us to-day that we should change our labour pattern. Can we in this country ever contemplate changing our labour pattern?</p>

<p>Let the hon. member tell me whether they would allow that. No, the hon. member will not allow that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to raise another matter with the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Prime Minister said at a meeting in Nigel that the Government was giving consideration to sending members of labour organizations overseas to put the point of view of the worker to overseas countries. This afternoon I want to make a very strong plea to the hon. the Minister of Labour that the idea expressed by the Prime Minister of sending the chairman, secretaries or committee members of labour organizations overseas, should be propagated strongly and that the opportunity of going overseas should be afforded the workers as well just as we as Members of Parliament are afforded the opporunity of doing so, in order to make contact there with workers of other countries and in order to bring the policy of this Government and the situation in this country to the attention of those workers. I feel that it has become essential for the workers to be afforded the opportunity of making contact with workers abroad in order to explain our policy. I welcome the idea which the hon. the Prime Minister expressed at Nigel and I want to make a plea to the Minister this afternoon that this idea should be promoted and that it should be put into practice as soon as possible, because it is essential that members of the various labour organizations should have the opportunity of making contact with one another both here in the Republic and abroad. It has already been proved in the Republic of South Africa that if one has a content labour force one can achieve wonders. The Department of Labour has succeeded here in the Republic in keeping our labour force content for the very reason that it looks after the interests of not only the white man in the country but also those of the non-Whites in all spheres. I want to say to the hon. member for Yeoville this afternoon that we should be careful that we do not knock down those pillars on which our industrial peace rests, because that will only lead to chaos in our industries, a state of affairs which none of us wants. The idea which is propagated at present <span class="col_6433-6434" refersTo="page_0421"/>by certain trade union leaders that the Bantu should be allowed to organize themselves into trade unions is a dangerous one. It is something which we should not encourage. It is the duty of the Government as well as the Opposition to discourage that idea and to wipe it out immediately as it cannot benefit us in any way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I hope that the hon. the Minister will conduct this discussion on a higher level than the hon. member who has just sat down. The hon. member contradicted himself in every possible way and made his contribution completely worthless by exhibiting his lack of knowledge of the subject. In suggesting that we have taken umbrage at any change in the labour pattern he was admitting firstly that that change was taking place. How can we object to the Minister of Transport making certain changes in his labour organization unless those changes take place? The hon. member therefore admits that under this Government changes are taking place. Then I want to correct him. We do not take exception to the fact that the Minister does that, and the Minister knows that we do not take exception to it, but we certainly use it politically to point out how the facts of the situation force members of the Government to depart from the impracticable theory of separate development in the economic sphere. When the Minister of Transport is responsible for keeping the trains running, then he cannot carry out the very policy for which the hon. member for Brakpan is pleading. That is the point we make and we are entitled to make it. For the hon. member to suggest that we are pleading for a change in the labour pattern is nonsense. I might as well plead then that every human being should be born with five fingers on each hand; That is a fact, and we are dealing with the facts as we find them. I am asking how we can face this changing pattern in such a way that all sections of our people will benefit by it and, above all, in such a way that our white workers will not have their position endangered as a result of the inevitable change. That was the whole gist of my argument, but the hon. member did not listen to it. The hon. member asks whether I am in favour of black trade unions. I am not in favour of black trade unions and I will explain it in a minute. But there is nothing in the laws in South Africa to prevent black people from organizing themselves into trade unions. Why then does he ask me that question? If the Government is against it why do they not stop it? There is no law in South Africa to prevent the existence or the formation of a black trade union. All that happened was that when the Industrial Conciliation Act was put before this Parliament by the old South African Party Government in 1924, before the first Nationalist Party Government came into power, black people were excluded from the definition of &#x201C;employee&#x201D;. Therefore they cannot use their trade unions in the process of collective bargaining, as White, Coloured or Indian trade unions are entitled to do. Why does the hon. member for Brakpan come with these suggestions and insinuations which have nothing to do with the merits of the case? They are suggestions and insinuations which amount to mere suspicion-mongering and which do not contribute one iota to the solution of this difficult and vexed problem.</p>

<p>Sir, I was asking the hon. the Minister to react to certain suggestions which represent the policy of the Opposition. I want him to react to a few more. It is our feeling that where this change is taking place&#x2014;here I think the Minister and we are upon fairly close common ground&#x2014;it is best brought about as a result of the workings of industrial democracy, as was the case in the steel industry, the Railways and many others. The changes in the pattern should be brought about as a result of agreement between organized employers and organized trade unions. We feel that that is the most important safeguard for the standards of the workers in South Africa. It is not that we are pleading for it. It has been happening. We think it is right. I would like to know rhe Minister&#x2019;s reaction on that point.</p>

<p>I would like to know if the Minister will agree with me that, where this change is inevitably taking place in our labour field, it must happen, unfortunately, that some white workers, perhaps also some Coloured or Indian workers, will fall by the wayside, that they may not be able to meet the changes in the tempo of competition in our industrial life. I would like to know whether he will agree that in order to meet their position we should take special measures, and we should be agreed that special measures are necessary. I think, for example, that there should be spheres of protected work for people who, through physical or intellectual inability, cannot compete properly.</p>

<p>I also believe that the time has come that we should consider a minimum wage for those workers who are included in the definition of &#x201C;employer&#x201D; in the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>No. Job reservation gives the Minister powers in any industry in South Africa to reserve certain jobs for one race or the other. I am suggesting an extension of the principle of sheltered employment, as we had in South Africa for many years before job reservation was known.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he will also agree that something must be done to bring about a regular revision of the wages paid in the border industries to prevent unfair competition and to confirm the Minister&#x2019;s own argument that those lower wages are only justifiable while this labour is unsophisticated and cannot produce the same quantity of goods and give the same services as the more sophisticated labour in the existing areas.</p>

<p><span class="col_6435-6436" refersTo="page_0422"/>Finally, I would like to know whether the Minister would not agree that, when all this is done, there may still be people who feel that they have been neglected, that they have lost and suffered as a result of the change. Therefore there should be some impartial body to which they can appeal for consideration of their grievances and for redress, or else suggestions to the Minister by an impartial body of how this redress should be brought about. Perhaps the Industrial Tribunal, about the functions of which we are very doubtful&#x2014; since its establishment many of those doubts were justified&#x2014;should be reformed to some extent to be an industrial court of appeal, to which aggrieved individuals and unions can apply for a redress of grievances or for an explanation of grievances, if they are not fully justified.</p>

<p>So, there I have tried to suggest some positive aspects of policy to the Minister, and I think this debate will become worthwhile if the Minister will on merits discuss these problems with us and also give us his views with regard to the suggestions I have made. I personally want to say that other members on this side of the House will deal with the same problems, with more specific aspects of his policy. But we on this side of the House are convinced that, in considering this problem of the inevitable, inescapable changing labour pattern in South Africa, we are facing one of the most crucial problems any government will have to face in South Africa and any nation has to face in the world. That is why we hope that our approach to this will be serious, and not as flippant as that of the hon. member for Brakpan.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Yeoville. Since he is the policy-maker of the United Party, I expected him this afternoon to offer us and the workers of South Africa something better than they are receiving from the National Party Government. But I am convinced that, just as in the past 20 years, the United Party will again be rejected by the worker of South Africa in the next 20 years, because the hon. member has nothing to offer. He did not tell us this afternoon what the United Party would do to protect the white worker against non-White competition. On the contrary, he attacked the steps the present Government is taking to protect the white worker. He did not tell the White worker that the United Party would give him something better. He said here that the non-white was already taking over the labour market, but what he did not tell us was that industrial development in this country was phenomenal during the past 20 years and that non-Whites had of necessity to be employed in industry. However, he did not prove that the ratio between Whites and non-Whites in industry had been disturbed. He must first prove this point before he can come along with this kind of argument in an effort to scare the white worker in that way. We want him to tell the worker of South Africa precisely what the policy of his party is so that the worker will know where he stands with the United Party. The United Party&#x2019;s problem is the following: They are dealing with a patriotic white labour force in South Africa, a white labour force that has never been prepared to fall prey to socialistic liberalistic trade unionism, but that has remained loyal to and steadfast in the traditions of South Africa. The attitude of the white worker of South Africa is one of maintaining conservatism, and for that reason he has rejected the United Party at every election since 1948. If the United Party were to depend on the white worker of South Africa, it would be in the wilderness for ever and it would never have the privilege of endangering the position of the white workers as against that of the non-Whites. At the same time, the white worker is supporting the Government to an increasing extent to-day because he realizes that industrial development is to his advantage and that proper separation of the races is also to his advantage. He also knows that a good opportunity is being afforded him to progress. We in this House can only speak with the greatest praise of the white workers of the Republic of South Africa. They are responsible people; they are people who are prepared to work hard, because they are also patriotic, because they believe in &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;, and because they want to develop this country further and to achieve further industrial heights for South Africa. Last year when the hon. the Prime Minister called upon the workers of South Africa not to make irresponsible wage claims while the economy of the country was struggling with inflation, the workers of South Africa heeded that request, to the regret of the United Party and all the British newspapers in South Africa. They heeded that request notwithstanding all the incitement indulged in by the hon. member for Yeoville and those British newspapers in South Africa. For that reason we say we are grateful, and especially the industrialists of South Africa may be grateful that they have such a good white labour force to develop their industries, to allow them to flourish and thereby to fill their pockets with such great profits. The development of the Republic is largely indebted to that.</p>

<p>There is a certain matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, and I want to ask him that greater attention be given to it. It is with sincere gratitude that we take cognizance of everything which his Department is doing in connection with aptitude and trade tests and vocational guidance. However, we believe that even greater heights can be achieved in the development of our country if these services can be extended further. We believe that the manpower shortage in this country can be reduced to a very large extent if the right worker is harnessed to the right position in order to do his best. Therefore we want to ask whether these aptitude tests cannot be <span class="col_6437-6438" refersTo="page_0423"/>extended further. We read in the annual report of the cumulative reports which are being received from the schools, reports which the Department can use with advantage when people seeking employment are interviewed. I want to ask that these aptitude tests be extended so that every boy in our counry has to undergo an aptitude test before he leaves school and, if possible, before he leaves primary school. The children can thus be channelled into the direction for which they show an aptitude. Many of our boys leave school at a very early age because they cannot make progress at school and because no indication is given to them as to what direction they should follow according to their particular capabilities and aptitudes. Our manpower shortage can be relieved to a large extent if those boys could be guided in the right direction when the time is ripe, and they will be trained for their future careers even before they go to high school. The vocational guidance which is being given is of a high standard. This publication is an excellent one. But people see it only when they are out of work and when they come to the Department for work. But very few people are subject to the tests. According to this annual report about 24,000 people were subject to these tests during that year and they made use of vocational guidance, that is both technical guidance and tests. I am convinced that if these services are extended to our primary schools, the situation would be greatly improved. It may now be said this kind of work is the task of the educationalists but it is, after all, the responsibility of the Department of Labour to ensure that we will have a highly skilled labour force in South Africa to do the work and to expand and develop our country further.</p>

<p>In addition, I want to say that a person can only be realty happy and derive pleasure from his work when he does the work he was born to do. The Creator wanted each one of us to do a certain task, and for that reason I believe that the hon. member for Yeoville should never have been here, because he would have realized that he was on the wrong side.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the most interesting thing that has been said so far by hon. members on the Government side, is the remark by the hon. member for Brakpan, who said the hon. the Prime Minister is anxious that people from this country, especially workers, should go and visit overseas countries. The first inference, which can be drawn from that remark is that the Prime Minister acknowledges by implication, that a situation has arisen which needs some explaining. Moreover, I hope the workers who do go, will not all be white. I think a few black workers should go and do some explaining as well.</p>

<p>I wish to discuss with the Minister the prospects which face us in this country, unless some constructive approach is adopted towards the vast number of Bantu employed in our industries. It has been said that when the border industries adjoining the Transkei are in full swing, it will be possible for Bantu in the Transkei to form themselves into trade unions, which will be able to negotiate with their employers. One must, however, not lose sight of the fact that, in terms of Government policy, these Bantu will have their own countrymen working here in the Republic. We heard the other day that the latter will be given passports and that they will really be nationals of the Bantustans. Therefore, it is fair to assume, these people will belong to trade unions in the Bantustans and industrial negotiations will take place between those trade unions and employers in the Republic.</p>

<p>I think every white worker in this country is concerned, but not in the way indicated by the hon. members for Langlaagte and Brakpan. However much, we may wish to avoid the facts, the facts are, that five out of every six workers in industry in this country, are black or coloured. In other words, one out of six workers is white. By means of job resevation the Government tried to halt the introduction of non-Whites into industry. According to my information, there were only 21 reservations in terms of the Job Reservation Act in 12 years and of these, two were suspended in the engineering industry, one was declared <i>ultra vires</i> in the clothing industry&#x2014;it was formerly number one, now number eight&#x2014;and moreover the percentage of people affected by job reservation is negligible. I am informed they number about 50,000. So, Sir, I say job reservation has gone by the board; it is finished. Here we have small White trade unions, whose numbers may be large, but which in terms of the number of employees in industry in South Africa have small memberships. Negotiations are taking place across the conference table. Minimum wages are fixed, but very few White journeymen and other artisans receive a wage in terms of the fixed minimum wage because they are paid premium wages. There is a feeling among trade unions, that the wages fixed in terms of an industrial agreement should have a maximum as well as a minimum figure. That would result in the White worker getting a much higher wage than he gets to-day. To-day it is left to the employer to negotiate with the worker, on the basis of the man selling his ability and his skill in the best market. As hon. members no doubt know, there is no mention of colour in industrial agreements: Industrial agreements are based on various jobs and what is paid to the people doing those jobs. In the case of the Confederation of Labour, which forms the whole basis of the Blanke Werkersbeskermersunie, there also, concessions had to be made. Bantu men had to do jobs formerly done by Whites for a white man&#x2019;s wages. Any sensible person must to-day realize, that unless the Government faces up objectively to the proper control of Bantu labour, to ensure that they are adequately paid, and paid on the basis that they do not compete unfairly with the white worker, <span class="col_6439-6440" refersTo="page_0424"/>the Government will be guilty of gross negligence. Much as we may wish to shut our eyes to it, more and more black people are going into industry and trade than ever before. It is an irreversible process.</p>

<p>Let us look at the attitude of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. He is trying to remove Bantu from the Western Cape. Where do they go? They have to be employed in the Eastern Cape, and if they cannot get work there, they just come back here to the Western Cape. These policies of or actions by the Government, seem to indicate that something is being done, but the people concerned who should be moved, are in fact still with us. They may be 300 or 400 miles away, but the Government has not succeeded in its policy. As we heard to-day, when another Vote was under discussion, they are congregating around East London where they are becoming quite a serious problem from an unemployment point of view.</p>

<p>I say to the hon. the Minister that I should like him to explain to us why he is so hostile to TUCSA when they are endeavouring to get the Bantu worker organized. When I say organized, I do not mean organizing them to create disturbances and things like that. I have many years of experience in dealing with industrial agreements, on the international as well as on the local national levels, and I can tell this House, quite frankly, that the attitude of workers in the international field is to give a fair day&#x2019;s work for a fair day&#x2019;s pay, whereas before they used to ask for a fair day&#x2019;s pay for a fair day&#x2019;s work. These people negotiate; they ask for better conditions; they ask for social welfare benefits; for pensions and shorter hours of work, the limitation of loads carried by one man; they discuss the position of women in industry and the ages at which minors should be employed. These are the fields in which industrial councils work on the international plane. They are quite straightforward and the resolutions are called conventions.</p>

<p>As far as white labour in this country is concerned, we have a tremendously good record. Our Industrial Conciliation Act is as good as any in the world, and indeed it is better than most legislation of a similar kind, but when one talks about labour matters at international congresses one is asked: &#x201C;What about the great black mass in South Africa?&#x201D;. As I have said, in our country the &#x201C;great black mass&#x201D; constitute five-sixths of the number of people employed in trade and industry. These are the people I think the Minister should apply his mind to, because the present Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act simply does not work. I do not know how many years ago a minimum wage was set for Bantu workers; it must be over twenty years ago if it is a day. I recall that the only representations that were made came from one man who used to attend meetings of the Industrial Council, where employers and employees had discussions, who pleaded for more money for Bantu workers. Of course, the Bantu of those days and the Bantu of to-day are totally different persons. What the Bantu of to-day is interested in, is to get more money, a better wage, more comforts, a better home, educating his children, and having his health seen to when he is ill. These are the things they are interested in, the same as anybody else. I believe the Government is making a vast mistake when it regards these people as a menace. They are nothing of the sort. I believe if our Bantu were introduced into trade and industry on an orderly basis and with a proper arrangement with employers, together with adequate safeguards for white workers, perhaps by way of paying minimum wages or some other way, we would, I believe, begin to show some progress.</p>
