<li>(3) whether prospecting licences are to be given in respect of surrounding farms from which it is proposed to remove Bantu residents.</li>

<p><span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="#page_1249"/> Dr. E. L. FISHER: Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, may I ask him why no notices were put up regarding the proclamation of this land and the prospecting rights that would be available?</p>

<p>The MINISTER: The position is that there is no legal obligation upon the Department to publish this information but now that the hon. member has raised the matter, I will go into it with the Department, and if it is possible and feasible, we will do so in future.</p>

<p>Dr. E. L. FISHER: Further arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, how was it possible for the persons named to know that these facilities were available?</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<p>Records of the expenditure under the direct control of the Department, are not kept on the basis of the hon. member&#x2019;s question and there is the further consideration that practically all State Departments contribute in some respect to the development of the different groups and the cash value of the contribution by each cannot be determined.

<from>The MINISTER OF FINANCE:</from>

<p>I am only in a position to reply to this question as far as my own departments are concerned, as details of services rendered by firms of accountants and payments made to them by other departments are recorded by each department separately. As far as my departments are concerned the reply is as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p>A. Department of Finance.</p>

<p>Professor B. Wiehahn was appointed as professional adviser to the Decimalization Board in 1959 and rendered services in that capacity at the approved tariff of R6.60 per hour until the 1st July, 1961. In view of the fact that all vouchers are already in the archives and that the services were rendered during a continuous period, it is not possible at this stage to say what amount was paid for the part of the year 1961.</p>

<p>B. Department of the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last night I was saying that this Bill is the first step in this Government&#x2019;s policy of leading the Bantu peoples of South West Africa to independence. I want to ask when will the next step be taken. I want to pose this question directly to the hon. the Prime Minister and to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development: how many tribes in South West Africa do they consider ready for independence now? They do not want to answer, so can I pose the question to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education? Does he consider there are any tribes in South West Africa which are ready for independence to-day?</p>

<p>Yes. The point is: Was this statement made for outside consumption only? Has he now been pulled to order and into line to follow the official party policy? The point now arises of what he said to those chiefs in Ovamboland. Did he promise them independence and if so, when? When has he promised them that they will get their independence? I want to say that after what I saw in South West Africa this is the most irresponsible statement that I have ever heard come from a Member of Parliament, let alone from a Deputy Minister. It is completely in line with the statement made by the hon. member for Brakpan when he said to me yesterday in this House: You have seen the fruits of 20 years of Nationalist Government. I have seen them, but they are nothing to be proud of. In fact, they are something of which to be ashamed when one thinks of the lack of development in that area. We saw there the utter failure of the Nationalist Party policy over the past 20 years. They have talked of the millions of rands that have been spent on development. On what development have those millions of rands been spent? They have been spent on schools, roads, hospitals, administrative buildings, a palace for the Commissioner-General and other such undertakings. That hon. member also saw them. I cannot agree with the hon. member for Houghton who said yesterday that there had been a degree of economic development there. In fact, I also cannot agree with the hon. member for Primrose. I want to say that the economic development in that area is virtually non-existent. It is borne out by the South West Africa survey of 1967. What economic development has there been? There is one furniture factory in the whole of the northern areas, at Oshikati. There is this one furniture factory in the while of the northern territories and not only in Ovamboland. We also saw where they are now attempting to establish, and I hope it is operating to-day, a plant where they are going to train Bantu mechanics.</p>

<p>What do we find in regard to economic development apart from industrial development. Once again according to the South West African survey we find that in the whole of the northern territories&#x2014;and I want to remind this House that there are over 500,000 Bantu in that area&#x2014;there are 254 general dealers, 26 restaurant/tobacco licences, 21 hawkers and 12 bakers. This is the sum total of economic development in that area and this hon. Deputy Minister with the Government behind him wants to give them independence now&#x2014; to-day! This Bill is the first step. It does not allow for independence but the preamble states that this Bill is to lead to eventual independence. The hon. the Deputy Minister has said <span class="col_5259-5260" refersTo="#page_1263"/>that they are ready now for independence. As I have indicated there is no economic development there at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. G. J. KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, my time is limited. I am sorry that the hon. the Prime Minister has left, because I want to remind him and the House of the warning which was given to him by my hon. Leader in this House on the 23rd April, when he told him to be careful of allowing political development to outstrip economic development. That is exactly what this Government is doing in South West Africa to-day. Let me say that this has been the problem of Central Africa. It is also the problem which is facing the United States of America to-day. Where you have people who are developing faster, politically, than they have developed economically, you have trouble. Where you have a balance of economic and political development, there you have peace and tranquility. But if either outstrips the other, you have trouble immediately. That is exactly what this Government is going to do now with their promise of independence to the northern territories, in the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister, &#x201C;to give the Ovambos independence now&#x201D;. He has said that they are ready now for independence. If they are ready now, as I said yesterday, the timetable is out of the hands of the Government. When are they going to get their independence? They will get it when they want it, because this Bill gives them the right to determine themselves when they want their independence, and to take it.</p>

<p>There is another point. As I said millions of rands have been spent on schools and hospitals. It is a magnificent development. And make no mistake, I am not belittling that development. But without an economy, how will any independent state ever run those undertakings. How will they ever keep the hospitals, schools and roads running, let alone develop any new ones. Let me say that those that are there now are very nice, but they are hopelessly inadequate. There must be further development. But with no economy in a country, how do they develop and run these things?</p>

<p>As far as I can see, we are going to put ourselves in the position that Britain has found herself in in Central Africa, where it is being held to ransom by black states. We are going to be in the same boat when these independent Bantu areas up there are going to say to us: We want more money. The position can arise where they will sell their allegiance to the highest bidder. I want to know how far will the Republic of South Africa come in competition against Russia and Red China if they do decide to sell to the highest bidder?</p>

<p>There is another aspect. Who is going to run these institutions? Who is going to run the hospitals and the schools? The hospitals at the moment are run wholly by Whites. As far as higher education is concerned, there are only Whites that are teachers. According to the South West Africa Survey once again, what facilities do we find for education of these people in the northern territories? Now I want to remind you once again that is for over 500,000 people. There are 179 Government and community schools and 49 mission schools. How many matriculants are there in those areas? I wonder if the hon. the Minister knows. How many university graduates are there? I would be surprised to find one university graduate. And yet they want to give them independence. The Deputy Minister says they are ready for independence now.</p>

<p>With regard to education, I once again refer to the South West Africa Survey report. We find that in the whole of South West Africa for a Bantu population of over 600,000 there are only three teachers training institutions with 255 students. There are only six secondary schools with 800 students and one vocational technical school with 53 boys. The teachers that we met have attained Std. VI plus a diploma, for which they worked two or three years. It goes further. Those teachers told us that it takes the average Ovanbo 14 years to attain Std. VI. It is not that he attains Std. VI at the age of 14 years, but it takes him 14 years to attain that standard.</p>

<p>Let me say that independent Bantustans is the most harebrained, impractical scheme ever dreamed up by this Government for the solution of our problems in South Africa. But when that scheme is applied to South West Africa, it becomes utterly ridiculous. Sir, we have at present in South West Africa and in the northern territories a cordon sanitaire on our northern borders. But I want to warn this hon. Minister: If this harebrained scheme is carried out, it will not be very long before this goes to its logical conclusion, and we will find that we will have a cordon most unsanitaire.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very clear to me that the hon. member who has <span class="col_5261-5262" refersTo="#page_1264"/>just resumed his seat has not only just seen South West Africa for the first time, but also just heard of it for the first time. Because we who know what is going on in those areas to which he has now paid a brief visit of two or three days, will most certainly not pay any attention to such utter nonsense as he concerned himself with here. If that hon. member knew what we had built up for those people through the years, he would most certainly not have taken up the time of the House with this. We in South West Africa are grateful for the Odendaal Report and awaited it with great expectation to see what recommendations it would make for the areas which we have inhabited for the past number of decades. We are very grateful for the comprehensive and interesting report which was issued with the long-term planning which it submitted to the Government for South Africa and its inhabitants. <i>Inter alia</i>, it also dealt with the non-Whites in South West Africa. I want to say at the outset that we are grateful that the Government of South Africa accepted it and that the policy which we have been pursuing for years will now be applied by the Government in that territory as well. We believe that it is the only policy which can be carried out successfully in South Africa. The hon. member quoted from a very dangerous newspaper &#x2014;we are acquainted with it. If I were in his shoes, I would not quote that newspaper so freely before making sure of my facts. In 1966 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition opened the congress of the Opposition Party in South West Africa, namely the United National South West Party. On that occasion he said, <i>inter alia</i>, that the solution for South West Africa was the federal policy of the United Party in South Africa. This is also the policy of the United National South West Party. In an election manifesto of 1966 they said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Verwoerd Party has the temerity to accuse the United Party in the Republic and the United National South West Party here that we do not have a non-white policy.</block>

<p>They mentioned the five points of their non-white policy and I should like to quote the last point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To grant the non-white inhabitants of our country four nominated white representatives in the Legislative Assembly.</block>

<p>In other words, the policies of the two parties are more or less in agreement. One can therefore link the two. The policies of these two parties have been put to the test since the 1948 election. The National Party has always come out on top. The verdict of the electorate was such that the National Party has all the representatives here, and it was put to the electorate in no uncertain manner that we would continue to develop the apartheid policy of the National Party in South West Africa as well. We shall also help to lead the Bantu home lands to independent development when the time is ripe for it, as the Odendaal Report recommended. Accordingly we are grateful for the legislation which is now before the House. There are various reasons why one is grateful for it. We are grateful that the non-white issue will be removed from our white politics by this legislation. Just as Coloured politics in South Africa is dragged into white politics all the time, so non-white politics is also dragged in and promises are made to them which only create confusion. Not only do they create confusion in South West Africa, but they also create confusion and erroneous ideas in South Africa and outside South Africa. For this reason we are glad to be able to tell those people what their future will be. From the experience which we have built up over a period of 300 years, we know what will be best for them in the long run. We believe that the policy which we are applying is the only one which will succeed in a multi-racial country such as South Africa. The position is that those people&#x2014;and the Whites&#x2014;have been consulted in this connection and know what our policy is. They realize that the policy of the National Party is the only one which can succeed. The non-Whites in South Africa must also obtain their rights. The only way in which they can obtain their rights is in their own areas. They must not be given rights in the Assembly in South West Africa or in the Central Government here, as is incorporated in the federal policy of the Opposition. They realize that the course which has been followed in the rest of Africa, will also be followed in their case. Whether the United Party now says that it will not happen, or that they will not allow it, we Shall not be able to accept it under any circumstances, because we believe that they will never be able to withstand the pressure. We believe that the world will not be satisfied with a few representatives for those people in the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa. South West Africa has a population of approximately 600,000. If one subtracts the Whites, who number approximately 90,000, from this total, one finds that there are approximately 510,000 non-Whites. To give these people only four representatives in the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa, will be to throw the fat in the fire as far as the world is concerned, instead of achieving something with it. Neither will it assist those people in any way. The same will happen as happened here throughout the years in the case of the Coloureds. They will be used as voting cattle and this will cause race relationships to deteriorate instead of improving them. The Nationalists in South West Africa, who form the largest part of the white population there, therefore believe that this is the only way to lead these people, as this legislation prescribes, to eventual independence when they are ready for it.</p>

<p>As far as the Opposition is concerned, I have already mentioned what the attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was at the time of that United Party congress. We <span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="#page_1265"/>also heard what he said here the other day. We also saw what the official policy of these people was there, namely to give representatives to the non-Whites there. We believe this is something which can never work. We also believe that the Whites in South West Africa will never allow it. We have tested them time and again and they will never allow it.</p>

<p>We now come to another point and this concerns the attitude of the non-Whites in South West Africa. They have seen that this Government is well-intentioned as far as they are concerned and that the Government has not adopted the attitude of trading with their interests. They realize that this Government is prepared to help them in the future. This method is proving itself to an increasing extent and gaining an increasing foothold in the world, which is proof that it is the only method which is right. Even in America, the model state, where the Negroes have all the rights that the Whites have, they are also asking for separate development now. The non-White peoples in South Africa are beginning to realize more clearly every day that their future, welfare and prosperity depend on the actions of the National Party. They realize that these things do not depend on these stories which the United Party hawks about day after day, i.e. to keep them where they are and to have them remain mixed, which will eventually lead to racial friction such as exists in the rest of Africa. We believe that they will never be able to withstand the pressure if this should happen one day. They say that they will not allow it; they will give them a certain number of representatives. The United Party leader in South West Africa has already admitted that they would not be able to withstand the pressure. Advocate Niehaus said on 22nd October, 1963 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">World opinion cannot be resisted and the sooner we get into step with world opinion, the sooner there will be hope for us. If we &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the United National South West Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; move with world opinion, the speaker sees a safe road through for us.</block>

<p>He said this as far back as 1963, according to his own newspaper, of which he is the chairman, namely the <i>Suidwes-Afrikaner</i>. A few days later, on 12th November, 1963, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing that we may do will prevent the advent of a multi-racial government, and the sooner we have a responsible multi-racial government, the better for the race relationships in Southern Africa.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the Government is adopting this attitude, because the Whites in South West Africa and in South Africa are not prepared to entrust the future of the non-Whites to the people who have already made these admissions, so that they may make tests of this kind, because they will simply not be able to withstand the pressure. Last Saturday the former organizing secretary of the United National South West Party tried to suggest at a meeting at Stamprietfontein that nothing was being done for the Whites, but that everything was being done for the non-Whites. On 17th May, 1962, when the Carpio Commission was in South West Africa, the Leader of the United National South West Party, Advocate Niehaus, and the same person who came to ask us questions at the meeting at Stamprietfontein the other night, namely Mr. Van der Berg, and another person, went to give evidence before the Carpio Commission on behalf of the United National South West Party. I quote from the official report of the Carpio Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">UNSWP (United National South West Party) representatives had been called traitors and other names but were beginning to achieve results. Due to pressure by the United Nations from outside and the UNSWP within, the Government was for the first time beginning to promote Native development.</block>

<p>That is what he went and did; he went and sought help from our enemies and said to them: &#x201C;Help us; exert pressure from outside and we will exert pressure from inside to achieve our aim&#x201D;. This is what they are doing in order to come into power again; they are making common cause with the enemies of South Africa, because the Carpio Commission was nothing but hostile towards South Africa; you know the whole history, Sir. Mr. Niehaus went as far as making a charge that the police did not understand the people. I quote from paragraph 205&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was also an influx of South African police who did not understand the people and that caused trouble.</block>

<p>He went to our enemies and indicted our police force. They supposedly do not understand the people there and that supposedly caused trouble. Those are the people who are suggesting an alternative policy and then they do this sort of thing. He also said to the Carpio Commission that they represent about 50 to 60 per cent of the electorate, because the rest were officials and Railway officials who were transferred there by the Government to vote for the National Party. That is what he said according to the report.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a very interesting remark here yesterday at the beginning of his speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>Have you lost your place?</p>

<speech by="#roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. C. ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>No, I have not lost my place, but hon. members opposite are all going to lose their places here. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said yesterday that the Government ought to outwit its enemies. That was the statement which he made here yesterday&#x2014;a very fine statement. I sat and listened to the hon. member. I know him very well, and I thought that he would go further and eventually come round to the enemy itself, but he left that statement in the air. He only said that the Government ought to outwit its enemies. One asks oneself: Who are in fact the enemies of the country, not the enemies of the Government, but the enemies of the country? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in the debate here yesterday that the Natives had refused to move from the old location in Windhoek to the new one and that many houses in the new location were standing empty. Why has this happened? There are people in South-West Africa who make common cause with the non-Whites, and especially with the Herero nation; who encourage and urge them not to move to the new location. Mr. Sieberhagen, who was my opponent in 1966, said from the platform that if he had lived in the old location, he would also have refused to move. He made a public statement in this connection. There are lawyers in Windhoek who advise those people free of charge. If you go along to the offices of certain advocates, there are strings of Herero sitting outside their offices to obtain free advice as to how they can thwart the authorities. I should like to know whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also regards these people as enemies of South Africa&#x2014;not enemies of the Government, but enemies of the country. What was the attitude which the white Opposition in South West Africa adopted all along when South Africa fought for South West Africa before the World Court? South Africa was actually fighting with its back to the wall, and what was the attitude adopted by the United National South West Party? What was their reaction when strangers, foreigners, Americans, went to submit evidence on South Africa&#x2019;s behalf before the World Court? I shall not tire you with a long series of quotations, but J want to point out that when Professor Logan went to give evidence for South Africa, that same Suidwes-Afrikaner, from which the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) quoted, wrote in a leading article on 9th July, 1965 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want to record here in the plainest language that the statement made by Professor Logan before the World Court is the greatest nonsense imaginable and that he does not know what he is talking about.</block>

<p>Sir, that is the sympathy which we received from the white Opposition Press in South West Africa when a lot of false charges were made against us, charges which were eventually all withdrawn. Not once did they stand by our advocates before the World Court. When our advocates had Advocate Gross cornered, these people were completely silent, but they continually went out of their way to aid our enemies inside and outside South Africa in this way. One can make a string of quotations in this regard. I wonder how one should fight these people, these enemies of South Africa who are with one every day. They are sitting around us; they are with us, and these are the deadly, dangerous methods which they employ. If one presents a plan to the Government to outwit its enemies, one would like to know what plan one could devise to deal with them, because there are many people of this kind in South Africa. If problems were to arise here and you look at the actions of the Opposition in South Africa and in South West Africa over the past years, they actually put you in mind of an elephant with tooth-ache. It becomes so frustrated that it will do anything, but the tooth-ache remains. It knocks down trees and houses and fences, and that is what they will try to do. They will try to do anything to the country and the people if they can only gain some small political advantage from it. Therefore I say that in South Africa and in South West Africa we will never make the mistake of placing non-white affairs or matters affecting the interests of Whites in their hands, for them to make a political football of them as they have done in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mariental, who has just sat down, made a whole series of attacks on the Opposition as well as on the Opposition in South West Africa, attacks which naturally are unfounded. He made every possible attempt to suggest that this Opposition and our associated party group in South West Africa were lacking in love for our country and patriotism; that we can only treat with the contempt it deserves. While I was listening to the hon. member for Mariental, I thought I was back on the Press gallery in the days of 1938 and that I was again listening to the then National Party attacking General Smuts for having sent 300 South African Police to South West Africa to combat the undermining activities of the enemies of South Africa. In my mind I was carried back to those days, but I do not want to remain there. I do not want to conduct this debate on that level, because I think we all realize that we are dealing here with an extremely serious matter which can affect the whole of Southern Africa if it is not handled <span class="col_5267-5268" refersTo="#page_1267"/>correctly. I want to say at once that I accept, as all of us on this side of the House do, that to a large extent this Bill constitutes an attempt on the part of the Government to create an image of its administration in South West Africa which would be to the benefit of Southern Africa as a whole and which would present us in the right perspective to the eyes of the world. Because this is so, because we do not doubt that this is the Government&#x2019;s sincere endeavour, we have been trying all along to conduct this debate on a higher level than the unfortunate level to which it was lowered by the hon. member who has just sat down as well as by the hon. member for Primrose. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We cannot support this Bill, even though we accept that is the Government&#x2019;s <i>bona fide</i> attempt to create a better image of South Africa. We cannot accept it, because we honestly see it as an act of despair, as something which has not been fully considered, as an attempt to create an image by means of shadows, an image which cannot deceive anyone if he really goes into matters. The fact that we are dealing here with shadows became very apparent from several speeches. I do not want to refer again to what was said by the hon. member for Mariental. We forgive him for that because he is still young, but I want to refer to a speech by someone of whom one expected more, my hon. good friend the member for Middelland, who made certain surprising statements, and the hon. member for Primrose. I am sorry that he is not present, because I want to refer to him once again.</p>

<p>The hon. member is so ashamed about the speech he made yesterday that he does not even want to sit in the seat from which he delivered that speech. But those were very enlightening speeches.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No one can mislead me, but that hon. member has been trying for years. The present Minister of Foreign Affairs, in presenting South Africa&#x2019;s case at the U.N., states explicitly each time that the South African Government accepts the fact that South West Africa has an international status, and he has gone as far as to give the U.N. an assurance that measures such as the one we are discussing at the moment would be introduced into our Parliament without detracting from the international status of South West Africa. I cannot understand how informed members such as the hon. member for Middelland and now even the hon. the Minister can deny that. Here I have an official report of the speech delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 12th October, 1966, only the other day, to the 21st General Assembly of the United Nations. For the sake of clarity I just want to quote from pages 14, 15 and 16, because we cannot come to terms or conduct a fruitful debate if we differ about facts in regard to which there ought to be no disagreement. About ascertainable facts there ought to be no disagreement, and here we now have a statement of those facts. At the U.N. the hon. the Minister gave an historical review and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The latter part of the arrangement, coupled with the fact that South West Africa and South Africa are geographical neighbours, has led to close political integration in the spheres of public administration, economic affairs, transport, etc., without the separate international status of the Territory being impaired.</block>

<p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs calls it &#x201C;the separate international status&#x201D;. Nothing can be clearer. On page 15 of the speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I further wish to confirm the statement made to this Assembly on 5th October by the South African representative to the effect that there is nothing in the proposals of the Odendaal Commission or in my Government&#x2019;s policy concerning the separate and parallel development of the various ethnic groups which in any way amounts to incorporation of the Territory or to interference with its separate international identity.</block>

<p>Now it is even stronger than a status. Now it is a separate international identity, an international existence which is assigned to South West Africa. On the next page they refer to the possibility of the legislation we are discussing at the moment. There we see what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs very <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="#page_1268"/>clearly told the outside world at the U.N., although hon. members opposite want to tell this country a different story. He referred to this measure now before us and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those decisions will be taken and announced in due course with recognition of the principle that the Territory can for that particular purpose, and that purpose alone, best be treated as an integral part of South Africa without thereby affecting its separate international status.</block>

<p>I am not at all concerned with the hon. member for Houghton.

The hon. member for Middelland reacted to a speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, not to a speech of the hon. member for Houghton, who stated that particular case. The hon. the Minister reacted to something said by me, not by the hon. member for Houghton. But I am pleased that we can now agree that we concede and that the Government accepts that South West Africa does in fact have an international status and that that complicates matters as regards our actions as South Africans in our endeavours to find a solution to the international problem of South West Africa as well as to the internal race problems of South West Africa. This is the point I want to make. I think the hon. member for Middelland would concede that. This makes the problem extremely difficult, and we on this side have real sympathy with the problems of the Government. The Government must find it especially difficult to solve these problems, because they have never been in favour of South West Africa becoming part of South Africa in any sense of the word. In 1914 they even went as far as to make an armed protest against the occupation of South West Africa by the troops of General Botha.</p>

The solution they see is the implementation, under all possible circumstances, in spite of all improbabilities and impossibilities, of the policy of separate development, as stated and developed by Dr. Verwoerd. This is not the policy of apartheid on which the Government was elected in 1948. This is not the policy of apartheid on which the Government won the elections in 1953 and 1958. This is the Bantustan concept announced by Dr. Verwoerd after he had become Prime Minister of South Africa. They see the implementation of this policy of the development of separate states, independent, sovereign, political entities for the various ethnic groups in South Africa, as the answer to world pressure brought to bear on South Africa. They say the only answer to that is that South Africa, and now South West Africa as well, has to be fragmented in order to create homelands for the ethnic groups. They also say the homelands should be allowed, even assisted, to develop to sovereign independence. As we on this side of the House have often said, if one regards this policy of the National Party as a theory only, it is morally unassailable, but if one tries to implement it in practice, one sees its impossibilities and its ridiculous points and it becomes improbable. But our main objection to this policy, and consequently also our objection to this Bill, is what Government members themselves admit in their moments of clear insight, namely that this policy is one which is foreign to the thinking of South Africans. Sir, this is a policy which they themselves do not want; this is a policy which they accept simply in an attempt to satisfy the outside world. This is not homemade bread for South Africa. [Interjections.] What I am saying now, was very clearly put by the greatest authority on this policy who ever lived. Indeed, he was the creator of this policy, the father of this policy, namely Dr. Verwoerd. I think it is necessary for us to remember these things if we want to think clearly about these matters. On 10th April, 1961, in this House of Assembly Dr. Verwoerd defended this policy of separate development in the sense of Bantustans which would develop to eventual independence. He defended it and at the same time also stated it very clearly. After he had attacked and sharply criticized the federal concept of the United Party, he said the following, as recorded in Hansard, volume 107, column 4191&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As against that, even though it may lead to great difficulties, we again unequivocally state the policy of the development of the different race groups. The Bantu will be able to develop into separate Bantu states.</block>

<p>Now comes the point I want to make my friends realize&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is not what we would have liked to see. It is a form of fragmentation which we would not have liked if we were able <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="#page_1269"/>to avoid it. In the light of the pressure being exerted on South Africa, there is however, no doubt that eventually this will have to be done, thereby buying for the White man his freedom &#x2026;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am quite prepared to sit down if someone wants to put a question to me, but I think hon. members should concede in all fairness that it is impossible for me to reply to seven, eight questions at the same time, particularly by the hon. member for Primrose. If he has a question which he wants to put, I shall sit down and then he can do so, but I really think he ought to behave himself a little better now. Now problems are arising in South West Africa and still our friends opposite cannot get away from this rash and extremely dangerous concept of separate independent states as a solution. Come hell or high water, this concept must be enforced on South West Africa now, irrespective of the circumstances. In the publication South West African Survey it is also mentioned that circumstances differ in South West Africa and they try to say that the policy of separate development will be completely different in that territory; only the name is the same. But that is not substantiated by this measure now before the House. What is now being enforced on South West Africa still is the concept of separate states which will become sovereign. The hon. member for Primrose strongly emphasized his statement, and by doing so he tried to bring discredit on this side, that no provision was made in this Bill for the eventual independence of these groups in these homelands. That is so. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition emphasized this phenomenon as he wanted there to be no misunderstanding in this regard. In this measure no provision is made for the eventual sovereign independence of these areas. It is very clear that before the Government will be able to grant sovereign independence to any of these areas, they will have to come back to Parliament. Has the hon. member for Primrose given proper attention to the aims and objects of this Bill?</p>

<p>But we have never denied that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Now he is admitting it. Yet he attacked my hon. Leader and tried to throw suspicion on him when my Leader said that this measure did not provide in so many words that the countries could become sovereign independent countries in terms of the powers given to the State President in this legislation. But he admits that the ultimate aim is in fact independence and that this Bill is a means to that end. He has no alternative because if he denies that, he denies all the nice, grand words printed for overseas consumption in South West African Survey. Then he also denies the report of the Odendaal Commission and he repudiates the White Papers we have received in this Parliament as well as the preamble of this Bill. I think it is necessary for us to read the preamble of the Bill again. A preamble in a Bill is what the Government employs to give an explanation of what it is seeking to do as well as to mention the policy of which the Bill is to form part and towards the implementation of which the Bill is a means. This is the preamble&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is desirable that the native nations in the territory of South West Africa should in the realization of their right of self-determination develop in an orderly manner to self-governing nations and independence:</block>

<p>Then the Bill itself follows. I simply cannot understand why members opposite suggest that the object of this Bill is not to take these states to independence.</p>

<p>Of course not. I assume that it will not happen immediately, but it still remains the object and the aim of this Bill. As hon. members opposite always tell us in their philosophical moments, and in this respect they agree with authoritative British colonial administrators of the period <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="#page_1270"/>after the Second World War: When the time comes when these nations, after they have developed in this way, say that they want to become independent, it will be too late for the Government or the Republic of South Africa to say that the time is not yet ripe. They will fix the time-table.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. G. J. KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to put a question to the hon. member. If he agrees with all the things he has just said, why was it necessary for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and certain other members to have drawn attention to all these points, for example the dangers, etc., of this measure? That is the very point we have been making throughout this debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member on his brilliant question. The hon. member has just agreed with me that this Bill is a means to an end. It is a means to an aspiration and the aspiration is independence. But when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition points out the consequences of that independence he is attacked, as the hon. member has just tried to do once again. How can one conduct a debate with such an hon. member? How can one conduct a constructive debate with such an hon. member who one moment admits that this Bill is intended to lead those people to independence and the next moment criticizes the Leader of the Opposition for pointing out the dangers of that independence? Surely we cannot conduct matters in that way in the Parliament of South Africa. The hon. members must decide where they stand. See how the hon. the Deputy Minister runs away from the question of the independence of the Bantustans. He becomes so angry that he even tries to say unparliamentary things. Why does one have to be afraid of one&#x2019;s own policy? Why does one have to run away from one&#x2019;s own policy if one has confidence in that policy? This is precisely what is happening in respect of the argument of the hon. member for Primrose which he has just repeated. Anyone who heeds the preamble of the Bill cannot deny that the Bill is in fact a means to independence. That point has now been established and we can have no further arguments about it, because even the hon. member for Primrose, who based his entire speech on an evasion of that fact, now concedes that point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#koornhof">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. G. J. KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not doing so at all. I still say the Leader of the Opposition made an irresponsible speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>One of the consequences of this unfortunate phenomenon, namely that we are dealing with a policy which is not homemade bread but a policy which has been created for the sake of the outside world, is that when anyone makes a critical analysis of this policy with a view to ascertaining its consequences and its meaning for South Africa and South Africans&#x2014;seeing that the policy is intended for overseas consumption&#x2014;he is accused of being unpatriotic and of attacking South Africa. This is virtually unavoidable when a government in its despair and clumsiness and helplessness creates a policy, not with a view to serving the interests of South Africa, but with a view to pacifying the outside world; then it lands itself in the position that any criticism of that policy must be regarded as an attack on South Africa in the face of the outside world. The consequences of such an attitude are serious. Then one finds a phenomenon such as the hon. the Minister of Planning and his kindred spirit, the hon. member for Primrose, beginning to think that Oppositions should not exist.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Circumstances in the outside world are one of the factors one has to take into account, but it cannot be the only or the decisive factor. The consideration cannot be what was stated by the late Dr. Verwoerd when he announced this policy of separate states, namely that the matter which made one decide, although one realized that <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="#page_1271"/>it was not desirable, was circumstances in the outside world. One cannot adopt that attitude. There are other factors too which one has to take into account. There are other factors which this Opposition does take into account. The most important of these is: What will be in the real interests of South Africa, what will be in the real interests of South West Africa as well? We have a duty to South Africa and to South West Africa always to do those things&#x2014;even if we have to run risks as far as the outside world is concerned&#x2014;which are right and most beneficial to the inhabitants of South West Africa and of South Africa. This is our answer to those fine-sounding words such as the right of self-determination, etc., which we have heard in this debate. It is a very fine concept and one for which we have to thank President Wilson of the U.S.A. for formulating in the work he did in connection with the peace settlement in Versailles. It is a very important concept and for me it is very interesting that Government members now are enthusiastic disciples of the late President Wilson. But while we concede that it is a very important right and perhaps a natural right of groups of people to work out their own destinies, there are other factors which have to be considered as well. The most important of these is that the right of the smaller unit can be seen and exercised only in the light of and with due regard being had to the rights of the larger unit. History abounds with precedents of minority groups claiming the right of self-determination which they were refused, even by force of arms, as that assumption of a right of self-determination by a minority group was contrary to the interests of the majority group of which that minority group formed an element.</p>

<p>The first example of this which springs to mind&#x2014;because this right of self-determination was the creation of an American President, President Wilson&#x2014;is the fate of the southern states of America 108 years ago. The southern states of America endeavoured, under certain circumstances which were very important to them irrespective of the merits of the matter, to exercise their right of self-determination. They wanted to break away from the U.S.A. and form their own confederation of American states. The result was what probably was the most bloody civil war in the history of mankind. It was a civil war which lasted for four years, and in the end the southern states of America were denied their right of self-determination. To-day they still form part of the U.S.A. because the exercising of that right of self-determination would have been contrary to the interest of the whole of the U.S.A. and it could not be granted. Mr. Speaker, there are other examples. Here in our country the Eastern Cape wanted to secede a century ago because of dissatisfaction in regard to race problems. That they were refused by the then authorities. I do not want to evade the question of the hon. member for Graaff Reinet. I think he was the one who asked me whether they were of the same race. Apparently his argument now is that if they are of different races, they should have the right of self-determination even if their secession would be contrary to the interests of the larger whole. Is that his argument?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I do not know what his argument is, but apparently the hon. member for Graaff Reinet is of the opinion that other considerations apply when one is dealing with different races than when one is dealing with a homogeneous nation.</p>

<p>But let me remind him of the history of that part of the country which he represents. Does he know that just over 100 years ago an attempt was made by the British liberals, particularly by Lord Glenelg, to make the Transkei, known as Kaffraria at that time, a separate state and to grant it the right of self-determination, in order to implement in the Cape Province what to-day is the apartheid policy of the present Nationalist Party Government. It was only after seven Kaffir wars, as they were called at that time, and after the appointment of an enlightened governor, Sir George Grey, who put an end to this Bantustan policy of the British liberalists, and who incorporated Kaffraria into the Cape Province, contrary to the right of self-determination, that we obtained peace in the Cape Province. I am very grateful to the hon. member for Graaff Reinet for his intelligent and helpful interjection. Now I have to put this pertinent question to the Government: Suppose there are further developments in the Free State such as that we are witnessing in the Municipality of Bloemfontein and that with the Administrator of the Free State, and the Free State wants to claim its right of self-determination to-morrow &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>At a later stage I shall reply in more detail. [Interjections.] I shall reply immediately in general terms. The test is not whether it is homogeneous or heterogeneous; the test is what serves the interests of the whole to the greatest extent. That is my reply. South Africa as a whole is a unitary state. The test is: will any secession by minorities be in the interests of South Africa? That is the test. I think we have clearly indicated in this debate that these attempts are being made to create artificial states when no wish for apartheid exists. The hon. member for Primrose knows that one of the tests of nationhood is the will to be a separate nation. Where is there any will to be a separate nation amongst the peoples of South West Africa, except perhaps amongst the Hereros? What nation in South West Africa has expressed a desire to this Government that it should create a separate state and grant them independence? I shall tell you. There was only one fair test, and that was in 1946, when General Smuts held the nearest thing to a referendum amongst the peoples of South West Africa and all of them expressed the desire to remain with South West Africa and the Republic of South Africa. Since these hon. members have come into power, they have deliberately undermined the loyalty of those nations to South Africa by means of propaganda and they have put the idea of apartheid into their heads. Their intelligent desire was to seek their good along with South Africa and South West Africa By means of propaganda they artificially induced them to adopt another attitude contrary to the interests of South Africa. And this Minister is to blame more than anyone else.</p>

<p>There cannot be an inherent right in the Government&#x2019;s point of view irrespective of the rash interjection of the hon. member for Heilbron. If there were an inherent right, the Government would be at pains to grant also the Indians and the Coloureds the right of self-determination. Can this therefore mean that this is escapism? This is a suspicion one must have. Is it an attempt to evade responsibilities by telling small nations who cannot possibly exist separately or cannot have any hope of doing so, &#x201C;Whether or not you can, you must, because we want to be rid of you&#x201D;. Is that the motive? Personally I do not think so, but this is the only possible motive of which one can think. Or is the motive that suggested by the hon. member for Middelland, namely that they allegedly want to determine the boundaries between nation and nation? And when boundaries have been established between population groups and ethnic groups, then there will be peace. That was his attitude, not so? Is that the motive? But boundaries between nation and nation can only preserve the peace if those boundaries are accepted and observed by the nations. To what extent have these particular nations in South West Africa been consulted, especially the large majorities who do not live in homelands, as to whether they want to accept the boundaries which the Government is determining by means of this Bill? As soon as one nation does not want to observe and respect the boundaries which another nation regards as existing between the two of them, there is trouble. The hon. member for Middelland knows about this; he mentioned it in his speech. In 1829-&#x2019;30 the Hereros came from the north and trespassed on the territorial area of the Namas. They trespassed over the boundaries which existed. The hon. member knows as well as I do that all primitive tribes in the world create their own boundaries for themselves. If another tribe does not want to observe and respect those boundaries, there are clashes. What happened was that the Hereros came from the north and trespassed on the territory which the Namas regarded as their own. The result was a bitter war. The result was the decimation of both the Namas and the Hereros. Do we want that state of affairs again? I think the Government should be warned. If they believe that the fragmentation of South Africa or South West Africa is going to bring peace, they are living under the greatest delusion under which a government can <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="#page_1273"/>labour. They are living under a delusion which has been proved to be a delusion by the experience of the whole of Africa. I can make one quotation after another.</p>

<p>Yes, look at her now, because the Government&#x2019;s policy has been applied to Nigeria. Nigeria was given her freedom before she was ripe for freedom.

We know what has happened there, and that is the state of affairs which now has to be created also in South West Africa and South Africa. What we are concerned with in South West Africa are not nations, but tribes. How do tribes react to freedom? Let us once again take Nigeria. The leader of the Ibos, one of the most advanced tribes in Africa, Azikiwe, made the following statement when he founded his party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a record to show that the martial prowess of the Ibo nation at all stages of human history has enabled them not only to conquer the others, but also to adapt themselves to the role of preserver of all that is best and noble in African culture and tradition. Placed in this high estate by the God of Africa, the Ibo nation cannot shirk its responsibility towards it manifest destiny.</block>

<p>The immediate result was that the leader of the rival tribe, the Yorubas, who dominated the Ibos, also made a statement. The leader of the Yorubas, Obafemi Awolowo, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact can be taken as admitted, or cannot honestly be disputed, that in Nigeria Yorubas are the pioneers and the masters in every field of human endeavour.</block>

<p>This is the kind of situation which will be created in South West Africa and for South Africa by this Government. Where will it end? The danger of these small independent nations, as they are called, being arrogant and not preserving the peace, is heightened by the most important fact we must know in considering race relations in South Africa or in the world, and that is that the struggle in South Africa or in the world between one race and another is not primarily a struggle between race and race. It is primarily a struggle between those who have and those who do not have; between those who possess and those who do not possess; between the rich and the poor; between those who are satisfied and those who desire. To-day one-fifth of the world&#x2019;s population possesses six-sevenths of the world&#x2019;s riches, and that one-fifth of the world&#x2019;s population is the white nations, and to-day they are surrounded by envy, and this clouds relations throughout the world. Here in South Africa we have the same micocosmic situation. Here in South Africa approximately one-fifth of the population possesses the vast majority of our riches, six-sevenths of our wealth. This one-fifth is the Whites and the non-Whites desire to become our equals as soon as possible. Unless we face up to this fact, namely that our race relations are clouded by the distribution of wealth in our country, we shall have ill-considered Bills like this one. The disaster facing South Africa as a result of the policy of the Government, is that we want the political development of these nations, as they are called, to be far in advance of their economic development. We want to give them political rights, political powers; we want to give them the ability to enter into alliances with people who want to exploit their economic situation, against South Africa, because they are, from the nature of the case, dissatisfied with their poverty, and because they are envious of the wealth of the Whites; and this Government is shortsighted and rash enough to place this powerful political weapon of independence in the hands of people who do not have, who do not possess, who desire, who are envious. If the Government wanted to act wisely, and wanted to act like a responsible Government, it would pay more attention to the economic upliftment of these people and at first keep their political development in abeyance. I should like to remind the Government and particularly the hon. the Minister of the famous words of Lord Hailey in his Africa Survey, probably one of the most efficient administrators of colonial Africa who ever lived, when he wrote in his book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let the metropolitan powers beware that when the day comes that the peoples of Africa ask for bread, they do not try to fob them off with the vote.</block>

<p><span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="#page_1274"/>Sir, there are other more urgent and greater problems facing the Native nations of South West Africa and of South Africa; and the Government is trying to push them away with political institutions which are mere shadows. What can we expect if this policy is proceeded with? We would have to expect struggles and confusion to arise the more independent these unripe nations become&#x2014;unripe particularly in the economic sphere. We would have to expect that these dissatisfied sovereign independent small states would seek interference from outside. We would have to expect that we would be isolated and separated from our allies to the north, and in all the arguments advanced by the other side of this House, there has been no reply to the argument of my Leader and of the hon. member for South Coast that this policy, especially as regards Ovamboland, is going to isolate us from the Portuguese in Angola and will cut us off from potential oil supplies for South Africa and will separate us from our allies against possible terrorism which is also aimed against the heart of South Africa.</p>

<p>There has been no reply to these arguments. If ever before the Government had failed to make out a case in defence of an ill-considered, rash measure, then that is the case with this Bill, which according to the Government is intended to lead the Native nations of South West Africa to independence. I must repeat what was said by so many members on this side of the House: We can only hope that the Government will reconsider this matter before finally committing us to an irrevocable line of action in these matters, and will withdraw this Bill or else, if it has to pass this Bill, will never implement it.</p>

<p>I shall now furnish a specific reply to a few of the points raised by the last speaker on the opposite side; I shall reply to the others when I reply one by one to speakers on the other side, because even the last speaker on the Opposition side could not succeed in raising any brand new arguments. More than half his arguments were raised by previous speakers on that side, who did so better than he could, and I shall in fact reply with reference to them; but I should now like to reply to a few points raised by the hon. member.</p>

<p>In the first place I just want to say that hon. members took note of the fact that, according to the rules, the hon. member for Yeoville, had the right to speak for an unlimited period of time. As I said by way of interjection, he was at a loss for a point on several occasions.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member had an hour, which he did not use. The hon. member, contrary to what we have come to expect of him, was at a loss for points to-day, so that he in fact asked this side for interjections so that he could at least get hold of a few points. In his speech the hon. member for Yeoville ranged inordinately far afield. He came forward with the shattering truth that the policy of the United Party and our policy differed radically from each other. Sir, every school boy knows that, but the hon. member presented it to us here as one of the super points in his speech. He dragged in President Wilson; he dragged in Sir George Grey and the Kaffir wars. I found it extremely strange that he did not drag in Harold Wilson. The hon. member got up to try and bake all the heaps of crumbs which fell from the Opposition&#x2019;s table into a small loaf, and that is why he even used the word &#x201C;bread&#x201D; as an image in his speech. He was unable to achieve anything by doing so. The few points he made I can mention now&#x2014;there were three or four &#x2014;and the other points he made were also mentioned by previous speakers on that side.</p>

<p>Firstly, I just want to say a few words about the expression &#x201C;the international status of South West Africa&#x201D; which he used, and the way in which similar words were, according to him, used by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I repeat that I would prefer to use the term &#x201C;international character&#x201D; in respect of South West Africa, because the word &#x201C;status&#x201D; can so easily be misinterpreted, as the hon. member for Yeoville actually tried to do to no avail this afternoon. I repeat&#x2014; and this is also the standpoint of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is the standpoint of the Government, and f would be grateful if I could be given the assurance that it is also the standpoint of the Opposition&#x2014;that in the constitutional sense of the term South West Africa has no international status. It has none. The so-called status of South West Africa, which I would prefer to call &#x201C;character&#x201D;, is not the same as that of a country such as South Africa itself. South Africa has an international status, yes, because it enjoys international recognition as a separate international personality in the world tribune, but it is a separate international country. This South West Africa does not have, and the hon. member knows it. South West Africa has no international status in the sense that France has, in the sense that Belgium has, in the sense that Holland has, or in the sense that even countries which are independent and which are not represented at U.N. have. South West Africa does not have it in that sense, and that is why I say that we cannot speak of the international status of South West Africa, without running the risk of being misunderstood or being misrepresented, which is precisely what happened here this afternoon. South West Africa does not even have an international status in this sense that we have to account for South West Africa to others, because we deny that responsibility.</p>

<p>No, that is not so; I deny it. I deny that the Minister of Foreign Affairs used the expression &#x201C;international status&#x201D; in that sense of the word, as that hon. member is suggesting. I also deny that South West Africa has international status in the sense that it can be controlled on an international level by some body or other, which status South West Africa did in fact previously have, when, in terms of the League of Nations Mandate we were able to control it on behalf of a body, upon the instructions of that body. That is why I maintain that it is far better to speak of an international character, in this sense that it is in fact being discussed on an international level, both justly and unjustly. I shall leave that expression at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the preamble. In point of fact the hon. member is the only member who referred at any length to the preamble, although the other members on the opposite side also referred to it in passing. The hon. member should now take a proper look at the preamble, for the umpteenth time. Mr. Speaker, you must recall how the hon. member, in a farcical way, literally wanted to kick up dust here by referring to the Free State as a parallel in regard to the right of self-determination. Let us realize that this is a foolish example. What does the preamble state in regard to the right of self-determination? It refers explicitly to &#x201C;nations&#x201D;, not to communities, or districts, or provinces in the sense of these being communities of people. It is stated here explicitly&#x2014;</p>

The preamble refers explicitly to &#x201C;nations&#x201D;. Sir, must we now be treated to such nonsense here, and that, I ask you, by a man who uses more than half an hour for it? The hon. member must realize fully that this preamble&#x2014;and that is why it is in the Bill&#x2014;is there to indicate the direction which the course of developments can take in respect of that self-government of the Bantu territories in South West Africa. There are only two directions in which these things can go&#x2014;only two; there are no others.</p>

<p>Anybody who uses his sound common-sense can reason it out for you. There are only two directions. I know the Opposition wants to pretend that there is a third intermediary direction, a conglomeration of ideas, but there are only two directions, i.e. the direction of political integration, and opposed to that the direction of political separation or separate development. [Interjections.] The hon. member is now playing with words. In respect of the political development of countries which can become states, there are only two directions when one has such a mixed composition, consisting of different nations. The whole lot must either merge into one entity, with an integrationary context, or they must develop in separate context. We included this preamble very explicitly in order to make it clear to all who were interested, and last but not least the nations in South West Africa who are directly involved, that the direction of this Bill is the direction of separate development, the direction which leads to self-governing nations, and to independence.</p>

<p>There may be more than three directions, but there are only two directions which are the natural and the only practicable directions, and they are the direction of the integration of the population, or the separation of that population along the road of separate development.</p>

<p>Now let me continue. The preamble, as I said, indicates the direction. It is the direction which leads to self-governing nations and independence, as is stated there. In my speech I stated very emphatically, as has been confirmed by several other speakers and <i>inter alia</i> by the hon. member for Yeoville, that this Bill does not make provision for the last phase of full independence. Whether we will arrive at that last phase, I cannot guarantee to-day, nor can anybody else. The same applies to the Bantu nations in South West and in South Africa. I have stated repeatedly that there is no certainty as to whether or not they can enter the last phase, because it depends upon their human and national abilities as nations; we are not arguing in terms of the reasoning of other countries which granted independence to people in Africa without their being mature enough to accept it. That is why I say it is a direction. We will all have to see first whether they are going to achieve success in that direction. We must wait and see.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville became quite vehement here about the unacceptability of the establishment of small states. He said small states are dangerous things; they can be swallowed up and overshadowed, or overwhelmed by others. I found something interesting in this regard. It is the latest list of recognized countries which are members of the United Nations. If the hon. members would care to glance at it, he would see how many small countries have been established during the past few years, countries which are smaller, numerically speaking, than Ovamboland, and smaller than many of our other Bantu areas in South Africa.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. The hon. member is wrong. The most recent country to gain its independence, although it is not yet a member of the United Nations, came into existence in January this year, with a population of 5,600. It is just enough to fill a large City Hall, as one of the hon. members opposite said. But let the hon. member not try to distract me from my course now. I want to follow my own course; he has no course. I can mention to him a country such as Barbados with 246,000 people, which has been recognized by the United Nations as a member since 1966. Let me mention Lesotho and Botswana; and I will soon be able to mention Swaziland as well, which numerically speaking are smaller than most of our Bantu areas in South Africa. I want to mention the Maledive Islands, with 96,000 inhabitants, which are smaller than most of our own Bantu areas, and smaller than some of those in South West Africa, but which are independent and a member of the United Nations. Mauritius, which has a sizable population of 680,000, recently became independent.</p>

<p>No, the preamble indicates a direction, and I have already dealt with that. The Bantu nations of South West Africa have been consulted, but not all of them have as yet expressed their agreement to it. The Ovambos have said this on numberless occasions and asked for it. In my speech I quoted a letter from them and I can repeat it if the hon. member wants to hear it. The Damara did precisely the same thing. In June of last year I had a private interview with the paramount chief of the Damaras in his own office. He told me this on that occasion, and also confirmed it by letter, and there were newspaper reports about it. The people of the Okavango did the same, and a portion of the Herero tribe, although they are the minority are also prepared to accept it.</p>

<p>And I am grateful for that. I am extremely grateful because the <span class="col_5287-5288" refersTo="#page_1277"/>Leader of the Opposition is disappointed in me. It would cause me, and not only my children, but also my friends and my Party the greatest embarrassment if he were pleased with me. But I, on the other hand, am extremely pleased with him as Leader of the Opposition, because a better Leader of the Opposition, and consequently a worse leader of his Party, we cannot have. But I do want to say this much to his credit, i.e. that he, unlike his stable companion on his left, did try to discuss the Bill in restrained terms. I want to deal with quite a few of his points, and if hon. members will give me a chance to do so now, I shall get through what I want to say quickly, but if they do not give me a chance to do so it will take a long time, because I have quite a good deal to say.</p>

<p>The hon. member pointed out that, to his present way of thinking, this Bill is &#x201C;disastrous&#x201D; for South West Africa and for South Africa, because it may lead to independence. On this point the hon. member told us nothing new. All we have here is the fundamental difference which the hon. member for Yeoville also emphasized unnecessarily to-day; it is the fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government. This is what the Opposition believes in. Lump all the nations together into one governmental context. We on the other hand believe that they should be separate and that they should have their own separate distinctive context. All the hon. Leader of the Opposition did was to present us with the old story again. In addition he asked what the right to self-determination meant, what its derivation was, and what proportions a nation or a group should assume in order to lay claim to self-determination. The hon. member also had a book from which he quoted at length. I want to mention the name of an authority to him which he can study. It is the evidence submitted in the World Court case by Professor van der Haag on this very point, and the gist of that evidence from a person who is an international authority and unconnected with South Africa was that if one has a group which has centripetal force, and feels an affinity with one another, then it has the potential for becoming a nation.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition is now suggesting that the numbers of nations remains static. The hon. member for Primrose pointed out the very fact that the numerical strength of nations did not remain static. Years ago the numerical strength of the Hereros was far greater than it is today&#x2014;years ago, before all the massacres and wars. There are other nations, including those I mentioned just now, which became independent nations and which did not at the outset have the same numerical strength they have today, although that numerical strength amounted to only a few hundred thousand. They were much smaller. They began with limited numbers, and they increased. The number is not the decisive factor; it is the distinctiveness of that group which is unassimilable, incapable of integration and union with other groups. It is the only criterion for determining whether that group has the potential for becoming a nation, yes or no. If it has that possibility it has the right to develop in terms of self-determination, and that is what is being laid down in this legislation. The right to self-determination is an inborn instinct in the ethnic group, in the community.</p>

<p>They also had something to say about big and small countries. I have already mentioned a few of them in passing. There are many of them. I mentioned the Maledive Islands, which recently gained its independence and became a member of the United Nations and which at present only has 96,000 inhabitants. But did they always have 96,000 inhabitants? Did they begin with 96,000 inhabitants? And will they always remain at 96,000? I am certain that 20 years ago their numbers were much less. I am not even going to take the trouble to look it up. Any rational person can reason it out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The Hereros were originally greater in number.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they were, and their numbers can increase again. [Interjection.] There are many countries&#x2014;and I have a long list of them here&#x2014;which I can mention, and the relative size of the country is not the decisive factor in determining whether it should develop on its own along its own lines and independently as an entity. The decisive factor is the will to stand alone, the natural impulse to develop on its own along its own lines, yes or not, or the desire to be assimilated by others. That is the criterion, and the decisive factor. Time and again the Bantu nations of South West Africa have stated explicitly that they did not want to be assimilated into other nations, they did not want to be governed by others and that they did not want to govern others. Surely that is very clear. They said this to us over and over again, and I read what they had said out to you here. Therefore I do not know why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is still bothering about the criterion of what the right of a nation is to realize its own self-determination. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said that we were going to lose our friends as a result of this Bill. The question which arises is what one must consequently do to keep one&#x2019;s friends or to win more friends. It is very clear from what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intimated, and what the other speakers on the opposite side intimated more explicitly because they did not guard their tongues as carefully as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did, i.e. that in order to keep one&#x2019;s friends, or to win friends, <span class="col_5289-5290" refersTo="#page_1278"/>one must dance to the tune of one&#x2019;s friend. That is what is implied in the question of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and in his warning that we will lose our friends. It is not for outsiders to determine what we should do. We have a duty which we must fulfill in respect of these Bantu areas, and in respect of South West African affairs in general. We cannot ask a lot of outsiders what we must do. That is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would do. I want to remind you of what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in 1961 when South Africa became a Republic outside the Commonwealth. He said that if he were to come into power he would make it his aim&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;&#x201C;to change the image of South Africa&#x201D;. In other words, he wanted to change South Africa as Malaya wanted it changed at the Commonwealth Conference, i.e. that if 10 Whites were allowed into Parliament, South Africa would be allowed into the Commonwealth again. That is the criterion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to tell him that it is not our criterion. He will have to be content with the fact that we will not dance to the tune of others as far as doing our duty is concerned. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also asked what was signified by the fact that the State President was being granted the right to set aside other areas for recognized nations, as is stated in clause 2 of the Bill.</p>

<p>It is very clear what is being envisaged by that. My reply to that is a twofold one. In the first place it is an existing procedure which we are, for the sake of completeness, repeating and laying down in this legislation. The hon. Leader of the Opposition ought to know that additional land still remains to be proclaimed for the Damara nation, which falls within the purview of this Bill, in order to give final shape to and complete their homeland properly. It is land which had in the meantime been purchased from Whites, but which has not yet been legally proclaimed as part of the territory of the Damara nation. This provision is, <i>inter alia</i>, making provision for that. I have already dealt with it in my speech, and I do not know why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is returning to it now. This provision is being included in the Bill to make such adjustments which may still be necessary in the future and the proclamation of land legally possible.</p>

The reply is, yes; if it is found necessary to set aside land for the Tswanas, then it can be done under those provisions.

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am struggling with the Leader; I am struggling to get something out of him. Let it be very clear now. A moment ago I asked the hon. member what a people or what a nation was. We often use the two words synonymously and this is the way I used them as well, people and nation. We use it, as they say in English, colloquially, we use them as every day expressions, to mean the same thing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is very loose language for one who upholds a language!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh dear! The people who have that centrifugal force, as I said a moment ago, who feel that they want to be together and do not want to be assimilated by others, those people are one people, they are one nation, to use the alternative word. That is my reply to him and that is why I say that we as Whites feel quite categorically, and without huming and haing, and without evading questions in that regard, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did, we feel unequivocally that we as Whites cannot form one nation with the Ovambos, we cannot form one nation with the Hereros, we cannot form one nation with the Zulus, the Bushmen, the Indians, or with the Coloureds. That is very clear. We as Whites are one nation. Let me admit, admit candidly as many have done already: We in South Africa as Whites are in fact still struggling to become one nation in the true sense of the word, because we have so many recalcitrants which we have to knead into the dough. We as Whites are still going through the difficult process of becoming a nation. But it is quite out of the question to think that we can incorporate Ovambos and those people as well, and that is why I maintain that those groups are separate entities, <span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="#page_1280"/>I mean the Ovambos, the Kaokovelders, the Okavombolanders, the Damaras, etc. They are separate entities, separate nations and they are also separate from the Whites in South West Africa because those Whites are identical to our Whites here in the four Provinces of the Republic.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised other points here. He took it amiss of us because, as he put it, this Bill was paving the way to independence, to things which will take us past the point of no return. To that I have at least two immediate replies ready for him. The first is this. As I have stated repeatedly, our policy of separate development is not one of trial and error; it is not an experimental policy; it is not a policy of doing one thing for a while, and if that does not succeed, then doing something else.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But you keep on saying it is an empirical policy; that is the word you use.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Do you know what that means? It is a policy which grows out of experience. The hon. member should have spent some time in a normal college, then he would have known what empirical sciences mean. As I said, we do not have a policy of trial and error, of doing one thing for a while, and then doing something else if the first does not succeed. We are applying this policy with conviction and with faith, knowing that it is the natural development which has taken shape throughout the entire world, because what country and what nation in the world has originated on any other principle except this one, namely that a separate entity wants to develop separately? This is how North American and Western European nations took shape and this is the same principle we are applying here.</p>

<p>The second reply I want to furnish to him is that the hon. Leader of the Opposition must, after all, not expect us to make laws in the illusion that they will subsequently take over the Government. We must not make laws now in the illusion that they will subsequently have to come and apply their policy. We must make laws now according to our policy. If they do not want us to make laws according to our policy, then they must ask the voters to return them to Parliament as the governing party. If we are the governing party then we make the laws to fit in with the whole scheme of our policy and for application by us for all time to come. This the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will simply have to swallow now. After 20 years he should have realized it by now.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know from me what was going to happen in South Africa in regard to the Bastards, the Coloureds and the Namas. Now, Sir, strictly speaking you should not allow me to reply to that question, because in my introductory speech I stated that the Nama, the Coloureds and the Bastards did not fall within the preview of this Bill. But if you would allow me a little leeway, I shall reply very briefly to those questions, and state very emphatically to hon. members that although this is not relevant now, that the Bastards and the Coloureds do not fall within the ambit of the administrative responsibilities of my Department. At present the Bastards and the Coloureds still fall within the ambit of the administrative responsibility of the legislative council of South West Africa, but will, as the hon. member knows, fall under the Department of Coloured Affairs in future in terms of the resolutions of the Odendaal Commission and in terms of resolutions which still have to be taken in future, and not because the Bastards are being regarded as Coloureds, but because the Bastards and the Coloureds of South West Africa will be administered by the Department of Coloured Affairs. The position in regard to the Nama is a similar one. To-day the Namas in South West Africa still falls under our Department, and are our responsibility. We are undertaking their administration. But according to the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, which are going to be implemented&#x2014; and I said this in my introductory speech&#x2014;the Nama will at some time or other which still has to be determined, and I hope it will be soon, be transferred to the Department of Coloured Affairs for administrative purposes. The following must be fully understood by all: They will be governed as Namas, and no attempt will be made to make Coloureds of them. That is the reply, and more than that I need not say. I think I have already said too much outside the rules.</p>

<p>Yes. Actually I shall return to that question a little later with specific details, but they will have their separate areas, which in fact they already have, plus the necessary adjustments. That applies particularly in the case of the Bastards and the Namas. Actually we cannot discuss the matter. I can understand the hon. the Leader wanting to know this. I can understand that he is bursting with curiosity to get to know this, but he should not ask me now under the discussion which is at present being conducted. As far as the Namas are concerned, who still remain my responsibility, and the Damaras, who are in fact my responsibility as well, we shall return to them in a moment, in pursuance of questions put by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>One or two hon. members made mention of an oil pipeline. This is that imaginary oil pipeline from somewhere in Angola running through the northern Native territories of South West Africa to the Republic. They asked, &#x201C;What is going to happen now? Suppose an oil pipeline is laid from somewhere in Angola to the Republic, running through an independent area. What is going to happen to the new oil pipeline?&#x201D; I know nothing about an oil pipeline from Angola, but let us suppose that this oil pipeline will one day be constructed. I now want to ask the hon. member: Does he not think that, of all places in South Africa, that oil pipeline will not be of value to those so-called independent countries which he is envisaging at this early stage? Does he not think that the value which the pipeline will have for us will also apply to them? Has it not occurred to him that we are at present negotiating with the Portuguese&#x2014;and the hon. member knows about that-&#x2014;on matters in regard to oil and electricity as independent countries which have to render assistance to each other in that regard, as well as to other countries? Did the hon. member not for one moment think of the possibility that we could negotiate with an independent Ovamboland in regard to that oil pipeline and that country would itself benefit thereby and that, far from blowing up that pipeline, it would also utilize oil from that pipeline for its own needs? That did not occur to the hon. member. It did not dawn on him at all. He cannot comprehend it. But the reverse of this very matter &#x2026;</p>

<p>What happened to you in Roodepoort? I cannot discuss Syria and such matters now. Hon. members must give me an opportunity of dealing with the points raised by the Opposition. What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members who asked questions in regard to the oil pipeline think the position in regard to that oil pipeline will be if the situation is the reverse of the one I have just discussed? The reverse of the situation will be the following. If that great Ovambo nation becomes a subservient entity of his race federation concept, if they form a suppressed minority group in his system of white leadership, what is going to happen then to that oil pipeline? Is it not a possibility that those people will say: &#x201C;We have not been granted our own independence; we are not being granted recognition to develop independently. Let us blow up the oil pipeline.&#x201D; Does he want me to argue in this way with him? I think this argument of mine is much more relevant than his is. I think that to speak of such oil pipelines is to raise fictitious arguments. We cannot expect a Leader of the Opposition, who aspires to a seat in this Bench in front of me, to raise such arguments. He has to leave it to the back-benchers, such as the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition can sit back. I have finished with him for the time being.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for South Coast and I know each other rather well. Strangely enough, we sometimes see eye to eye. We understand each other rather well. The hon. member for South Coast will probably accept it&#x2014;I know he will, since we understand each other&#x2014;if I say sincerely that I do, in fact, have a little respect for him. I hope he also has a little respect for me, even if it is only as a person. But really, the conduct of the hon. member for South Coast in this House the other day was very unworthy of him. He made a speech which was unworthy of him. He made a speech which was unworthy of this House. He made a speech which was unworthy of South Africa. He made a speech which was a blot on his career as a parliamentarian. I am saying this after careful consideration. For a long time I considered whether I should say these words. He and I are always open and frank in our dealings with each other. I would regard myself as a hypocrite if I did not say this. The hon. member did not speak here in a way which we would expect from a front-bencher, from a man who is obviously second in control, and an influence in his party. We did not expect that a person of his status in his party would make a speech with such a slant, tone and content as he did from his bench the other day. I had good reason&#x2014;and the hon. member will know why I am saying this&#x2014;to expect a moderate, sensible though highly critical speech from that hon. member. I expected him, when he rose to his feet, to attack and criticize us on every point, but at the same <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1282"/>time I expected, and he knows what I mean, that he would make a moderate, well-thought out, dispassionate though highly critical speech.

<p>Very well then, I shall withdraw it. The hon. member probably did not intend it to be one, but the hon. member went altogether too far in what he said. He spoke of the safety of South Africa which was at stake and of this period of hatred and enmity in which we would be introducing by this Bill, a Bill which should never have been. In the entire speech of the hon. member I searched in vain for a single sensible, moderate word. He did not utter a single word to try and win the friendship of one single Native nation or Native individual in South Africa for us as a country, and I am not speaking now of us as a Government. I found nothing of the sort. On the contrary, every word the hon. member uttered tended to drive the Native nations, of South West Africa in particular, further away from us instead of trying to win their friendship, drawing them closer to us and conditioning them to adopt a moderate and well-disposed attitude towards us. It is a pity that the hon. member for South (Coast) adopted this tone in his speech.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the method displayed by the hon. member for South Coast was disgraceful and dangerous. By doing so he did not draw a single Bantu nation closer to us. In fact, he instilled ideas in them which would drive them further away from us. That is what he did. The hon. member spoke of the nations in South West Africa on our northern boundary between us and Angola. He made wild statements in regard to them. Is the hon. member not aware that those nations have already given us positive assistance in that they have exposed terrorists who had infiltrated there, handed them over and helped us to capture them? Is he not aware that the Bantu nations in the north of South West Africa have, on more than one occasion recently, offered to assist us in exposing terrorrists, and in future will continue to do so? Why did he discuss them in such an unfriendly and objectionable spirit? I am sorry the hon. member did not go along on the tour through South West Africa which certain hon. members undertook during the short recess. He would then have heard from those people what their standpoint is in this regard. I am certain that they probably told Members of Parliament how they would stand by South Africa if a crisis should arise. He should have gone along. With this reprimand I leave the hon. member to his own conscience as far as his speech is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands also discussed the small countries and the wars which had arisen over small countries. I think that I have dealt adequately with this point in what I said earlier on. The hon. member for Pinelands spoke in a very pleasant and moderate vain, as is his custom and as we have come to expect from him. But he tried very hard but without any success to penetrate to the fundamental aspect of this Bill. The fundamental aspect which the hon. member should have investigated, was the following. I put this matter to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a moment ago by way of a question, to no avail. The question is this: Does that group of peoples or nations, or whatever you want to call them, consisting of Natives in South West Africa, form part of one entity along with the Whites of South Africa, or along with the Whites and the non-Whites of the Republic as a whole? Do they form an integral, inherent organic part of the whole, which consists of these people? That is the fundamental problem.</p>

<p>The hon. member should rather ponder that question at greater length instead of wanting to reply to it in this short time. I also want to tell him that if he wants to reply to it, then he must ask himself the following question: Are those groups satisfied to be assimilated into one whole, firstly with the non-Whites of South West Africa, secondly with the non-Whites and the Whites, and thirdly with the non-Whites and the Whites of the entire Republic?</p>

<p>Then the hon. member will realize that they are not prepared to do so, in the same way as we are not prepared to do so. I think that hon. member will be more prepared that his Leader to say that he does not want to be an equal member together with an Ovambo in one nation. A moment ago the hon. Leader of the Opposition did not want to reply to that question. I think the hon. member for Pinelands will candidly admit that he is not prepared to do so. If he and the Whites are not prepared to do so, why do they not want to accept that an Ovambo nation, for argument&#x2019;s sake, does not want to be assimilated into other nations as well, as they have explicitly told us in their communications? That is the fundamental aspect of this matter. If one recognizes, accepts and identifies the separate entities, then one must make provision for separate development and not offer them integrated development. That is the basis of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated that independence for each little group was ridiculous. I have stated repeatedly that what is involved <span class="col_5299-5300" refersTo="page_1283"/>here is not independence. These are things the future will teach us. Consequently the hon. member must realize, and I want to predict here for his benefit, that in Southern Africa, of which we form the nucleus, there is already an embryonic system developing, which will take shape to an increasing extent and which will lead to the inter-dependence of nations on one another becoming the pattern for the independent nations of the future. There in South West Africa you are going to see that pattern established, in the same way as I predict it will happen here in the Republic. The inter-dependence of one nation on the other is perhaps more striking here in our country and in Southern Africa than in any other part of the world. Here we&#x2014;and this is our duty and it falls within the ambit of our policy of separate development to make provision for this very thing&#x2014;will, as these small countries obtain an increasing measure of autonomy and become independent, see to it that it will be an independence which will rely very strongly on the inter-dependence of countries and nations upon one another.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the timing of this Bill, which was suppose to have been incorrect. But according to the Opposition none of our timing is correct. Our timing was not correct in the case of the Transkei. We have been watching the Transkei developing successfully for five years. It has been five years of successful development without sound or fury. They are more than well on the way to self-government. But there is no more striking example of how the Opposition was quite wrong when they told us that our timing was wrong as when we established the Republic of South Africa. Then our timing was once again suppose to be fatal. But now all those no-voters of 1960 are all supporters of the Republic, for which I am eternally grateful and for which I am not reproaching anyone. I am simply using this example to prove that our timing was absolutely correct. The hon. member for Pinelands also had quite a lot to say about how wrong this Bill was. He is also one of the hon. members who intimated in his speech that the Bill should have pandered more to the taste of other countries and even more to the taste of the U.N.</p>

<p>But firstly, I want to say this to the hon. member for Pinelands: Not even their policy of race federation or political integration, or whatever it is called, would satisfy the U.N., because inherent in his policy is the fact that in the large multiracial entity which they foresee, consisting of 17 million or more people, the minority of 3 million people will have to retain supremacy over all the rest. With that policy he will not satisfy anybody at the U.N. or in international world circles. I cannot understand why there is at present such a lack of support for our policy. As we all predict, and as I am also predicting now, hon. members will see that in future there will be an increasing degree of understanding of this policy of ours. This will be the case because our policy recognizes something which is being insisted upon internationally to a very great extent, i.e. independence for those who are able to gain independence. That is why I say that each one of the separate nations can win their independence. The hon. member must not think that a Bill which is based on his policy would meet with any great approval in the outside world.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated that too much was being forced upon the nations in South West Africa. What is being forced upon the nations in South West? In this Bill absolutely nothing is being forced upon them. This Bill is a permissive, fundamental Bill which lays down a series of principles and procedures, and which states: &#x201C;On this basis Native nations in South West Africa can develop further towards autonomy and self-governing communities; and this is followed by the proclamations which will be promulgated specifically for those nations, after consultation with them.&#x201D; And certain consultations have already been held with them, as I told the hon. member in private.</p>

<p>This Bill is forcing nothing upon them. After consultation with these people, it is determined precisely what they can manage and what they will manage at this stage, and then, in that proclamation, powers are conferred to them for direct implementation by themselves with their legislative boards, executive boards and public services which will be made available to them as their ability determines what they can at present accomplish. Nothing is being forced upon them which they cannot cope with. That is precisely what we are not doing, and it is precisely what other countries in Africa did do, namely to force independence upon people, as was done in the Congo where a government of 80 years standing was suddenly withdrawn overnight and where people who did not know how to proceed, were left to their own devices. This is not what we are doing, and I do not know where the hon. member gets it from to come and tell us here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North), who excused himself for being unable to be present here, mentioned a few points to which I can give more detailed replies. He said that they had not been consulted in regard to the Bill and that we were taking the criticism which they were expressing amiss of them. No, we are not taking it amiss of them. I have stated very emphatically now in my reaction to what the hon. member for South Coast said that I expected a critical speech from him and from every member on the opposite side who spoke. But what we also expected from hon. members on that side was that they should be reasonable and that they should at least try to be patriotic in their criticism. That is what we expected from them, but they were welcome to criticize. I want to say to the hon. member for Durban (North) that I cannot <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1284"/>see what use he and also other members on the opposite side as well who raised the matter, could see in so-called reference to or consultation with the Opposition in regard to this Bill. I should like to know whether hon. members on the opposite side think that in regard to this matter on which we differ so fundamentally, as the hon. member for Yeoville himself confessed here this afternoon, we could in any way come to any kind of agreement without one side or other having to relinquish some of its fundamental standpoints? I maintain it is quite impossible. The basic differences are too great for a compromise to be reached in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>I then come to a further point raised by the hon. member for Durban (North). He said that the Bill brought into prominence points in regard to which the U.N. would be up in arms to a far greater extent than before. This will have to be the case then. We are not trying to satisfy the U.N.; we will never succeed in doing so, nor will they. We are trying to help to serve and to satisfy the nations in South West Africa to the best of our ability according to our standpoints in regard to their development.</p>

<p>The speech made by the hon. member for Houghton, even if she did not intend it to be&#x2014;as usual this was precisely the effect it had&#x2014;was merely grist to the U.N. mill. She made use of all the terminology which she knows will elicit condemnation there. For example, one of her arguments was in regard to Bantustans which are being removed from South Africa to South West Africa. Removal of large numbers of people which would supposedly cause great dissatisfaction and inconvenience; that also formed part of her argument. And then she stated, quite dramatically: &#x201C;The wrong thing at the wrong time.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I wrote it down in English; the hon. member said: &#x201C;The wrong thing now with regard to the political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission.&#x201D; Sir, if proposals had been made here which were in accordance with her concept of political integration and equalization, then she would not have said that this is the wrong time for the measure; she would have rejoiced. Suddenly it is the wrong thing now, because there is a difference between us. According to her it is not the time which is wrong; it is the process which is wrong; it is the basic principle which is wrong. We know this, and we cannot get anywhere with her because she is standing on the opposite side of the chasm, and that is why I am now passing her by. For her information I want to say that the information which she brought forward here in regard to the pending appeal court case is not relevant here. It is not relevant here, for two different reasons. Firstly that Bill does not deal with anything similar to what is happening here; it deals with something quite different. Consequently the <i>sub judice</i> rule does not apply here. But in the second case the hon. member must remember that the entire argument deals with the question as to whether we should recognize the U.N. resolution adopted in regard to us. We stated emphatically at U.N. and everywhere&#x2014;here as well&#x2014;that we did not recognize the resolution adopted by the General Assembly of U.N. in which it was stated that our responsibility in regard to South West had been withdrawn. We do not recognize it, because the matter is entirely outside their jurisdiction. Thus the entire matter which she raised here is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Then I would just like to reply to a question raised here by the hon. member for Etosha. The hon. member asked me a question in regard to the control of water affairs in South West Africa. The standpoint of the Government is that control of water affairs in South West Africa should be seen and administered as one overall complete water service, with this adjustment that within the Bantu areas the necessary water distribution and water provision shall be undertaken by my Department.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City). The minor point he raised here has already been dealt with by me in my reply to other hon. members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who also excused himself for having to leave, raised quite a number of points to which I must at least make some reply. He also spoke about South West Africa which would supposedly be such an important link between us and the outside world, and he stated that we should not merely apply the recipes used in the Republic to South West Africa, but on the other hand the hon. member failed to go into the matter fundamentally in order to give as examples of what he condemned in this respect and what he regarded as the correct state of affairs. In addition the hon. member asked very dramatically: &#x201C;Prove to us that the Damaras&#x201D;&#x2014;he mentioned the Damaras specifically&#x2014;&#x201C;want the proposed Damara Homelands&#x201D;? Sir, in regard to this I can mention a few very interesting things, and I think I ought to do so. It is extremely apposite and I envisaged this a moment ago in reply to a question put by one of the other members. The Damaras, as you know, are one of the nations which are perhaps most widely distributed throughout South West, and who will perhaps have to undergo the greatest territorial adjustment in respect of their area. I want to inform you that the Damaras do in fact accept this concept of a consolidated Damara Homeland, with everything which that implies. I want to quote to you something which appeared in the Press last year, not in order to publicize it, but because I think it is so important that, generally speaking, it should be placed on record. This is a letter signed by Dawid Goraseb, who signed himself and whom we recognize as the paramount chief of the Damaras. In a letter dated 12th July, <span class="col_5303-5304" refersTo="page_1285"/>1967, he communicated the following to me, and now you must take note that the paramount chief wrote to me in order to implement resolutions which they adopted at a meeting at which only his counsellors and he himself were present after they had held discussions with the Commissioner-General. He writes as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On his recent visit to Okombahe, the honourable the Commissioner-General, Dr. Olivier, conveyed your message to us, namely that staff development and ultimate self-government is also being offered to the Damara nation.</block>

<block name="quote">I travelled the length and breadth of Damaraland and made personal contact with my people in regard to the matter. On 6th July, 1967, at a meeting held at Okombahe, the representatives from all sections of the reserve unanimously decided to accept your offer.</block>

<block name="quote">We thank you and your Government for the guidance in the past and we ask you to continue with you policy. We realize that we as Damaras cannot, in the near future, think of self-government, but we are prepared to accept your guidance and ask that a start be made immediately in the direction of self-development and self-government, but we are prepared to accept your guidance and ask that a start be made immediately in the direction of self-development and self-government. What we specifically have in mind here is education, agriculture, and the powers of headmen. At the moment they do not have any powers with which to carry out their duties more successfully and combat evils such as excessive use of liquor, child neglect, non-maintenance, etc.</block>

<block name="quote">In conclusion I, as paramount chief of the Damaras and my nation would like to confirm our sincere trust in the Government of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<block name="quote">(Sgd.) Dawid Goraseb, Paramount Chief of the Damaras.</block>

<p>I cannot furnish the hon. member for Bezuidenhout with a better documentary reply than this one, coming as it does from the paramount chief of the Damaras, to the question of the hon. member whether the Damaras accept the proposed Damara homeland. There you have the answer. Sir, hon. members of the Opposition, particularly the front benchers who ought to set an example, are now deliberately holding a discussion amongst themselves out loud in order not to hear what I am saying. It stands on record.</p>

<p>Who wrote that letter?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The letter was written by Dawid Goraseb. Here is his signature on the letter. Those resolutions were adopted at a meeting where they were present, without the Commissioner-General. I know what that hon. member is thinking, after all, we know him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I also want to quote from another letter, a very recent one dated 2nd April, 1968, a letter coming from the Chief Bantu Affairs Commissioner in Windhoek, in which he reported to us what was happening in respect of the Damaras. It is a long letter and I am not going to read all of it; I am merely going to give you the gist of it. What it amounts to is that the Damaras are voluntarily and in large numbers, already leaving their old places of abode for the new area of their Bantu homeland which is still to be proclaimed for them. He speaks here of 254 families, consisting of more than 1,500 individuals, which have recently left quite willingly for those parts where the Damara homeland will be created for them. Hon. members on the opposite side, amongst them the hon. member for Houghton, spoke of the tremendous deprivations which these ethnic removals entail. I can inform you that these people are doing so before we have given them the signal, because, in point of fact, we were not even prepared for them and we now have to make all kinds of provision for them there in great haste. They took with them&#x2014;just to give you another indication of the size of their migration&#x2014;1,360 cattle, 22 sheep, 15,800 goats, 96 horses, 38 mules and 280 donkeys, i.e. genuine donkeys. I said a moment ago that I would refer to the Namas in this respect, simply to show you that precisely the same thing is happening there. In the area over which we still have control, precisely the same thing is happening. This is taking place further down, in the southern part of South West Africa. During the same period 244 Nama families, comprising 2,200 individuals, have already migrated voluntarily with more than 20,000 head of cattle. They have migrated voluntarily to the future Nama homeland. It was a voluntary movement of those people, which was not inspired or organized by us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said a very interesting thing here when, according to their policy, he made a contrast between the system of government for the built-up northern territories, outside the Police zone, and the system for the Whites as well as all the non-Whites south of the red line. He went further than the Leader of the Opposition. Of course he is always two or three steps ahead of his Leader. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said they accepted that the three northern territories could become a quite independent country or countries, something which his Leader did not want to say. But then he also stated that they, as United Party, advocated&#x2014;and this the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also said, but not as outspokenly as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout did&#x2014;that in the Southern territories the Hereros, the Damaras, the Namas, the Bastards, the Coloureds, and I take it the Bushmen and the Tswana, should all be represented and governed in one integrated context by the <span class="col_5305-5306" refersTo="page_1286"/>Legislative Assembly of Windhoek. We must realize that what he is predicting here is precisely what the United Nations is predicting. What they are proposing here for the police zone, that is the area outside Ovamboland, Okavangoland and the Kaokoveld, is precisely what the United Nations is advocating for the entire South West Africa, i.e. that all should be included in one legislative authority.</p>

<p>There we have the illusion again, the new word of this Session. This is the illusion of the United Party, i.e. white leadership. The hon. member is reconfirming what I said earlier on to-day, i.e. that he imagines that the United Nations, or any other overseas nation for that matter, will be satisfied if all those people have representation in one political conglomeration and in one legislative assembly, with the Whites in charge. That is what they imagine. That hon. member must think this matter out very carefully and he will then realize that what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout predicted here is precisely what is being asked for in United Nations circles, namely one conglomeration for South West Africa as an independent country with one legislative authority. The people outside, and particularly the Whites of South West Africa, should hear this and understand that it is the policy which the United Party is advocating through the mouth of their spokesman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is more outspoken in regard to this matter than his Leader.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District)&#x2014;I must at least say something about the poor hon. member&#x2014;stated that last year in March I opened the proceedings of the territorial authority at Oshakati in Ovamboland. That is not so.</p>

<p>Even if I were to tell him, he would not understand. I went there last year for the express purpose of offering them the principle of self-government, which is the reason I am now introducing this legislation. No territorial authority was opened; they do not have a territorial authority. When that hon. member was still a mere clerk in my Department, he heard of territorial authorities and now he is trying to discuss matters like that, but he does not know what he is talking about. The hon. member also spoke about the independence, now, for Ovamboland, and he tried to put words into the mouth of the Deputy Minister, Mr. Coetzee, words which I know he did not utter and which he himself denied here to-day. Nor is this being done in the Bill. The hon. member is as wrong in regard to the Bill as he was in regard to the Deputy Minister, because this Bill is not making provision, now, for independence for Ovamboland. I do not know what he was trying to say if that was not what he was trying to say.</p>

<p>No. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) and the hon. member for Yeoville had quite a lot to say about the economic development which was needed, and other members on the other side immediately fell into this trap and wanted to pretend that a country should be totally independent economically if it wanted to obtain political independence, or political self-government; according to them it must then at least have a large measure of economic autonomy.</p>

<p>Let me now make a categorical statement for the benefit of this hon. member which he can go and test. There is no politically independent country in the world which is economically independent. It is a relative matter and the hon. member ought to know that we are living in a time of political awakening of nations throughout the world, particularly on this continent, and also in the southern part of Africa where we are established. That is why we are steadily leading our Bantu nations along the road to self-government, in the direction of political independence. And parallel to that we are doing our very best to see that they develop economically as well. But I remind him now of what I said a moment ago, i.e. that the political independence of countries, particularly of these Bantu areas here, if they are going to achieve this one day, will be dependent to an increasing extent upon the economic and other forms of inter-dependence upon one another. The same applies here. What country in the world waited until it became absolutely independent economically before it became politically independent? Did Lesotho wait for that, or Botswana? Did Britain wait for that? Did America wait for that?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill was foreshadowed by the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech earlier this year. It will be recalled that the Minister of Finance pointed out at the time that South Africa had always been willing to co-operate with other states in improving economic and social conditions and in promoting international economic welfare. As a member of various international organizations we have also contributed for this purpose, financially and otherwise, on a multi-lateral basis. Frequently, however, our contributions received no recognition and the very countries that benefited by them slated us for reasons which have nothing to do with international cooperation. In cases where we were denied the full benefit of membership, as in the International Labour Organization, the World Health Organization and the Nutritional and Agricultural Organization, we naturally ceased to contribute money, and in other cases we reduced our contributions.</p>

<p>It is the Government&#x2019;s view that we should apply our resources in the first instance to promote the welfare of our own population. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that it has a responsibility towards the international community and in particular towards our neighbours on the African continent; cooperation can indeed be to our mutual benefit. The Government is therefore of the opinion that the contributions which were previously made on a multi-lateral basis, should in future be applied to a greater extent to assist neighbouring states on a bilateral basis. Accordingly the main object of the present Bill is to establish an Economic Co-operation Promotion Loan Fund so that direct aid, mainly in the form of loans at reasonable rates of interest, for sound development projects may be rendered to well-disposed developing countries&#x2014;particularly in Africa. This fund can to a large extent be financed from the savings in respect of the contributions to which I have already referred. An amount of R5 million is being set aside for the fund out of the 1967-&#x2019;68 surplus.</p>

<p>For the rest the measure only provides for the creation of machinery to achieve the aforementioned objects. The fund which is being created, will be governed by the ordinary measures in regard to the auditing of accounts <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1288"/>and will be subject to the directions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with the Secretary for Foreign Affairs as the accounting officer. As provided in the Bill, no loan or financial assistance will be granted without the approval of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The terms and conditions will in each case be determined in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a very short, simple and straightforward Bill, and it is much more important than is indicated by the length of the very short introductory speech which the hon. the Deputy Minister has made. I think we should note that, despite the short speech he made, this Bill may very well become a milestone in our foreign policy. The object of the Bill, as the Deputy Minister said, is to take a practical step towards establishing relations particularly in Southern Africa, hoping to develop economic ties with countries there who are friendly disposed towards us. The Deputy Minister pointed out that we had made substantial contributions in the past to international organizations but we had received very little recognition therefor. In that respect our contributions to those bodies are being reduced. There is one matter to which I shall refer a little later concerning which the Deputy Minister may perhaps inform us.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill is in line with the policy which this side of the House has for years been urging the Government to adopt. Therefore, as the Government is taking over United Party policy, we are bound to support this measure. There are, however, a few comments which we should like to make.</p>

<p>In the first place the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the R5 million placed on the Estimates to start this fund, but of course that is only a drop in the ocean. We should like to know whether the Minister can give us any information as to what this is likely to involve us in. The Government is at present in the fortunate position that its money bags are full, full to bursting almost, and perhaps an embarrassment, and I think we can take it for granted there will not be a lack of applicants once this measure is placed on the Statute Book and it is known that we are open for applications for assistance. The Deputy Minister said it was still, and would remain, the Government&#x2019;s duty to attend to the internal needs of the country. I hope he and his colleagues will bear that firmly in mind when they deal with applications because we all know that, despite the Government&#x2019;s overflowing coffers, there are legitimate claims in this country for improved social services, assistance for agriculture, soil conservation schemes, education, and other matters, claims which the Government dare not neglect. If it does, it will come in for criticism that it is neglecting domestic matters at the expense of foreign matters. I was glad to hear the Deputy Minister say the Government would keep this in mind. We shall have it in mind, too.</p>

<p>I think the Deputy Minister and his colleagues should also remember&#x2014;and no doubt they know this&#x2014;that one does not necessarily make friends by lending money. In fact, very often it is the reverse that happens, especially when the lender expects the borrower to repay the borrowed money. I remember during the war there was in London what was called a Foreign Debt holders Committee which represented British holders of foreign stock amounting to some £4,000 million sterling, nearly all of which was regarded as being irrecoverable. It shows how very easy it is to incur bad debts once you start investing money abroad. This money is going to be lent on the assumption that it is a good investment for the country. My first comment is that the activities which will be embarked upon under this legislation will call for very careful and prudent handling. We have seen what happened in other countries, especially after the war when certain countries tumbled over each other to lend money. We heard tales of golden bedsteads and fleets of cadillacs, numbered accounts in Zurich, and so forth. Many large sums of money have been advanced to underdeveloped countries and I am not aware in any case of thanks being conveyed to the lenders thereof or that the recipients had any gratitude for the help received, let alone repaid the loan. I think these factors must be borne in mind and one must face the fact that, however careful we are, we may very well incur some bad debts. I dare say that in some instances it may be worth our while to incur bad debts. I do not want to go into this, but it does happen, and I can give instances, where loans are made and the indirect benefits resulting therefrom far outweigh the value of the loan itself over a period of time. But at the same time there is no reason for not taking the greatest care and acting with circumspection when making loans.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister also said this Bill created the machinery for administering the Fund. I cannot see that in this measure. It does say the Secretary for Foreign Affairs will be the Accounting Officer, and that is all. I should like to know what is envisaged in the way of machinery because clearly very large sums of money are likely to be involved in the next few years. Before the money is lent, a good deal of expert examination will have to be made. Before it is lent, careful plans have to be made as to how the money is to be made available. In addition to that, plans will have to be made for the payment of interest, for the redemption of the loan, and so on. Therefore it would appear that there would have to be almost a separate section in some department or other, to watch this matter very carefully. There is no reference in this Bill, and perhaps the Deputy Minister can tell us, just how far he has gone in making preparations for setting up the necessary machinery. The Bill does not only talk about loans; it talks about &#x201C;other financial assistance&#x201D;. It does not talk about lending money to other governments; it just talks about making loans and <span class="col_5311-5312" refersTo="page_1289"/>other financial assistance, so that it is possible that a loan may not be made to a government.</p>

<p>The Minister in his introductory speech did not explain what he meant by &#x201C;other financial assistance&#x201D;. But it is conceivable that there might be a large contract, obtained by a South African firm, and they might want some financial assistance, in carrying the contract. That loan, therefore, would not be made available to a foreign government. Or, on the other hand, it might be made to a foreign government, but a good deal of the money might be spent in the country, paying people who are supplying the necessary capital goods for carrying out the schemes for which the loan is made, because I have no doubt that we shall not make any loans except for specific projects. The great mistake that was made after the war by other countries was to give globular sums to the undeveloped countries without taking proper precautions to make sure that the money was going to be used for specific objects and being satisfied that the money was going to be used for that purpose.</p>

<p>So it is quite likely, I should imagine, that a good deal of the money which we lend will in fact be spent in this country. All that will require to be dealt with by the machinery which the hon. the Deputy Minister will have to set up. The hon. the Deputy Minister referred to our contributions to other international organizations, but he did not refer to the International Development Association, to which, according to this year&#x2019;s Estimates, we are permitted to contributing some R3 million, I think over a five-year period. That, I take it, is not a loan, but a grant. It is intended to be at the disposal of this association for schemes in undeveloped countries. In their annual report they deal with it and they give a list of the schemes which they are sponsoring and financing in these countries, and it amounts to a great deal of money. I do not know whether the hon. the Deputy Minister left that out by mistake, but, if we are going to undertake to help in the economic development by financial assistance to underdeveloped countries&#x2014;and we are not limited in this Bill to our neighbouring countries, although that is the prime object I take it&#x2014;and are going to reduce our contributions to these organizations, one wonders whether it is necessary to continue our grants in aid to an association which has regarded us as a developed country and our Native areas, falling under us, as being developed as well. The Minister might let us know what he thinks about that.</p>

<p>The other point I would like to raise, is this: What commitments has the Government already made which will fall under this Bill when it becomes an Act? We have read in the papers about loans to Malawi. The hon. the Deputy Minister will correct me if I am wrong in my figures but I think I saw a figure of some R5 million to help build a new capital. I think I saw another reference to R11 million for building a 70-mile railway to the Mozambique border. I do not know whether those contracts have definitely been agreed to, whether we are committed to making those loans. If so, I think that the Minister might tell us something about them, so as to give us a picture of how it is working, because it means that, in effect, this scheme is already working, even before the Bill is passed. If we are actually committed to give these loans, I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will tell us the amount of the loans, the purpose for which they have been made, the interest that is being paid, and the terms of repayment.</p>

<p>I see also in the Press that a very big firm of building contractors has just announced that they received a R12 million contract for building a big new sugar factory in Malawi. I do not know whether they will approach the department or the Minister to help finance it. If they have, I assume that it would be the kind of financial assistance which is envisaged under this Bill.</p>

<p>Then there is Mozambique. We have also read in the Press with regard to the Caborra-Bassa scheme, which is an enormous scheme, that we have agreed to subscribe to that. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us whether we have in fact agreed to take part in that scheme? If so, to what extent and to whom are we then to lend the money? I do not know who is actually carrying out this scheme, whether it is the Portuguese Government or a consortium. But who will be responsible for the loan or any financial assistance that we give? I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister, if we are committed in any way, will give us some information about it.</p>

<p>Then there is the hydro-electric scheme at the Kuneni River, hut of course we are told that that is still under discussion, and that nothing has yet been decided on. It is thus clear from what we have heard and what has been published, that there are quite substantial sums involved in prospect, and that the Government may be called upon to find fairly large sums of money in the next two or three years.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, we approve, as I say, of the object of this Bill. We feel that its success will depend entirely on how prudently and efficiently it is administered and managed, and we do ask that Parliament should be kept fully informed of all commitments undertaken by the Government under this Bill. I know that the Auditor-General is mentioned in this Bill and that his report will be available for consideration. But we would also like the assurance that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention that Parliament will be given full information about the activities of this fund and commitments which are undertaken in its name. With those remarks, I want to say that we support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to say a few words about this Bill. Like the hon. member who has just sat down, I <span class="col_5313-5314" refersTo="page_1290"/>feel very strongly that this is a Bill to be supported and that the principle underlying the Bill is an excellent one. I for one have long thought that South Africa ought to adopt more Continental responsibility in regard to the under-developed areas in Africa. I see this Bill as a sign that we are intending to do so. There have been schemes as the hon. member has mentioned, which we have undertaken without introducing a Bill in Parliament. Various loans have already been granted, but this measure is, so to speak, putting the official stamp on this policy. I think that it is an excellent idea. It is not a question of charitable hand-outs to under-developed areas. I believe that this is good sound economics on our part as well as good sound politics. I say this because the faster we develop the neighbouring territories in Africa so much more will South Africa benefit from those areas. This is our obvious hinterland. This is the area to which we will be exporting in future. South Africa will of course be the leading manufacturing country in Africa for a very long time. We have to look for our customers in the hinterland of Africa. As Europe continues to combine with its Common Market plans and with the ever present possibility that Britain will also eventually enter the European Common Market, South Africa is going to be turned more and more towards the African Continent for its markets for manufactured goods. I also say that with the gradual reduction in the amount of gold this country is producing, we are going to have to depend more on manufactured goods as exports to obtain foreign exchange. I believe that this is a very good economic idea as well as being a good political idea. The sooner we develop our neighbouring countries and use them as markets the better for South Africa. There is therefore going to be two-way traffic in this regard. I would say too that the personal contact that South Africa will make as a result of this scheme, will be very good for the country politically. I hope that this will also be the beginning of further development with personal contacts. I believe that we must not only look to our economic well being, but we must also try to build friendships throughout Africa in this way. With the technical assistance and the personnel that South Africa can supply, I think that this will be a very big feature in developing friendships with other countries in Africa. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister too that some of the financial assistance could perhaps go towards financing volunteer corps who wish to work in other territories on the lines of the voluntary services which have already been started by a group of young people in this country.</p>

<p>Yes, I am all for the idea of a peace corps. I do not see why it should be left to countries as far away as the U.S.A. or Britain with its British voluntary service, to suggest to our young people that there is an excellent opportunity in Africa in the under-developed areas, for them to use their energy where they can assist these countries in building and in teaching skills and scientific knowledge which they have and these countries do not have. I hope, therefore, that apart from the economic aspect we will also look to the other favourable results which could follow the development of an idea such as this, in fields other than financial aid.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support we have received for this Bill, but the discussion which has taken place makes it necessary for me to make a few further observations and also to reply to the remarks made by the hon. member for Constantia in particular. The hon. member began by saying that this was a milestone in our foreign policy. I think that it is a very important milestone. The hon. member then continued and praised the legislation. Subsequently he did criticize it a little, but before he got round to the criticism he tried to explain that this was actually the Opposition&#x2019;s idea which we had taken over and embodied in a Bill. The Opposition is in the position that, since they received so many drubbings in the past as a result of opposing legislation which came from the side of the Government, and since it damaged their image to such an extent in the eyes of the electorate, they eventually decided rather to agree with the Government. But if they want to agree with the Government because the Government does the right things and introduces the right legislation, and because it is in the public interest, it is also of no avail to them, because then they no longer have a political identity of their own. Then they must try to find some justification for their agreeing with the Government. We have heard repeatedly in the past that whenever they are compelled to agree with the Government because they have no answer to or criticism of legislation introduced by the Government, they offer the excuse that it is something which they told us in the past we should do. This is the background to the attitude which the Opposition has so often displayed this year. They seek an excuse when, as so often happens, they feel compelled to agree with the Government in connection with what it is doing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said that the R5 million for which provision is now being made, was in fact only a drop in the ocean. However, the drop is not so terribly small, especially if one compares it with the contribution which we made in the past. It is also obvious that it is not the idea that this fund should be established with R5 million and that that would be the only contribution to the fund. I take it that the hon. member for Constantia understood that, as circumstances make it desirable and essential, amounts in addition to this R5 million will be made available for the purposes of this fund. <span class="col_5315-5316" refersTo="page_1291"/>The hon. member referred to the words which I used when I said that it remained the policy of the Government to look after the domestic interests of South Africa first. Then the hon. member continued and again tried to make some political capital of the matter. He referred to erosion works which had to be carried out, apparently referring to the erosion in the United Party. He also spoke of social services for which money was needed. I could not quite understand why the hon. member brought up these arguments in connection with a Bill such as this one. The hon. member himself said that this Bill was a milestone in our foreign policy. When we are dealing with a matter such as this, which can be described as a milestone in our foreign policy then, surely, it is quite wrong and unfair to link it with domestic matters of detail. As the hon. member for Houghton also said&#x2014;and the hon. member for Constantia also said it in the course of his speech&#x2014;benefits as yet unforeseen may be expected to result from a measure such as this. And because this is so, because this measure goes beyond the matters of detail mentioned by the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;such as erosion works, social services, and so on&#x2014;it is not comparable. The hon. member spoke of &#x201C;neglecting home for abroad&#x201D;. This is a remark which does not accord with the attitude which the hon. member for Constantia otherwise adopted. It compels me to elaborate somewhat on this Fund which is to be established and on what the Government envisages with it. As a matter of fact, the hon. member also accused me of having said too little when I introduced the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia is correct in saying that we have always contributed to the International Development Association, generally known as I.D.A. We do not intend discontinuing these contributions altogether upon the establishment of this Fund. We shall continue to meet our obligations in the future in so far as we consider ourselves in duty bound to do so, and in addition to what is done by means of this Fund. The hon. member is probably also aware of the fact that in the past circumstances have compelled us to contribute to the development of undeveloped countries by means of I.D.A. and on account of our membership of the World Bank. But, as I have already said&#x2014;and the hon. member will agree with me&#x2014;we are not quite happy about the way in which our contributions are being used. Firstly, we have no control over the allocation of those contributions and, secondly, those funds are so often used for the benefit of countries which are not only hostile to us, but even do us harm as a result of that attitude. Therefore our contributions to this International Fund have in the past often been applied to our own detriment. As a result we have never felt happy about these contributions. At the same time we are aware of the fact that we have countries around us in Southern Africa which are also still undeveloped, countries which need assistance and, what is most important of all, countries which want to co-operate with us. The Government&#x2019;s object with this fund is that by way of a <i>quid pro quo</i>, by means perhaps of a reduction in our contribution to I.D.A., it will render assistance to these countries around us, countries which are well disposed towards us and which are still undeveloped, so that their development may be furthered. We are convinced that this assistance will not only be to the benefit of the countries concerned, but will also be to the benefit of South Africa itself, directly and indirectly. South Africa has been denied membership of certain international organizations&#x2014;the International Labour Organization, for example, the World Health Organization, the Nutritional and Agricultural Organization, and others, organizations to which we made substantial contributions while we were still a member of them. To-day we are no longer a member and therefore no longer contribute. In this sense it is an essential saving for us.</p>

<p>Let me say that we feel ourselves compelled to meet our obligations in the international field. We do not want to be isolated from international co-operation. Therefore we are prepared to continue to make a contribution, also to make a contribution to the development of underdeveloped countries. The money which we save by having been denied membership of the organizations which I mentioned, can now to a large extent be applied for the purpose which we envisage here.</p>

<p>Such a scheme as we are now envisaging also offers a whole series of economic advantages for South Africa. The hon. member said that the contribution which we are making and which we shall make in the future to the International Development Association is simply a donation. He said that we could not expect to get anything in return. That is indeed the position in respect of our contribution to that organization. What we are envisaging here, and what is also provided in the Bill, is not that the amounts provided should be gifts, but that they should be loans. We will then get the loans back with interest. I want to put it to the House that we cannot expect to receive a high rate of interest. It is simply not in accordance with international practice that this kind of soft loan, as they are called, should carry a high rate of interest. From the nature of the case and according to international practice these loans will carry a low rate of interest. In contrast to what we do in the case of the International Development Association, these will be loans which carry interest and which will be repayable to South Africa. When such loans are granted, it can and will be stipulated as a condition that as far as it is at all possible, South African labour and goods must be used for the development of the projects concerned. This may hold tremendous hidden benefits for the growing economy in South Africa, especially for our industry. The extent of what this may mean to us in the future we can hardly determine now. <span class="col_5317-5318" refersTo="page_1292"/>I also want to mention an additional benefit which this may hold for South Africa. Because we shall have exclusive control over the allocation of these loans, the Government will see to it that these moneys are not applied for luxury purposes, but that they are applied not only in states which are well disposed towards us and wish to co-operate with us, but also for beneficial economic development.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia also asked for certain details, but I cannot furnish him with the full details at this stage. However, he noted that a loan of R8 million had been made to Malawi over a period of three years for the development of their new capital Lilongwe. We believe that this loan complies with these qualifications and that it will be a productive project which will be of great benefit both to Malawi and to the South African economy. The fact of the matter is that the development of well-disposed neighbouring slates is at all times desirable for any country in the world. All developed countries of the world take this view, and we cannot but do so as well. What is even more important is that the contribution which was previously made on a multilateral basis&#x2014;which I mentioned and which was emphasized by the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;-will now largely be made by means of loans which will be used to develop well-disposed neighbouring states on a bilateral basis. In other words, our funds will not be paid into a pool and distributed from there, so that we have no control over it. They will be made available on a bilateral basis in the form of loans to countries which we approve and for projects of which we approve. I therefore believe that the hon. member for Constantia cannot compare loans and financial assistance of this nature with domestic loans or domestic financing. The implications of and the benefits inherent in financing of this nature are so much greater and more important than anything which can be compared on a particular basis with what we are doing in the domestic field. The benefits which result from this as far as sound economic co-operation and good neighbourliness are concerned&#x2014;and I acknowledge the hon. member for Constantia to be right in this regard&#x2014;are not necessarily created by financial assistance alone. Surely we have learnt this in Africa. Financial assistance is not the only way of gaining the friendship of fellow human beings. The obligation which we feel, is a more worthy one than merely granting financial assistance. We believe in real economic advancement. In the process we do not merely want to give presents, but we want to render financial assistance to develop neighbouring states economically so that at the same time it will be to the benefit of South Africa. I therefore believe that what we are envisaging here can be of great benefit to Southern Africa, and can at the same time hold greater benefits for ourselves. The hon. member also spoke of protection, I do not think that it is necessary at this stage to go into details concerning the loans. The details have in fact not yet been worked out. Only the one loan to Malawi has so far been announced, and the details of that have not yet been worked out. The hon. member spoke of the Caborra Bassa Dam and the construction of a railway line. Those are matters which are not relevant here. In view of the fact that the administration of this legislation will fall under the control of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I think that it will be more appropriate for the particulars of loans and financial assistance to be discussed under the Vote of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The hon. member for Constantia rightly said that these statements would be audited. It is not necessary now to set up complicated machinery to deal with this matter. The Secretary for Foreign Affairs is the accounting officer. The statements will be audited and members of this House will every year and at all times have the opportunity of obtaining particulars of how these funds are being administered. The hon. member also asked what we had already undertaken. I think that I have already replied to that. In conclusion I want to say, as the hon. member&#x2019;s experience during the past 20 years has taught him, that when one keeps the administration of a sound undertaking in the hands of this Government, nothing will go wrong with it.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote 15,&#x2014;Social Welfare and Pensions, R117,643,000 (continued):</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad of this opportunity to say a few words during the discussion on this Vote. I just want to mention a few facts and to make a few pleas. The second largest single Vote in the Estimates of Expenditure for the year ending on 31st March, 1969, is this amount of R117,643,000 in regard to Social Welfare and Pensions as against the amount of R252,700,000 for Defence. We take notice of this enormous amount the Government has earmarked for the welfare of our people. Last year I pleaded for the aged and this year I feel I have to break a lance with the hon. the Minister for the child who is the most valuable national possession of the State. The child is the future citizen of the country. We are compelled, especially in the era in which we live to-day, to give much more attention to preventive services. Prevention is better than cure. The gathering of wrecks along the path of life is a very expensive process. There is only a slight possibility that these wrecks may be repaired again. It is an accomplished fact that the housewife and mother of old have entered into the open labour market. This <span class="col_5319-5320" refersTo="page_1293"/>phenomenon is increasing steadily. The working wife and mother have now become an economic necessity. The result of this is smaller families, loose family ties, and child neglect, all of which will gradually have a very detrimental effect on our nation. Owing to lack of time I shall unfortunately not be able to deal with this more fully. In view of this, the second best thing to do, will be to cope with this sad state of affairs and to take steps to cope with this state of affairs. This offers a challenge to parents&#x2019; societies, to associations, to organizations, employers and even to the church and the State, namely, to establish nursing homes for babies of six weeks old and upwards. We already have about ten of these creches for which we are sincerely grateful. Firstly, I want to ask whether the hon. the Minister would not consider increasing the existing means limit for subsidizing by the State, so that a greater number of working parents may make use of this privilege. If this is done, private initiative will show greater interest in establishing such nursing homes or creches. Furthermore, and in conjunction with this, I also want to appeal to employers to allow the working mothers of such children who are being looked after in nursing homes, to go home from at least 3 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. We owe this to ourselves. Apart from physiological care, these children need the loving care which only a mother can give. Without this aspect of education, very little is achieved. All the people, also children, want to be human beings and not merely a number. There is great need for all of these institutions, and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister and I want to ask him whether the time has not arrived, when sub-economic housing schemes are planned, to make special provision for such creches in these projects, or to plan for the erection of these creches. The scope of these schemes may possibly be extended in this way. The babies of working mothers in the neighbourhood may then be cared for in these institutions. The institutions will be within easy reach of these mothers. This will solve the problem of neglect and/or the servant problem. But this must not stop here either. I should say children must be kept in such nursing homes until they have reached the age of three years, but I feel that the existing nursery school should be able to meet the requirements for children, between the age of three years and the age at which they enter primary school. Here also, as regards the nursery school, we should not underestimate the necessity of establishing such nursery schools or creches. I say it is essential that we should consider the child as the future citizen of the State. In this institution, in the creche or in the nursery school, the same rules of education and care, of loving care and physiological care apply, but here a purely pedagogical care is added as well. In this respect we will have to concentrate on sound relations between the parent, the nurse and the teacher and we will have to lay strong emphasis on the fact that there should be a satisfactory relationship and that the matron of such a creche should also act as a social worker.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>A great many matters were dealt with during the few hours which the debate lasted. I want to try to deal very briefly with some of them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo asked when the various Acts dealing with welfare matters would be put into operation. The intention is to put all of them into operation on 1st October of this year so that all the latest concessions, which will come into operation with effect from that date, may be put into operation by regulation at the same time, otherwise the regulations will have to be amended again. The hon. member asked me whether a further relaxation of the means test was envisaged. The answer is that an overall adjustment of the means test is a budgetary matter which has to be dealt with in conjunction with the Budget owing to the far-reaching financial implications thereof. Seeing that such a concession was not announced in the Budget speech, it is not the intention to introduce such a concession in the interim because this will upset all the financial arrangements of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Finance. But within the framework of the existing means test adjustments are in fact made from time to time so as to eliminate anomalies. There are for instance, the question of a supplementary allowance in respect of old age pensioners over the age of 70 years and the concession granted to working married women in terms of which one third of their income is taken into account for assessment purposes in cases where the husband is unable to work. I think there is room for improvement in this connection. On the other hand, we have the question of annuities. These three aspects are receiving the attention of my Department and investigations are being carried out in that connection in order to see what the implications will be, and we shall act in an accommodating manner wherever it is at all possible to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to blind persons and asked that only one third of their income be assessed as means instead of one half of their income as is the case at present. According to the information I have, the problem he referred to actually exists among the non-White blind and not so much among the Whites. Since this is a problem among the non-Whites, it is a matter for the other Departments. If this problem does exist among the Whites, I shall be pleased if he will let me have the particulars. Then I can have the matter investigated further.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the fact that a certain period had to lapse before a welfare organization could obtain a subsidy because of the prerequisite to build up a work load in respect of a social worker before a <span class="col_5321-5322" refersTo="page_1294"/>subsidy may be granted, as well as for other reasons. I have referred this entire matter to a departmental committee which is investigating a completely different and new approach. The various welfare organizations as well as the Welfare Council will be consulted in this investigation in order to try to bring about an improvement in this connection.</p>

<p>To begin with I am only dealing with the minor points which were raised here. The hon. member for North Rand asked for the means test to be abolished for veterans of the First World War. Not so long ago this matter appeared as a point for discussion on the agenda of the congress of the South African Legion which was held in Cape Town a few weeks ago. After prior discussions had been held with my Department, the Legion decided not to include this matter for discussion on its agenda because they agreed that, in view of the present relaxed means test applicable to persons over the age of 70 years, all people falling in that category and in need of assistance, did in fact obtain such assistance to-day. In view of the fact that the war veterans themselves came to the decision that at this stage they agreed with the attitude adopted by the Government, I think we should leave the matter at that for the present.</p>

<p>As regards war widows who forfeit their pensions when they remarry, there are of course serious administrative problems for then one would have to decide what benefits such a widow had derived from the second marriage, before the pension she had forfeited as a result of the second marriage could be restored. To me the obvious solution seems to be that these people should be assisted by the normal social services when in need of assistance.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised the question of Bantu war veterans once again. This matter is the exclusive concern of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and any representations in this connection should therefore be made to that Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene asked for overall control to be instituted for all the welfare services in the Republic under me and my Department. I want to point out that I have already appointed a departmental consulting committee as regards welfare services in respect of the various population groups in consultation with my colleagues, the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of Indian Affairs. The inter-departmental committee will advise the Ministers and Departments concerned as regards the implementation of policy and administrative matters, and it will make the necessary recommendations to the various Departments. Therefore, machinery does exist for co-ordination in this connection. As regards the other welfare services or quasiwelfare services rendered in connection with rehabilitation, and so forth, by other Departments such as the Department of Labour and the Department of Prisons, there was until recently an inter-departmental fact-finding committee which evaluated the various services, undertook research work and kept proper records. After that the committee ceased to exist. I think this is an indication that further co-ordination between these Departments may produce good results, and I am considering methods of bringing about co-ordination in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands mentioned that many persons who may possibly qualify for some benefit are not aware of this possibility and that consequently they do not receive such benefits. I agree with him. I think the methods we employed in the past, namely to rely on the welfare organizations and the other public bodies and the magistrates&#x2019; offices where all the information was available, did not always convey the information to the public in a form which they could easily understand. As a result of representations I received from this side of the House, I gave instructions a short while ago that the matter be investigated and that a very simple but attractive pamphlet be compiled in which the various benefits would be set out in a simple way and in a manner which would enable the ordinary citizen to understand them. We are engaged on that task.</p>

<p>Various hon. members mentioned different aspects affecting family life, for example, the question of family allowances, care of the aged and child welfare, and so forth. Just as I think that it is necessary for us to have a special section in the Department to deal with the question of the care of the aged, so I have decided to establish in the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions a section to deal with family life. This section will operate in close co-operation with the Family Life Commission of the National Welfare Council. Professional officers will be detailed in order to carry out sustained study in connection with matters affecting family life in general. These officers will have to carry out evaluations in connection with the various existing or proposed services affecting the family in general. This section will therefore form the research and administrative branch of the Family Life Commission. Apart from the attention this Commission is giving to the question of divorce at the moment, I believe it will have to cultivate a large field which is still lying fallow at the present. There is also the question of child welfare and a wide field remains to be covered in this connection. There is also the question as to whether greater emphasis should be placed on foster care instead of institutional care. On a previous occasion I said something about this in public. I think it would be worth while to have further research work carried out in this direction. There is also the question of family allowances. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) pointed out to what extent the various auxiliary services established as a result of the report of the Piek Commission had recently been extended and to what extent <span class="col_5323-5324" refersTo="page_1295"/>family allowances had been extended during the past seven years. It is necessary that further investigations be carried out in this connection in order not only to ascertain to what extent the assistance which had been rendered, served its purpose but also to what extent such assistance would have to be extended or would possibly have to be directed elsewhere. A decision in this regard is not an easy one to take, and I think this is a matter into which the Commission should in the near future institute a thorough investigation with the assistance of the family life section of the Department.</p>

<p>Then there is also the question of creches. The hon. member for Hercules as well as various other members referred to this matter. I want to agree that the restriction being imposed under the present circumstances is particularly unfavourable in that the Department is at present subsidizing creches in which the children of indigent parents are accommodated only in cases where both the parents are working and where the joint income does not exceed R120 per month. I am going into this matter at the present moment, but this is not an easy matter and careful investigation will have to be instituted. We are not only concerned with the question of creches and nursery schools for children of pre-school age; I think there is another question to which attention would probably have to be given and this is the question of places of detention and of auxiliary services in respect of school-going children whose parents both work after school hours. As far as this is concerned, places of detention are already being made available by certain employers at the factories or institutions where these mothers work. I think this is a commendable idea and one which may be encouraged. A start has been made to provide creches in the various residential areas. I think it is essential that we should bear in mind that these preventative services for maintaining a sound family life and particularly for developing the child into a well-adjusted adult, is going to be one of our most important tasks in future. To-day welfare work does not merely consist of poor relief work only. To an increasing extent it is becoming family care and it often enters the field of even the more wealthy parents in modern city life. In that respect we must face up to the task presented by modern society and by the urbanization caused by the modem way of living, and we must give the necessary attention to it to be able to produce well-adjusted and well-balanced citizens for the future. But I want to stress the fact that in this sphere, as much as in the sphere of the care of the aged, it is necessary for us to maintain the communal character of our social services, namely that what is being done and what should be done should not primarily be the task of the State and of the State alone but that it should primarily be the task of the various church and other voluntary welfare organizations. In this respect I want to associate myself with the hon. member for Westdene, who paid tribute to the excellent work being carried out by private initiative in the sphere of welfare services. I think the part played by the State is and should remain subsidization, research, guidance, co-ordination and general assistance, but the actual services and particularly services regarding family care, should continue to be the task of private initiative so that the communal character of those services may be maintained. In this connection I want to refer to the interesting speech made by the hon. member for Durban (Central) about the prejudicial effects flat life may have on the family, not only in the social sphere, but also as far as national health is concerned. To me it is an open question whether the harmful effects on national health should be attributed solely to the flat as such or whether it should be attributed to the flat as a result of the location of the majority of flats in our metropolitan complexes in the world to-day. The flats are mostly situated in the central parts of the cities where there is a great density of population as well as a concentration of commercial and factory buildings in the immediate neighbourhood with the air pollution that goes with it. The flats are situated at those points where all the traffic of the city converges and where there is a great amount of air pollution by motor traffic. The question is, therefore, whether the flat as such is primarily responsible for the prejudicial effects or whether they may be attributed to the location of the flats. I noticed an interesting phenomenon in this connection during my visit overseas and that is the fact that these prejudicial effects cannot always be attributed to flat development. In a city like Los Angeles, for example, where, until recently, no buildings, except hotels and certain factory buildings, more than two storeys high were allowed, there developed as a result of this restriction a city which extends over a vast area in which places of employment and business undertakings are widely dispersed, and the result is that almost all the inhabitants are making use of private motor transport. Consequently, we find that there is serious air pollution as a result of the exhaust gases of motor transport. In other words, if there is no flat development but only development of ordinary dwelling houses, which extends horizontally over a large area, this results in various other problems, problems which may also have a prejudicial effect on national health. Allow me to say in this connection that an interesting experiment is at present being carried out in Toronto, which is a rapidly developing metropolis, an experiment in terms of which sky-scraper development is not concentrated in one particular part of the city but is spread over different parts of the city so that the development of flats takes place in at least ten different parts of the city separated from one another. One will probably find ten blocks of flats in one area but the other blocks of flats will be quite a distance away. One does not, therefore, find a large concentration of flat dwellers in one particular area of the city. <span class="col_5325-5326" refersTo="page_1296"/>These are interesting developments. In other words, it seems to me that we should get away from the practice of simply dividing our towns and cities into zones and that we should give attention to the proper planning of our cities and towns, planning as to their final appearance. In this connection I have already asked the administrators of our provinces to discuss this matter with me and I hope to be able later on to negotiate through them with the local authorities in order to bring about a certain amount of co-operation between the State and the local authorities in connection with the preparation of proper plans as to the final appearance of our cities and towns. One of the matters I want to incorporate then, is that regard should also be had to the social factor as far as planning is concerned. I think the social factor has totally or largely been disregarded in the past, particularly in our urban and town planning. It is my intention to give strong consideration to the social factor in future as regards all planning where community development takes place. I shall do my best in that regard and I believe that the Family Life Commission will then, for example, go into the effects of flat life on the family. We will have to develop patterns to ensure that, in cases where it is necessary to obtain greater density, these patterns are carried out in such a manner that the prejudicial social and health effects on the family will be limited to a minimum. I hope that we will be able to carry out research in that direction and that we will be able to take steps in future to minimize any disadvantages which may exist.</p>

<p>Various hon. members spoke about care for the aged and they raised various aspects in this connection. As I have said, I announced in the past that I had a section established in the Department to deal with care of the aged, and one of the officials is at present carrying out a comprehensive study of the various methods employed in respect of care of the aged. These steps are actually a result of the study tour I undertook last year when I came across various interesting and beneficial methods, methods which I think may be employed advantageously in this country. I want to mention one of them only in passing, one which was developed, particularly in Holland, into a very sound method. According to this method all the aged persons who are able to look after themselves are accommodated in one large housing unit. Every family has a bedroom, lounge-dining-room, kitchen and bathroom. The whole of the institution is devised in such a way that proper control can be exercised for the protection of the aged persons. The institution has, <i>inter alia,</i> a proper inter-communication system so that the aged person can obtain immediate assistance by simply pressing a button when he becomes ill or when he needs assistance. If the aged person should one day be unable to prepare his food himself owing to illness or other circumstances, food is simply ordered from the communal kitchen. Welfare organizations also use this communal kitchen by organizing the distribution of food to aged persons living outside the project when they cannot look after themselves. I think this system may be employed with great advantage in our cities and towns. However, I want to emphasize once again that it is not the task of the State to put all these things into operation. We shall determine by means of research and investigation the pattern which may be followed but then private initiative, for example the welfare organizations, the church bodies, and so forth, should take active steps to establish those facilities with the assistance we make available.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that we have made considerable progress as regards the care of the aged. I am not going to quote all the relevant figures now; I may merely mention that while we had only 73 old-age homes in 1961, we will soon have 190 old-age homes which will be able to take care of a total number of 12,600 aged people, 2,600 of whom will be infirm. Moreover, we now insist that in every old-age home which is being built at present, provision should also be made for taking care of at least four to eight infirm aged persons. This is in addition to the special old-age homes available to them. At my request the National Housing Commission agreed to make provision in future for a medical examination room and a chemist to be included in the calculation of cost of all old-aged homes. Negotiations are at present being conducted with the provinces to take over certain services concerning aged persons which up to the present have been rendered by them. Considerable progress has been made with these negotiations and we are receiving excellent co-operation on the part of the Administrations. Negotiations with the Department of Health are in progress and I hope to be able in the near future to give a full explanation as to how the matter of nursing care for sick aged will be controlled mainly by my Department so that we will be in a position to co-ordinate all those services properly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo once again questioned me about compulsory social security. I gave instructions for a thorough investigation to be carried out into the system which is in operation in the U.S.A. as well as the one in Canada and I was satisfied that the system operating in the U.S.A. was not a socialist one because the State made no contributions and because the system did not dampen the private initiative of the individual in that he himself made provision for his old age without receiving any contributions from the State. In South Africa we have various serious problems because our labour pattern, particularly that of the non-Whites, is such that it will be difficult to introduce such a system in this country. In any case, I am having a document prepared in which the system is fully set out and I shall have it investigated properly and then I shall discuss it with the other Departments. It was not <span class="col_5327-5328" refersTo="page_1297"/>possible to give consideration to this matter before now because we have been waiting for the report of the Cilliers Commission which became available a few days ago. We shall have this report investigated properly. I have taken a quick look at the report and it is clear that their recommendations may lead to steps being taken to retain the benefits and to bring about greater uniformity of schemes gradually and probably to introduce compulsory schemes in due course so that there may be proper transferability. If this is the case, it will not be possible to introduce another scheme parallel to this one. It will require careful study in order to ascertain whether it is necessary and possible to have, in addition to the existing scheme, another which only provides for ground-floor benefits. To my mind it is quite wrong to think that two schemes can and have to exist parallel to each other, schemes which will both place a burden on the employer as far as contributions and additional expenses are concerned and as a result of which the employee will derive twofold benefits. Hon. members will therefore appreciate that this matter requires a careful study and that we will have to consider it in a proper manner in the light of the report of the Cilliers Commission when this report comes up for consideration. This matter will be considered by the Government in the near future. Therefore, I cannot add anything at this stage to what I have already said.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister to give us some information regarding the item I referred him to in the Estimates. It is a matter of R100,000 which the Minister said he would look into and explain it to us. It is on page 95 of the Estimates. It is under item &#x201C;P&#x201D; and relates to special grants to welfare organizations. The item was R250,000 last year and this year there is R100,000 on the Estimates. Will the Minister please tell the Committee what the R150,000 was used for?</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, I forgot to mention this matter. This is an amount which is available to my Department to enable welfare organizations wishing to erect old age homes to acquire the necessary land, and also to assist them in other respects. Much use is made of this amount and the additional amount now being asked is less than the amount asked for in the past, because a certain amount is still available. When the whole of this amount has been used up the Treasury will be approached again in future with a request to make more money available. In view of the applications which have already been received and which are still expected I think this amount is at present quite adequate.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of matters which we want to discuss with the hon. the Minister. In the first place I want to discuss with the Minister the Press statement which he issued last week regarding customs matters. The statement has caused very widespread anxiety throughout the community, and it was a very sweeping statement. I think we are bound to ask the Minister to elaborate it and to tell us exactly what he had in mind when he made it. One does not know why he made it at this particular stage. Amongst other things he said a number of prosecutions are pending and if that is so, then one wonders if this was the right time to issue such a statement.</p>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s statement contains a number of remarks which are very disturbing. He says a very serious situation has developed. He does not suggest that situation has developed suddenly; indeed it is quite obvious it must have developed over several years. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister the specific question as to when this matter was first brought to his notice. The Minister has control over a number of departments which handle a large number of subjects and he cannot be expected to be a master of detail all the time and he must of necessity depend upon his officials to keep him fully informed. A very serious situation has developed, to use the Minister&#x2019;s own words, and one should like to know when this &#x201C;very serious situation&#x201D; was first brought to his notice. The statement goes on to talk about the nature and the volume of alleged contraventions. He talks about complicity between importers and indent agents and suppliers on such a scale that it is undermining the Government&#x2019;s protection policy. That is a very devastating remark to make. He says those are persons who are enriching themselves at the expense of the State. He talked about a disregard for and <span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1298"/>ignorance of customs and excise provisions shown by the &#x201C;average&#x201D; importer. That means all importers more or less, a very large number of people. Then he says in spite of the steps taken by his department to prevent these irregularities the number of alleged contraventions and other difficulties is still increasing. Then he mentions the criminal prosecutions to which I have already referred. At the end of his statement he admits that the steps which had been taken do not find favour generally with trade and industry and he is reviewing customs and excise legislation with a view to improving matters. I do not want to go into details.</p>

<p>The impression one gets, and I think the impression the public have got throughout the country from this statement, is that there is widespread dishonesty in the textile trade. The hon. the Minister, as I say, refers in the course of his statement, to the &#x201C;average importer&#x201D;. He does not actually accuse the average importer of dishonesty but I think it is inevitable that in the course of his statement the one is linked up with the other. That is the impression which he gives. He also gives the impression that the department at the present time is not able to cope with the situation and with the difficulties with which it is faced. I agree with the hon. the Minister that this is a very serious state of affairs. Apparently the regulations have become so involved that importers are finding it almost impossible to comply with them in every detail, and they have to comply in every detail, otherwise they were in trouble. As I say, I am not going into any detail because this matter does belong under the Customs and Excise Vote, but I wish to give just one example to illustrate what I mean.</p>

<p>This month&#x2019;s South African Bureau of Standards bulletin refers to new specifications, a code of practice, and terms and definitions for textiles and textiles merchandise that they have just published. This new textbook which presumably is to be used by everybody is very interesting. The second section of the book covers nearly 1,000 terms used in connection with fabrics and weaves, and it is illustrated by diagrams and so on. The third section deals with technical terms of particular interest to the trade. I want to ask the Minister whether he has had a look at that code. If he were an importer would he care to make himself master of the thousand items in that list, on top of all the others they have been working on for a long time, and be absolutely certain there is no room for any kind of inaccuracy? I am bound to say the Minister would be a marvel if he could really master all this even over a period of months, doing nothing else, and leaving all his other departments out of it. It think it is right to say the regulations have become so involved that importers are finding it almost impossible to comply with them in every detail.</p>
