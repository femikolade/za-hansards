<heading>ACTING STATE PRESIDENT&#x2019;S ADDRESS</heading>

<p>Mr. SPEAKER stated that at the opening ceremony he had received a copy of the Acting State President&#x2019;s Address to members of the Senate and of the House of Assembly, which was in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<p>MR. ACTING PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE:</p>

<p>MR. SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY:</p>

<p>I am glad to welcome you to this the Third Session of the Third Parliament of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Die verwikkelinge in die Midde-Ooste sowel as in die Verre-Ooste hou verreikende <span class="col_3-4" refersTo="page_0018"/>implikasies in vir die internasionale politieke situasie. Die wankelende vrede in die Midde-Ooste is vol gevaar en verskaf &#x2019;n guide geleentheid vir uitbuiting deur die Kommunistiese magte om hul invloed uit te brei, terwyl die verwikkelinge in die Verre-Ooste die moontlikhede van &#x2019;n gevaarlike uitbarsting inhou.</p>

<p>Die sluiting van die Suez-kanaal het weer eens die strategiese belangrikheid van die Kaapse seeroete beklemtoon. Die vermo&#x00EB; van die Suid-Afrikaanse hawens om die uitdaging te aanvaar en die geweldige vermeerdering in verkeer te hanteer, is verblydend.</p>

<p>Brittanje se besluit om homself van sy verdedigingsverantwoordelikhede in die gebied oos van Suez te onthef, kan &#x2019;n gevaarlike vaku&#x00FC;m in die Indiese Oseaan skep, en daarom is dit nog noodsaakliker as ooit tevore dat toereikende maatre&#x00EB;ls getref moet word vir die beskerming van skepe wat van die Kaapse roete gebruik maak.</p>

<p>Die jongste besluit van die Britse Regering waaruit afgelei kan word dat dit twyfelagtig is of Brittanje sy verpligtinge ten opsigte van Simonstad sal nakom, skep weer eens &#x2019;n nuwe situasie en dit mag vir ons noodsaaklik word om die aangeleentheid in heroorweging te neem, veral met die oog op toekomsbeplanning.</p>

<p>Die gebeure in die Midde-Ooste het opnuut aandag gevestig op die onvermo&#x00EB; van die Verenigde Volke om in gevalle van ernstige veiligheidskendings in verskeie dele van die w&#x00EA;reld doeltreffend op te tree.</p>

<p>Die Regering glo nog dat die Organisasie in sy werklike taak sal slaag siegs indien hy in alle erns tot sy grondbeginsels terugkeer; en dat alleen deur verdraagsaamheid aan die dag te l&#x00EA;, nasies in staat sal wees om soos goeie bure in vrede met mekaar te verkeer.</p>

<p>Ons verhoudings met ander lande is nog besig om te verbeter en uit te brei, en daar is aanduidings van &#x2019;n beter begrip van Suid-Afrika in die buiteland. Terwyl ons bure in Suider-Afrika &#x2019;n spesiale posisie beklee en besondere aandag geniet, het ons ook met &#x2019;n aantal ander lande waardevolle kontakte opgebou, veral op die gebied van ekonomiese en tegniese samewerking.</p>

<p>Suid-Afrika se beleid van vreedsame naasbestaan en vriendskaplike samewerking met, en tegniese bystand aan, Afrika-state, het reeds goeie vrugte afgewerp en &#x2019;n positiewe bydrae gelewer tot stabiliteit in Suider-Afrika. Met die verder afgele&#x00EB; Malawi is formele diplomatieke betrekkinge aangeknoop wat hopelik sal lei tot &#x2019;n verstewiging van die goeie verhoudinge wat alreeds tussen die Republiek en daardie staat bestaan. Die Regering bly onverminderd bereid tot vriendskaplike samewerking met alle Afrika-state wat daartoe gene&#x00EB; is op grondslag van wedersydse agting, erkenning van mekaar se soewereiniteit en nie-inmenging in ander se interne aangeleenthede.</p>

<p>Kommunistiese insypeling en ondermyning gaan ongelukkig onverpoos voort op die vasteland van Afrika en skep &#x2019;n potensi&#x00EB;le gevaar vir die binnelandse rus en veiligheid van Suider-Afrika. Groter waaksaamheid is dus gebiedend noodsaaklik.</p>

<p>Die Brits-Rhodesiese geskil wag steeds op &#x2019;n bevredigende oplossing. Dit bly die standpunt van die Regering dat &#x2019;n eerbare oplossing deur vreedsame onderhandelinge gevind moet en kan word. Die voortsleping van die geskil raak noodwendig alle gebiede in Suider-Afrika, en dit is van groot belang vir die stabiliteit en voortgesette ontwikkeling van Suider-Afrika dat hierdie geskil so gou moontlik uit die w&#x00E9;reld gemaak word. Daarom sal die Regering voortgaan om hom te beywer om &#x2019;n eerbare skikking van die vraagstuk moontlik te maak.</p>

<p>Wat Suidwes-Afrika betref, word die maatskaplike, politieke en ekonomiese vooruitgang ten opsigte van al die inwoners van daardie gebied gehandhaaf. Ondanks voortdurende aanvalle, veral in die Verenigde Volke, sal die Regering volhou om sy verantwoordelikhede in Suidwes-Afrika in die gees van die voormalige Mandaat na te kom. Hierin geniet hy die daadwerklike samewerking van verreweg die oorwegende meerderheid van die bevolking. Maatre&#x00EB;ls sal getref word om die Regering in staat te stel om verder voort te gaan met sy program van ontwikkeling. Sekere administratiewe herre&#x00EB;lings wat Suidwes-Afrika betref, sal so gou as prakties doenlik in werking gestel word. Hierdie herre&#x00EB;lings vorm deel van die voortdurende evolusieproses wat daarop gemik is om te voldoen aan die behoeftes van &#x2019;n ontwikkelende gemeenskap.</p>

<p>In teenstelling tot baie ander gebiede bly die toestand binne ons landsgrense rustig en vreedsaam, en pogings van buite om die kalmte deur terroriste te versteur het skromelik misluk. Hoewel die Regering steeds waaksaam bly, kan sommige spesiale maatre&#x00EB;ls in di&#x00E9; verband reeds verslap word.</p>

<p>Kragtens die beleid van die Regering dat hy terroristiese aanslae orals waar moontlik sal beveg, is Polisie-eenhede na Rhodesi&#x00EB; gestuur. Hierdie optrede, sowel as die Polisie se optrede in Ovamboland, het die gewenste uitwerking gehad.</p>

<p>Die stryd teen inflasie en die gepaard gaande styging van pryse het voortgeduur. Gedurende die eerste helfte van 1967 is hierdie stryd bemoeilik deur &#x2019;n uitbreiding van bankkrediet aan die private sektor en &#x2019;n toevloei van buitelandse kapitaal, maar in die jongste verlede het hierdie inflasionistiese faktore heelwat afgeneem en is daar bemoedigende tekens dat die inflasiedruk nou nie meer so sterk voorkom nie. Dit sou onverstandig wees om nou die verskillende maatre&#x00EB;ls teen inflasie te verslap. Die Regering sal die koers van die ekonomie in die komende maande egter noukeurig dophou.</p>

<p><span class="col_5-6" refersTo="page_0019"/>Een van die maatre&#x00EB;ls teen inflasie wat die afgelope maande &#x2019;n belangrike rol gespeel het, is die RSA-spaarveldtog. Die veldtog was tot dusver baie geslaag, en behoort wesenlik by te dra tot die bestryding van inflasie en die herstel van &#x2019;n stabiele groeitempo in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie.</p>

<p>Die besluit van die Regering om nie die voorbeeld van die Verenigde Koninkryk met betrekking tot devaluasie van sy geldeenheid te volg nie is moontlik gemaak deur die gesonde toestand waarin die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie tans verkeer en sal as 'n verdere positiewe faktor in ons strewe na ekonomiese stabiliteit dien.</p>

<p>In die huidige omstandighede is dit nie die Regering se beleid om buitelandse staatslenings op groot skaal aan te gaan nie. Re&#x00EB;lings is egter getref vir die hernuwing van sekere buitelandse krediete en vir die uitreiking van &#x2019;n beperkte staatslening op die Europese kapitaalmark.</p>

<p>Die Regering het &#x2019;n Kommissie benoem om ondersoek in te stel na die doeltreffendheid van die verskillende fiskale en monet&#x00EA;re maatre&#x00EB;ls wat aangewend kan word om die stabiliteit en groei van die ekonomie te verseker.</p>

<p>Ondanks die toepassing van verskerpte maatre&#x00EB;ls in die stryd teen inflasie, is die afgelope jaar weer eens gekenmerk deur volgehoue groei en vooruitgang in die handelsektor. Die algemene peil van handelsomsette was dan ook deurgaans ho&#x00EB;r as gedurende 1966.</p>

<p>Wat die buitelandse handelsektor betref, het die Republiek se uitvoere in 1967 aansienlik gestyg, veral vanwe&#x00EB; die ho&#x00EB; peil van die land se landbouen nywerheids-produksie.</p>

<p>Die Regering sal onvermoeid voortgaan met sy optrede om die Republiek se handelsbetrekkinge met ander lande en gebiede op &#x2019;n wedersyds voordelige grondslag verder uit te bou.</p>

<p>Diepgaande struktuurveranderinge in die internasionale handelsbetrekkinge wat veral vir die uitvoerhandel van die Republiek van belang is, word met die Britse en ander aansoeke om lidmaatskap van, of assosiasie met, die Europese Ekonomiese Gemeenskap in die vooruitsig gestel. Die Regering bestudeer hierdie verwikkelinge noukeurig ten einde die Republeik se handelsbelange te handhaaf, en het reeds die onderneming verkry dat Suid-Afrika in hierdie belangrike onderhandelings tussen die betrokke Europese moondhede deurlopend geraadpleeg sal word waar die Republiek se belange ter sprake kom. Terselfdertyd beywer die Regering hom om met meer lande handel te dryf en &#x2019;n groter verskeidenheid goedere uit te voer. Bemoedigende resultate is reeds in hierdie verband behaal.</p>

<p>Hoewel die klem die afgelope jaar op die verlangsaming van die ekonomiese groeitempo geval het, het daar nie stagnasie in die fabriekswese ingetree nie. Nywerheidsproduksie het trouens nog voortdurend opwaarts beweeg en die nywerheidstruktuur is verder verbreed deur ontwikkeling in verskeie nuwe rigtings. Dit is onvermydelik dat die Regering se maatre&#x00EB;ls tydelik ook op die fabriekswese &#x2019;n remmende invloed sal uitoefen, maar terselfdertyd het di&#x00E9; maatre&#x00EB;ls die heilsame uitwerking om hierdie sektor op &#x2019;n stewiger grondslag te plaas waaruit hy langtermynvoordele sal trek.</p>

<p>Die skerper buitelandse mededinging waaraan plaaslike nywerhede weens die verslapping van invoerbeheer blootgestel is, het geen noemenswaardige ontwrigting veroorsaak nie en dit is duidelik dat al hoe meer Suid-Afrikaanse fabrieke, wat die prys en gehalte van hul produkte betref, met die beste ter w&#x00EA;reld kan meeding. Der alwe kan die Republiek nou, beter as tevore, enige gebeurlikheid tegemoet gaan.</p>

<p>Die soektog na aardolie word met toenemende ywer voortgesit en ondersoeke na ander mineraalhulpbronne word ook bespoedig, veral deur middel van lugmagnetiese opnames wat reeds waardevolle inligting opgelewer het.</p>

<p>Die verhoogde opbrengs van onedele minerale en die groter mate van verwerking van mineraalprodukte in die Republiek sal aansienlik tot die land se ekonomiese stabiliteit bydra.</p>

<p>Verdere uitbreiding op die gebied van platina-ontginning kan met vertroue afgewag word, en dit is duidelik dat daar &#x2019;n toename in die vraag na uraan sal wees. Dit word voorsien dat navorsingswerk in Suid-Afrika verskeie verbeterings in die tegnologie van uraanwinning tot gevolg sal h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Die implikasies verbonde aan die aanwending van kernkrag in Suid-Afrika is ten volle ondersoek, en die resultate van hierdie ondersoeke sal in die nabye toekoms beskikbaar gestel word.</p>

<p>Weens die belangrike rol wat die wetenskap in ekonomiese vooruitgang speel en die steeds toenemende eise wat dit stel ten opsigte van opgeleide mannekrag en kapitaal, het die Regering besluit om op &#x2019;n nasionale grondslag deur middel van vier Nasionale Komitees ondersoek in te stel na die funksionering en onderlinge koordinering van die meer as dertig verskillende organisasies wat met navorsing en tegnologiese ontwikkeling te doen het.</p>

<p>Ons prestasies op die gebied van die geneeskunde, veeartsenykunde, kernkrag, landbou en talle ander wetenskaplike terreine is w&#x00EA;reldbekend, en sal verder gestimuleer word. Besonder vermeldingswaardig is die hartoperasies waarmee Suid-Afrika die leiding in die w&#x00EA;reld geneem het. Ons het ook presteer deur die navorsing wat gedoen is in verband met probleme wat ontstaan wanneer &#x2019;n landbouland tot &#x2019;n nywerheidsland ontwikkel, en die kennis wat opgedoen is blyk nou ook tot voordeel te wees vir ander <span class="col_7-8" refersTo="page_0020"/>ontwikkelende lande, waaronder verskeie van ons buurstate.</p>

<p>Ondanks die feit dat die Regering ten gevolge van die inflasionistiese toestande besluit het om die uitvoering van sekere groot projekte tydelik op te skort, word daar voortgegaan met die beplanning van die projekte sodat wanneer die tyd aanbreek, hulle onmiddellik aangepak en volgens plan voltooi kan word.</p>

<p>Die masjinerie vir die toepassing van die Wet op Fisiese Beplanning en Benutting van Hulpbronne, 1967, is reeds in werking gestel. Samewerking met die georganiseerde nywerheid is bewerkstellig en alles dui daarop dat hierdie maatre&#x00EB;l beter beplande en georganiseerde nywerheidsvestiging tot gevolg sal h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Die opvallende vermo&#x00EB; van die landbou om, na emstige terugslae, te herstel, is weer eens na die afgelope jarelange droogte bewys. Hierdie vermo&#x00EB; blyk uit die spoed waarmee daar oor die algemeen tot normale produksiepeile teruggekeer is. In sekere gevalle soos byvoorbeeld mielies, kafferkoring, grondbone en kaas, is selfs rekordopbrengste behaal.</p>

<p>Gedagtig aan die belang wat alle sektore van die gemeenskap het by die beskerming en uitbouing van ons landbouhulpbronne, is daar besluit om deur middel van die landswye veldtog, wat reeds aan die gang is en wat op Van Riebeeckdag sy hoogtepunt met die viering van die Fees van die Grond sal bereik, elke burger van sy plig in di&#x00E9; verband bewus te maak.</p>

<p>Die Kommissie van Ondersoek na die Landbou, wat in Mei 1966 deur die Regering benoem is, het reeds goed gevorder. Omdat droogte een van die inherente en belangrikste probleme van die Republiek is, het die Kommissie besluit om voorkeur te verleen aan daardie gedeelte van sy opdrag wat betrekking het op die heropbou van die landbou in gebiede wat erg onder droogtes gely het. Die Kommissie het sy ondersoek in di&#x00E9; verband reeds voltooi en is tans besig met die opstel van &#x2019;n tussentydse verslag.</p>

<p>Die beperkende finansi&#x00EB;le maatre&#x00EB;ls wat deur belangrike invoerlande gedurende die jongste tyd ingestel is, het &#x2019;n neerdrukkende uitwerking op w&#x00E9;reldpryse, veral van prim&#x00EA;re produkte. Met ons groter landbouuitvoere verlede jaar, het dit noodwendig ook &#x2019;n nadelige uitwerking op ons landboubedryf. Gelukkig lewer die steeds stygende binnelandse vraag na landbouvoedselprodukte &#x2019;n groot bydrae tot die stabilisering van die landboubedryf.</p>

<p>Op dieselfde wyse as ander staatsorganisasies het die Departement van Waterwese gedurende 1967 daadwerklike stappe gedoen om inflasie te bestry deur uitgawes aan nuwe watervoorsieningsondernemings, waar ook al moontlik, tot dringend noodsaaklike projekte te beperk, wat net ten opsigte van die-Oranjerivierprojek &#x2019;n besnoeiing van sowat R50 miljoen tot Junie 1973 meebring.</p>

<p>Hoewel die milde re&#x00EB;ns dwarsdeur die Republiek gedurende die somer van 1966-67 tot die verligting van feitlik alle onmiddellike watertekorte gelei het, is daar nietemin nog sekere gebiede en ondernemings waarvan die toekomstige behoeftes aan bykomende water sodanig is dat dit die vroe&#x00EB; konstruksie van groot opgaarondernemings vereis, indien ernstige krisisse weens watertekorte in die nabye toekoms uitgeskakel moet word. Die gebiede wat besondere besorgdheid wek en aandag geniet is die Vaalrivierbekken en Kaapstad en sy omgewing, asook die Bloemfonteinse kompleks. Die Elektrisiteitsvoorsieningskommissie is verplig om die bou van drie nuwe kragstasies met &#x2019;n gesamentlike opwekkingsvermo&#x00EB; van sowat 6,000 megawatt te onderneem by Camden, Hendrina en Arnot in Oos-Transvaal ten einde aan die Republiek se steeds toenemende vraag na elektrisiteitsvoorsiening te voldoen. Om te voorsien in die verwagte waterbehoeftes van hierdie drie kragstasies wat tans in aanbou is, sal dit nodig wees om die bou van die goedgekeurde Kafferskraaldam in die Komatirivier voort te sit, ondanks die noodsaaklikheid om kapitaalbesteding te beperk.</p>

<p>Soos algemeen verwag is, het die stigting van die Departement van Landboukrediet en Grondbesit in 1966 en die inwerkingtreding van die Wet op Landboukrediet, 1966, in &#x2019;n groot behoefte voorsien.</p>

<p>Aanvullende wetgewing tydens hierdie sessie word beoog waardeur kredietverskaffing deur die Staat moontlik gemaak sal word ter uitvoering van grondbewaringsmaatre&#x00EB;ls en waterhulpbronneontwikkeling ook aan privaatmaatskappye, wat hulle uitsluitlik op boerdery toel&#x00EA; en wat tot dusver nie daarvoor gekwalifiseer het nie.</p>

<p>In order to improve the quality of locally grown soft-wood timber which is used for constructional purposes, grading specifications will be prescribed with effect from the 1st July, 1968, and all structural timber will have to comply with these specifications. A bill to amend and consolidate the Forest Act, 1941, will be introduced.</p>

<p>The Department of Bantu Administration and Development will continue to activate Bantu Authorities to greater self-development, an important component of which is economic development. Great enthusiasm has been encountered amongst all the different Bantu national units for greater self-activity in matters pertaining to their own government. Significant innovations and reorganization will be introduced during this year, and appropriate steps are being taken to utilize all the knowledge and information already at the disposal of the Government.</p>

<p>In South West Africa and the Eastern Caprivi, considerable progress has lately been made in regard to the development <span class="col_9-10" refersTo="page_0021"/>of Bantu homelands. Provision is being made for roads, new townships, conservation of water supplies, expansion of health and other services, which are essential prerequisites for the comprehensive development programme which is now being carried out.</p>

<p>These matters are all vital for the self-realization of each nation and for development in the field of government. With thus in mind the government has suggested further stages of development to the different Bantu peoples of South West Africa. Some have already accepted the suggestions and your approval of legislation which will authorize the establishment of governing authorities and services for them, will be requested during this Session.</p>

<p>With the granting to the various Bantu Authorities of a greater measure of self-rule, it is also proposed to entrust them with increased responsibility for educational matters in their own homelands. This will entail the reorganization of the Department of Bantu Education in such a way that the various Bantu Authorities may gradually and with white assistance, assume these responsibilities. The Department will, however, continue to carry full responsibility for Bantu Education in white areas.</p>

<p>It is expected that the election of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, for which provision was already made in 1964 with the passing of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, will be held during 1969. The establishment of this Council is considered a most important political event in the development of the Coloured people. Then for the first time in our history the Coloured people of the whole Republic of South Africa will be granted political rights on a representative basis. The Council will advise the Government on all matters concerning the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured people of the Republic and will generally serve as a link between the government and the Coloured community. Apart from advisory functions, the Executive Committee of the Council will be granted administrative powers in respect of matters such as education, social welfare, pensions, the administration of rural areas and settlements for Coloureds. Most of the activities of the existing Department of Coloured Affairs in respect of those matters will be handed over to the Council, which will be provided with its own administrative machinery.</p>

<p>Initially the activities in connection with local authorities, in so far as Coloureds are concerned, will remain the function of the provincial authorities but with a view to preparing for the takeover the Council will assist, in an advisory capacity, with matters relating to Coloured residential areas.</p>

<p>White public servants on loan will initially assist the Council with its administration, but as and when sufficient and experienced Coloured officials have been trained, the administrative machine of the Council will be staffed by Coloureds. This will afford them the opportunity to progress to the highest posts in the Public Service.</p>

<p>As the policy of separate development for Indians is being implemented, the Department of Indian Affairs is receiving more active support from Indian leaders who previously had either taken no active part in public affairs or dissociated themselves from the South African Indian Council. When the Council was established in 1964, it was given only consultative functions and consisted of 21 appointed members, but its development and success have been so rapid that the necessary legislation will be introduced during this Session to reconstitute the Council into a statutory body with at least 25 members.</p>

<p>The political development of the Indians, initiated in the field of local government, has during the past year reached the stage where the town of Verulam will later this year become the first local authority to be administered by an all-Indian elected town council.</p>

<p>In education there has been marked and overt support by Indian educationists for the Department&#x2019;s educational policies. Steps will be taken this year to establish an Indian Education Advisory Council as provided for in the Indians Education Act of 1965.</p>

<p>The need for advanced technical education for Indians has been recognized and legislation to have the M. L. Sultan Technical College in Durban declared a college for advanced technical education will be introduced this Session.</p>

<p>The continued industrial expansion has afforded employment opportunities to all categories of work-seekers and the Republic is still enjoying a state of full employment. The optimum utilization of available manpower enjoys the constant attention of the Department of Labour. This Department devotes special attention to the vocational guidance of juveniles, and the employment of the handicapped and vocationally maladjusted.</p>

<p>In so far as relations between employers and employees are concerned, a spirit of co-operation and goodwill prevailed and no serious industrial unrest or disputes occurred during the past year. The disputes in the gold-mining industry which arose from domestic difficulties within the Mine Workers Union have been settled and the discontent which prevailed appears now for the greater part to have been dispelled.</p>

<p>Although reliable information indicates that the housing backlog is not nearly as serious as has been contended in various quarters, it is true that a backlog does exist, but not so as to cause alarm. With State funds as much housing as possible is provided <span class="col_11-12" refersTo="page_0022"/>for the middle and lower income groups, and the provision of housing by private enterprise is also encouraged in various ways. Statistics snow that approved building plans in respect of dwelling units in the larger cities are fortunately again on the increase. The continued application of building control has the effect of canalizing capital and building activity to housing.</p>

<p>Special attention is being given to urban renewal and a large number of depressed areas has already been listed for rejuvenation. The time is fast approaching when considerable capital expenditure will be required for the acquisition of properties, the systematic removal of slum conditions, and subsequent renewal.</p>

<p>The resettlement of population groups in appropriate group areas, and with a view to slum clearance, is progressing as speedily as the country&#x2019;s economy can bear. Very good co-operation from local authorities is being experienced.</p>

<p>The Government is at present considering positive steps further to promote the construction of dwellings and has arranged for inquiries to be instituted in regard to, firstly, the purchase of undeveloped land, as a continuous process, by the State as well as local authorities, in the neighbourhood of the larger metropolitan areas; and secondly, the financial measures which would be conducive to the housing of the middle and lower income groups.</p>

<p>Despite great progress in the modernization of the postal and telecommunication services of our country, the necessity of restrictions on capital has led to the accumulation of a considerable backlog in the past few years. Owing to the increased direct contribution by the public, it was possible to plan for more generous provision which will considerably reduce the backlog. As a result of the investigation into new financial arrangements for our postal services, steps are now envisaged for the management of these services on business principles, which will lead to a substantial improvement in the facilities and efficiency of the Post Office.</p>

<p>Our radio service, which was expanded during the past number of years to serve our country&#x2019;s various population groups in their own languages, continues to make a substantial contribution towards the promotion of mutual goodwill and peaceful co-existence between the groups. Powerful transmitters now also carry the voice of South Africa to other parts of the world and indications are continually received of growing understanding there of our country and its peoples. Steps are also now being taken to provide a radio service in their own languages to the non-white peoples in the more densely populated parts of South West Africa.</p>

<p>In the field of public health, efforts to protect the public against and to cure them of infectious and contagious diseases are being conscientiously pursued in all areas. The greatest single problem is still the disturbing incidence of tuberculosis amongst great sections of the population. However, research into techniques for the more effective prevention and more rapid cure of this disease shows encouraging signs, and steps are being taken to promote it in the most effective manner.</p>

<p>The Department of Social Welfare and Pensions will devote more attention to the problem of aged persons in terms of the Aged Persons Act, 1967.</p>

<p>This will promote additional planning to ensure a properly co-ordinated and progressive national policy for the care of the aged.</p>

<p>In the meantime, attention is being devoted also to many other problems affecting the modern South African family. As a result of representations for the improvement of Government pension schemes, it has been decided to appoint an interdepartmental committee of inquiry to investigate the adequacy of the existing pension schemes in the light of modern requirements.</p>

<p>As it is necessary that we should have our own legislation providing for prize courts to deal with enemy property captured in times of war, the required measures will be submitted to you.</p>

<p>During the past year the Government continued normally with its policy of selective and balanced immigration. The results were gratifying, in spite of the fact that the flow of immigrants from African territories is diminishing.</p>

<p>During the past year the Hotel Board made good progress with the registration, grading and grouping of accommodation establishments and it is expected that the rate of applications for registration will now increase considerably. Progress was also made with schemes for the training of persons in the hotel industry, as well as the general improvement of the service and standards in the hotel industry of the Republic.</p>

<p>The growth in tourism to the Republic is continuing and it is trusted that more and more tourists will visit South Africa in future.</p>

<p>1967 was a golden year for sport in South Africa, not only for the teams representing the Republic in international sport, but also as far as the performances of some of our individual representatives were concerned.

<p><i>Late Dr. The Hon. T. E. D&#x00F6;nges</i></p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move, as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, deeply conscious of the great loss sustained by South Africa on 10th January, 1968. through the death of Dr. the Hon. Theophilus Ebenhaezer D&#x00F6;nges, formerly State President-elect of the Republic of South Africa, places on record its sincere appreciation of the invaluable services so selflessly rendered by him to his country and its people, in particular as a member of this House for an uninterrupted period of almost 26 years, and as a Cabinet Minister from 1948 to 1967.</block>

<block name="quote">This House expresses its profound sorrow at the loss of an outstanding statesman whose memory is held in affection and admiration not only by the Members of this House but also by the people of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<block name="quote">This House further resolves that an expression of its heartfelt sympathy be conveyed to Mrs. D&#x00F6;nges and members of the family in their sad bereavement.</block>

<p>We have all, on various occasions outside this House, already had the opportunity of paying tribute to our deceased ex-colleague and State President-elect. The particularly tragic circumstances which, after eight months, led to his death, are known to us all. In the tributes which have already been paid to his abilities and talents, mention has rightly been made of the roles which he played in society as a churchman, man of culture, sportsman, university man, lawyer and statesman. Not only did we pay tribute to him for what he had accomplished and achieved in these various fields, but we also, as was fitting, conveyed our sincere condolences to his wife and children.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances little remains for me to say on this occasion to-day that has not already been said by myself, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and others. But from what has already been said it is very clear that the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges was a versatile man, a man of wide interests, and a man of great talent. Nevertheless I should like on this occasion to say a few words about the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges and the role he played as a parliamentarian and, in so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, as a loyal party man, and to pay our tribute to him in this respect. I think we all agree wholeheartedly that we had in him a person who gave loyal service to this Parliament. One likes to think of him as one of the great parliamentarians who have entered these precincts. The fact that he was an eloquent and polished orator remains fresh in our memories. He displayed a subtle sense of humour, and although he was able to state his case and participated in the discussions of this House with very great firmness, he always combined this with the greatest degree of courtesy, no matter how heated the struggle or contentious the subject under discussion might have been. After having said all these things one is convinced that here we had a man who was a parliamentarian in the true sense of the word. With the characteristic thoroughness which marked his actions in this House, he was most certainly an example to many of us. In addition it struck one that he was a person who was very much at home in both our official languages. The high regard he had for our two official languages was most certainly an example to us all.</p>

<p>I think I am speaking for all of us when I say that at all times he conducted himself in this House in accordance with the best traditions of the House. That being so, we are convinced that it was to the benefit of Parliament as an institution to have had the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges as one of its members.</p>

<p>Once again I should like to express our heartfelt sympathy with his wife and children in their great loss, a loss to South Africa and to Parliament as well.</p>

<p>On behalf of members on this side of the House I should like to associate myself with the words that have fallen from the lips of the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of the late Dr. D&#x00F6;nges. There is one thing which the hon. the Prime Minister said which I should in particular like to emphasize and that is the feeling of sympathy we all have for his wife and family not only in their great loss but also for the anguish they must have suffered during those long months of his illness.</p>

<p>I too feel that it is fitting that Parliament should pay a tribute to-day to a man who was a great parliamentarian. The hon. the Prime Minister spoke of him as a friend and as a loyal party man. We speak of him as a worthy opponent and as a master craftsman in this House. He was always master of his brief and <span class="col_15-16" refersTo="page_0024"/>he could always put it with just that little stamp, which was his own character glimmering through. He did his work efficiently. He was never personal. He was a fine administrator and a model debater. For Parliament as an institution he had a real feeling.</p>

<p>He filled many roles in this House. As a matter of fact, I believe there is no post in this House which he could not have filled. It was my privilege to know him outside Parliament many years before he came here. I knew him as a distinguished lawyer and as a man who in so many respects was highly civilized. He was widely read and had a tremendous knowledge of the classics and a prodigious memory. He was known for his charm and for his politeness.</p>

<p>But I think there is one characteristic for which I shall always remember him and that is the enthusiasm with which he tackled everything he did&#x2014;whether his work in politics, whether as a lawyer, a university man, a church man in the church to which I too belong, as a sportsman and as a student. One of his outstanding characteristics was his enthusiasm, his real zest for living. It is a great tragedy that one with that zest should have had his time with us terminated in this way. But this proves once again that man proposes and God disposes.</p>

<p>I second the motion of condolence proposed by the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I would like to associate ourselves with the motion before the House and with the eloquent tributes that have been paid to our late State President-elect by the previous speakers. We have to mourn to-day yet another gap in our ranks, which is not the less felt because he who filled it was no longer a member of this House. We remember to-day with gratitude that Dr. D&#x00F6;nges was a distinguished member of this House for over a quarter-century, and he only relinquished his position in this House in order to accept the highest honour that our country could bestow upon any of her illustrious sons. It was the will of Providence, however, that he should not be spared to occupy this exalted position.</p>

<p>Although Dr. D&#x00F6;nges was possessed of a lofty ambition, which fate intervened to deny him, our lamented friend was in himself a humble man, and I feel he would have been the first to condemn any formal oratory or any pompous panegyric on his virtues. Nevertheless, it is fitting that we should to-day recall the profound impression which he has made upon our public life. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges&#x2019; name will always be imperishably associated with most of our public functions in this country, for throughout these many years he was in the very forefront of our parliamentary life. All hon. members of this House will, I am sure, agree with me when I say that he has won for himself a place of singular distinction in the history of our Republic.</p>

<p>It is sad indeed that he was deprived of the culminating honour which his devotion to the public service of this country merited. Our thoughts at this time naturally turn to his beloved ones whom he has left behind, to his loyal wife and to his children, and it is our fervent prayer that the Almighty may sustain them in this sad period of affliction. We all appreciate that condolences are but poor consolation for the loss of one&#x2019;s dear ones, but it is our sincere conviction that into the dark corners of their bereaved homes will flow the light of the consolation that their beloved one has left an honoured name lastingly and firmly entrenched in the hearts of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move, as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 6th December, 1967, of Mr. Gideon Jacobus Knobel, who represented the electoral division of Bethlehem, and desires to place on record its appreciation of his parliamentary service which extended over a period of almost 16 years.</block>

<block name="quote">This House further resolves that its sincere sympathy be conveyed to the relatives of the deceased in their bereavement.</block>

<p>Every year when we prorogue and go our separate ways, the question that involuntarily occurs to each of us is whether we shall all meet here again in the next year or whether we shall not perhaps, during the recess, suffer the tragic loss of one of our colleagues. I do not think that the possibility had occurred to any of us that our colleague Gideon Knobel would come to such a tragic end during the recess. For 16 years he was well known to all of us. He was a person who had a great zest for living. He was a person Who carried his years very well. He took pleasure in participating in the proceedings of Parliament and the life connected with Parliament. His tragic death as a result of a motor accident was a profound shock to all of us. He was&#x2014;and that is how we knew him&#x2014;a farmer to the core, and I think the main characteristic he displayed was his deep love of the soil. He did not only make his living from the soil, but also dedicated his life to it. Consequently it was to be expected that he would participate very enthusiastically, as indeed he did, in the discussions in this House on agricultural and other matters. We shall remember him for that in particular, although it is of course a fact that his interest was not confined to agricultural <span class="col_17-18" refersTo="page_0025"/>matters alone, but that he displayed great interest in health matters as well as matters relating to transport, communications and other business of this House.</p>

<p>We knew him as a person who did his very best to promote those causes in which he believed, and he advocated them with great emphasis in this House. He was a person who was very loyal to his constituency and the people he represented here. At all times he promoted their interests to the best of his ability. One recalls that this tragic accident which led to his death occurred while he was on his way to deal with the affairs of his constituency and his voters. Not only was he a good member of this House, but he also served his church and his community very faithfully and to the best of his ability. He was therefore a respected member of this Parliament, a valuable member to his party, and an asset to the area in which he lived.</p>

<p>We wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and children, and may God bestow on them His richest blessings and mercy in the difficult time that lies ahead for them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of those on this side of the House I should like to associate myself with the words of sympathy that have fallen from the lips of the hon. the Prime Minister, and the words of appreciation in respect of Mr. Gideon Jacobus Knobel. He was, I believe, a self-made man. He had built up from small beginnings, but unlike many who were made on that pattern, he was always polite, always friendly, always approachable, and acquired many friends on both sides of the House. He was always reasonable, always ready to see the other man&#x2019;s point of view. He was always ready to put his own case strongly, but always appreciative of the manner in which another man could put his. It was quite clear that, whatever his interests, agriculture was his first love. To that he devoted himself, and there is no doubt that he will be a big loss both to his constituency and to the farming community. I second the motion.</p>
