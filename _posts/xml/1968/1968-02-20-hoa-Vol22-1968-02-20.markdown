<li>(d) Owing to the favourable climatic conditions early in the season and the consequent increased milk production by fresh milk&#x2014;as well as industrial milk producers it was possible for the industrial factories to process all the milk offered.

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) To obtain the required information, will entail the individual scrutiny of thousands of files since 1943, and it is regretted that my Department is not in a position to undertake such a task at the present moment.</li>

<li>(b) As at 31st December, 1967, the total unclaimed moneys since 1943, including old cases under the previous Act, amounted to R1,365,131, which represents less than 1 per cent of the total compensation awarded over the same period.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) Separate statistics are not kept in respect of the various race groups.</li>

<li>(3) In the case of Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics letters are transmitted to the workman&#x2019;s last known address. In so far as Bantu workmen are concerned, Bantu Affairs Commissioners assist in the first instance. Thereafter untraced cases are referred to the Bantu Reference Bureau of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for the latest information on the workman&#x2019;s whereabouts which is then followed up by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation office. Details of unclaimed benefits are also published regularly in the Government Gazette.</li>

<li><p>(4) All possible avenues of practical value have been explored. In the case of Bantu workmen an arrangement was introduced in 1967 whereby advances are made to the workers by the larger employers in respect of temporary total disablement. Reimbursements are then made directly by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner to the employers. Arrangements have also been made in respect of awards for permanent disablement, or in the case of fatal accidents, for the payment of such benefits by cheque to the workmen concerned or their dependants through Bantu Affairs Commissioners.</p>

<p>Before an amount is transferred to the unclaimed benefit account, the Commissioner transmits inquiries to all possible addresses at his disposal. Should this be unsuccessful, the South African Police, in whose area the accident occurred, are requested to assist in tracing the workman concerned.</p></li>

<question by="#marais">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<p>Whether consideration has been given to extending the train service between Soweto and Johannesburg in order to cope with the growing number of urban Bantu commuters; if so, with what result; if not, why not.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<heading><span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0441"/>Reply:</heading>

<p>Yes; in order to cope with the increasing number of non-white passengers, provision has been made for one additional set of coaches to be placed in service during 1968 and four in 1969, while provision will be made in the Budget for 1968-&#x2019;69 for a further four eleven-coach sets.</p>

<p>The train service is continually being extended to meet the demand. For example, the number of trains being operated in one direction on weekdays from Soweto to Johannesburg was increased from 109 in January, 1956, to 164 in January, 1961, and to 211 in January, 1968.</p>

<p>A special sub-committee of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Transport of non-Whites, which is responsible for transport for the resettlement areas, is at present investigating the future transport pattern and the carrying capacity of the sections of line concerned.</p>

<question by="#marais">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he has taken any steps to ensure that a larger proportion of gem quality diamonds mined in South Africa and South West Africa will be processed locally; if so, what steps;</li>

<li>(2) whether consideration has been given to selling the entire production of diamonds from South Africa and South West Africa to local and overseas buyers in South Africa; if so, with what results.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_mines">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) As the hon. member is aware, the local diamond cutting industry is largely dependent on the cutting of diamonds which are in excess of one carat in weight, and steps have been taken to ensure that the entire South African production of locally cuttable gem diamonds (i.e. in excess of one carat) which are marketed through the Diamond Producers&#x2019; Association, is being made available to the South African cutters. These supplies are being augmented by a limited quantity of stones of a special quality from South West Africa.</li>

<li>(2) The main producers of diamonds in South Africa and South West Africa are bound by contract to market their production through the Diamond Producers&#x2019; Association which, in turn, has contracted to dispose of its stocks through certain channels. These arrangements cannot be altered while the contracts in question are in force.</li>

<li><p>(b) The following relief measures have been planned:</p>

<p>Westville: A cable construction work will be undertaken during the 1968-&#x2019;69 financial year to meet the majority of the waiting applicants. Because of the extent of the work, a completion date cannot be furnished at this stage. Interim arrangements have been made to augment the existing cable in the industrial area of New Germany. This will enable the Department to dispose of approximately 100 business applications within the next three months.</p>

<p>Pinetown: The exchange is being extended by 1,200 lines. Completion of the work is expected towards September this year. It is also proposed to replace the existing exchange, but this project is dependent upon the erection of a new exchange building. The planning of the new post office and exchange building has reached an advanced stage and it is expected that tenders for the building work will be invited during the second half of this year.</p>

<p>Kloof: Two hundred indicator numbers will be installed within the next two months. This will enable the Department to provide telephones for most of the waiting applicants.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>To the relief perhaps of the hon. the Minister of Finance I do not propose to use this opportunity in order to reply to some of his rather fatuous remarks made in his reply to the Second-Reading debate. Instead I should like to direct attention to two matters, matters which I feel should now be raised because there will in all probability be no other opportunity for raising them before the Budget debate. These matters are veiled in some uncertainty at the moment and I feel this uncertainty should be resolved.</p>

<p>The first of these matters is the Simonstown Agreement, the second the position of Coloured representation in Parliament now that the Commission which was appointed to go into the matter has tabled its report. In regard to the Simonstown Agreement, it is common cause that that agreement exists firstly because of historical reasons and, secondly, because of the strategic importance of Simonstown as a naval base. I believe that up to a certain point this agreement worked well, even after the Security Council&#x2019;s resolution banning the sale of arms to South Africa. It worked well because, <i>inter alia,</i> of a formula devised by the British government of the day enabling them to make available to us sources of arms which we thought were necessary. A former British Prime Minister, Sir Alex Douglas Home, is on record as having said that as far as he knew no government had ever complained to Britain about its interpretation of that agreement. So the years have rolled by and in the meantime Simonstown has become of overwhelming importance to the Western world, particularly as a result of the British withdrawal east of Suez and the closing of the Suez Canal. In fact, in recent months we have seen developments which have accentuated the importance of this base beyond all measure, perhaps beyond what anyone imagined might be the case even a few years ago.</p>

<p>We see a build up at the present time of Russian military and naval strength in the Mediterranean, a build up quite obviously designed to facilitate Russian military presence in the Indian ocean by means of domination in the Middle East. Of course, one realizes that that would mean domination of the Dardanelles as well as of the Suez Canal. It is worth noticing in this connection that Aden has already been offered to Russia as a base after the British evacuation. We have also heard of the plans announced by the British Prime Minister to withdraw east of Suez for all practical purposes by the end of 1971, thereby leaving a power vacuum in the Indian ocean. Of course, France has bases in Malagasy and French Somaliland but it is common cause I think that French policy is somewhat ambivalent&#x2014;one can never be certain in what direction it will be going. Recent history shows how small countries tend to succumb to communist pressure where such countries are not bolstered up by the possibility of military support from the West.</p>

<p>I think we might have regard to two other matters. The one is what the objectives of Communist China at the present moment may be. Clearly India would be an added liability <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0450"/>to her. Her moves must therefore be in a south-easterly and south-westerly direction&#x2014; possibly Australia, Indonesia and New Guinea may be her immediate objectives. In a southwesterly direction the east coast of Africa is an obvious objective, one in which she already seems to have gained a foothold. The other matter to which I think we should give attention is the fact that although the Vietnam war, a war in which the United States of America is so heavily involved, may be waging on another continent, it is only across an ocean from us, an ocean which at the moment seems to be unprotected by any superior naval force. We are faced with the problem that in Canberra as well as in Washington alarm has been expressed at Britain&#x2019;s withdrawal from the Indian Ocean. The Australians have made it clear that their financial ability to take over Britain&#x2019;s role is limited while the Americans have made it clear that they are very heavily committed already at the present time. And yet it is the position that of all the ships in the Indian Ocean, of those diverted from Suez, probably 40 per cent sail under the British flag.</p>

<p>There are possibly at any one time in the Indian Ocean at the present time 800 ships flying the British flag. We know that Great Britain has certain treaty commitments. She speaks of plans for flying assistance out to those countries with which she has commitments. That means overflying rights over countries which may not always grant her those rights. It also means bulk maintenance to be shipped round the Cape, accentuating once again the importance of Simonstown.</p>

<p>We all know that the Simonstown Agreement was a gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement and that there could be different interpretations on how it should be implemented. We saw that at the time of the Buccaneer contract and the difficulties it involved. We also know that there were conversations last year when there were representatives of the British government out here. However, we did not raise the matter at the time because of the delicacy of the situation. Since then there have been statements by the hon. the Minister of Defence, by the Prime Minister and by the Acting State President in the speech opening the present session of Parliament, statements indicating that the agreement might have to be reviewed in the light of the changed attitude of the British government, especially in respect of future planning. Imagine, therefore, our puzzlement at a statement by the British Prime Minister on 6th February, that he had not received any communication from the Prime Minister of South Africa about the future use by the Royal Navy of the naval base at Simonstown, that he attached importance to the agreement and regarded it as being in force. Sir, this seems an extraordinary state of affairs. We are considering reviewing the agreement, but the British Prime Minister tells us he has had no communication from our Prime Minister in this regard. It seems to me this is no way to conduct diplomatic negotiations. Is it possible that no use was made of the accepted diplomatic channels, and that we are conducting delicate discussions by means of public statements&#x003F; I think we are entitled to know where we are at the moment, and I think the public has the right to know.</p>

<p>I think three things seem clear. The first is that the strategic importance of the Simonstown base is probably greater than it has ever been for the Western world. The second is that in view of Britain&#x2019;s withdrawal east of Suez, her continuing treaty commitments and the necessity of protecting her own shipping, especially in the Indian Ocean, the facilities provided by the Simonstown Agreement are of even greater importance than they were in the past. I think the third thing is that in spite of all this, the present British Government, although under pressure from the official Opposition in Britain and from some of its own people, is not making available to us as readily as in the past arms vital to the defence of this route and for our own defence against aggression. I want to say straight away that to me the attitude of the present British Government is inexplicable and indefensible. I think it is causing bitter feelings amongst many people who are anxious to be Britain&#x2019;s friends. Surely they must appreciate the threat to their own oil supplies in the Persian Gulf, and surely they must appreciate that South Africa is a primary objective of the communist offensive in the eastern half of the world. There are critical factors which it is difficult for us to evaluate. There is possibly the economic preoccupation of Britain and the United States, and possibly the nearness of the presidential election in the United States, and possibly the uncertainty over France&#x2019;s attitude, and possibly the refusal by the present British Prime Minister to discern the interrelation between economic and strategic problems. I take that no further, but I want to say what our attitude should be at present.</p>

<p>When one asks what our attitude should be, that raises two points. The first is how effective was this agreement negotiated by the Government through the late Mr. Erasmus. The second is whether alternative steps should not have been taken to safeguard our needs and to ensure the safety of the base and of the route round the Cape. I do not propose to expand on those, except to ask whether there is some flaw in this agreement, or is it just a difference in interpretation by different British Governments&#x003F;</p>

<p>Unfortunately that is not entirely the answer. After 1961, when the late Prime Minister withdrew from the Commonwealth, he indicated privately&#x2014;it has now become public&#x2014;that he stood by his promise to maintain that agreement. He must have felt it was important to make a statement of that kind. Then it must <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0451"/>have been obvious for some time that things were not going entirely in the direction we had hoped. Have we been shopping elsewhere to ensure our supplies&#x003F; Have we been looking to other friends, and have we perhaps other treaty commitments to ensure the safety of this route and of our own naval base&#x003F; Sir, seeking alternative sources of supply has complications for us and also for Britain. There is a lot we can manufacture ourselves. Quite clearly this agreement has certain advantages for us in peace-time, and certainly potentially in war-time. If we were involved with the Communist world we could naturally expect to get the fullest support possible. What should our attitude be now&#x003F; It seems to me that the right attitude would be not to move in the direction of hasty reviews or hasty abrogations, but to use all our persuasive powers to influence the present and future British Governments to honour this agreement not only in the letter but in the spirit. As the hon. the Prime Minister said, it is a gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement. I believe that in this matter right is on on our side. I believe time is on our side. I believe that we have to keep perservering, but at the same time we have to protect our rear. I put the situation as we on this side of the House see it. I think the time has come for the Government to take the public into its confidence in regard to this matter. That is the first matter I wanted to raise.</p>

<p>The second matter, which we shall not have an opportunity of discussing until the debates following the introduction of the Budget, as things stand at the moment, is the future of Coloured representation in this House in the light of the report tabled on Friday of the recent Commission of Inquiry appointed as the result of an agreement between the hon. the Prime Minister and myself. Here may I say that when that Select Committee was appointed and converted into a commission, I had high hopes of a new approach and a more realistic solution of this problem with which we have been faced for so long. I may say that having been through this report&#x2014;I have not read it as thoroughly yet as I would have liked&#x2014;I am bitterly disappointed with the majority report which is now before this House. There is no new thinking. The whole philosophy seems to be that if a thing is difficult to carry out and if it is difficult to get it to work, then it must be abolished and replaced by something else. But all is not yet lost. Despite the statements made by the hon. the Prime Minister in the past, we have as yet had no statement from him on this report, and therefore I take the opportunity of raising this matter to-day because it must be well known to everybody that the Prime Minister need not accept this report, either in principle or in detail. I think it is right that I should draw to his attention the fact that it is the opinion not only of this side of the House but I believe of large sections of the public of South Africa that he would be well advised not to accept this report. He would be well advised, in the first place, because the recommendation for the abolition of the representation of the Coloured people in this House and the Upper House is a recommendation which is contrary to the weight of evidence submitted to that Commission. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is not one single representative coloured organization of any standing which favoured the abolition of the representation of their people in this House.</p>

<p>I know of no coloured organization of any standing which favours it. We may disagree as to which organizations have standing, and possibly in that regard I will be a better witness than the hon. member. I go so far as to say that the overwhelming volume of evidence is that the coloured people bitterly resent being deprived of representation in the sovereign Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. I notice, on going through this evidence, that even Mr. Tom Swartz, the president of the Federale Kleurling-volksparty, whose origin has been a matter of great interest to us on this side of the House, gave evidence that support for this proposal would mean disaster for his party. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I might as well disband my party. I would not stand a chance at the election.</block>

<p>That is, if representation of the Coloured people were supported by his organization. I go further. I think the hon. the Prime Minister should bear in mind also that the late Dr. Verwoerd made it clear that he stood for the retention of the representation of coloured people in this House. Here is a record of his interview with Allen Drury, in his most recent book, &#x201C;A Very Strange Society&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will the four white representatives of the Coloureds remain in Parliament&#x003F; Of course they will, but we want to be sure that they will not be used by other political parties to advance the ambitions of those parties. The Coloured Representatives in Parliament must really reflect what the coloured people are thinking. &#x201C;Some people fear you will abolish them altogether&#x003F;&#x201D; A quick smile, a dismissing expression: &#x201C;Oh well, that is just politics.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, I think that is as firm an assurance as you can wish to have. But I think there is a second reason. Look at the blue print with which the Prime Minister will be left if he abolishes the representation of coloured people in this House. He will be left with no Colouredstan, no separate area for the coloured people where there can be a so-called coloured state no independence <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0452"/>for the coloured people, the most advanced non-White group in the Republic, no say for them in this Parliament, the one body that really controls their destinies and in which they have been represented since Union, over 58 years ago, and for some 50 years before that. For over a 100 years they have had representation in the Parliament that controls their destinities.</p>

<p>What are you giving them in return&#x003F; You are giving them R50 million a year to dispose of through a Coloured Representative Council which will have very limited powers. I do not know whether the hon. the Prime Minister is going to accept the recommendation that it should have powers of taxation. There will always be matters in which they will have no say at all, matters which essentially affect the well-being of both the Coloured people and the Whites.</p>

<p>Sir, I go further. There are recommendations from this commission in respect of improper interference. This is a matter which the hon. the Prime Minister and I have discussed before, but in the whole of the discussions before the commission it seemed that there was no practical or acceptable definition of &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D; not already covered by the electoral laws. Because they could not define &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D; what is the recommendation of the majority&#x003F; The recommendation of the majority is: &#x201C;That all participation and assistance by one group in the political affairs of another should be banned.&#x201D; Surely, Sir, that is utterly unrealistic and utterly impracticable. If this is going to be the central Parliament that is going to decide the future and the well-being of all the groups concerned, it is inconceivable to me that a group with the history and the background of the Cape Coloured people should be the subject of a report that proposes that they be treated in this way.

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the Opposition raised a very important issue in regard to which I should like to make a statement and, in making this statement, I hope to reply to most of the points he made about Simonstown. I think the time is ripe to give a proper picture of the Simonstown Agreement as such, because most people are under the impression that the Simonstown Agreement only deals with a specific naval base. What is generally referred to as the &#x201C;Simonstown Agreement&#x201D; actually embodies several closely inter-related agreements.</p>

<p>Firstly, we have an agreement relating to the transfer of the Simonstown Naval Base. This part of the Agreement refers to facilities, installations and working conditions at Simonstown and elsewhere. Secondly, there is an agreement on the defence of the sea routes round Southern Africa. Thirdly, there is an agreement on the need for international discussions with regard to regional defence. I wish to refer in the first instance to the Agreement on Regional Defence.</p>

<p>With regard to regional defence both the United Kingdom Government and the South African Government agreed that, &#x201C;Southern Africa and the sea routes round Southern Africa must be secured against aggression from without&#x201D;. It was also recognized by both Governments that the defence of Southern Africa against external aggression lies not only in Africa but also in the gateways to Africa, namely in the Middle East. Having recognized this fact it was, and I quote from the documents&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government to contribute forces for the defence of Africa, including Southern Africa, and the Middle East, and, secondly, of the Union Government to contribute forces in order to keep the potential enemy as far as possible from the borders of South Africa, in other words, for the defence of Southern Africa, Africa and the Middle East gateways to Africa.</block>

<p>It was furthermore agreed that, and I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">in order to implement the above policies, the lines of communication and logistic support in and around Southern Africa must be adequate and securely defended.</block>

<p>I quote further: &#x201C;The adequacy and security of logistic facilities and communications within Southern Africa and particularly along the lines of communication to the Middle East&#x201D; were considered of such importance that both Governments undertook to sponsor a conference to integrate forward and to develop the planning that had already begun at an earlier conference in Nairobi. Matters to be further discussed included &#x201C;base facilities, for instance storage and stockpiling arrangements, repair facilities, etc., on the lines of communication through and around Southern Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>However, owing to the rapid and unfavourable political developments in the Middle East, which led to the total collapse of the concept of a regional defence set-up for the defence of the gateways to Southern Africa, the projected conference never materialized.</p>

<p>With regard to the &#x201C;declared policy&#x201D; of both Governments to &#x201C;contribute forces for the defence of Africa, including Southern Africa, and the Middle East&#x201D;, whilst I cannot speak for the United Kingdom Government, I believe that they have adapted themselves to the new situation which has developed since 1955, when this Agreement was signed, by establishing a highly mobile force based in the U.K., <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0454"/>capable of rapid transportation to distant places. Apart from our own commitments flowing from the Agreement on the Defence of the Sea Routes round Southern Africa, I am not aware of the adequacy of the security of U.K. lines of communication and logistic support, through Africa, to theatres of operation East of Suez. In view of the importance of air transport, I have no doubt that British defence planners have considered a number of alternative routes to various parts of the globe. I have no doubt that the route through the Republic offers the most secure of any of the possible alternative routes from West to East. We have at no time been approached by the U.K. Government with regard to an understanding on the use of our air facilities in time of need. We have, however, on numerous occasions been requested to furnish overflying facilities, not only by the U.K. Government, but also by other countries. This fact alone points to the importance of the Southern African line of air communication from West to East. I am sure that the R.A.F. must be well aware of the value and adequacy of the facilities that we have always gladly placed at their disposal.</p>

<p>As far as our own contribution of forces in terms of the agreement on regional defence is concerned, we intimated at the time a resolution was embodied in the agreement that we were proceeding with &#x201C;building up a task force for use outside South Africa against external aggression.&#x201D; In pursuance of this undertaking we purchased Centurion tanks from Britain to the value of more than R10 million. I may say that, faithful to our undertaking this task force is in being, equipped and trained for conventional war.</p>

<p>An important stipulation with regard to our joint concept of regional defence was the agreement that &#x201C;the internal security of the countries of Southern Africa must, however, remain a matter for each individual country concerned&#x201D;. Hon. members are well aware to what extent the U.K.&#x2019;s policies have contributed towards the deterioration of the internal security of Southern African countries bordering on our own. We. for our part, have steadfastly and at great expense improved our own position, and we have every intention of maintaining this state of affairs. We are doing so from our own resources and with the assistance of friends who are not blind to the importance of Southern Africa and its defence to the free word, in a global conflict.</p>

<p>I take it for granted that the premise on which this agreement was based, namely that &#x201C;Southern Africa and the sea routes round Southern Africa must be secured against aggression from without&#x201D;, is still valid. We have certainly at no time been informed of any change in the U.K. Government&#x2019;s strategic thinking. Hon. members are also bound to agree that the internal security of a country can hardly be divorced from its capability to withstand external aggression. It is in the light of the clearly stipulated premises of a joint interest in the security of Southern Africa within the context of a wider field of common security interests that the obvious need for the continuing supply of the necessary implements of war from our main source of supply at that time, namely the U.K., was neither stressed nor even mentioned in any of the agreements under discussion. For the same reason the question of the supply of spare parts for the Centurion tanks purchased from the U.K. in pursuance of our agreement with an undertaking towards the U.K. Government, and which had previously been refused to us, was raised during the Cape Town discussions last year, which took place towards the end of January, 1967. The U.K. Government could not see its way clear to change its attitude on this point. I may say that we are quite capable of making other arrangements for keeping our tanks in fighting condition. I do not visualize the need for these tanks within the foreseeable future but the need for training our task force in the use of conventional weapons of this kind, remains important to the efficiency of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important conclusion to which both Governments arrived in this Agreement was that, in order to implement the policy of securing Southern Africa, Africa and the Middle East gateways to Africa, &#x201C;the lines of communication and logistic support in and around Southern Africa must be adequate and securely defended&#x201D;. I have already pointed out the lack of any clear international understanding on the use of our air facilities. With regard to sea communications, this was regarded as being of such importance that, and I quote from the agreement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in this connection the arrangements set out in a separate agreement for the defence of the sea route round Southern Africa are of primary importance.</block>

<p>This brings me to the most important of the series of agreements which were arrived at during the discussions on defence matters between the United Kingdom and South African Governments, in 1955, namely the agreement on the defence of the sea routes round Southern Africa. I would again like to invite the attention of hon. members to the fact that the agreement relating to the transfer of the Simonstown Naval Base constituted only one integral part of the series of discussions and exchanges of letters on the various defence matters between our respective Governments. In fact the first paragraph of this latter agreement starts off by stating that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; consequent upon the intention of the Union Government to expand the South African Navy as described in the agreement on defence of the sea routes round Southern Africa,&#x201D; the two Governments agreed to various measures which have, as far as we are concerned, faithfully been implemented.</block>

<p>It is on the grounds of our agreement on the defence of the sea routes round Southern <span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0455"/>Africa, in which it was assumed that we and the United Kingdom would be allied, possibly together with other nations, that we agreed to place not only the naval base at Simonstown at the disposal of such an effort, but also other shipping facilities of South Africa. This clearly proved our willingness to play a major part in any global conflict.</p>

<p>The agreement on defence of the sea routes round Southern Africa must be examined. This agreement started off by both Governments &#x201C;recognizing the importance of sea communications to the well-being of their respective countries in peace and to their common security in the event of aggression,&#x201D; whereupon both Governments entered into various agreements, and whilst the agreement made no specific mention of the supply of arms, we nevertheless looked upon it as a &#x201C;gentleman&#x2019;s agreement&#x201D; between two allies, and the fact that we afterwards left the Commonwealth did not change that agreement.</p>

<p>We, from our side, agreed to expand our Navy to a stipulated size. In this connection I refer you to paragraph 3 of the second agreement. I quote &#x201C;The Union Government will place firm orders in the United Kingdom for the purchase of these vessels, costing some &#x00A3;18 million (R36 million).&#x201D; With minor variations agreed to by the United Kingdom Government this expansion programme has been completed. We carried out our obligations. Apart from the cost involved in connection with the vessels, millions have been spent by us on British aircraft and other equipment in pursuance of our agreement between our two Governments to safeguard Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The agreement embodied an understanding on a suitable joint command and control structure, and the demarcation of joint and separate South African strategic defence zones in the South African area, involving also implied co-operation with other nations concerned in the adjoining areas. The agreement also involved the continued use by the British Navy of the wireless telegraphy installations in the Cape area.</p>

<p>Obviously, if we are to play our part in the defence of the sea route round Southern Africa we need not only the ships and the aircraft required for this task, but also the weapons that go with these ships and aircraft. We did, in fact, during our discussions last year, offer to accept an even greater responsibility for the defence of this important sea route, an offer that was accepted by the United Kingdom Government with alacrity. The only request from our side was for an assurance from the British Government that we would be in a position to rely on the supply of our material needs to enable us to fulfil our obligations.</p>

<p>I wish to reiterate what I said in a statement on the 2nd February, 1967, in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the discussions of 1967 in Cape Town took place, on the basis of the traditional relations of friendship and co-operation which have always obtained between the armed forces of the two countries.</block>

<p>We accordingly presented the British Government, in the light of these talks, with a &#x201C;shopping list&#x201D; for maritime defence equipment we would possibly require during the next 10 years.</p>

<p>The British delegation took note and gave an assurance that this would be considered urgently. I have been in correspondence with the British Defence Minister on this matter, but in spite of several reminders the only reaction thus far was Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s statement in the House of Commons that the arms embargo still applies. We did not get one official communication. It was only after Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s parliamentary statement that our Prime Minister reacted as he did.</p>

<p>The defence of any country, not the least South Africa, needs forward planning. In the light of the British Government&#x2019;s decision we accordingly have no choice but to develop more rapidly our own resources to provide as far as possible for our defence requirements. And in so far as our supply of weapons from overseas sources is concerned, those countries willing to co-operate with us will naturally reap the benefit. The importance of the sea routes around Southern Africa is illustrated by the volume of shipping that has passed through South African waters since the closure of the Suez Canal in June, 1967. Merchant and passenger ships which docked at South African ports from June, 1967, to January, 1968, numbered 8,652. Of these 5,953 visited our harbours under normal trading relations and 2,699 due to the closing of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is estimated that 9,600 vessels used the route round Southern Africa without making use of our harbour facilities. As far as warships are concerned the following docked at our ports as from June, 1967, to January, 1968: Britain&#x2014;46, France&#x2014;4, Portugal&#x2014;3 and Belgium&#x2014;1, which totals 54, and there were also 41 auxiliary naval vessels. Fourteen warships and two auxiliary naval vessels sailed past South African ports.</p>

<p>These statistics amplify the importance of our strategic position. This position has recently been enhanced by the British announcement on her withdrawal from East of Suez, and thereby creating a serious power vacuum in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>From my account of what was involved in the Defence Agreements of 1955, it should be quite clear to hon. members that we have throughout honoured these agreements both in the letter and the spirit.</p>

<p>Whilst we have always been prepared to carry the burden of our responsibilities in accordance with the clear understanding reached in 1955, and subsequent discussions, and whilst we continue to be prepared to do so in the interests of the defence of the free world, I am now constrained to say that in view of the attitude of the United Kingdom Government in the matter of the supply to us of defence equipment for the implementation of our agreement on the defence of the sea routes round Southern Africa, the United Kingdom Government cannot continue to rely on our benevolent acquiescence to the use of our airfields, or the naval base at Simonstown, or any of our other harbour facilities in peace or war, except when we deem it in the interests of South Africa to make them available.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have nothing more to say at this stage. I hope that the leaders of great countries like the U.S.A. and Great Britain will eventually accept the fact that we have a joint task as regards the sea routes around the Southern African coast.

<p>The hon. Leader of the Opposition raised this afternoon the very important question of the future of the Simonstown Agreement. In doing so, he declared the attitude of the United Party for the benefit of the people of South Africa and he called on the Government to declare its attitude to the future of this important agreement. We have had in reply a full statement from the hon. the Minister of Defence, a statement which, in all fairness to the hon. the Minister I must describe as an important one. In view of this, in view of the implications of this matter, the statement made by the hon. the Minister requires careful consideration from us on this side of the House. For this reason we do not wish to proceed further at this stage with this matter. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>In view of the fact that the other important matter raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon is to be the subject of a separate debate, this matter also will naturally be left by us in abeyance until that debate commences.</p>

<p>I now wish to go on to another subject entirely, a subject which whilst perhaps not of equal importance with the other two matters raised this afternoon, is nevertheless also a matter of importance. That is the question of housing in South Africa at the present time. I wish to make it quite clear at the outset that I believe that South Africa faces at the present time a housing shortage which, if not properly and adequately dealt with, will fast approach crisis proportions. What worries us on this side of the House, is that we do not see any signs that the Government is really aware, first of all, of the magnitude of the shortage or, secondly, that it is prepared to introduce sufficiently extensive and dramatic remedies to deal with this shortage satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The third point that I wish to make, and on which I will elaborate, is that the Government is entirely to blame, and I repeat, entirely to blame, for the present state of affairs. It cannot pass the buck, it cannot pass the responsibility on to anybody else or any other bodies.</p>

<p>The fourth point which I wish to make and upon which I will elaborate, is that I doubt very much that the concessions which have been made by the Government are sufficiently far-reaching or adequate to deal properly with this housing shortage. What is the attitude of the Government to this&#x003F;</p>

<p>First of all, let us look at the statement which was made by the Acting State President on the occasion of the opening of Parliament this year. This is his statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although reliable information indicates that the housing backlog is not nearly as serious as has been contended in various quarters, it is true that a backlog exists, but not so as to cause alarm.</block>

<p>The first question which arises from that statement, is: What is the source of this so-called &#x201C;reliable information&#x201D;&#x003F; I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will disclose this source when he gets up to reply to this Third Reading debate &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; or perhaps the hon. the Minister of Community Development will do so. In this regard I will point out to the hon. the Minister of Community Development that the sphere of the housing shortage that I wish particularly to deal with this afternoon, is not so much the housing for which his Department and the National Housing Commission, are responsible, namely subsidized housing, but the other housing of the middle and lower income groups for which funds must primarily be sought from building societies, in other words, from the private sector as opposed to the Government sector. This is the first thing we should like to know: What is the source of this &#x201C;reliable information&#x201D;&#x003F; We ask this particularly because the Government through the hon. the Minister of Community Development has made it clear that it has no reliable statistics as to the extent of the housing shortage. It does not have reliable statistics in relation <span class="col_871-872" refersTo="page_0457"/>even to the housing for which the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is responsible.</p>

<p>There are no Government statistics whatsoever, reliable or otherwise, in regard to the extent of the housing shortage in the sphere for which the hon. the Minister of Community Development is not responsible, and for this the Government must take full blame, firstly because no attempt has been made by the Government to obtain proper statistics.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it is not true. Perhaps, if he speaks in this debate, he will tell us what is being done. I am talking about the sphere of housing for which the building societies are responsible. The Government has been warned for some time of this deteriorating position, and what has it done&#x003F; Apparently nothing. If the hon. the Minister disputes that, let me quote to him what the president of the Association of Building Societies of South Africa has had to say. In a statement which was issued towards the end of January, after the Association of Building Societies interviewed the Minister of Finance, the president said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has been advised from time to time recently by the Association of the increasing difficulty the societies were experiencing in carrying out their function of providing adequate funds for housing the middle and certain lower income groups.</block>

<p>That statement was made round about 20th January this year. In other words, the Government was warned some time prior to 20th January. The first question I would like the hon. the Minister of Finance to answer is: When did the building societies first advise his Department or the Government of the difficulties they were beginning to face&#x003F; The second question I would like the hon. the Minister of Finance to answer is this. What steps did the Government take to deal with this deteriorating position&#x003F; And I suggest that the Government did nothing at all. Not only that, but the delegation from the Association of Building Societies interviewed the hon. the Minister of Finance, as I said, round about 20th January and the alleviatory measures which the Minister of Finance has introduced, were taken almost a month after. In other words, the position was allowed to deteriorate for a further month before this Government took any action. I am not the only one to blame the Government for the situation that has arisen. In its recently published appraisal of the economic and market situation in South Africa last year, a responsible merchant bank, Hill &#x0026; Samuel, had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is in the sphere of housing that some real blame is to be placed at the door of the Government. After all, though the immigration inflow might have been greater than expected, it was not entirely unplanned. The Government&#x2019;s monetary policy, too, has seriously hit those institutions, namely the building societies and trust companies, which are mainly responsible for the supply of development finance.</block>

<p>I suggest that this is an extremely cautious and polite statement, because after all the immigration inflow was not only something which the Government could have foreseen but something which it had actively encouraged. and quite rightly so, in our opinion. It should have done so many years ago. But at the same time it is no good encouraging immigrants without making adequate provision for housing the inflow of extra people. Secondly, the Government must take the blame for the outflow of funds from the building societies to its R.S.A. bonds scheme, and it must stop trying to shelve this responsibility. Let the hon. the Minister of Finance answer a few questions for us on this subject. The hon. the Minister of Finance was at great <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0458"/>pains to say that he does not believe that extensive funds left the building societies to go into this scheme. Well, let him tell us, if he is so certain, what was the extent of the funds that flowed out of the building societies into the R.S.A. funds.</p>

<p>The Minister has told us that a lot of this money came from the banks and he does not believe that much came from the building societies. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of Finance is saying that a lot of this money came from the banks simply because the R.S.A. scheme received this money by way of cheques drawn on the banks&#x003F; If that is the Minister&#x2019;s reason, perhaps one ought to point out to him that that does not necessarily mean that those funds were invested in the banks. They could well have been invested in the building societies and then deposited in the customer&#x2019;s bank, from which cheques were withdrawn. But this is really beside the point. The representatives of the building societies, who ought to know, are satisfied that substantial funds left the building societies to go into the R.S.A. scheme. If the Minister denies this, let him quote chapter and verse to prove his case. But up to now he has made no effort to do so at all.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the Government really realizes the seriousness of this situation. I very much doubt it. Let us look at one of the concessions the Minister had made. The Minister of Finance has said that he will provide for the building societies an amount of R8.5 million in cash to be used for housing. This is all very well, but surely the Minister knows that this is a drop in the ocean, or at any rate a very small amount in comparison with the amount which is needed right now, at this very moment.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>This is a very interesting attitude on the part of the Minister of Finance, because it indicates what we have been suggesting all along, namely that the Government is not seriously concerned about the housing shortage that exists at the moment. Surely it is the responsibility of any Government in any country, if a serious housing shortage exists, to do something about it. to assist in some way to provide the housing. Surely that is so, but here we have the hon. the Minister of Finance asking me whether the Government is supposed to do something about it. Of course the Government must. This of course supports my contention earlier that the Government neither appreciates the seriousness of the situation, nor is it prepared to take adequate steps to remedy the position. What did the building societies tell the Minister of Finance in regard to their needs at the moment&#x003F; This is what the president of the Association said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite a substantial inflow of funds during 1967, bringing their total assets to almost R2,000 million and reflecting the continuous confidence placed in them by the investing public, building societies had been quite unable to meet the demands placed on them.</block>

<p>I want to draw attention to this, because we have had speakers on the Government side who have pointed to the fact that the inflow of funds into the building societies during 1967 exceeded the inflow of funds during 1966, and that therefore the R.S.A. scheme did not draw out any funds. But I would stress the fact that it was pointed out to the Government and to the Minister of Finance that despite the fact that building societies had this large inflow of funds during the bulk of 1967, they were still short, by many millions, of the funds required to satisfy the demands made upon them. In other words, the need for housing has outpaced the inflow of funds, despite the fact that there has been an increase in the inflow of funds. The shortfall was mentioned to the hon. the Minister apparently by the Association of Building Societies, and this is what they told him. They told him, apparently, that during the second six months of 1967 the loans which were granted totalled R157 million, as compared with R199 million during the first half of the year&#x2014;R42 million less. They also said that the inflow of funds during the fourth quarter of 1967 was well below the average for the year, and consequently a further decrease in the availability of funds for loans during the coming months will arise. The Association of Building Societies made the point that the shortage of funds available to building societies for housing could have serious repercussions throughout the Republic on the growing population and on immigration and that the housing problem would deteriorate if the problem of the shortage of funds was not remedied.</p>

<p>Sir, how realistic is this amount of R8&#x00BD; million&#x003F; It has been estimated, first of all. that at R10,000 per house&#x2014;and that is a fairly low figure for the type of housing which is the subject of discussion, i.e. housing for the middle and the lower income groups (not subsidized housing)&#x2014;only 850 houses can be built. It is estimated by one building society that the requirements of building societies as a whole throughout the country at the present time, in other words, the amount of money that they require to meet the applications which they already have for building loans, amounts to very nearly R50 million, and the Government has provided R8&#x00BD; million. The House will therefore see that the provision made by the Government is entirely inadequate to meet the present situation. The hon. the Minister had other funds available; out of last year&#x2019;s Budget he had available R52 million for housing which the local authorities have not used.</p>

<p>Sir, the other thing that I think the country is entitled to know is this: A delegation from the Association of Building Societies considered the housing problem so important that they interviewed the hon. the Minister of Finance roundabout the 20th January. The Association of Building Societies has not told the public exactly what requests they made to the Government and what changes they asked for. Quite rightly they did not wish to make this a public issue and possibly jeopardize negotiations between themselves and the Government. But since the Minister came to this House and made a statement in regard to housing and volunteered certain concessions, I submit that the South African public is now entitled to be told precisely what the Association of Building Societies told the hon. the Minister of Finance; exactly what concessions or changes to the Building Societies Act the Association asked for; and which of these requests the Government intends to accede to and which of these requests the Government intends to refuse and why it refuses.

<speech by="#smith">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>The speech made by the hon. member for Musgrave who has just resumed his seat, is an excellent example of the way the Opposition has lately been exaggerating the so-called housing shortage in this country. In an irresponsible manner the hon. member simply alleged here that the hon. the Minister of Community Development and the Government had been warned from time to time that a housing shortage would arise in the country, and that apparently nothing was done about it. Then he continued and made wild allegations across the floor of the House and he mentioned statistics which the hon. the Minister was able to invalidate at once by way of interjections. I do not know whether we should take much notice of the hon. member for Musgrave if he cannot even control his figures and statistics in regard to the housing position. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will at a convenient time bring him to book and show the country and this House how faulty the hon. member&#x2019;s figures are and how these attempts of the Opposition at rousing the workers and the man in the street against the Government, have been exaggerated. We know why they are doing it. They are doing it because there are a few by-elections in the offing, particularly in workers&#x2019; constituencies, and since the housing shortage really and truly affects the ordinary worker, they are hoping to gain a few wretched votes in this way.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Musgrave also made a great fuss there about the fact that the R.S.A. savings bonds had supposedly been responsible for the drop in the funds of building societies. By way of a statement made outside this House, the hon. the Minister said very clearly that the R.S.A. savings bonds had in fact had an effect on the funds of the building societies, but it did not have the effect the hon. member wanted to suggest here. The fact that the Minister had discussions with the building societies when they approached him, shows that this Government is aware of the needs of the country and of the necessity of funds for housing. He acted immediately and made this large amount available in order to help the building societies. Sir, since when has it been the task of the Central Government to finance the building societies&#x003F; This has never been the position, nor will it ever be the position in a private enterprise country. But there is another aspect to the criticism on the R.S.A. savings bonds. The Opposition is continuously criticizing the Government because the Government had supposedly not <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0460"/>acted in good time to combat inflation. Now they are criticizing this very important measure which the Government has introduced to encourage the nation to save. How is one to understand them&#x003F; They ramble so that the public does not know what their policy is in regard to combating inflation and what solution they are offering to the so-called housing shortage.</p>

<p>I shall deal with that presently, if the hon. member for Green Point would only display a little patience. This housing shortage question is a world-wide phenomenon, as an hon. member on this side rightly said in the Second Reading Debate, and if the hon. the Minister of Community Development joins this debate, I am sure that he will be able to show with the aid of figures that during his latest tour of the world, which included America, he found this to be a universal phenomenon. As far as I know there is to-day not one single country in Western Europe where a housing shortage does not exist, and this also applies to America and Canada. The housing position in South Africa is in good hands, in the hands of this Government. I think that we can consider ourselves fortunate to have a Government such as this one, a government which has devoted as much attention to this question as has been done by this Government over the years it has been governing this country. I do not want to bore hon. members with figures and statistics; I have the figures here, but I just want to say the following: Although previous governments were also sympathetic towards the question of the provision of housing, it is particularly in the last 15 years under this Government that we have been making phenomenal progress in regard to the solution of our housing problem. I just want to mention a few figures in this regard. Out of a total amount of R419,282,201 voted which was by South African governments, as from 1920 to 31st March, 1963, for a total of 397.000 houses, no less an amount of more than R313 million was made available for the construction of 310,000 houses under the National regime in the past 15 years. Therefore, in the past 15 years approximately three times as much was spent on housing by this National Government than was spent in the previous 28 years, and if this is not a reply to this accusation which is being flung about so gaily for political gain, then there is no reply.</p>

<p>We admit that there is a small shortage of housing. There are good reasons for that. We are catching up with the shortage. There is a shortage; that is obvious, and there are many factors which have contributed to it. One of the most important factors, as has already been pointed out here is the large-scale influx of immigrants into this country. Instead of helping us and suggesting constructive ideas as to how we may catch up with this small shortage, the Opposition comes forward with this unfounded criticism in which so many holes can be picked. Even a chairman of a building society was infected by the Opposition, and he came forward with wild allegations which the hon. the Minister of Community Development was obliged to repudiate on a certain occasion. For instance, one of the chairmen of the building societies made the wild allegation that there was a shortage of 180,000 houses in this country. Where that gentleman obtained his figures, I do not know. It is likely that he obtained his figures from, and made his inquiries of the hon. member for Musgrave.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the question of the so-called housing shortage. This is a relative concept. I am saying this for the benefit of the hon. member for Green Point&#x2014;this so-called housing shortage is a relative concept. This is so because many of the people whose names appear on the waiting lists of the Department of Community Development, have already found accommodation. They are already living in flats or have other accommodation. That is why one has to be careful not to claim without more ado that there is such and such a housing shortage in South Africa. Because, as I have already said, many of those who applied for housing have already found accommodation. But as we all do, they also want their own homes eventually.</p>

<p>Another aspect is that there are specific factors contributing to the existing housing shortage, factors for which this Government cannot be held responsible, but which are nevertheless receiving attention from the Government&#x2014;the elimination of bottlenecks, for instance. In the first place there is the shortage of building sites. This is a matter which requires serious. attention from all of us. I know that the hon. the Minister will also devote his attention to this. On the Rand, for instance, the wildest speculation with building sites is going on at present&#x2014;in fact, matters have got so out of hand that it is virtually impossible to-day for the man in the middle income group to obtain a building site at a reasonable price. We find that town developers are buying up sites in order to sell them again at enormous profits to prospective house-owners, while they themselves are living in huge palaces, smoking thick cigars in their offices and driving about in Cadillacs. In the meantime they are preventing prospective house-owners, such as young married couples, from obtaining at a reasonable price a piece of land on which they can build a home for themselves. I wonder whether the time has not arrived for the Government to give thought to putting a stop to this sort of speculation in land by way of legislation. I myself have no proposal to make in this regard. But to me it appears to be a matter to which attention should be paid in some way or other. To-day we need not only speak of land barons in the rural areas&#x2014;we also find them in the cities to-day. In some way or other we must curb <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0461"/>the activities of these people. Since this major shortage of building sites at reasonable prices does exist, I want to make the suggestion to the Minister and his Department that they should consider the construction of large blocks of flats on the limited number of vacant sites that are available, as is being done in many places in Europe where sufficient building sites are not available. In America they call it &#x201C;high rise development&#x201D;. In South Africa the trend is still for South Africans to flock to the cities. Everybody wants to settle there, although sufficient land for houses for everybody is simply not available. That is why we should begin to give serious thought to this aspect, to what I want to call &#x201C;density housing&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Another idea I want to express in this regard, is the possibility that flats can generally be bought by persons who are interested in them. I know that there are many difficulties involved in this&#x2014;for instance, the problem of the registration of ownership, etc. I nevertheless think that it ought to be possible to surmount all these difficulties so that we may be able to sell flats to prospective buyers on a large scale.</p>

<p>I also want to mention another aspect which aggravates this housing shortage, an aspect for which this Government cannot be blamed either. It is a legacy from the past. I believe that if it is at all possible, the Government will pay attention to it. I am referring to the fact that there is to-day a major shortage of schooled labour in the building industry. From time to time builders resign from the building industry on a large scale when there is a recession. This is a matter which requires our attention, and we must see whether methods cannot be found whereby the builders can be kept in the building industry in South Africa on a more permanent basis. With further reference to this, I think that if a constant flow of funds to the building societies can be ensured, it will be a possible solution. As we know, a recession in the building industry results the moment funds for construction work are no longer available. Stagnation results and the builders resign and seek other employment. The only way to cope with the large-scale continuation of this phenomenon, is to create more stability in the building industry. In this way we shall attract and also keep in this industry our young men who wish to make a career of the building industry.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is possible to eliminate the delays experienced in the proclamation of townships and to expedite these proclamations. I know that the hon. the Minister has given attention to this matter. I do not know how much progress he has already made. In my constituency there are two cases in respect of which we have been struggling for five years to have those particular townships proclaimed. [Interjections.] What I am saying here now, is not criticism of the Government. There are more than 40 bodies that have to be consulted before proclamation can take place. They are all bodies which have to be consulted. But perhaps there is a method whereby the proclamation can be expedited and the delays can be diminished. I do not want to say much more about this matter. I am sure the hon. the Minister himself will reply to the Opposition&#x2019;s unsuccessful attempts here in this House at making us believe, and therefore the outside world as well, that this Government is doing nothing about providing the nation with housing and seeing to it that every person in this country is happy because he and his family are living in a house and have a roof over their heads.</p>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s reference to the Simonstown Agreement earlier this afternoon, I should also like to say something. I know they said that they did not want to discuss it any further at this stage, but that is the Opposition&#x2019;s affair. I should like to say that after the clear exposition from the Minister of Defence, this matter is crystal-clear as far as this side of the House is concerned.</p>

<p>We on this side do not need a few extra days for giving deep thought to this matter. I want to emphasize that it is a good thing that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition apparently agrees with the Government to-day as far as this important matter is concerned. Let me add, however, that this is the impression he gave me&#x2014;I might have to review my opinion once he has spoken again. The sting that was concealed in the Leader&#x2019;s speech, namely that we did not contact the British Government or negotiate with it, has already been replied to decisively by the Minister of Defence. To my mind the hon. the Prime Minister handled this matter under great provocation in an extremely exemplary way and with a great deal of circumspection, as was reflected in his New Year&#x2019;s message. But as the hon. the Minister of Defence said here, we have always relied on the fact that Britain would observe the gentleman&#x2019;s agreement in regard to the Simonstown Agreement. To us England&#x2019;s word of honour has always been sufficient, and we believed that they would also keep their word in this regard. As the Minister said, we observed our side of the agreement very carefully. Now we unfortunately have the position that in Britain there is a Prime Minister who is so eager to force South Africa to its knees that he is even prepared, in his blind prejudice, to jeopardise the safety of the whole Western world. This sad state of affairs gave rise to the fact that the Minister of Defence had to make this very important statement here this afternoon. Now I want to say that to my mind the time has come for Britain to reflect on her attitude. Britain must realize that the time has arrived for her to put a stop to the attempts made by the meddlesome U.N. to dictate to her. I think the time has arrived for Britain to decide, in her own interests as well as in those of her friends, that she will no longer allow herself to be pushed around by the U.N. The hon. the Minister of Defence told us how we <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0462"/>had made available to Britain &#x201C;a ready-made shopping list&#x201D; as regards armaments. But what a bad businessman Harold Wilson is! His country is on the verge of bankruptcy. Like manna from Heaven he is given a shopping list for millions upon millions of rands&#x2014;I assume&#x2014;but he is so dazed by his prejudice against South Africa that he is not prepared to continue to make arms available to us, arms which are important to us for honouring faithfully our obligations in terms of the Simons-town Agreement. I think the time is gradually arriving when South Africa will no longer beg on its knees for arms, which are not proposed to be used internally, but which we want to use to defend ourselves against attacks from outside and which will also benefit the Western countries. The time has passed when we have to go on our knees to beg for arms of that type.</p>

<p>We have a strong and powerful economy, and we are prepared to and capable of paying for those arms. We are not like some independent African states which are also asking for arms and other gifts and which subsequently ask with cupped hands whether they can have them for nothing or on the never-never system. No. we are prepared to pay for what we require.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with the following. I am glad that in certain circles in England a change in attitude and spirit is at least taking place nowadays in respect of this matter. As hon. members know, a former British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas Home, visited South Africa recently, and we know what he said. I have been privileged to converse with one of the leading and most famous newspaper editors of Fleet Street, namely John Gordon of the <i>Sunday Express,</i> and in a private conversation he also told me that he hoped that we in South Africa would act cautiously and would not sever the line of communication with Britain altogether. According to him he is convinced that the Wilson Government with its unsympathetic attitude towards South Africa will be something of the past in two years&#x2019; time when the old traditional cooperation between South Africa and Britain will be restored. I hope that he is right in his forecast. However, we cannot bargain on that. We must be prepared for contingencies. We cannot wait too long to see what the future will bring, because, as the hon. the Minister of Defence rightly said, it might be too late.</p>

<heading>EXPANSION OF EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES</heading>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, recently we have been hearing a great deal about the Government&#x2019;s outward-looking policy directed at the outside world. There is no doubt whatsoever that the outward-looking policy directed at the outside world has made an impression on people in countries which were normally critical of South Africa. But I believe that what we still lack now is an outward-looking policy directed inward. That is my aim with this motion on the Order Paper this afternoon, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to take cognizance of educational and social developments in other countries&#x2014;notably the plans in Britain to launch a so-called Open University of the Air which will offer courses by means of television and the radio &#x2014;and to take all the steps required to bring all education within easy reach of everyone and to create a population that is generally literate and well-informed.</block>

<p>The crux of the motion is really contained in the last part, in which we request the Government &#x201C;to take all the steps required to bring all education&#x201D;, that is to say knowledge of life and civilized values, within reach of as many as possible of our people and of all our population groups so that we in South Africa can create a wider population that is generally literate and well-informed.</p>

<p>In the second place the motion requests the Government to take cognizance of advanced plans which exist in other countries for reaching this goal. In particular I should then like to refer to the plans in Britain to establish an &#x201C;Open University of the Air&#x201D; which is aimed at bringing the greater amount of education within reach of the entire population. Let me say at once that I am not adopting the attitude that our Department of Education consists of a number of people who do not know what is going on around them, and that no steps are being taken by the Government to expand educational facilities in South Africa. I am quite aware of the fact that our Heads of Department are doing their best to keep abreast of developments in other countries, and that in our country we are witnessing further progress in the field of training and education each year. That is the least any government can do. There must be progress in the field of education and training. One is tremendously pleased to see that there is a virtual stampede to our universities this year, a stampede by all the population groups, and that the number of applications for admission to our universities has reached a new record.</p>

<p><span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0463"/>The University of the Witwatersrand is attracting 8,500 this year, which is 500 more than last year. The University of South Africa, which already has almost 20,000 students, is admitting 800 more than last year. It is rather disturbing to find that there are so many students who cannot be admitted, particularly in the medical and associated faculties. I think that this is not something which ought to happen in a growing country, and is something which we will have to overcome. But nobody in the House will deny that there has been progress in the field of education, particularly university education. I also concede that it is quite easy to stand up here in this House and prove with statistics that we are doing a little more than Ghana for example, or Tanzania, or other countries on the Continent of Africa. But I want to inform hon. members on the opposite side straight away that this kind of comparison does not make the slightest impression on anybody, for the very simple reason that there is a world of difference between the circumstances here and those in the Africa countries. What is more, our natural riches are so much greater than those of the other countries in Africa, that any comparison between Africa states and ourselves is to my mind, na&#x00EF;ve. I would never dream, for example, of comparing the Unites States of America with certain of the mini-states in South America. Such comparisons prove absolutely nothing. Nor is it of any avail comparing the education received by the white population here with statistics affecting the total population in other countries. That is an equally inadmissable comparison.</p>

<p>As far as privileges are concerned, we, the white population, form the uppermost layer of the population; and one cannot skim off the privileged layer of the population of one country and then compare it with all the layers of the population of another country. Comparisons are easy to make but I believe that a comparison between one country and another is only valid if it is done on the basis of the entire population in the various countries and if all the circumstances are the same, including their national riches. The prosperity of the uppermost layer of the population in South Africa definitely depends to a large extent on the labour co-operation of the bottommost layer. That is why it is quite impracticable to skim off the one group, and make comparisons with other countries solely on that basis. To my mind there is no sense seeking consolation in statistics which indicate that we are so much better off and are doing so much more than other Africa states for example. I believe that our progress must be measured against our own possibilities and nothing else. Now it is indisputably the case, and nobody can deny it, that we are an exceptionally wealthy country, that we have at our disposal natural resources which are the envy of other countries. We do not have an exceptionally large population&#x2014;18 million, or slightly more. That is nothing in comparison with other countries. There is no question of teeming millions. I have seen what that means in a city such as Bombay. There one wonders, if one sees how thousands of people have to sleep in the streets, how one can, with the best will in the world, control and govern so many people. We have no problems of that nature. We do in fact have problems of distance, but even that is not such a terrible disadvantage, because the vast majority of the population, all races and groups, is concentrated in and around about 20 large towns and cities. Without denying that there has nevertheless been progress, as there ought to have been, I say that, measured against our own ability, our vast resources and the comparatively small population we have, we are, in my opinion, lagging far behind what we are capable of achieving in the field of education in our country.</p>

<p>As regards the Whites, I believe we are lagging behind as far as the quality of the knowledge we are disseminating is concerned. As regards the non-Whites, we are lagging behind as far as both the quality and the quantity is concerned. For some reason or other which has its roots in the fact that this Government is so old-fashioned, we are not utilizing all the means available to us in order to keep pace with the developments of modern times. I do not think a thing like this is fair to South Africa, to the youth of our country.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, for example, it was reported from America that &#x201C;President Johnson has signed the nation&#x2019;s first Public Broadcasting Act&#x201D;. As you know, broadcasting there is in private hands. He has now signed a public Act which will entail &#x201C;the use of computers and satellites in the cause of education. Under the plan, students in small colleges could tap the resources of large universities. Physicians in remote areas could contact distant laboratories via the network. It will try to prove that what educates, can also be exciting.&#x201D; A further report from that source read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">President Johnson has signed into law legislation to give every child in America a better chance to touch his outermost limits, to reach the furthest edge of his talents and dreams. The legislation is the 1967 amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. He said that the signing of these amendments signalled the beginning of a campaign to unlock the full potential of every boy and girl regardless of his race or religion or his father&#x2019;s income.</block>

<p>These are imaginative steps, but if we ask for similar imaginative plans to be made in South Africa to bring education and training within easy reach of all, rich and poor, White and non-White, regardless of their father&#x2019;s income, then it is said in advance that we are being too idealistic. This kind of practical idealism in the United States has already led to the establishment in that country of new colleges at a rate of one new college per week. The popularization of education has <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0464"/>already resulted in an increase in recent times of 12 per cent in the number of young people from indigent homes who are now going to university.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am prepared to measure the possibilities here against our own ability. [Interjections.] The emphasis lies in this that nobody need, on the grounds of his father&#x2019;s income, or his race, be deprived of the opportunity of developing his talents to the best of his ability. I think that this is a way of looking at things that is still lacking amongst us. If it does exist amongst us, then we are hiding it under a bushel. Yet we are the one country in the world which has a greater interest in the upliftment of the masses than any other country, because there is no doubt that illiteracy, no matter to whom it applies in the country, or backwardness, is a burden to the country which has to be overcome. We have a great deal to say about the maintenance of the white civilization, and then we rely almost exclusively on the power of legislation to safeguard our future. I believe that in the long run there is only one way to ensure the preservation of standards in South Africa in future. We must help to teach the non-white population groups in the shortest possible time to appreciate the same high standards, and side with us in defending them if it should ever be necessary to do so. Contrasts of identity, of colour, or language, these we will always have, but there need not necessarily be such a wide gap and contrast between people as far as the quality and quantity of education is concerned. Certainly, one of the quickest ways of closing this gap between people, is the idea which has now originated in Britain, namely that of establishing a &#x201C;University of the Air&#x201D;. One need not stay long in Britain to-day to realize that tremendous developments are taking place in the cultural sphere. The &#x201C;Inner London Education Authority&#x201D; launched a scheme a year ago to link the 1,350 schools and colleges under its control by means of television. This scheme is being repeated in other parts of the country. In this way the network is being expanded further and further so as to include as many educational institutions as possible. The object which is being pursued is to interconnect universities by means of television in such a way that the best available lecturers and facilities on every subject will be available for a wide student audience, instead of merely for a small audience in a specific university. The purpose is also to make specialized training generally available to all. I see that Professor Gerrit Viljoen, principal of the new Rand Afrikaans University, recently discussed at a simposium in Johannesburg&#x2014;I am reading from a report which appeared on 15th February, 1968 in <i>Die Burger</i>&#x2014;the &#x201C;knowledge explosion&#x201D; and the great possibilities for co-ordinated higher education which are being offered by the five neighbouring universities on the Rand. He added that, to achieve this, closed circuit television between institutions for higher education in the Transvaal was an &#x201C;unavoidable necessity&#x201D; for the exchange of specialized knowledge. One is pleased to see that, but we should like to hear what kind of encouragement the Government is giving the universities to develop in this direction. In England the developments are now reaching this high-water mark, a high-water mark which one can describe as a revolution in education and in adult training. It is namely the idea of a &#x201C;University of the Air&#x201D; or rather a television university, one in which television will play the major role. The idea was put forward a few years ago by the British Prime Minister. Subsequently a committee of inquiry was appointed by their Department of Education, in conjunction with educationalists, which made its report to the British Parliament in 1966. Obviously I cannot read the entire report here, but I shall read only a few extracts from the report on this &#x201C;Open University of the Air&#x201D;. It is stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the educational world, as elsewhere, technological discoveries are making a profound impact. Television and radio, programmed learning, and a wide range of audio-visual aids have already brought about considerable changes. The most important undoubtedly is that the best of our teachers can now be made available to vastly wider audiences. A distinguished lecture that at one time might have been heard only by a handful of students, or a few hundred at most, can now be broadcast &#x2026;</block>

<p>By that they mean television; &#x201C;broadcasts&#x201D; in Britain now mean television&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to millions of people. It has therefore become possible for the first time to think in terms of a university of the air.</block>

<p>What is important, is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It could do so without requiring vast capital sums to be spent on bricks and mortar.</block>

<p>A whole new world is opening up in education, which is of greater importance for a country such as South Africa, with its mass of people who have lagged behind, than for any other country. One can think what one pleases about Britain in the sphere of politics, but in other fields and particularly in the material field, it is quite incorrect to say that she is going backwards and that as a country she is deteriorating. My observation was that as far as modern human development was concerned there was hardly any field in which she was not ahead of us and where we could not learn something from her. In regard to this &#x201C;University of the Air&#x201D;, this television university, I just want to add that a few months ago the Government there appointed an &#x201C;Open University Planning Committee&#x201D; consisting of picked educationists, who have to take the final decisions in regard <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0465"/>to how this should be proceeded with and everything that is necessary to have the undertaking achieve its purpose, namely to create a population which is generally informed and well educated. It is expected to come into operation in 1970. As it happens it will then coincide with the appeal made recently by the United States and 17 other countries to make 1970 an &#x201C;International Education Year&#x201D; with a world-wide campaign for the expansion of education. <i>Inter alia,</i> the question of an administrative centre for this University of the Air must be decided upon. To me it seems obvious that in our country we should make use of the University of South Africa as the most suitable instrument for something like this, and since new buildings are being constructed, one hopes the hon. the Minister will keep an eye open to such possibilities. Recently, to my regret, I saw that Professor S. Pauw, the principal of the University of South Africa, was forced to complain that the great work which was being done by the university was, as it were, being concealed from the population of South Africa. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said that the University of South Africa was &#x201C;hidden from the people&#x201D;, with the result that no one knew what was being done to help students further their knowledge. (<i>The Star</i> 13.2.68.)</block>

<p>This is certainly something which must be rectified. What we need is for the Government to live a little more in our own time. Then the University of South Africa can become an instrument which will place South Africa on the path of a revolution in education. When I say that the Government should become a little more of a government of our own time, I am not saying this merely in order to be derogatory. Just listen to this, Sir, and you will understand what I mean by that. Here is a report which appeared in <i>Die Beeld</i> on 14th January this year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tukkies are getting their Ty on the quiet; the University of Pretoria has received permission from the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs (the former one) to use television on condition that nobody is told about it. The equipment has been quietly installed, and now the university is very pleased with it. It is being used in the training of medical students. Every detail of complicated autopsies can now be viewed by students on four television screens. If all the students had to stand around the corpse, they would not have been able to see half as well. When the accompanying picture was taken, 220 students had seen how the heart of a baby was being removed. The television magnified the heart approximately five times. Professor Dr. I. W. Simpson, chief of the pathological Institute, did not want to discuss television at all. He stated that it had been a condition for the licence that nothing was published concerning it.</block>

<p>Well I never! It seems to me Government members regard it as a charge against them if someone suspects them of being progressive. Let me say in parentheses, this is the sort of conduct which from time to time causes one to be confronted by the humiliating position as Afrikaner, not only overseas, but sometimes in South Africa as well, where one has to hear people say that the Afrikaner is a backward-looking person and is afraid of modern civilization. It is attitudes like this which make for opinions of this kind, and I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Education this. He has in his hand a portfolio which is one of the most exciting portfolios in the entire Cabinet. What I am saying here to-day in regard to a university of the air should really have come from the Minister.</p>

<p>I say again, I am not suggesting in any way that the hon. the Minister or the Government is not doing anything and that there is no progress. I know that the Minister also has, as all governments have, to contend with a shortage of trained teachers, and that there is a limit to the funds a government can spend. But such a university of the air is precisely the one means of overcoming this kind of problem, as we have seen in Australia and New Zealand, where the best possible education is being provided by means of television for the children who cannot attend large schools, particularly those in the remote districts, where the distances are great and where there is a shortage of teachers. And we find in our country to-day that children in the rural areas very often have to do without the benefit of certain subjects, such as Latin, owing to a shortage of teachers, a shortcoming which can easily be solved by a television university. To-day use is already being made overseas of one teacher to give physical training, music, art appreciation, and other subjects simultaneously to a series of classes in a wide network of schools.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for us to attach too narrow an interpretation to the concept of a television university. It can also be introduced for the purpose of providing pre-university training. I know that we are already making use of the radio for the purpose of school lessons, but the radio has limitations, and nowhere are the limitations of radio lessons better described than in the educational journal of the Department of Bantu Education. This also applies to the Whites. They state (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The radio is not a person. The radio cannot, like the teacher, gain the pupils&#x2019; attention and hold it by means of facial expression or gestures.</block>

<p>Those deficiencies can all be overcome by means of television. As far as radio lessons are concerned, one also finds a further disadvantage. Before a radio lesson on, for example, the Orange River Project can be given, the teacher must first take five or ten minutes to show the children on maps what is going to <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0466"/>be discussed; or, they must take out illustrated books and show them so that the children can understand what is being taught over the radio. All these problems can be overcome by the introduction of a television university with wide terms of reference. Just think what a tremendous advantage it would have been if even the radio lessons which there are to-day were in fact television lessons; because in comparison with what television can offer, radio has already become an anachronism.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying this. I was in Berlin a few months ago and while the guide was showing us around he stopped at a building and showed us where. 31 years ago. the first television broadcast in Germany had taken place. Thirty-one years ago! In Britain they have now progressed as far as a television university, but we in South Africa are nowhere. And then the hon. members talk about progress! We are years behind in this field in South Africa and whose fault is it&#x003F; It is the fault of the Government which does not see its way clear to providing us with this development. That is why we want to bring it to the attention of the nation.</p>

<p>This motion does not lay emphasis on the closed circuit, but on an open university of the air, because what is being taught on television through such a general university of the air, may just as well be placed at the disposal of the entire nation. And if, as it is being done on television, life broadcasts are offered, it would become a powerful means of dissemination of knowledge and information to the large bulk of our population. I agree with that person who described this development overseas as just as important a milestone in the development of man as the development of printing was generations ago. That is why I am moving this motion in the hope that the hon. the Minister will rise, not to present us with his problems, but to recognize and recommend these opportunities and take the lead in persuading his Government that the time has now come for an outward looking policy directed inward.</p>

<p>If ever there was proof of the truth of the adage that the cobbler must stick to his last, then it was provided to-day by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who showed throughout his speech that he really knew very little about education. I want to ask a single practical question by way of illustration. I ask the hon. member to inform me how one can teach Latin by means of television in the rural areas of the Transvaal. What foolishness that a man can stand up here and talk such nonsense in this House!</p>

<p>I was in Britain along with the hon. member and he cannot tell me anything about what is happening there. That is the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty. This University of the Air which the hon. member talks about is not yet in operation in Britain. It is being planned at the moment and will only come into operation in 1970, and it has already presented numerous problems, so that many of its aspects are being reconsidered. It may only come into operation in 1970, but the hon. member wants to force us into it straight away as if we would be backward and orthodox if we did not rush in at once and implement this novelty which has not even been tested in Britain yet. The hon. member says that we are living in a previous century because we do not want to utilize television for education. In the first place this is, of course, not true. The hon. member himself quoted the fact that closed circuit television was already being used at some universities. It is already being used, and there is no objection to that either. But there is a tremendous difference between closed circuit television in universities for a specific purpose and the Open University of the Air which he talks about, with all the cost it involves and all the various other aspects which I cannot enter into in the few minutes at my disposal.</p>

<p>But the use of television in education is not an unmixed blessing. Educationists of great repute, persons with experience of it, say: &#x201C;Keep it out of your country!&#x201D; I want to quote someone from Britain in this connection, namely Professor Harwood, who was here, and had the following to say. I quote from a report (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The effects of television on children are shocking. Keep it out of Africa as long as you can.&#x201D; This is what Professor Harwood, an educationist and psychologist from London. said in a Press interview in Newlands. Professor Harwood is in charge of a training course in Britain for teachers who are interested in the Waldorf method of teaching.</block>

<p>He said that television was about the worst thing that could be brought to South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_speaker">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I just want to point out that the hon. member must not discuss the general principles of television, but must confine himself to its educational aspects.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member brought television into a discussion on education. and I have now quoted an educationist on the matter of television in education. But let me proceed. Every educationist of repute will tell you that there is no substitute for the actual presence of the teacher in his classroom. There is no substitute for the personal contact between the teacher and the child because one is not only concerned with the imparting of knowledge; the object of education is to educate the person as a whole and for this one needs direct. personal and intimate contact between the teacher and the child every day, and television can never achieve this.</p>

<p>I want to take my argument further. In short the hon. member&#x2019;s motion boils down to three <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_0467"/>points. We must take cognizance of educational and social developments. This implies that we are not taking cognizance of these developments, because why would we otherwise be urged to take cognizance of them&#x003F; Is the hon. member totally unaware of the tremendous progress we have made in this connection&#x003F; Is he totally unaware of the modern techniques in education which we are already applying&#x003F; To mention a few examples, is he totally unaware of the modern trends in arithmetic in our educational system, which represent a brand-new approach in the field of mathematics&#x003F; Is he aware of the work being performed by the audio-visual services, where use is made of the school radio, with films being sent beforehand to schools and where they are then screened to coincide with transmissions over the radio. Then one has the two elements combined and synchronized, just as in the case of television, but at much lesser cost, and practically applied in the particular classroom. We already have language laboratories, a modern technique, one of the most modern in the world, to teach people languages. The hon. member says that we must take cognizance of what is going on in the outside world. We have modern research techniques. South Africa is so far advanced in this field that we lead the world in medical science, with heart transplants for example. Must we not for a change ask the outside world to take cognizance of what is happening in these fields in South Africa&#x003F; Sir. not everything that one takes cognizance of is good. Too often things have happened which we took cognizance of and introduced into our educational system without due consideration, and which eventually proved to be great failures. We must be very careful not to make our children the quinea-pigs of overseas developments. I want to mention one specific example, and that is social studies, which was introduced precipitably from overseas and announced here with great acclamation, and which has now fortunately been done away with because we have realized that it was a total failure. We believe in keeping an eye on things, but we also believe in taking over only those things which are to our benefit, and that we must not take over everything holus bolus simply for the sake of supposedly being modern or in the forefront of technical development. It would be foolish of us to take over such things indiscriminately. and it would be foolish for a specific reason. Our South African conditions and situation are peculiar to this country. There is no other country which is precisely comparable to South Africa and therefore we must deal with South Africa and its problems specifically and separately and solve our own problems in that light. The hon. member says that we must take all the steps required to bring all education within easy reach of everyone. What more must we do than we are now doing&#x003F; The only suggestion that the hon. member can make is that we establish an Open University of the Air; that is all that needs to be added. Does the hon. member accept that all the other steps have already been taken&#x003F; Let me just mention them quickly; To place all education within easy reach of everyone means that the school must be located as near to the child as possible, and this is precisely what is being done. The 106 high schools that there were in 1947, for example, have increased to 471. In this way the Government has placed schools within reach of the children to bring all education within easy reach. As a result the number of pupils has grown from 69,000 in 1947, when the United Party was in power, to 274.000, which proves that education has been brought within easy reach of the children; we have already done so. National schools have been placed within reach of pupils. Where there used to be 29 there are now 66. There used to be eight technical courses; they have now increased to 84. Technical knowledge has been brought within easy reach of pupils. The amount provided on the Vote of the Department of Education, Arts and Science in 1947 was R5&#x00BD; million, for educational facilities only. In 1967 the figure stood at R45&#x00BD; million. We are therefore bringing education within easy reach of evervone. Take buildings. For buildings alone buildings for educational purposes, the United Party Government made R&#x00BD; million available in 1947: in 1967, R35 million was made available. For the education of Whites the Government has done everything possible within the financial means and capacity of the country. Everything that could be done has been done, and the results prove it. We to-day have outstanding research workers in numerous spheres in the world. We often hear the reproach that our best men are leaving the country: that there is a &#x201C;brain drain&#x201D; in progress. Why do they leave this country&#x003F; They are enticed away by other countries because they are better than those already there. This is very clear proof that our facilities here are adequate and good enough. I do not say that one must not keep pace with modern developments, but one must be practical and realistic.</p>

<p>However, the hon. member&#x2019;s motion goes further and refers to all sections of the population. I want to take the section which he would regard as the bottom layer; this is not a term that I want to use. The hon. member divides the population of South Africa into layers, probably to get away from the question of colour. The bottom layer is the Bantu, according to the hon. member. How have we brought &#x201C;all educational opportunities,&#x201D; in the terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, within easy reach of the Bantu&#x003F; Let us look at a few figures. Bantu education was taken over by the Department in 1953. I am not comparing South Africa with other countries now: I want to compare what was done under the United Party Government with what has been done under the National Party Government. and then I want to ask if any reproach can be levelled at this Government. Bantu education was taken over in 1953. At that <span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0468"/>stage there were 5,665 Bantu schools; by 1965 the number had grown to 8,722. This is how education was brought to the people; the number of pupils had increased from 858,000 to 1,900,000. The number of teachers, who, in terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, must impart knowledge to all, had increased from 21,000 to 34,000 in these few years. Sir, the Government is doing what it has to do; it is doing more than it has to do.</p>

<p>Let us look at a few of the African states about which the hon. member is so boastful, states using television to bring education to the masses. If it was so effective, then surely it would have been used long ago for this purpose by all the states of Europe which are to-day interested in the emergent African states. If television is really so effective, then surely they would have introduced it long ago. Let us look at the number of pupils attending schools in the various African countries. In Liberia 17 per cent of the children of schoolgoing age are attending school, in Somalia 4.5 per cent, in Mali 18.5 per cent, in Kenya 49 per cent, in spite of all the facilities they have; in Nigeria, in spite of its television, 34 per cent; in Algeria, which has television, 55.8 per cent. In the Republic of South Africa 85.3 per cent of the Bantu children of schoolgoing age are attending school. Can we be reproached with not having brought education within reach of everyone&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in actual fact the sting of this motion is in its tail. In his motion the hon. member asks that we should create &#x201C;a population that is, generally literate and well-informed&#x201D;. How does South Africa compare with African countries where television has already been introduced&#x003F; Television has been introduced in those countries, not for this purpose, but purely for the sake of being able to boast and to say to the outside world, &#x201C;We have one of the most modern technical developments, namely television.&#x201D; It is purely a question of prestige and nothing else. Here are the true facts: In 1952, 21.8 per cent of the Bantu population in South Africa were literate. At present almost 60 per cent of the Bantu are literate. In the age group seven to twenty years, i.e. the group which could obtain its education during the term of office of this Government, the literacy rate is 80 per cent. The reproach is directed at us that we are not doing enough; we must do more and introduce television to bring literacy to the people. But how does South Africa compare with African states that do have television&#x003F; In Algeria 20 per cent of the population are literate, in spite of its television; in Tanzania 20 per cent are literate; in Gaboon, 35 per cent; in Botswana 30 per cent; in Ethiopia 2 per cent.</p>

<p>But the hon. member wants to suggest here that we must do much more. I want to say at once that we are doing everything that our funds permit. We are doing what falls within the framework of our policy, and that is that we want to set and keep each population group in this country on its own feet, but we refuse simply to follow every new fad in the world slavishly for the sake of supposedly being modern. We still firmly believe in examining and taking cognizance of every development and making use of it if it is good, and not making use of it if it is not good, and the very fact that we do not follow every new fad is an indication of our responsible and mature attitude in South Africa.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has quoted figures to show what other countries in Africa are doing. I do not think those figures mean very much. You cannot take the most advanced country in Africa and compare it with countries which are struggling under new Governments. It seems to me to be no argument to say that television is no good because those countries happen to have television. Perhaps they are not even attempting to use television in those countries for the purposes of education. They use television to provide entertainment, not as an educational medium. It is true, as the hon. member says, that they use television for prestige. But, Sir, prestige does not fill empty stomachs nor does it educate people. What the mover of the motion means to imply, I believe, is that while we are doing a great deal for the majority&#x2014;in fact, for nearly all the people of the country&#x2014;we are not doing enough. We are not searching out the unfortunate individuals who do not fit into the pattern of the ordinary school. One way or another, physically or mentally, they are handicapped. We deal only with the majority; we deal only with the school-age group and with the university-age group. I feel that we should go out of our way to seek out the unfortunates who have not been able at the ordinary school-or university-age to obtain the training that they would wish to have had. Perhaps they did not mature early enough to appreciate the discipline that a university or a secondary school demands. All these people deserve extra consideration. In other words, we must try to provide education for the individual. The Education Department provides for the group, but modern educational facilities, particularly radio and television, do make it possible for the Department to give individuals, whatever their age may be, at least some educational facilities, particularly those who are far removed from schools and universities. By using modern methods you can bring to these people as good an education as perhaps they would receive anywhere else.</p>

<p>We can do it by means of a much cheaper method than by sending individual teachers <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0469"/>to these people, even if it were possible to do that, which it is not. So I think greater use should be made in this country of the radio. The radio broadcasts very few educational programmes, and it should be the business of the Education Department, I believe, to have always available a channel on which to broadcast. Various times will suit various people. During school hours the channel could perhaps be used for transmitting programmes to schools. But I am not thinking so much of the schools; I am thinking rather of the housewife. The housewife is tied to her house. She could have an hour, or, if need be. make an hour in the morning in which to listen to the radio for the purpose of improving her cultural knowledge, her education, and even perhaps her cuisine. All these things could be done shall we say at 11 o&#x2019;clock in the morning. If the educational authorities had a channel available at all times, it could even undertake the training of businessmen during the times when they are away from their businesses. The radio could educate the man who has served his apprenticeship and is a journeyman artisan but who wishes to better himself. There are things happening in the world to-day of which all of us need to be informed. These developments occurred at a time when most of us had left school. For instance, how many of us can appreciate the intricacies of the space exploration which is going on&#x003F; How many of us would not be delighted to take a course in nuclear physics&#x003F; How many of us are secure in our jobs when we are faced with electronics, automation and computers. Even a senior wrangler finds that he is no longer required to do mathematical calculations&#x2014;there is a machine to do it. Humans cannot calculate rapidly enough the flight of a projectile on its way to, for instance, Venus, because by the time the calculation was made the projectile would probably have collided with some other planet. So it seems that none of us can be certain that the machine will not replace us. and to avoid that all of us must be educated further. However, the State cannot afford to take us back to school because we are needed in the jobs which we are doing. But at the same time we must prepare ourselves either to improve our knowledge, or to stand back while some machine takes over. We have this conflict between the machine and the human being, and there is a danger that the machine may take over. The only way of avoiding it is to provide education, and that should be done by means of communication media available to all of us. Up to a point the radio can, if properly used, instead of broadcasting quizzes which lead to the awarding of prizes, fulfil that need. All day long one hears quizzes or music of a special character. Radio in this country has a very limited field at present in which it is used for educational purposes, and yet I am sure there are large numbers of people in this country who would gladly sit and listen to a lesson in modern sciences or art or in any other form of culture rather than be tied down to recorded music or tinned lectures from some other country. I hope this motion will bring the realization to the hon. the Minister and the officials of his department that the use of radio on a wide scale to deal with individuals, the individual citizen in his wants, has much to commend it. Give him an hour a day. Broadcasts of this nature could take place fourteen hours per day, and there are at least fourteen different groups of people who want something badly. If a little study and investigation were carried out by this department I am sure they would find gratitude amongst large numbers of people who are sick and tired of the use to which the whole, or almost the whole, of the S.A.B.C. is devoted.</p>

<p>When it comes to the use of television in this way it must be appreciated that there are certain matters in which groups of people must be trained but in regard to which they cannot be adequately trained without risk to themselves or to others. As hon. members all know, we have a man with a transplanted heart here in Cape Town. I did not intend to refer to this matter, but the hon. member who has just sat down referred to it and I wish to add a few remarks to what he said. There was a picture of the fortunate patient in yesterday&#x2019;s papers, and with him there appeared a medical attendant in sterilized gowns and wearing a mask. I mention this to illustrate how the patient is completely protected against infection, and no nurse can be trained to nurse him whilst these measures are in force. His condition is such that the nurse who nurses him must already be fully trained. But she has to have training and those who follow her and others who, as science is developed, will be required, must also be trained. But they cannot be trained, as doctors and nurses usually are, with the assistance of the living patient&#x2014;they have to learn by observation indirectly. And here we see need for television in education. By making use of television, the equipment in the patient&#x2019;s ward being well sterilized before hand, it is possible to train nurses. They can be guided and taught how to do work of the nature referred to, without endangering the health of the patient. The introduction of television would open a wide field for the education of medical students, and for people who work in dangerous surroundings. People who work in laboratories do not like having the public or students about the place more than is necessary. Laboratory work often is a dangerous occupation. However, those who are being trained, the students, can be taught quite safely by means of television. Above all things I want to draw attention to the fact that it is very difficult nowadays to get through to people by merely talking to them. The modern child wants to see something, he likes to see movement. It is interesting to watch a baby looking at a screen in front of it. It looks at the screen, but it does not listen to what is said very much. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that his department investigate very carefully the question of interim training, whether kindergarten <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0470"/>and infant children should not start by learning to look at television and to learn that television is not something only for their amusement&#x2014;they must not be shown conjurers and similar entertainers. They will indirectly and slowly learn firstly the discipline of listening and looking with attention. As far as the use of television and radio in the field of teaching is concerned, I feel the prospects and possibilities are unlimited. Above all the department can think of the isolated individual. I think, for instance, of the housewife in her home who is for most of the day alone in her home busy with the housework. Let us not only give her music all day. I think if a good lecture were broadcast at the time when bridge-playing ladies take a break for tea, perhaps few of them would continue with their bridge playing. Their interest might be kindled in some other subject. They might then prefer to pursue some educational subject. I feel the field is unlimited, but it needs exploring and it needs a great deal of thought.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (Central) has just pleaded that further provision should be made for the individual to increase his knowledge and to further his studies and that television should be introduced for that purpose. He also referred to the housewife who works alone in her house during the day. If a television service were to be introduced for her sake, it would actually be introduced for entertainment and recreation. I say this because nobody can study without concentrating. For that reason the thoughts and pleas we had from the hon. member will not achieve anything. In order to provide in the said educational needs, we have, for example, the University of South Africa which, with its correspondence courses, have always achieved good results.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked that the Government should take cognizance of educational and social developments in other countries. He referred to the Open University of the Air which will offer courses. In other words, the hon. member wants this type of television service to be employed on all levels of education in South Africa as well&#x2014; that is how he actually put it. He actually wants this to be not only in the primary classes but also in the sphere of secondary and higher education. The hon. member, during his recent wanderings in Britain, came across this idea of the Open University of the Air and he was enormously impressed by it. It had made such an impression on him that he subsequently introduced his private member&#x2019;s motion in order to inform us about it here in the House of Assembly. He went even further and assured the hon. the Minister of National Education that this was the very thing our education needed and that it would be the proper incentive for bringing education on all levels within easy reach of all.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randfontein also concerned himself with the ideas of the said institution during his visit overseas. As we all know, education is the one subject in which he is particularly interested. As a matter of fact, he is the leading speaker on educational matters on this side. The hon. member for Randfontein also observed the work of the Open University of the Air in its initial stages, but he was not nearly as impressed as that hon. member was, because he saw it merely as a means of aid, similar to the other means of aid which are already being used in connection with audio-visual education. For that reason he does not go into raptures about the matter.</p>

<p>According to the wording of the motion, the means of aid advocated by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, will be used not only in White schools but also in non-White schools. If the service were in fact introduced in due course, could the hon. member for Bezuidenhout tell us what the cost of the service would be&#x003F; Has the hon. member or anybody else ascertained whether it would in fact be such an effective means of aid that it would justify the enormous cost it would entail&#x003F; In other words, Sir, has it ever been established beyond all doubt that, as a means of aid, it would be so suitable and so effective that we simply must accept it without more ado&#x003F; Education must be dynamic and this we all believe, but one cannot accept something like this without investigation and study. If a means of aid of this nature were accepted in a particular province or&#x2014;as we should like to advocate as we want more uniformity in education&#x2014;throughout the Republic of South Africa, it would create a slavish uniformity in the school time-tables. I now want to speak as a person who has had many years of experience of time-tables in high schools, as a teacher and also as a former principal. Subjects in high schools, for example, will have to be offered in a fixed order, at fixed times and during fixed periods and then school life as such will in point of fact have to be regimented. Is that what the hon. member wants to propose&#x003F; Does he want to recommend something like that&#x003F; In France, for example, a time-table for schools within a particular category has been laid down on a country-wide basis. In that country subjects are offered over television in a fixed order. But this definitely amounts to regimentation and definitely entails a slavish uniformity. This means of aid about which the hon. member waxed so lyrical is, as I have said, not an extra-ordinary means of aid. In this respect I want to associate myself with the words of the hon. member for Randfontein. This means of aid can never replace the teacher. The hon. member said a short while ago that the problem of the shortage of teachers can be solved by means of television. I just want to tell the hon. member what a misconception, what a ridiculous remark that was. The teacher cannot be replaced. The teacher cannot be replaced by any means of aid. That hon. member may know a great deal about other matters but I truly believe, and when he makes a statement like that, it convinces me even more, that he knows nothing about education.</p>

<p><span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0471"/>But, Sir, the hon. member probably has an ulterior motive for introducing this motion. The hon. member probably regards this as the thin end of the wedge. If television were introduced for educational purposes, it could pave the way for its general introduction. That is why I detect an ulterior motive in the motion moved by him.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member admits that I am quite correct. I am very grateful to the hon. member for having reacted in such a positive manner to my statement. The second leg of the motion moved by the hon. member reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To take all the steps required to bring all education within easy reach of everyone and to create a population that is generally literate and well-informed.</block>

<p>To me this part of the motion contains an accusation. This accusation is that the present Government does not bring education within easy reach of everyone. When speaking of &#x201C;everyone&#x201D; the hon. member, as he himself also said, naturally means all the other races as well. The hon. member for Randfontein dealt with Bantu education and while the hon. member for Bezuidenhout apparently is such an expert on the Coloured people and matters concerning them, I want to try to tell him in brief what this Government has done over the past number of years as far as education for the Coloured people is concerned.</p>

<p>We all know that Coloured education was transferred to the Department of Coloured Affairs in 1964. The United Party, as the official Opposition, was violently opposed to that. This is still fresh in our memories. We remember the United Party&#x2019;s opposition to that step. The United Party made dire predictions that Coloured education would deteriorate. I wonder whether that still is the attitude of the Opposition&#x003F; The Government, after consultations with prominent Coloured people and authorities on education, felt that all facets of Coloured education, including the University College of the Cape, had to be placed under the control of the Department of Coloured Affairs. Emphasis was laid on how essential it was for Coloured parents in particular to play a leading role and take an active interest in the control of the education of their children by serving on school committees, school boards and even on the Education Council for Coloured Persons, for example. The Education Council for Coloured Persons was established as well as school committees on which Coloured persons serve. The pattern which existed in the primary schools at that time was continued. There were no deviations from the then existing pattern. Enormous progress, particularly in respect of secondary education, has been made since the take-over by the Department of Coloured Affairs and the appointment of a director of Coloured Education. The Department of Coloured Affairs is doing a great deal in respect of academic and vocational education, particularly in respect of the latter in both the technical and commercial spheres. Remarkable progress has been made particularly as far as technical education is concerned. An effective system for the training of apprentices has been evolved in co-operation with the Departments of Labour and of Education, Arts and Science, as the Department of National Education used to be called. The Government is taking active steps to provide the Coloureds with facilities for technical training in order to prepare them in that way for rendering services to the Coloured community in their particular area in the first place and, through that, also to the Republic. Without tiring this House with too many statistics, I should nevertheless like to quote some statistical data in order to illustrate what progress has been made in respect of Coloured education since its take-over by the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<p>In this connection I shall deal with three years only, namely 1962 as the year prior to the take-over, 1964 as the year of the take-over, and 1967. In 1962 there were 1,694 schools for Coloureds. There were 347,730 pupils and 10,793 teachers. In 1964 there were 1,743 schools with a total number of 386,732 pupils. There were 11,686 teachers at that time. In 1967 there were 1,810 schools, 429,526 pupils and 13,358 teachers. I quote these figures merely for the sake of pointing out to you that the number of pupils increased by 11 per cent from 1962 to 1964, and by 23.2 per cent from 1962 to 1967. This represents a constant and steady growth. The Opposition made a big fuss about compulsory education at that time. The Minister concerned made it quite clear at that time that although the Act did leave the door open for compulsory education, it could not possibly be carried into effect because of the fact that the facilities did not exist and because there were not enough Coloured teachers. But I may point out to hon. members that compulsory education is being enforced to a certain extent this year. The Director of Coloured Education informed me that pupils who enrolled with a particular class at the beginning of the year were compelled to attend that class until the end of the year.</p>

<p>What is the position now as far as the University College of the Western Cape is concerned&#x003F; In 1960, 164 students were registered at that university college, of whom 131 were allowed to write the examinations. Of that number of 131, 83 passed. In 1966, 508 students were registered and of that number 431 were allowed to write the examinations and 236 passed. We see, therefore, that 54.8 per cent of those who wrote the examinations passed. In 1967, 566 students were registered, of whom 480 were allowed to write the examinations and 333 students passed; that is an excellent pass figure of 69.4 per cent. I quote these figures merely to illustrate to you what remarkable progress is being made at <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0472"/>university level, what purposeful work that is being done by the lecturers and students and what excellent results are being achieved.</p>

<p>I should very much have liked to discuss Indian education as well, but I notice that my time had almost expired. I should have liked to draw the parallel in that respect as well in order to illustrate to you what progress has been made in Indian education since its takeover by the Department of Indian Affairs. I want to conclude by saying that it is quite clear that the details I have furnished within the short space of time at my disposal, belie the accusations made by the hon. member that we were allegedly neglecting the education of the other groups.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to discuss television as an audio-visual aid in education. We have been warned about that. I do not intend to discuss the progress that has been made in regard to secondary education in South Africa, because the progress that has been made goes to the credit of the provinces.</p>

<p>Primary and secondary education were the function of the provinces and they were responsible for the progress referred to by the hon. member for Randfontein. In this progress no particular political party was solely responsible because in the provinces we had proportional representation. Both parties cooperated in establishing schools and extending the whole system. I am also not going to speak of vocational education because the Government took over vocational education and now it has seen the error of its ways. Vocational education has now been returned to the care of the provinces. I think that on the whole one can avoid discussing those matters.</p>

<p>I should, however, like to refer briefly to a point made by the hon. member for Koedoe-spoort in regard to the education of Coloured children. I do not know a great deal about that but I have discussed the matter with members from the Cape Province who are principally concerned. Their complaint has always been that funds were not available. It was a question of provincial financial relations. I do not think that that falls within the orbit of what we are discussing. I am also not going to fly to the heights and discuss university education. If we are to discuss university education in terms of this motion, we would naturally discuss Unisa, because Unisa has done very valuable work in this direction, But I am not going to discuss the services of Unisa either. I should like to make a special appeal to-day because the hon. the Minister is now responsible for policy in education. I am going to take an aspect of policy and seek his support and sympathy. I want to refer especially to the wording of a particular part of the motion, namely:</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to take cognizance of educational and social developments in other countries &#x2026; and to take all the steps required to bring all education within easy reach of everyone</block>

<p>The other countries to which I am going to refer are not the highly developed countries of Europe or the U.S.A., but countries situated rather as we are situated here. I want to make an appeal for certain children on the platteland We have made very great progress in South Africa in education for our rural population] We have seen the policy as my hon. friend wisely pointed out, whereby we brought the school to the child. We then had the system of small schools. Later we developed the system of transport. That was very well done Throughout the years all this has taken place We are concerned of course about the depopulation of the platteland, which is always a problem in providing education on the platteland. The children I wish to discuss now are those who are not covered even by the provisions we have made so far. I think of the children living on lonely farms. I will give three examples of children of families which have come within my own experience.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to deal with the children of a Native commissioner. As I knew him this Native commissioner lived a lonely life. He had four children, and as these children grew up they had to be educated. They lived many miles from a suitable school. The second example is the children of, for example, men who are working in our national parks. They live there and their children grow up there, but what are they to do about their education&#x003F; The third class is the children living on lonely farms especially in the Karoo. What provision can we make for their education&#x003F; There are people who say that when a child reaches the age of six or seven, he should be sent away as a boarder. Psychologists and parents differ on this matter and when I seek guidance in education I go to the parents. There are some parents who are anxious to give their children early education. They can educate them up to a certain standard. I would say, and the hon. the Minister will understand our professional standards, that they can educate them at home up to say the end of Standard II. Many parents have done that and many parents are capable of doing it. The difficulty is that they are not always well instructed although some of them are. I have been reading the Cape Ordinance on education. because I was thinking particularly of the Karoo, and this is what it says about compulsory education:</p>

<block name="quote">Education is compulsory for children from the age of six years provided that such attendance at school shall not be compulsory for any child if such child is in the opinion of the board under regular and efficient instruction in any other manner, and unless a contrary opinion is expressed by the Department.</block>

<p>I have been told in my travels that the Department says that unless the teacher, the mother <span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_0473"/>or the governess, has a primary teacher&#x2019;s certificate the Department will not accept her as teacher in the system of education. The child must then go to a school. I do not agree with that. There are parents who say that we must keep the child at home, especially on the platteland, so that we can inculcate a love of the land in him. We must inculcate the spirit of &#x201C;O, boereplaas, geboortegrond, jou het ek lief bo alles&#x201D;. Secondly, they feel that the child is not morally and ethically sufficiently developed to leave home at the age of six or seven. But I must say that I have seen children who have gone away to boarding school at the age of six or seven who are living happily and whose parents are quite satisfied. There is another section of parents who do not like this. I am trying to consider them. Ours is not the only country which has this problem. I wish to refer to other countries in the spirit of the motion moved by my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I Should like to see our Education Department, and I feel that it should come from the Central Education Department, assist these parents to educate their children. Provision for that was made in Australia thirty of forty years ago. Lessons were broadcast, but they were not teaching the children; they were teaching the mother. The broadcast is not to the child, but to the mother. Of course television is out of the question. It lacks the range. Television is for the urban population. I am speaking of the radio, which we can use for the mother. In Australia they not only make use of the radio, but also of correspondence courses. Then Australia did this: I remember this being described at our National Conference in 1935. Once a year mothers were given a free ticket to Melbourne or Sydney where they met the people who broadcast and sent them the instructions in the education of their children. Assume for the moment that they were English-speaking children. The mothers would then be taught during the week they spend at Melbourne or Sydney&#x2014;or in our case Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg, Durban, and so on&#x2014;the new methods in their system for arithmetic, or to read the English I.T.A.&#x2014; Initial Teaching Alphabet. They will therefore have this close contact. It is not only Australia that has done that. I am told there are 17 members of the Education staff in Rhodesia broadcasting lessons to parents or even to governesses who might not be fully qualified teachers and helping them through correspondence. I feel something of the sort could be done here. But the educational authorities take un too professional an attitude towards this matter. I like the professional attitude, but I think in this case they insist too much on it. I will give one example&#x2014;a reliable example I am told&#x2014;of a mother who had two children, whom she educated. When the children reached the appropriate age, they were sent to boarding school and eventually to university, where they did very well. Then that mother had a third child&#x2014;what wine farmers call &#x201C;a late harvest&#x201D; and mothers an &#x201C;afterthought&#x201D;&#x2014;whom she was anxious to educate in the same way. But the authorities said, &#x201C;No, you do not have a primary school teacher&#x2019;s certificate.&#x201D; I will tell you what she did have. She had a university degree and a H.O.D. certificate. She had all that, but because she did not have the primary teacher&#x2019;s certificate, the authorities said she could not educate the third child herself. Another important qualification she did have, which I have not mentioned: she was a Nationalist. She felt that she was quite capable of educating her own child. She was an important member of the community, an educated and cultured lady.</p>

<p>I want to help these people. I want the Government to establish a national rural educational correspondence school. After all, what will it cost&#x003F; It will cost the staff of about one primary school, excluding the cost of postage, et cetera. I think we can do that. I am very anxious to have this done. I am also anxious to have the facilities they had in Australia in the early days extended to parents here, namely that once a year they can meet the teachers and the people who conduct the correspondence classes to discuss their problems. They could bring the children along if they wish, perhaps when they go on holiday to the coast. Thereby a very happy relationship could exist between the teachers in the correspondence college and the parents of the children. The hon. the Minister will realize that one cannot extend this to all children, but only where it is possible for the mother to carry out the scheme under the direction of the Department. I have seen children educated in that way. I will mention one example, the case of a Native Commissioner who had three sons and a daughter. The mother educated them up to standard three or four. They then went to a boarding school and all of them did exceptionally well. She was an educated woman and of course, as the hon. the Minister will understand, school-teachers were anxious to help. I did a little to help them too by bringing them in touch with methods and so on. Everybody was prepared to help but that was not organized assistance. I want the thing organized on the lines which I have mentioned. If the hon. the Minister will give his attention to that his staff I think would be able to study the systems in other countries. I hope he will be able to do something for my lonely South African child.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIONAL EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are two matters about which I am very pleased to-day, and the first one is that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has placed this motion on the Order Paper. The second matter about which I am, however, more pleased, is that as a result of this motion we are in a position to furnish the public outside with the correct information. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout submitted a motion here which was really not debated and substantiated properly, and which is in fact still in the air. It was only the hon. member himself who developed the motion uo to a certain point, whereas the other two hon. <span class="col_905-906" refersTo="page_0474"/>members on the opposite side of the House did not give him much assistance as regards the contents of his motion. As regards the hon. member for Kensington&#x2019;s very friendly request, I can give him the assurance that I shall go into that matter. There is in fact something to say for it, but it does not really fall within the scope of this motion. At first I almost felt annoyed at the motion when I read it. However, I was very glad that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout immediately relieved me of my annoyance right at the beginning by admitting frankly and openly that this Government had done its duty in respect of the care for the youth and even in respect of those who had outgrown their youth. With that admission he really &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, but it is so. He intimated that we were not sitting here and growing rusty, but that we were most certainly taking cognizance of what was happening in the world. I may just add to the introductory words used by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that educationalists are regularly sent abroad; there is probably not one single educational magazine which is not being received by all education departments and schools; there is an exchange of learned persons, university graduates and others, and missions are being sent abroad. But one thing this Government and I and my Department will most certainly never do, is to follow overseas ideas slavishly and without more ado, as has already been said.</p>

<p>Nobody is asking for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, we know that you are not asking for that. Even if methods are being applied abroad with the greatest of success, we are taking into account the fact that circumstances in South Africa are totally different. In view of these changed circumstances it does not necessarily follow that successful applications abroad can also be applied here. In this request I can merely point out our strange position. We are a White population with two language groups. Each group has its own culture, educational opportunities and traditions which have been built up throughout the years. We have tremendously great distances. The hon. member for Kensington pointed out that in the rural areas, in the distant Bantu areas, a White child was deprived of opportunities. In spite of that I can, without fear of contradiction, issue a challenge to comparable European countries, namely that in certain respects we are not only keeping pace with them, but are far ahead of them and&#x2014;allow me to mention this&#x2014;we even regard ourselves as leaders. Just think of our physically handicapped in Kimberley, for instance; the school for weak-sighted people in Pretoria; our schools for the cerebral palsied and our educational methods for committed children. This is where we take the lead. It is in this regard that other countries of Europe are coming to see what is being done in South Africa. It is not only so in the field of heart and kidney transplants and other important matters relating to the natural sciences or biology, but also in the field of education. In the motion which was for the greater part debated here by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, reference is made to radio and television &#x201C;to create a population that is generally literate and well-informed&#x201D;, and further it particularly refers to the so-called University of the Air, which was subsequently called the &#x201C;Open University&#x201D;. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout went into raptures in recommending it strongly for consideration and application in South Africa. The hon. member for Randfontein rightly pointed out to him that in spite of the fact that it was not even an accomplished fact as yet, they wanted us to follow suit. It will only be in 1970 &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I know that the hon. member said so. But in spite of that the hon. member wants us to decide at this early stage that we are taking cognizance of that and should also follow suit. It is very likely that the hon. member does not have the same information I have at my disposal. I have clippings here taken from British publications which are already raising their misgivings. According to the White Paper which has been tabled in the British Parliament and of which we are also aware, it is clear that so far they have not even reached unanimity in regard to the matter as a whole. But let us leave it there. But what worries me, is that we have had no evidence of a truly profound study of the subject on the part of the hon. Opposition&#x2014; something one would at least have expected from the introducer of the motion&#x2014;and that he did not distinguish between the two forms of education. We have formal and informal education. All I heard here, was that the formal aspect was only touched upon indirectly. And this is really the main point of education. We shall deal with informal education later. It is unnecessary for me to give a lengthy account here. Any educationalist or anybody who wants to risk talking about a motion on education, should at least know the difference between formal and informal education. And now I should like to read out just one quotation. In a discussion of the open university in the magazine <i>New Education,</i> dated August, 1967, the author says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The attempt to provide with the same instrument for two groups of people with quite separate needs and goals will surely result in failure and waste, both for the individual and for the community.</block>

<p>And that is exactly where the trouble will start. If an attempt should be made by means of any form of television, or by means of the radio or even by means of films, to achieve immediately <span class="col_907-908" refersTo="page_0475"/>the same goal and the same results with these two types, then it would not succeed, as I shall indicate in a moment in my further discussion. Let us look first of all at the question of informal education. An aim of the British Open University is to contribute to the educational, cultural and professional standards of any person who wants to look and listen. This is the real major aim. This is a praiseworthy ideal which nobody can criticize. The general public, the post-school public, the man and woman who really want to be an asset do the country, never stop learning. The hon. member for Kensington is a person who is still studying and is still making progress.</p>

<p>There is hope yet for the future.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He is always improving and is always talking more sensibly. Now, in the field of this informal education and of the culture of the country, the State is continuously doing a tremendous amount. I can call it a praiseworthy ideal when any attempt is made at bringing knowledge home to the population. But we are doing a great deal. In the references made here to-day to the Broadcasting Corporation and its contribution, there has not been very much evidence of praise and conviction. I think it was the hon. member for Durban (Central) who pointed out that more should be done for the housewife. But I can say that the regular listeners to the radio can learn a tremendous amount. Unfortunately we are too busy and too tied down, but during the holidays when we can in fact make use of the radio, that institution does its duty thoroughly. We have the Department of Cultural Affairs, adult education with its organisers in this field, the cultural agreements with certain Western countries, the visits of learned persons to our country, the colleges for advanced technical education where everybody can continue their studies after std. 10, colleges for vocational education and aided schools. A whole series of informal educational courses is offered. Often at our universities open lectures are Offered, lectures which do not have a specific bearing on a certain subject. In regard to the colleges for advanced technical education, I can say that if there are only 15 persons in a group&#x2014;no matter where they may be living&#x2014; a course can be introduced. In this way approximately 8 courses have already been introduced in Pretoria. I can only say that everybody who wants to listen and who wants to attend classes and learn, is being afforded good opportunities for enriching and enhancing in an informal way his educational, cultural and professional life. But as far as formal education over the air is concerned, I want to make it quite clear that I am not belittling its value. I am not belittling it at all, but on the other hand I do not want to over-estimate it either. I shall try to give my reasons why not. We should not use closed-circuit television, of which the use as a teaching aid has been proved, as an argument for defending the University of the Air. And, incidentally, Professor Viljoen referred to &#x201C;closed-circuit television&#x201D; and not to the Open University of the Air. But I want to say further that it is not such a big secret that this is being used in Pretoria. A few years ago the Transvaal Department of Education sent a mission abroad in connection with closed-circuit television. This is being used in certain training colleges in the Transvaal, and there are a few high schools in the Transvaal where this is being used experimentally. It is openly admitted that this is an expensive installation, but closed-circuit television is really an asset to the educationalist because it enables the student to see and hear, so that the teacher will be able to fulfil his task much more successfully. Audio-visual education is an acknowledged educational aid, but then we should not use it as an argument for the Open University of the Air. We had experience in this country of school radio lessons which subsequently developed into radio-vision lessons. The radio lesson came and later on use was also made of films. The teacher was there, and when it was shown at the right time, when it suited the teacher and could fit into the school programme, it was done. But hon. members know that about a year ago this was abandoned in all the provinces. It is no longer being applied. As an educational aid it proved to be ineffective. Now that it has been stopped there is nothing to take its place. I shall come back to this point later.</p>

<p>Let us look at that Open University of the Air. The English scheme aimed at offering ten major subjects on a two-year basis and an unspecified number of subjects on a one-year basis. I have made a study of their scheme. What they will be able to obtain, will be a two-year degree, and it will consist of eight courses. Our university degrees in South Africa require a three-year course. Therefore, if we accepted something of that nature, a large number of third-year courses would have to be added. Along with the radio and television lectures&#x2014;this is also the British system which they are envisaging&#x2014;correspondence lectures will have to be provided, and they regard these as indispensable. During a conference on the Open University of the Air, Mr. D. Jackson, director of the National Extension College in Cambridge, said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crucial element in the University of the Air would be correspondence tuition.</block>

<p>It cannot be visual only; it has to be followed up by correspondence. In these studies which will have to be done according to this method by the student who wants to obtain a degree, the most important part is not what is presented, but self-study and the handing-in of assignments which will have to be corrected by experts. The fact that the correspondence section will quite easily be the most important element of such a university, is also proved by the experience gained by the Chicago City Junior College, where during the first eight years of their experiment only 95 students obtained a degree exclusively by means of television <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_0476"/>tuition. Please note, only 95&#x2014;and this was done experimentally&#x2014;obtained a degree in a case where use was made of television exclusively, whereas the number of people viewing those television broadcasts in 1964, was estimated at 200,000. Surely, this is a damning figure. This proves that through television alone one cannot achieve good results. This is the first point.</p>

<p>But now I shall deal with a second difficulty. Did the hon. member for Bezuidenhout take the trouble to calculate the cost of this Open University of the Air he is recommending&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>But England bears the costs, and that is probably why it is bankrupt.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We are not bankrupt, but the hon. member should just listen a moment to what I have to say before we decide to do such a thing. The cost of such a university was obviously not taken into account by the hon. member. It was calculated in England that up to six television channels would be necessary in the morning and at least one extra channel for the whole day. Mrs. Lee, who is handling the entire matter, calculated it in this way. The capital cost of such an extra channel in England is estimated at R60 million, for one channel only. Now we must see what services we can provide with that R60 million and what the services are we are providing to-day. The hon. member should listen attentively, then he will realise that it is a very ill-considered idea. If we had had television, such a channel would probably have cost in the vicinity of R100 million owing to the great distances and the size of our country. Lectures over 40 weeks per year and eight hours per day for five days per week give us a total of 1,600 lecture hours per year. That would require one television channel. One channel will give us 1,600 lecture hours per year, and it will cost R100 million. But now I just want to compare this with a few figures I have been able to obtain in the short while since this motion was placed on the Order Paper. Compare this with the 10.000 lectures of 40 minutes each which the University of Pretoria offers its pre-graduate extra-mural students. One channel gives us 1,600 hours only, but Pretoria&#x2019;s extra-mural section alone provides 10,000 lectures of 40 minutes each solely in respect of its extra-mural students. And take the University of South Africa which would have served the purpose of the correspondence section They offer 547 pre-graduate courses. Only one lecture each of 40 minutes per subject per week would require more than 14,000 broadcasting hours. Now the hon. member should work out for himself what it will cost As regards the running costs of the Open University of the Air, the British Minister of Education calculated that it would be between R6 million and R8 million per year. Add to this the interest on the capital investment. I made my own calculation, and do you know what I found&#x003F; If we were to use the amount it would cost to introduce such a service in South Africa for ordinary education, then we would have been able to grant a bursary of at least R1,000 to each matriculant in this country, White and non-White, every year. Is this not clear proof of the rashness of this motion&#x003F; That is what one finds when a person goes to England, spends a few weeks there, sees and hears television and then thinks that he has found something with which he can corner the National Government and with which he can turn the nation&#x2019;s head, because there are a lot of &#x201C;verkramptes&#x201D; or conservatives here who do not want television in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker,_i_shall_conclude_by_asking_the_following_question">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Speaker, I shall conclude by asking the following question</person>:</from>

<p>Is there any need in this country for such formal university training over the air&#x003F; My reply is a definite no; it is unnecessary and this is so for the following reasons: The State, the universities, all other bodies and private persons are doing a great deal to make bursaries and loans available to students. Some universities offer extra-mural courses. The University of South Africa offers excellent correspondence tuition. Mr. C. A. Bedemeyer, a world recognised expert in the sphere of this type of education, recently spent three months at the University of South Africa, and he found that as far as the activities of the University of South Africa were concerned, South Africa was the leader; not a follower, but a leader. When necessary we establish new universities. In the past few years we established two universities. In fact, one of them will be opened officially on Saturday. Radio and television can be aids for class teaching, but as the hon. member for Koedoespoort said, they can never become a substitute; that is simply impossible. They are additional but they can never become the chief aim of education. The hon. member for Kensington will be the first to agree with me. Those people whose heads are being turned by television or audio-visual teaching aids, are betraying their ignorance, because the personal contact between master and child can never be eliminated.</p>
