<heading>ARMAMENTS DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION BILL</heading>

<p>Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>To omit the definition of &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; and to substitute the following definition:</p>

<block name="quote">(i) &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; means any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, weapon, bomb, ammunition, instrument or technical equipment for military, naval or air force purposes or any component or raw material of whatever nature capable of being used in the manufacture thereof; (iv).</block>

<p>The effect is to omit the proposed definition of &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; as defined in the original <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="#page_1118"/>Munitions Production Act. I do so because this definition as it stands in the Munitions Production Act was designed to cover all the requirements of the armed forces and to enable the Munitions Board, now the Armaments Board, to purchase whatever was required of any type and from any source. That was in order and it was accepted, but the extension of that Act to production now creates a different set of circumstances. We are now expanding, by subsidization, the operation of the Munitions Board into a wider field than it covered originally with the purely State-owned factories. I should like to put it to the hon. the Minister that the proposed amendment gives him scope to handle every item which is likely, as we see it, to be needed to be manufactured by State-subsidized industries or any industry which will be created, expanded or operated in terms of the Bill. Without taking the matter further at this stage I would like the hon. the Minister to say whether there is in fact anything which would not be covered by this amendment. I realize that in a later clause we will deal with the question of consultation, which may to a certain extent meet the situation. But we feel that this definition inserts in the Bill what the Minister has said to be the intention of his Department and of himself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>When one considers the amendment that has just been moved, it is necessary to look at the definition of the word &#x201C;munitions&#x201D; in the original Act of 1964. That definition reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Munitions&#x201D; means any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, bomb, ammunition or weapon or any material, raw material, component or article of whatever nature capable of being used in the manufacture thereof or for defence force purposes or other purposes determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs.</block>

<p>It is also interesting to note, particularly in column 8515 of the 1964 Hansard, that this same hon. member for Durban (Point) who has now moved this amendment, strongly insisted that provisions should be made in the various clauses for reference to the Minister of Economic Affairs. But what is important here, is the &#x201C;other purposes&#x201D; for which it may also be used. The amendment now before the Committee, reads that &#x201C; &#x2018;armaments&#x2019; means any vessel, vehicle, etc.&#x201D;, but the crux of this is &#x201C;for military, naval or air force purposes&#x201D;. In other words, by his amendment the hon. member is limiting the definition of the word &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; to armaments for military, naval or air force purposes&#x2014;nothing more. Therefore it may only be used for that limited purpose. But that is not the intention of this legislation. The definition of the word &#x201C;armaments&#x201D;, as now proposed by the hon. member, in fact negatives the objectives of this legislation. If we have to confine ourselves to the manufacturing of armaments for military, naval or air force purposes, then it cannot meet all contingencies as provided in the original Act and also in this Bill. This measure makes provision for much wider contingencies. For example, one thinks of the combating of terrorist activities. If the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is accepted, it will mean that armaments may not be manufactured and produced for the combating of terrorist activities. We are not in a state of war at the moment, but at certain places within our own borders we have to act as though we are. But we cannot apply the definition proposed by the hon. member for those purposes. We are now in the situation that this armaments corporation will have to manufacture armaments to be used, for instance, by our Police in South West Africa. That is not for military purposes. Furthermore, if one looks at the objects of the legislation and if one takes into account what the hon. Minister said on this matter in his second-reading speech, and particularly if one looks at clause 3, then it is very clear that the objects include the export of armaments. The armaments which can and possibly will be exported, may, for instance, include ammunition supplied to friendly countries, ammunition which may be used in those countries for non-military purposes. It may be in our interests to export that ammunition in terms of the objects of this Bill, but this could then not be done because it would not be used for military purposes. A further object of the Bill is, for example, to supply arms and ammunition to the public. This, too, is not included under &#x201C;military, naval or air force purposes&#x201D;. Furthermore, this Bill is specifically intended to support private industry which is to manufacture arms and ammunition which may be used for private purposes, but if the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is accepted, it will negative the entire object of this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Potchefstroom has given the hon. member for Durban (Point) a conclusive reply. I furthermore want to point out to the hon. member that this particular section was contained in the Act relating to the Munitions Production Board all these years. In other words, that Board possessed these same powers. No objection was ever raised against the Board having to perform these functions. I explained here yesterday that we are living in a time in which tremendous progress is being made in the technological field and also in the scientific field. If we are going to allow ourselves to be limited because of spectres which we conjure up in this regard at this stage, then neither we nor this Armaments Development Corporation will be prepared for future contingencies. In the second place there is a safety-valve, because action will only be taken in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs. If I accept the argument and amendment put forward by the hon. member for Durban (Point), <span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="#page_1119"/>it will mean, in the third place, that the definition of &#x201C;armaments&#x201D; in the Act which establishes the Armaments Board, will differ from the definition contained in the Act which establishes the Armaments Development Corporation. Then there will be two different definitions of the same thing. I think this will only create confusion. The Armaments Development Corporation will only act after the Armaments Board has made certain recommendations to the Minister. I think, in order to be logical, we must retain the definition as it has been all these years, and it must be the same in both cases. Accordingly I regret that I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I see the Minister&#x2019;s point inasmuch as it is desirable to have the same definition in the two measures. But there is nevertheless a difference. The one is a procurement organization whilst the other is a manufacturing organization.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>In the past it was a manufacturing organization too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It was manufacturing in state factories, that is correct. But it did not have any power to expand into the field of private enterprise. We should like to know what sort of operation the hon. the Minister has in mind which would not be covered by the proposed amended definition. If he can give us some indication he may be able to satisfy us that it is in fact necessary to have the wider definition.</p>

<p>The argument of the hon. member for Potchefstroom is not valid because, provided manufacture is for military purposes in the first instance, surpluses can always be sold to the public or exported or whatever the case may be. What we are trying to get is an indication in the measure itself that the purpose is to deal solely with military, naval and air force requirements. Weapons or ammunition or whatever it may be could be sold to the public, or could be exported; I am talking about surplus stocks now. As I see it, those items would not be excluded by this definition, provided they were items required in the first instance for military, naval or air force purposes. The definition is very wide indeed and covers any bomb, aircraft, weapon, ammunition, instrument or technical equipment. That seems to cover the whole field. Could the Minister say what he has in mind, what he envisages which would be excluded in terms of the proposed amendment?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with a little bit of imagination it should not be difficult to reply to the hon. member for Durban (Point) on this. One gets the impression that he is still trying to protect his shoe factory, as he did in the second-reading debate yesterday. He seems to be afraid that the hon. the Minister is going to establish a shoe factory which will land him in difficulties. Let us consider only one field now, namely that of electronics. The Defence Force is an extremely large consumer of electronic equipment. There is, of course, tremendous diversification in the manufacturing industry in this field. If one takes all this into account, then no imagination is required to see a number of purely civil manufacturing processes which are going to become suppliers of electronic equipment to the Defence Force. It is a tremendously wide field.</p>

<p>When does the hon. member want the definition to be applied as he formulated it in his amendment? Let us analyze his amendment. He wants to prescribe specific limits, in contrast to the original section, which leaves it to the discretion of the Minister. There is a safety-valve. The hon. the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs, must from time to time determine the limits in respect of military use. If we were to accept this amendment, we would deprive the Minister of those discretionary powers and we would limit the Minister to the manufacturing of such articles as are defined in this particular clause. If we were to do that, we would have no discretion as to what is purely military equipment and what is not. We would again be faced with the problem that, when the Defence Force required anything and it bordered upon the definition as contained in the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, or, on the other hand, in the case of a purely civil article that has military applications, we would have to have somebody who could judge whether this article was a purely military requirement or not. As the definition reads at present, we have that safety-valve. As a matter of fact, we have a double safety-valve. We have the hon. the Minister who may determine a requirement through the agency of his Armaments Board and who in consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs, decides whether it is a military requirement. If we were to accept the amendment, then that right and that discretionary power would fall away. Then we would be pegged down and we would have to amend this law again in the case of such an eventuality arising.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer the hon. member for Durban (Point) to the provisions of the principal Act in regard to the Armaments Board. If the hon. member would care to look at section 4 (c), he would find the following:</p>

<block name="quote">(c) In consultation with the State Tender Board &#x2026;</block>

<p>and we have altered this now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to enter into agreements with persons within or outside the Republic for the manufacture or supply of munitions or anything (except patent rights) required in connection with the manufacture <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="#page_1120"/>of munitions, either by the board or by any person with whom the board has entered or proposes to enter into an agreement for the manufacture thereof;</block>

<p>Section 4 (e) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">(e) To take such steps for the promotion of the manufacture of munitions as the board may consider necessary;</block>

<p>In other words, this was a power possessed by the Armaments Board up to the present. It performed this function. The board not only had an interest in two factories which fell directly under it. The board also had other interests. It also took the initiative by making funds available for the development of other articles. But now the hon. member is asking me to give him some examples. I can easily give him probably 10 or 12 examples of this. The hon. member expressed his concern yesterday about the manufacturing of, for example, shoes. He mentioned an absurd example, but there is, for example, headgear which is perhaps in general use. It may be any other garment which is commonly used by the public, but which, with some modification or another, which is the property of the Armaments Board or the Development Corporation, may be applied in such a way that one would prefer not to make it available in that form to the general public. In that connection there may have been a new development by means of which the safety of our troops may be increased. Then we must have these powers. This may apply in the case of parachutes, which are used by the general public to-day and which are also manufactured by private industry. It may apply in the case of several articles which in the normal course of events are generally used by the public in their normal form, but which after a small modification do not necessarily fall under the strict classification of military purposes for the Army, Air Force or Navy, and in respect of which one must retain control over the modification which has been introduced. Since we know that we are on the eve of tremendous developments, in the electronics industry as well, we simply do not want to close the door so that we will find that our hands are tied when we have to act in the interests of the security of South Africa. That is the intention of this.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 12, page 5, after &#x201C;&#x2019;Minister&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;after consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The Minister indicated during the second-reading debate that he would accept a limitation requiring consultation with the Minister of Economic Affairs to meet us part-way in regard to the questions of definition and powers. For that reason we did not press our amendment to clause 1 dealing with the definition, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment as it is proposed.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on page 366 of the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;session&#x201D; in line 26 to the end of subsection (4) and to substitute the following proviso:</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Minister may delete from the copy of the report so laid upon the Table any names of suppliers, details of <span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="#page_1121"/>armaments or confidential information other than financial figures if he considers that the disclosure thereof may jeopardize the safety of the State.</block>

<p>Referring to the principal clause, one finds that, after the word &#x201C;session&#x201D; in line 26 it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; unless disclosure of any such report may in the opinion of the Minister jeopardize the safety of the State.</block>

<p>Under the Minister&#x2019;s clause, as it now stands, if anything in the report will jeopardize the safety of the State, we are going to get no report at all. That is the effect of the clause as it now stands. Under my amendment, if the Minister finds anything in the report which may jeopardize the safety of the State, he may delete that portion of the report and table the rest of the report. Then the House can have as much information as may be made available. Under the present circumstances, the House will not get any report at all if there are only one or two lines, the disclosure of which may jeopardize the safety of the State. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which I have moved, in preference to the clause as it now stands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#le_grange">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member intimated that actually his amendment only boiled down to the fact that the hon. the Minister could leave out those portions of the report which he considered it in the interests of the safety of the State not to disclose, and then table the rest of the report. But it is not so simple if one looks at the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. The hon. member&#x2019;s amendment amounts to this, that the hon. the Minister can omit the names of the suppliers, details of armaments and confidential information, but must disclose the particulars of the financial figures. In other words, the hon. the Minister can omit seven-eighths of the report because it is in the interests of the country&#x2019;s safety not to disclose it here, but he must make the figures available. If something of this nature were ever accepted by this House it would surely give rise to absurdities. I want to refer to the White Paper published in 1964-&#x2019;65. The Minister must now omit his references to suppliers, armaments and confidential information in such a report. This web of figures must then be submitted to the House. I think that the hon. member&#x2019;s proposal amounts to an under-estimation of the intelligence of the hon. the Minister and this House, if that is what it boils down to. Hon. members opposite have already been pleading for years&#x2014;what they said yesterday during the debate was virtually said word for word during the debates of 1964 by the hon. member for Durban (Point) and the hon. member for Pinetown&#x2014;for the appointment of a Select Committee on Defence, and for financial reports to Parliament by the hon. the Minister. All that remained was for them now to come with this ridiculous amendment which boils down to the fact that the hon. the Minister should annually make virtually a fool of himself and his officials in submitting a statement to Parliament which is just a heap of figures.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not agree with the hon. member. Surely the hon. the Minister is responsible for accounting to this House for the amount of money which has been spent by his organization. Surely the hon. the Minister does not intend to keep us in the dark altogether? If the hon. the Minister so wishes, all he has to do is to find one item in that report which he regards as detrimental to the safety of the State, and he will give us no report at all. If that is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention he is trifling with the House. Then he does not intend to give us any information. If there is one clause in that report, and it is damaging to the State, we get no report at all. At least we are entitled to get the figures to see what was spent during the course of the year, and how it was spent. I reject the argument put up by the hon. member, and I suggest that the hon. the Minister reconsiders this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pinetown&#x2019;s argument is surely quite incorrect. The subsection referred to by the hon. member reads as follows: &#x201C;As soon as may be after the completion of every audit the Board shall furnish the Minister with the report of the auditor containing such particulars as may be prescribed by the regulations &#x2026;&#x201D; The additional report is then proceeded to. Surely we receive an audited report in every case. The hon. the Minister has an audited report in every case, and it is clearly stated in the subsection: &#x201C;containing such particulars as may be prescribed by the regulations&#x201D;. After all, a report is submitted in every case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Who are &#x201C;we&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to Parliament at the moment. Surely, that audited report is available in every case. In addition the hon. the Minister may submit a further report containing the details, if in his opinion it is not harmful to the country. The hon. member for Potchefstroom very clearly said what would happen if we accepted the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. Let us consider the argument about harm to the country. If a purely financial report is submitted which reveals to the world in the finest financial details the productivity of the corporation in the financial field, one can gauge the activities of this organization precisely to the very last <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="#page_1122"/>cent. One can then determine in respect of every cent they spent, in the minutest detail how and on what it was spent. It is then not necessary for us to guard against harm being done to the country. By means of financial figures which require only a minimum of interpretation, we shall then in any case disclose every possible activity of this corporation. The imposition of an obligation in respect of the disclosure of the financial figures therefore cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>The financial reports may contain facts and disclose details which the hon. the Minister regards as harmful to the country. Some of the greatest secrets in regard to this corporation&#x2019;s activities may be disclosed in this way. It is most surely not the intention of the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment that this should be brought about. We should leave it to the hon. the Minister to decide whether or not to make particulars, financial or otherwise, which are in the country&#x2019;s interests, available to this House. This is not a new principle; it is an old principle of defence budgets, of the Defence Department&#x2019;s reports throughout the years, that the Minister concerned decides what is in the interests of the country and what is not. That principle is in no way being assailed and should be accepted as such. We cannot place an obligation on the hon. the Minister to submit such a report without exercising his discretion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just spoken, is of course talking utter nonsense&#x2014;complete and utter nonsense. In the first instance he says &#x201C;Ons sal &#x2019;n finansi&#x00EB;le verslag kry&#x201D;. That is quite untrue. A report will be lodged with the Minister, and not with us as Parliament. However much the hon. member may wish that the hon. the Minister was Parliament, this Parliament is still the mouthpiece of the people. It is still responsible for the taxpayers&#x2019; money and for watching over and commenting upon the expenditure of the Government. It will be a tragic day for South Africa when a Minister becomes identified as substituting for Parliament. In the first instance it is incorrect that Parliament will get the figures. In the second instance both the hon. member for Middelburg and the hon. member for Potchefstroom have stated that a report will be ridiculous if it just had figures. It would take very little intelligence, and perhaps we could help them if they cannot work it out for themselves, to draw up a report which indicates expenditure by stating &#x201C;Purchases: confidential purchase &#x2014;and then the amount; Support for X company for manufacture&#x2014;and the amount.&#x201D; We Will then be able to see what is being spent. We are being asked blindly, to vote R100 million, and then never again in the future to hear a word about it. In 1964 we asked for a similar provision, but we accepted the provision as it is now proposed to be repeated. We have in fact not had a report. The hon. the Minister therefore has made it clear by not having tabled a report in the past, that he has no intention of tabling a report in future. We are therefore asking for provision for us to get some information, other than an occasional handout in a White Paper which covers what the Minister wants to disclose, on an initial amount of R100 million, which the hon. the Minister himself has said is only a token allocation and will become much more.</p>

<p>When we come to voting the Budget for Defence, it does not say so much for Mirages and so much for Buccaneers and so much for this or that. It just refers to the purchase of aircraft and a globular sum is given, and Parliament votes it. It votes each item group specifically and individually, as a group allocated to a heading. If it is possible for us to vote the R256 million which is spent every year by Defence under certain heads, surely the least that Parliament can ask is to be told how this money will be spent. If the name of the person is suppressed then the type of expenditure that is taking place should be given instead of asking us for a blank cheque. I know hon. members will say that we must trust the Minister. I am sorry. I do not care whether you trust the Minister or not, but Parliament lays down a procedure. You can have the greatest confidence in the Minister, but that does not derogate from Parliament&#x2019;s right to demand information on the expenditure of money. It is not a question of trust or otherwise. It is not a question of handing over funds and saying everything will be safe in the Minister&#x2019;s hands. It is a question of principle, the principle of Parliament controlling the expenditure of the money extracted from the public in the form of taxation. That is our job; that is how the system works, and we should be chary of any departure from the right of Parliament to examine the spending of public money.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) should really not try to present himself here as being so intellectual or so academically minded. A few moments ago he did not even know the difference between &#x201C;in consultation&#x201D; and &#x201C;after consultation&#x201D;. If the Chair had not helped him out of his difficulty, he would still have been standing there without knowing which way to go.</p>

<p>This hon. member as well as other hon. members opposite are very concerned that the Minister should now be taking the responsibility in respect of these financial reports which must be submitted, but it is important to note that in actual fact the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in any legislation is interpreted as meaning the Cabinet. It is therefore not the person who is the Minister of any specific portfolio who alone is responsible for this, but the entire Cabinet.</p>

<p>With all respect to the hon. the Minister, we are all convinced and satisfied that no Minister, and not this <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="#page_1123"/>Minister either, would be so irresponsible as to carry the responsibility alone where these large amounts are involved. The entire House, including hon. members opposite, ought to have the fullest confidence that these reports will be considered by the entire Cabinet, and we on this side of the House have sufficient faith in the Cabinet and in this Government of ours to know that these matters which are disclosed to them in confidence and which in the interests of the country they cannot divulge, must remain so. And we have sufficient assurance in this connection. We received assurance that White Papers will be published from time to time. We have received that assurance, and we also know how the Armaments Board will function and how it will requisition its supplies and what evaluation they will make. We also know how the matter will get to the Armaments Corporation. There is still the Controller and Auditor-General and there is the Select Committee on Public Accounts, and then matters are still submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister. Therefore it is my view that sufficient assurances have been given to this House by the Government for the House to accept that the provisions of the clause as it stands are in order and will suffice.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Pinetown is asking me is this. When I receive an annual report from the Development Corporation, and the Corporation states in that report that they spent so many million rands or so many thousand rands on the manufacture of such a quantity of this equipment or armament, and they manufactured it in collaboration with so and so, or they had it manufactured themselves by this factory, then he says according to this amendment of his that I may omit from that report the details, &#x201C;&#x2026; any names of suppliers, details of armaments or confidential information&#x201D;. If you omit the name of the manufacturer with whom you are collaborating, but you say that you have ordered or made so many of these specific kinds of bombs or rockets or projectiles, then the whole world immediately knows from whom you obtained them. If I say that I spent so much on so many projectiles, so many bombs, so many armoured cars, so many aircraft, so many fighters, so many bombers, or I spent it on such a certain type of electronic equipment on ships or armament systems, then, although I omit the names, by the very fact that I identify those objects, I already divulge our source. And in doing so we shall be playing the most dangerous game of all times. Do hon. members not realize that South Africa is under an arms boycott at the moment, and do they not realize that South Africa&#x2019;s friends in the world are under pressure to boycott us? Does it pass hon. members by?</p>

<p>Now, what are we doing to safeguard the rights of Parliament? In the first place we are coming to Parliament and saying that we shall establish a corporation at the head of which we shall place responsible members of a directorate. We will not issue share capital to any parties other than the State, and this Parliament will decide about the issuing of share capital. But I went further yesterday and said that I would try to inform Parliament as far as possible, and I have done so to date, last year by means of a White Paper and this year by means of a policy statement in the Other Place, and it is my intention to continue doing so. But in that case we can prepare a properly compiled document which will have sense in it. If, however. I must prepare an annual report containing a whole series of figures and I say that so much went for aircraft, the hon. member for Pinetown will get up and ask what kind of aircraft I ordered. If I say that I regret that I am unable to tell him because this is the first instalment which we are paying on those aircraft, he will say that he wants to know what kind of aircraft they are, because it is his right as a member of Parliament to know whether they are the best kind of aircraft. Then the hon. member argues with me, and we are both laymen, as to whether they are the best kind of aircraft. What do we achieve by that? We achieve only one thing by that, and that is that we disclose our confidential defence matters to the public and to the whole world. Hon. members may say to me that it happens in other countries, and why not in South Africa? The reason is that the other powers are great powers which can afford to blurt these things out, but South Africa cannot always afford to do so. Here is no question of unnecessary secrecy, but it is simply a fact that we do not always live in a period of cold war only, and the hon. member for Pinetown knows it. We are no longer living in a cold war only; we are living in a world situation in which there is no longer a proper demarcation between peace and war. Therefore the State, and State institutions of this kind, must have powers which would not be requested under ordinary circumstances. This is my reply to the hon. member. I cannot possibly accept this illogical amendment of his. I think it would be irresponsible of me to do so.</p>

<p>We are very anxious to get some form of parliamentary control. If the Minister does not want any parliamentary control he should say so. We are anxious to get it and we want to help the Minister with this Bill. We want to get adequate information, having regard to the safety of the State. We know from experience in the past that money can be spent in the wrong way and wasted by a State Department of this kind. The Minister knows from reports which he had recently from the United States that in the United States there has been very caustic criticism by a joint committee of both sides of the House dealing with Defence expenditure, and only a year or two ago there were very serious criticisms in Britain of Defence contracts awarded to one of the big aeroplane factories, and a substantial refund had to be made by an overseas firm to the British Government. When we know that things of this kind take place in peace-time in the United States of America and in Britain, surely we must act with a full sense of responsibility and not simply say that it cannot happen here. We are asking for parliamentary control and we are asking the Minister to accept our <i>bona fides</i> in this matter and to give us better control than is envisaged in the clauses which are before us to-day.</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Minister may delete from the copy of the report so laid upon the Table any names of suppliers, details of armaments or confidential information other than financial figures if he considers that the disclosure thereof may jeopardize the safety of the State.</block>

<p>In effect circumstances may develop in which it is necessary for the hon. the Minister, the Supreme Command and the Armaments Board to refuse to make this information available, and all that remains then is a set of financial figures, in which the hon. member said a moment ago he was not interested; he wants the other particulars. In the preceding clauses, which have already been approved, it is specifically provided that the objects of the corporation are to meet as effectively and economically as may be feasible the armaments requirements of the Republic; then the composition of the directorate of the corporation which must deal with this matter is set out. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs must also be consulted in this matter. The Supreme Command must be consulted. There is a long list of responsible persons who will from time to time deal with highly secret information, and from the publication of only this financial information which the hon. the Minister may publish in terms of this amendment, any military enemy of the Republic can obtain a mass of information by co-ordinating and analysing it. Surely this is dangerous to the country.

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<p>With reference to the arguments of the hon. member for Pinetown I just want to say that I fully accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the hon. member, but I want to tell him what I told him yesterday. In the first instance this Parliament is a legislative body. This Parliament gets the opportunity under the existing law to exercise the powers that it does exercise. In the first place in regard to moneys voted for this corporation. Parliament gets the opportunity of considering the matter before the money is made available. But this Parliament is not a body which must concern itself with the ordinary administration of such an undertaking and therefore a board of directors is appointed. The hon. member is free, after that board has been composed, to call the Minister to account here on his Vote if he does not have confidence in the board. But Parliament or the State has certain methods by which it has matters handled on its behalf, and one of these is by a board of responsible directors who have to act in accordance with the provisions of the Act passed by this Parliament. Secondly, the State President appoints that board. It is not the Minister alone who appoints it; the Bill provides for that. In other words, the Cabinet as a whole is charged with the task of appointing a responsible board. It seems that our only remaining point of difference is this: the hon. member thinks that this report can be submitted to this Parliament, without <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="#page_1125"/>making a farce of it, by eliminating quite a number of things. I just have to mention a long list of figures and then say, for example, &#x201C;R2 million for aircraft&#x201D;. What does the hon. member want to do with that information? The natural thing for the hon. member to do is to get up with that report in his hand and to say: &#x201C;I want to know what you paid for these aircraft; from whom you bought them; why you bought this particular number; and when they are being delivered&#x201D;. The publication of that information can embarrass not only South Africa, but the hon. member must take my word for it that it can also embarrass our friends, and I am not prepared to have either us or our friends embarrassed. That is why I am adopting this attitude. I want to make an appeal to the hon. member. All possible steps have been taken; I think he has already satisfied himself that both the Government and I are in earnest as regards ensuring that there will be the greatest measure of control in respect of costs, quality and method of acquisition as far as the procurement and manufacture of armaments are concerned, and if the hon. member will also accept my <i>bona fides</i>, I think that in the interests of South Africa we should leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>The Minister has now been caught in his own trap. The Government wants to accept the responsibility, which is a very serious responsibility. We on this side are not happy about this responsibility being theirs alone. In the past we asked the Government to appoint a confidential committee to investigate and report on all matters pertaining to defence. We know there are certain dangers in the world to-day, but Parliament cannot blindly vote money without knowing what is being done with it. It has nothing to do with the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government. I just feel Parliament would be failing in its duty if it did not ask what is happening to the money which it votes. We have had several instances in other countries where State money has been misused and wasted. Therefore I say Parliament has the right to know what happens to money it votes. We on this side are not prepared to vote large sums of money without some form of report as to what is happening to it. The Government over the years has refused to appoint this confidential committee &#x2026;</p>

<p>I feel the responsibilities which the Government alone want to accept at the moment are far beyond them. There may be a day of reckoning, and not only the Government but also the Opposition will get the blame if anything should go wrong. It is our responsibility to know what is happening to this money. We as the Opposition represent 45 per cent of the people of this country. Perhaps the hon. the Minister of Planning has forgotten that. We want to emphasize that and we are going to persist in asking what is happening to money which is voted in this House. We are not here to embarrass the Government. In other countries we find that even though the countries concerned are actually at war, they have to advise their congresses what is happening to public money. If things go wrong, those responsible are dealt with. It is a very heavy responsibility for the Government alone to accept. We as the Opposition will continue to ask over the years what is happening to money that is being spent.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the cat has been let out of the bag again. The hon. members of the Opposition are not so much concerned about this clause; they are rather concerned about something else. They are like naughty children who want sweets and cannot get it and now they are crying about it. The hon. member who has just spoken was ruled out of order in regard to a certain aspect, and therefore I shall not discuss the same topic. However, it boils down to this. The Opposition want this clause to be amended in such a way that they will achieve an object which they cannot achieve in another way. Now this clause must he used for that purpose. They are making a great argument of their being responsible as well, but they do not want to credit the hon. the Minister with the same measure of responsibility. In actual fact they are claiming all the sense of responsibility for themselves. They say they will handle any confidential information with the greatest circumspection, but the Minister is not allowed the discretion of deciding whether something like that is in the interests of the country or not.</p>

<p>What is the basic point of difference in respect of this clause? It relates to one single fact. What is at issue is the discretion of the Minister as to whether the disclosure of something contained in that report is in the interests of the country or not. This is the crux of the difference. Therefore, when we look at the amendment, we see that all this kicking up of dust is solely about this simple fact. However, there is something else behind the smokescreen which is being put up here, and that is <span class="col_4985-4986" refersTo="#page_1126"/>what the hon. member called &#x201C;the joint committee&#x201D;. This is actually what it is about. However, you have ruled that we may not discuss this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) says I am talking nonsense. I think there is a Speaker&#x2019;s ruling that a member may not be called a soapbox orator, but the rural equivalent of that is probably permissible, and that is to call someone an antheap politician. I trust I may use that expression. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is playing his old tricks here of putting up an enormous argument about something. What is it about? He wants joint control in respect of the Defence Force. He wants a joint say in the Defence Force. He wants to use this opening in this clause in order eventually to obtain what they want. They want to share responsibility for the Defence Force with the hon. the Minister. They want to take co-responsibility in the sense of also being able to determine what may be done and what not. Therefore the amendment in its present form is totally unacceptable to this side of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was not going to participate any further in the debate, but I cannot allow the utter nonsense from the hon. member for Middelburg to pass uncontradicted. I want to say to him flatly and without equivocation that none of the intentions which he imputes to us is true. His allegations are totally untrue and I say this to him directly and without equivocation. This attempt to put thoughts and words into the mouths of the Opposition, and to impute to them motives which the hon. member thinks we have, is unworthy of a debate on a matter which is not a political issue but which concerns parliamentary control over R100 million plus much more to follow.</p>

<p>I want to point one thing out before I sit down. The difference between this measure and the Armaments Board is that the board is audited by the Controller and Auditor General. Therefore discrepancies and so forth which are found in the administration of funds will be reported by him. There is therefore some responsibility. But the corporation does not even have that safeguard. That is why we are so anxious that Parliament should have some measure of control over the money which we are being asked to vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we indicated during the second-reading debate that we are opposed to this clause because of the possibility of the extension of prescribed areas throughout the Republic in which case all the relevant legislation, for instance the Urban Areas Act, the Labour Act, the Beer Act, and all the other Acts which can be applied in urban areas, could be applied in the prescribed areas.

<p>That is, of course, what we said when the 1964 Act was passed, I think that the Minister said that this was necessary because of the position which has arisen around Ermelo, where a rural area has now been prescribed which will fall under the administration of the Ermelo Municipality. We have indicated why we are opposed to these provisions. It is because there is a fundamental difference in outlook between our two parties. In reply the Minister said that one of the causes of the trouble at Evaton was that private ownership was allowed there and that it was a slum. The suggestion he made was that the mere fact that you have private ownership brings about slums. That is of course nonsense. If that was so, every private property could become a slum. But steps can be taken to avoid slum conditions by laying down proper regulations. Evaton need not be a slum merely because it is privately owned. Provision can be made by law to control it. The Minister must find a way of doing that. Clause 3 does not apply to Evaton. In his speech yesterday the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to our plea for private ownership and then dealt with the released areas. I do not intend going into the speeches we made in 1964 or the discussion we had yesterday. We are opposed to the extension of this principle and we shall vote against the clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quite understand the attitude of the hon. member for Transkei. They are against our method of control as set out in the Acts of 1964. They do not agree with it and this principle is now being extended by clause 3. I can understand the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude when he says that if they were against the original legislation, they can most certainly not support its extension. I quite understand that, but this is not what we are debating at present. We debated it in 1964, and we can debate it again on the Vote. I therefore do not <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="#page_1127"/>think it is worth the trouble to have a lengthy debate about this. I can only repeat what I said yesterday. Clause 3 serves to give us the powers to control certain concentrations of Bantu which cannot be controlled at present. The one case which is now becoming urgent is the control of the concentration at Camden power station. We have regulations in this connection, but the law advisers are not quite sure whether these regulations are quite legal. All we are doing now, is to grant ourselves the power of asking the Ermelo local authority to exercise control at the Camden power station. In cases where we get such concentrations in future, we can make use of these powers. I do not think there can be any objection to that, except in this respect, as the hon. member said, that they do not agree with our method of control. I agree with him that we need not debate this any further now.</p>

<p>As far as subsection (4) (a) is concerned, the only difference that is going to be made, compared with the old subsection (4) (a) as far as I can see, is that it now excludes Bantu commissioners under the Better Administration of Designated Areas Act (Act 51 of 1963). It excludes the rights and functions given under paragraph (a), but under paragraph (b) he then gives the powers to the board exercised by a Bantu Affairs Commissioner. The new paragraph (b) reads:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="#page_1128"/>All the rights, powers, functions, duties and obligations of an urban local authority or a local Government body or a Bantu Affairs Commissioner under such clause as may from time to time be specified by the Minister by notice in the <i>Gazette &#x2026;</i></block>

<p>Subsection (5) (A) which the Minister is now deleting and which he had proposed to insert in the Act, empowers him to apply the Better Administration of Designated Areas Act to the released areas. He is deleting that. Now I want to know why this was inserted in the clause, to begin with. If it is not necessary, why was it ever inserted in the clause. If it is not necessary, I would like to know from the Deputy Minister how he is going to apply these laws to the released area of Evaton. I understood that he was now governing by virtue of section 25 of the Administration Act of 1927. He was able to do so, because Evaton was declared a Bantu area by proclamation, I think in 1958, so that it could come under the provisions of section 25, which gave the Minister certain powers with regard to scheduled areas. When I suggested to the Minister during the second-reading debate, that he could govern through the Bantu Affairs Commissioner as he is doing now, he by way of interjection said: &#x201C;We are not certain if we are acting legally.&#x201D; If that is so, I would be glad if the Deputy Minister would tell us what enables him now to bring Evaton under the Management Board by passing this clause 4. Where does he get the powers under clause 4 to bring it under the jurisdiction of the Management Board?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, subsection (5) (A) was inserted here in error. It is something that was overlooked, and the law adviser has informed me that it is unnecessary. The powers we are now getting are provided for by section 25 of Act No. 38 of 1927. The regulations of the Management Board of Sebokeng are being legalized by this clause. I am not going to be drawn into an involved legal argument by the hon. member, because, as I must honestly confess, I am not qualified to take part in it. But this is the information I have here. Our law adviser says that this grants us the powers we should like to have.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, of course, I sympathize with the hon. the Deputy Minister. He is at a disadvantage in not having had any legal training, I grant him that at once. But if he had been listening when I spoke now, he would have heard&#x2014;I wish he would listen to me now&#x2014;me saying that I understood that he was governing at the moment under section 25 of the Administration Act of 1927. He has confirmed it now again. I want to remind him that I have asked him how he was going to apply this law, because, when during the second-reading debate I said that he was ruling under section 25, be then said to me by way of interjection: We are not certain if that is legal. What, I asked him, was this: If he is not certain that he is proceeding legally, why does he then continue with this particular clause? Why does he not find some way of bringing in a clause which he is certain will be legal? I do not see any sense in passing a law which the Minister himself during the second-reading debate intimated may not be legal. That is why I want the assurance from him. If he is not certain that he can apply section 25, what is the use of passing this particular section now?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member&#x2019;s question is covered fully by subsection (2), which legalizes the regulations of the Sebokeng Board, which have been declared illegal by the Appeal Court. That is the full reply.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that what was declared invalid in Tlelima&#x2019;s case is now made valid by subsection (2). I would be glad if the Deputy Minister could refer to anything in that subsection which in fact validates what was declared invalid in that case, because Tlelima&#x2019;s case makes it quite clear that in view of the language of section 2 of the Better Administration of Designated Areas Act it is impossible to name as a designated area a released or scheduled area; and I can see nothing whatsoever in subsection (2) which touches upon that subject, certainly as far as a future period is concerned, after a possible validation of acts up to the present time. I concede it is possible that acts done up to the time of this Bill coming into force as an Act may have been validated, but even there I am doubtful. But even assuming that that is so, I see nothing in the language of subsection (2) which will enable the Minister to regard this section of Sebokeng as a designated area; and if he cannot regard it as a designated area I cannot see how he can possibly use the powers that that Act gives for making any regulations under it. This was the very thing which the Court in Tlelima&#x2019;s case held he could not do. It is admittedly a difficult point and one has sympathy with anybody wrestling with the construction of it, but I hope the Deputy Minister will do his best to reply. I hope also he will bear in mind the difficulty of people far less well placed than himself, including the Native people of that area, to know what their rights are in this particular case. But I think it is important to clear it up, because he may be putting legislation on the Statute Book which may not help him substantially, particularly in the future, and it may be necessary, if we pass this clause as it stands, for him to come back to regularize the position in some other way. I hope he will do his best.</p>

<p>The decision of the court gave rise to doubt whether Evaton may be included under the Sebokeng Board, and that is why they said that the regulations of the Sebokeng Board <span class="col_4991-4992" refersTo="#page_1129"/>are not applicable to Evaton. What we are now saying here is that those regulations are in fact applicable. We are not circumventing the decision of the court.

<p>It says &#x201C;and which will be taken in future&#x201D;. Now Evaton is legally included under the Sebokeng Board, under this Act of Parliament which we are now passing, in terms of clause 4 (2). [Interjection.] You are not reading clause 4 (2) correctly. This is the position, and I am no longer going to get myself involved in an intricate, technical legal argument with these two hon. members, because I do not like taking part in a fight I might lose. [Laughter.] It is a very complicated point. The law advisers say that we are right, and we will just have to see what the position in future will be. If it is illegal, they will probably take us to court again, but I have the assurance of very competent law advisers that they will not be able to take us to court again, and I am satisfied with leaving it at that.

<p>He says no, but the result of this is going to be that he will apply the law and he will be taken to court again, and a lot of unnecessary expense will be incurred by the African concerned and we will have to pay the costs again, and it means an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer. The Minister cannot say that we will go ahead now and if it is not legal we will fight it in court again, and if he loses he will come back to change the law again. That is no good. I submit that subsection (2) does not cover the case. Subsection (2) is a retrospective section. All it does is to make the laws already applicable in Sebokeng and Evaton legal, or to attempt, at any rate, to make them legal. It does nothing about the future. In any event, I agree with the hon. member for Pinelands and I am not at all certain that it does legalize the laws already put into effect where the court held that Evaton could not fall under the jurisdiction of this particular board because it could not be defined as a designated area. I must say that this is most unsatisfactory, and we cannot possibly support the clause as it stands now.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has now come clean and told us on what language in subsection (2) he relies to do what he wishes to do, namely to put right what the court found invalid in <i>Tlelima's</i> case. He is relying on the words he read out, i.e. the language of subsection (2), which says that the management board of Sebokeng shall be deemed to be lawfully established with effect from the first day of April, 1965, in accordance with the provisions of section 40<i>bis</i> of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act. I think it is very likely that that management board was perfectly validly established from the very start in terms of that particular ct. <i>Tlelima&#x2019;s</i> case did not deal with that aspect at all; it simply dealt with the fact that the Better Administration of Designated Areas Act, 1963, could not be applied to various sections of the Sebokeng area, and indeed it held that the whole of the regulations made under it were invalid. Consequently we are left with the impression that the Minister can suggest nothing to us in subsection (2) which does in fact put right what the court held to be invalid in <i>Tlelima's</i> case. This leaves us extremely unhappy as to the position. It is generally agreed that this was difficult enough beforehand, but when a clause starts out with, you might say, its parent so doubtful as to its validity, it certainly is going to be a very unhappy section in practice.</p>

<heading>DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT FOR NATIVE NATIONS IN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Much has been written about South West Africa and much more has been said, often by so-called experts who have very little knowledge of the Territory and its peoples, and who, if one has to judge by continued attacks based on half-truths and untenable premises &#x2014;and often on deliberate falsehoods&#x2014;evince no interest whatsoever in ascertaining the true facts</p>

<p>I do not propose to refer by name to any body or person, nor do I propose replying in this debate to all the allegations, but I do invite those concerned to take cognizance of the Government&#x2019;s declared intentions in presenting this Bill. I assure the different nations in South West Africa that the Government has their best interests at heart, and will continue to meet its obligations towards them in all spheres, in particular in the sphere of self-realization, which the Government considers to be the inalienable right of each and every nation.</p>

<p>I have tabled a memorandum dealing with various aspects of the Bill now before the House and, while one does not wish to be repetitive, it will be necessary, in the course of this speech, to deal more fully with matters referred to in that memorandum.</p>

<p>The history of South West Africa is well-known. The early years of strife and inter-group wars have not been forgotten and in many respects the aftermaths are still with us.</p>

<p>In the Northern Sector of the Territory, that is the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland, the Okavango and the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, the different peoples were not involved in inter-group wars to the same extent as in the Southern Sector, and consequently they remained in relative peaceful occupation of the areas traditionally occupied by them, and those areas have ever since been recognized as their traditional homelands.</p>

<p>In the Southern Sector, however, the position was entirely different. Here, there were continual internecine wars, even before the German administration of South West Africa, <span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="#page_1131"/>and it was not until the beginning of the present century that a measure of peace was obtained as between the different groups themselves, and the groups and the German administration. South Africa has governed the Territory as from 1915 after the German forces had capitulated and, in terms of the Mandate allocated to her in 1920, was given the right to administer South West Africa as an integral portion of South Africa.</p>

<p>South Africa found a country having within its borders peoples of different ethnic stock; of different cultures; speaking different languages; on different levels of development and having different forms of government.</p>

<p>On the one hand, there was the highly developed white group, with its modern economy, and modern form of government based on a system developed in the Western countries over hundreds of years. On the other hand, there were the indigenous groups which, in contrast with the white group, applied a subsistence economy, had their own traditional systems of government&#x2014;systems which differed vastly from the system known to and applied by the white group&#x2014;and according to Western standards, the indigenous groups were by far not as highly developed as the white group.</p>

<p>Moreover, great as the differences were between the white group and the indigenous groups in general, there were just as great differences between the groups themselves. They derived from different ethnic stock; spoke different languages and observed different laws and customs.</p>

<p>In the Northern Sector there were groups leading a settled existence in communities organized and governed in accordance with traditional systems; in the Southern Sector there were scattered remnants of groups which had no established forms of government and had largely been crushed and impoverished by the continual wars. Some groups lived a primitive, nomadic life, existing from the proceeds of the hunt and the wild produce of the veld; others were agriculturists, while still others were traditional pastoralists, following the herds wherever suitable grazing could be found.</p>

<p>In the circumstances vast problems faced South Africa in the administration of South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Of the peoples of the Southern Sector, only the Nama, Damara and the Basters had obtained rights in respect of certain land, which, however, was not sufficient for their needs. The result was that relatively few of the members of the different groups in the Southern Sector enjoyed security of tenure, and the resulting nomadic existence was not conducive to the establishment of settled and orderly communities, which is a prerequisite to peace, order and good administration.</p>

<p>Steps were accordingly taken to protect and entrench the interests of the various groups in respect of land. Thus it was provided in section 4 (3) of the Treaty of Peace and South-West Africa Mandate Act, 1919, that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No land within the said territory now or hereafter set apart as a reserve for Natives or Coloured persons shall be alienated save under the authority of Parliament: Provided that nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to prohibit the Governor-General, in respect of land contained in any such reserve, to grant individual title to any person lawfully occupying and entitled to such land,</block>

<p>and following upon the report of the Native Reserves Commission, certain areas were reserved and set apart in 1923 for Native occupation. From time to time more land was reserved and to-day the position is that the land so reserved includes the Northern Sector and some 17 different areas in the Southern Sector, as listed in detail in the memorandum which has been tabled.</p>

<p>Because of various problems with which the administrators of the day were faced, the areas in the Southern Sector were not consolidated homelands, but rather separate and widely scattered areas, some large and some small, intended primarily for sections of the various groups which had congregated in particular regions, where they could enjoy security of tenure and recover from the destructive effects which the existence they had led up to that time had had upon their social and economic structure.</p>

<p>The next matter which demanded immediate attention was the question of the system of government to be applied in respect of South-West Africa. The vast differences existing between the different groups militated against any thought of an integrated society, socially or politically, and this was in fact totally unacceptable to the people.</p>

<p>In regard to the administration of the indigenous groups, it was accordingly decided from the outset to make use of the indigenous political institutions and, where such institutions had disintegrated as a result of the events of the past to which I have referred, to endeavour to re-establish so much thereof as was practicable in the circumstances. In its approach to the problem, South Africa was largely influenced by two factors.</p>

<p>First and foremost, it relied on its own experience in the administration of the affairs of indigenous peoples, where it had been proved over and over that no system of government for an indigenous group could succeed if its traditional political institutions were ignored. Secondly, and perhaps more important as it related to something nearer home in so far as South-West Africa was concerned, the relative peaceful conditions in the Northern Sector, where the traditional systems had remained intact, was abundant proof of the <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="#page_1132"/>effect of traditional political institutions in settled groups.</p>

<p>In the Northern Sector, South Africa, therefore, established a system of indirect control whereby the groups governed themselves in accordance with their own systems, known to and valued by them, under the guidance and with the assistance of officials.</p>

<p>In the Southern Sector, however, there were few traditional leaders and due to the dispersal of the groups over different portions of the Territory, it was necessary to provide for a special form of control for the various reserves which had by then been established. Consequently, the general control over a reserve was vested in the magistrate of the district concerned, whilst the actual day to day supervision was entrusted to a superintendent. Provision was made for headmen to assist the superintendent and, as a means of giving the residents of the reserve an opportunity of participating in the management of their own affairs, Reserve Boards of Native leaders, under the chairmanship of the magistrate or superintendent, were established.</p>

<p>At the time it was considered that the system of reserves and the administration of the reserves that I have just described, would best serve the interests of the indigenous groups, in that it, <i>inter alia</i>, involved the recognition of the identities of the groups and afforded them the opportunity of preserving and fostering their community life and the possibility of progressive development on a foundation of their own culture. The systems so recognized and instituted have served their purposes well.</p>

<p>In the Northern Sector, the system of indirect administration through the peoples&#x2019; own systems has proved its worth over the last 50 years. The policy has not been to force upon any of the groups measures which they are not prepared to accept, but rather to make them appreciate the need for modernization and to change such practices and customs as are in conflict with civilized norms or are not conducive to peaceful administration. In the Southern Sector, cohesion and a return to settled community life and the systems known to the people, have been fostered by the method of administration introduced in the reserves.</p>

<p>In recent years it became increasingly evident, however, that conditions in South-West Africa were developing to a stage where accelerated and co-ordinated application of the constructive aspects of a suitably adapted concept of development was becoming possible and highly desirable&#x2014;in fact, the people themselves were asking for changes and opportunities for development. Consequently a commission, known as the Odendaal Commission, was appointed during September, 1962, to investigate the conditions of the inhabitants of South-West Africa, and particularly the non-white inhabitants, and to make recommendations in regard to their further advancement.</p>

<p>The commission submitted a comprehensive report, which was tabled in Parliament on the 27th January, 1964, and on the 29th April, 1964, the Government tabled a memorandum setting out its attitude towards the Commission&#x2019;s recommendations.</p>

<p>For various reasons the Government refrained from taking any decisions at that time in respect of the Commission&#x2019;s recommendations concerning the constitution of self-governing areas for the different Native groups, the demarcation of their boundaries and the changes in their form of government. However, as a result of subsequent developments the Government is now in a position to take positive steps in regard to those matters, and I shall deal with the relative recommendations in the order I have just mentioned, namely (a) the creation of self-governing areas; (b) the boundaries of the areas; and (c) the changes in the forms of government.</p>

<p>I come to the first recommendation, that is the creation of self-governing areas.</p>

<p>We are faced with the position that, by the fact of history and by the fact of birth, there are different peoples or nations within South-West Africa; peoples who differ ethnically and culturally; peoples who speak different languages; peoples who by choice prefer to live in homogeneous communities; peoples who are in fact nations and are entitled to treatment as such.</p>

<p>And it is the firm conviction of this Government that it is the inalienable right of every nation to govern itself in its area in accordance with that system of government best suited to its needs, having due regard to the rights and obligations of the individual and the welfare of the community.</p>

<p>The Native nations of South-West Africa, as distinct homogeneous entities, are, like every nation all over the world, entitled to self-realization and self-determination, and this Government is intent on assisting them to attain as much as they can in this respect.</p>

<p>I may add that it is also the attitude of the various indigenous peoples of South-West Africa, as expressed by their existing traditional authorities, that every people should govern itself (assisted by the Republican Government) and that they do not want domination by any one of the peoples of South-West Africa, which will naturally also be the position should all the peoples of South-West Africa partake in a centralized or joint form of government. In this connection it is justified to note the following significant statement of the chiefs and headmen of the Ovambo nation, which is numerically stronger than all the other indigenous peoples of South-West Africa together, a statement which was sent as a message to the hon. the Prime Minister in March, 1967. I translate the message&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We express our sincere gratitude for the message delivered to us to-day by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. It was an important message which <span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="#page_1133"/>rejoiced our hearts. We are happy because it appears that development will now also be extended to our governing bodies. We appreciate it the more because we now know that we in Ovamboland will have our own central government. It is an ideal to which we have been aspiring for some time. We appreciate it the more because we know that the Government of the Republic is not going to desert us but will assist us in this process of development. It will unite our Ovanbo tribes. It is a significant step forward which we welcome wholeheartedly. You, Mister Prime Minister, should please assist us in extending this process of self-government so that we are not left in the dark. We do not want strange nations to govern us, just as little as we in turn desire to govern others. We request that you and your Government continue to be our true ally.</block>

<p>In this regard the Government reiterates the views expressed in paragraph 21 of the memorandum in regard to the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, and I quote from the memorandum&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the objective of self-determination for the various population groups will, in the circumstances prevailing in the Territory, not be promoted by the establishment of a single multi-racial central authority in which the whole population could potentially be represented, but in which some groups would in fact dominate others &#x2026; The Government also endorses the view that it should be the aim, as far as practicable, to develop for each population group its own homeland, in which it can attain self-determination and self-realization &#x2026; The Government moreover accepts that for this purpose considerable additional portions of the Territory, including areas now owned by white persons, should be made available to certain non-white groups. It also shares the view that there should be no unnecessary delay in taking the next steps in regard to this important aspect of the development of the population groups concerned &#x2026;</block>

<p>This aspect was dealt with fully by the Odendaal Commission in paragraphs 183 to 190 of its Report, and in the Bill before the House provision is now being made for the recognition of the areas of the different Native nations in South West Africa.</p>

<p>The second aspect is the boundaries of the areas.</p>

<p>I have sketched the origin of the present reserves. The recognition in this Bill of the areas is in general based on the recommendations by the Odendaal Commission in Chapter 8 of its Report. I have indicated that in the Northern Sector the groups occupy traditional homelands which are geographical entities. The recommendations of the Odendaal Commission in respect of the boundaries of the Northern Sector, i.e. Ovamboland, Okavango, Kaokoveld and the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, therefore amount to boundary adjustments involving the present reserves and Government-owned land.</p>

<p>In respect of the Northern Sector, the Government is prepared to accept the Commission&#x2019;s recommendations in principle but the details, especially in so far as cessions of portions of the Okavango to Ovamboland and of the Kaokoveld to Damaraland are concerned, will be worked out and finalized in due course. As a matter of fact, we are busy on it at the present time.</p>

<p>In the Southern Sector we have an entirely different situation, that is in respect of Damaraland and Hereroland. By the way, allow me to remind hon. members that Namaland and the Namas, as a result of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s Report, do not fall within the scope of this Bill.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? Are you able to bring them in under clause 2 (g)?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not the intention. The intention is to do what the Report recommends. The Department of Coloured Affairs will in future administer the Namas and Namaland. Of course, for that to be done other legislation will be necessary.</p>

<p>The present reserves are scattered over the country and, as I have indicated, were intended primarily as areas where sections of the various groups which had congregated there, could enjoy security of tenure and reestablish traditional social life and customs.</p>

<p>The Odendaal Commission has recommended consolidated territories, as set out in its report. It is general knowledge that the South West Africa Administration, on the request of the Government, has purchased large tracts of land in various regions adjoining certain reserves which the Odendaal Commission recommended as the nuclei of homelands to be formed by incorporating the aforementioned tracts of land, after they have been bought. This matter is receiving the necessary attention of the Government and the South West Africa Administration, and a full statement in this connection will be made when it is possible. I may add that the general trend of the Commission&#x2019;s Report in this regard is acceptable to the Government but detailed information will have to stand over for the aforementioned statement.</p>

<p>The recommendations do involve a certain amount of movement by people, but an analysis reveals that any inconvenience to individuals will be more than offset by the benefit to the community as a whole.</p>

<p>I now come to the third division of the relative recommendations, namely changes in the forms of government.</p>

<p>Earlier in this speech, I sketched the existing forms of government, namely the indirect administration <span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="#page_1134"/>through traditional systems in the Northern Sector and Reserve Boards in the South. The Odendaal Commission recommended for each area a legislative council consisting of traditional leaders and elected members, the latter, that is the elected members, to constitute not more than 40 per cent of the council, except in respect of the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, where there are to be more elected members due to the existing system of government. Further, that the executive powers of the legislative council should vest in an executive committee.</p>

<p>In addition, the commission recommended the constitution of community authorities, to consist of traditional leaders plus elected members in the case of Ovamboland and the Kaokoveld; of traditional leaders only in the case of the Okavango, and to be constituted as determined by the legislative council in the case of Damaraland, Hereroland and the Eastern Caprivi, it being left to the council of the area concerned to define the powers of such authorities.</p>

<p>The Government accepts in principle the recommendations relating to legislative councils, the vesting of executive powers in certain members of the council&#x2014;in this regard the Commission used the term &#x201C;Executive Committee&#x201D;, while in the Bill the body is named an &#x201C;Executive Council&#x201D;&#x2014;and community authorities.</p>

<p>The Government does not wish to commit itself to any particular system of government for any area. The particular system of government, ranging from lower authorities to the highest, the legislative council, will have to be determined in respect of each area in consultation with the people concerned. It may well be that a particular nation will at the outset, or in time to come, adopt the particular system recommended for it by the Odendaal Commission or it may find that practical requirements demand a divergent system.</p>

<p>The Government is, however, of the firm conviction that any system of self-government introduced in any group should be founded on that system known to the group concerned, and that new systems should not be foisted on the people, but that provision should rather be made for the existing systems to be developed, extended and modernized and for the constitution of higher institutions with due regard to prevailing requirements and the wishes of the members of each group. The development of a governmental institution is an evolutionary process in which past experiences and developments in this field, especially in the Africa of to-day, are not to be ignored, and it is the sacred duty of South Africa to give guidance and advice in this regard to the nations under its care.</p>

<p>Accordingly in the Bill under consideration provision is also made for tribal authorities in respect of those tribes who may prefer this form of manifestation or cohesion. Furthermore, in the Bill provision is also made for regional authorities, not as a compulsory institution but permissive in respect of those who may find a need for a form of regional government within the system of territorial government which may eventually be adopted.</p>

<p>After the publication of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s Report, a series of meetings was held in South West Africa, at which the general implications of the recommendations were explained to the people concerned. The recommendations, especially those relating to political reforms, were met with general acclaim, except perhaps in the case of a part of the Herero nation.</p>

<p>After visits to the Bantu areas of the Republic by representatives of the Ovambo, Okavango, and Eastern Caprivi peoples, further requests were made for guidance and assistance in the development of the peoples concerned. I may add here that the representatives included chiefs, headmen, teachers and ministers of religion and that the visits were arranged at their request.</p>

<p>On 21st March, 1967, I held a meeting at Oshakati in Ovamboland. On that occasion an offer was made on behalf of the Government to assist the Ovambo nation to advance towards self-government and it was explained that the Government would render all possible assistance, including the provision of trained and experienced officials in the initial stages. I made it clear, too, that the offer also applied in respect of the other indigenous groups in South West Africa.</p>

<p>On that occasion I was informed that the Ovambo accepted the offer without reservation and others have expressed the same views, not only through officials but also when the hon. the Prime Minister met them during a tour of South West Africa after the last parliamentary session in July, 1967, when I accompanied him. Subsequently, officials of my Department also held meetings with representatives of the Ovambo and others at which details of self-government on the basis provided for in the Bill were explained.</p>

<p>On all these occasions no misgivings were expressed against the principle of creating self-governing areas, although it became clear that no uniform system of government could be introduced for all the nations and that there must be scope for variations and adaptations to suit particular needs and wishes.</p>

<p>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, must therefore be seen against this background.</p>

<p>It is a general measure intended for application in respect of the different nations, after consultation with every nation concerned. It provides for the recognition of the areas of the different nations and, in respect of each nation, for the fundamental principles of self-government through a system of Central Government, consisting of a legislative council and an executive council, and a system of local government through subordinate authorities. <span class="col_5003-5004" refersTo="#page_1135"/>These authorities are all components of and stages in the political development of a nation&#x2014;a development which can eventually lead to independence. It must, however, toe very well understood that this ultimate phase of development will be a different situation which will require further legislation and which is not empowered toy this Bill now under consideration.</p>

<p>The objects and envisaged effects of the Bill have been detailed in the memorandum which I have tabled. I wish to reiterate, however, that the development envisaged in the Bill will be determined on the one hand by the inherent vigour of the different nations and on the other hand by responsible guidance by the Government, in its role as guardian, which means that the Government must meet its obligations on the basis of creative self-withdrawal. It should also be realized that success will depend on intelligent and dynamic leadership by the legislative councils, executive councils and the different authorities, and that the Government is of the firm resolve to achieve in South West Africa the general objects of national development in respect of the different nations which have been summarized in the memorandum which I have tabled, but which I wish to repeat because of their importance:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) The creation of homogeneous administrative areas by uniting the members of each group in one nation, concentrated in one coherent homeland where possible;</li>

<li>(ii) the education of the nations to a sound understanding of the problems of soil conservation and agriculture so that all rights over and responsibilities in respect of their soil may be assigned to them;</li>

<li>(iii) systematic promotion of a diverse economy in the homelands, acceptable to the nations and to be developed by them;</li>

<li>(iv) the education of the nations to a sound understanding of the problems and aims of education, so that toy decentralization of powers responsibility for the different grades of education may be vested in them;</li>

<li>(v) the training of the nations with a view to effectively extending their own judicial systems, and their education to a sound understanding and the unimpeachable application of the common law so that the responsibility for the administration of justice in their areas can be transferred to them;</li>

<li>(vi) the education of the nations to a sound understanding of effective territorial administration;</li>

<li>(vii) the exercise of legislative powers by the nations in respect of their areas, at first on a limited scale but with every intention of gradually extending this power; and</li>

<li>(viii) the gradual and systematic replacement of white administrative and professional officers by qualified and competent members of the nations concerned.</li>

</ol>

<p>I now come to the different clauses of the Bill, Mr. Speaker, and although they have also been explained in the memorandum, I, for very obvious reasons, have to deal with them here in more detail.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 1, the Act will apply to South West Africa, including the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel.</p>

<p>The areas of the different nations are specified in clause 2 on the basis of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s Report and I have already dealt fully with this aspect.</p>

<p>Clause 3 authorizes the State President to establish a legislative council for the area of a nation, after having consulted the people concerned. That will be done in a separate proclamation.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 4. As I indicated earlier on in this speech, the Government does not wish to commit itself to any particular system of government for a nation before the people concerned have been consulted. Thus, the legislative council of a particular nation may, for example, toe constituted in any one of the following manners depending on the system of government desired by the people, namely: (a) a legislative council consisting of elected members and designated traditional leaders, on the basis of the particular recommendation of the Odendaal Commission; or (b) a legislative council constituted from tribal authorities and community authorities; or (c) a legislative council constituted in accordance with a system whereby tribal authorities and community authorities combine in forming regional authorities, and the regional authorities combine in determining the members of the legislative council, in which there may also be a number of representatives elected by the voters.</p>

<p>It is, consequently, not possible to determine in this Bill the manner in which each legislative council will be constituted, and the State President is accordingly being empowered in clause 4 to determine the manner of constitution by proclamation after the people concerned have been consulted.</p>

<p>South Africa has no rigid ideas about the type of franchise to be enjoyed toy the different groups. It may be universal adult franchise or a qualified one or a mixture of systems. That is a matter on which the group in question may indicate its own preferences, even if the result be a system of election and voting procedures which has no exact counterpart <span class="col_5005-5006" refersTo="#page_1136"/>in Western democratic countries. What is important, is to meet the needs and aspirations of the particular group.</p>

<p>I wish to invite particular attention to sub-clause (3) of clause 4, in terms of which any proclamation may be withdrawn or amended, thus enabling any system decided upon at the outset to be modified and adapted from time to time.</p>

<p>Clause 5 authorizes a legislative council to make enactments in respect of matters referred to in the Schedule.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, in sub-clause (1) (b), a legislative council is being specially empowered to provide for the enforcement of enactments in respect of members of the nation concerned who are or reside outside the area for which the council has been established, but within the territory of South West Africa.</p>

<p>In terms of sub-clause (2), enactments will have to be approved by the State President and be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> before coming into force.</p>

<p>Clause 6 provides for the executive government, consisting of an executive council which will be constituted from members of the legislative council in the manner determined in the proclamation referred to in clause 4. Here again, there will be prior consultation with the people concerned.</p>

<p>Sub-clause (2) provides for the establishment of departments by an executive council; subclause (3) prescribes such a council&#x2019;s functions; and sub-clause (4) provides for officers and employees of our Public Service to be designated to assist an executive council in the administration of departments so as not to disrupt services by the abrupt withdrawal of qualified staff. The process of withdrawal will be gradual, in that as competent and trained members of the nation become available they will gradually replace officers and employees of the Government.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 7.</p>

<p>I have, in the course of this speech, dealt in detail with traditional political institutions. I have indicated that in some areas, such as in the Northern Sector, such institutions remained fairly intact and have functioned over the years, while in other areas, such institutions had to a large extent been disrupted as a result of events of the past and that in cases such as the last-mentioned, efforts have been made to re-establish the institutions, or others have been introduced to facilitate local government. I have also indicated that the Government is of the firm conviction that existing political institutions cannot be ignored. Consequently, in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-clause (1) of clause 7 provision is made for such institutions.</p>

<p>Paragraph (a) is straightforward in that it provides for the recognition of an existing government functioning in a tribe or community in accordance with the law and customs observed by the tribe or community, as a tribal authority or a community authority, such recognition to take place after consultation with the people concerned.</p>

<p>Paragraph (b), however, is two-fold. Firstly, it provides for the establishment and constitution, after consultation with the tribe or community concerned, of a tribal authority or community authority in respect of a tribe or community in which tribal or community government does not exist. Secondly, it provides that if there is an existing government in a tribe or community, whether or not such government has been recognized in terms of paragraph (a), but it is considered expedient to replace such government, a tribal authority or community authority may, after consultation with the tribe or community concerned, be established and constituted in respect of that tribe or community. This will enable a tribe or community to modernize and adapt its traditional political institution as circumstances may require.</p>

<p>Paragraph (c) is designed to cover those cases where different communities or tribal authorities or community authorities, acting either on their own or in co-operation with others, may wish to combine for geographical or other reasons in a system of regional government, in which event a regional authority may be established. Here again, consultation with the people concerned is a prerequisite to the establishment of the authority.</p>

<p>It will be observed from sub-clause (2) of clause 7 that the provisions of clause 4 (2) and (3) will apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, thus, <i>inter alia</i>, enabling the bodies to which I have referred to be constituted in whichever way the people concerned may desire, including the possibility of elected members in addition to the traditional leaders.</p>

<p>Clause 8: The role which tribal authorities, community authorities and regional authorities will play in the general administration will of necessity have to be determined with due regard to the wishes of the people concerned, and, consequently, no hard and fast rules can be laid down in the Bill.</p>

<p>Provision is accordingly being made in clause 8 for their powers, duties and functions &#x2014;and in the case of a regional authority this may include the power to make enactments&#x2014; to be determined by proclamation after consultation with the legislative council concerned where one has been established.</p>

<p>Clause 9: Sub-clause (1) of this clause provides for the establishment of a Revenue Fund by an executive council and a Revenue Account by other authorities.</p>

<p>In terms of section 4 of the South West Africa Native Affairs Administration Act, 1954, certain trust funds established for tribes and communities, vest in the South African Bantu Trust Fund and the moneys have to be used exclusively for the purposes prescribed by the law in pursuance of which the moneys accrue, and in sub-clause (2) of clause <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="#page_1137"/>9 provision is now being made for the funds to vest in the appropriate legislative council, tribal authority, community authority or regional authority.</p>

<p>Clause 10: This clause provides for the auditing of books and accounts by the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>

<p>Clauses 11 and 12 provide for the nomination by an executive council of representatives in urban and other areas, the recognition of such representatives, and their duties. These representatives will be the link between the homeland authority and the members of the nation who are away from home.</p>

<p>Clause 13: Once a legislative council has been established, it is automatically vested with all powers relating to matters entrusted to it. It is, however, necessary to provide for such matters as departments, the collection of and control over revenue, the conditions of service of members, the proceedings at sessions of the council and staff, to enable the administration to function until such time as the council meets and makes the necessary provision therefor. The State President is accordingly being empowered in terms of clause 13 to make the necessary provision by proclamation in regard to these matters. The legislative council concerned will in terms of clause 13 (2) be able to amend or repeal any proclamation, subject to the general provisions governing its powers to make enactments.</p>

<p>Clause 14: In terms of this clause the State President will be authorized to make laws by proclamation in respect of areas now or in future reserved or set apart for occupation by Natives. This is no innovation in respect of Native areas, as similar powers vest in the State President in respect of Native areas in the Republic and in fact in terms of section 38 of the South West Africa Constitution Act, 1968 (formerly sections 2 and 3 of Act No. 55 of 1951), in respect of Native Affairs in general in South West Africa and in respect of all matters in the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel.</p>

<p>In clause 18 of the Bill, the existing provisions relating to the Eastern Caprivi are, however, being brought into line with this clause.</p>

<p>Clause 15: All proclamations under the proposed Act will have to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament in terms of this clause, and provision is being made for a proclamation or a particular provision thereof ceasing to be of force and effect if both the Senate and the House of Assembly by resolution disapprove of the particular proclamation or provision.</p>

<p>Clause 16: It is well known that traditional law and customs vary from tribe to tribe and community to community, and that the law and customs are intricate, especially so when they relate to a man&#x2019;s status in a tribe or community and his right to take part in tribal affairs and the deliberations of elders.</p>

<p>The law and customs are generally well-known and accepted by all, but when they are in issue in a court of law which is not empowered to take judicial notice of Native law and custom, it is necessary to produce conclusive proof of every facet of the law and custom involved and, as experience in the Republic has proved, this can result in protracted and costly trials, out of all proportion to the issues involved.</p>

<p>It is accordingly provided in clause 16 that in judicial proceedings evidence on questions relating to the membership of the different authorities provided for in the Bill, or whether or not an authority acted in a particular matter in accordance with the law and customs observed by the tribe or community concerned, can be given by affidavit by experts on Native law and custom. It should be noted that an affidavit will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts attested to therein and not conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>Clause 17 provides for the determination of the manner in which a nation, group of persons, a tribe or a community is to be consulted when consultation is a prerequisite to any action contemplated in the Bill. This will of necessity have to be determined in relation to the circumstances of the people concerned.</p>

<p>Clause 18 is consequential upon clause 14, which includes the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, so that there is no need for the retention in their present form of the relative provisions of the South West Africa Constitution Act, 1968.</p>

<p>Clause 19 is the short title.</p>

<p>The Schedule contains a list of the matters in respect of which a legislative council may make enactments. The matters in question are clearly specified and call for no detailed explanation.</p>

<p>One particular aspect of the Bill which I would like to emphasize is that it is not designed for any particular nation&#x2014;as a matter of fact, I have already said so&#x2014;but that it is applicable in respect of each and everyone of the nations concerned after due consultation with the people involved. It is clearly based on the fundamental concept of self-determination and the elimination of all domination of groups by one another. The very purpose is to build up each people into a self-governing organic entity, capable of co-operating with others in the political and economic spheres in such a manner as may voluntarily be agreed upon between them.</p>

<p>We contend that where one is dealing with the problems of pluralistic societies there is no one method which is &#x201C;best&#x201D; or &#x201C;right&#x201D;. Experience has taught us not to be rigid or single-minded. The best approach to matters of this nature depends upon the flexible application of the principles underlying the development of a nation with due regard to local circumstances and the wishes of the peoples concerned. It is my firm belief that this Bill complies with this concept.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that this Bill is designed specifically for circumstances obtaining in South West Africa, and that it is not <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="#page_1138"/>merely an extension of legislation in force in the Republic&#x2014;in fact, this Bill has no counterpart in the Republic.</p>

<p>This Bill deals of course primarily with political development. But that does not mean that development in other fields has been neglected and it would not be out of place to refer briefly to the following matters.</p>

<p>In assessing the physical development which has been undertaken and which still remains to be undertaken, there are two important factors which must be taken into account: firstly, the degree of human development which has so far been attained by the different peoples and, secondly, the conditions in the different areas.</p>

<p>In regard to the former, that is the degree of human development, it would for example be wrong to plan and build at too fast a rate great towns for people who have yet to attain a measure of urbanization. The physical development must not outstrip the human development. We must be careful to set a pace in conformity with that of the people&#x2019;s ability to absorb the technological skills, so that they gradually achieve self-confidence and stability.</p>

<p>In regard to the development of the different areas, there are difficulties such as limited natural resources, but these difficulties are not insurmountable, and are difficulties which many nations in other parts of the world also have had to face and some nations still have to face. Steady progress has, however, been made in all fields and the achievements have been recorded elsewhere, notably in the publication &#x201C;South West Africa Survey&#x201D;, which was issued during 1967.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it suffices to say here that the progress and achievements have in turn created new avenues and new possibilities, and to realize this, one has only to consider the effect on a country and its people of improved educational facilities, proper roads, assured water supplies, extensive health services and improvements in the fields of agriculture and stock breeding, particularly a people who by tradition are pastoralists.</p>

<p>I thank the House for having listened so attentively and quietly to my speech.</p>

<p>In the spirit of courtesy which the hon. the Minister has evinced, may I in turn from this side of the House thank him for the extremely useful White Paper which he issued in connection with this Bill, which has not only simplified our work but, I think, will make intelligent discussion very much easier when it comes to debate. I should also like to congratulate this Minister on having achieved something which we were told by the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs was impossible, namely constituting a second body to tax the same group of people in respect of each of the tribes. He, Sir is doing what the Minister of Coloured Affairs told us was impossible in respect of the Coloured Council; he said it was impossible to give that Coloured Council taxing powers. But the Minister in this Bill is providing for taxing powers to be given to the various councils he is establishing, and I want to congratulate him on being so far influenced by the Opposition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the inspiration came at the end. May I say to the hon. gentleman that as he started with an historical survey, I wish to do the same, but I want to start at a later point of time. I want to recall that when the report of the Odendaal Commission was debated in this House in May, 1964, just four years ago, the Prime Minister of the day indicated that although he had made a public pronouncement, that the political recommendations contained in that report would receive the support of his Cabinet, and although he had indicated that he was going ahead with them, he nevertheless, after further consideration, had decided to hold them over. It was clear that the then Prime Minister had decided to hold those political recommendations over because of the fact that the case in connection with South West Africa was still pending at the International Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Things have changed since then. The threat of an unfavourable decision by that court has been dissipated, and there are some nations of the world, I like to believe, that are taking a more realistic view of South Africa&#x2019;s position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> South West Africa and its duties in that regard. There is no doubt whatsoever that the outside world is paying attention to our administration of that Territory, and they are paying attention more particularly to any proposed political developments, and therefore it will not be surprising if this Bill and its admitted long-term objectives exercise their attention. For those long-term objectives, Sir, I would refer you particularly to the preamble and the White Paper attached to the Bill. Sir, because of an indication of what was coming I took the liberty of raising this matter with the hon. the Prime Minister earlier in this session and gave a friendly warning that it seemed to me that in introducing legislation of this kind, he was running the risk of losing some of the friends he had gained as a result of the judgment of the International Court. My statement did not bear fruit and this Bill is being introduced without the agreement of the Opposition. Sir, we cannot support this Bill; we cannot support it for a variety of reasons. One of them is that this Bill sets out the foundations for the implementation of the political recommendations contained in the report of the Odendaal Commission, in regard to which our attitude was made abundantly dear both at the time when that report was discussed in this House and in subsequent speeches on public platforms, both here and in South West Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="#page_1139"/>Sir, let us examine the Bill, not in quite the detailed manner that the Minister has done but let us try to determine what it is that is proposed. The preamble to the Bill is worthy of study because there it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is desirable that the native nations in the territory of South West Africa should in the realization of their right of self-determination develop in an orderly manner to self-governing nations and independence.</block>

<p>Sir, this is an unequivocal statement. It means that those who support this Bill regard it as desirable that-what are described as the native nations should develop to independence. I want to say that we on this side of the House can imagine few things more disastrous for South West Africa and for South Africa than just this development to independence. When one examines this preamble one is faced with one difficulty and that is, first of all, what is a nation? When does a group, a tribe or a community become a nation? I have been at pains to investigate this matter. Some of the groups with which this Bill deals are so small that they are almost in the nature of village or small town communities. Can they by any stretch of the imagination be described as nations? Sir, the best definition that I have been able to find is in Emerson&#x2019;s book. &#x201C;From Empire to Nation&#x201D; in which he deals with nationalism. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In fact, we do not know a great deal about it. But what we do not know or have taken for granted without adequate evidence adds up to an impressive body of ignorance and uncertainty, which is all the more dismaying because of the frequent failure to face up to the limitations of our knowledge. It is a far more complex and elusive matter than it is usually given credit for being. Many of the points on which our knowledge breaks down are fundamental to an understanding of nationalism and hence to an ability to deal with the problems which it raises.</block>

<p>Sir, can we in all honesty describe any of the groups in South West Africa, with the possible exception of the Ovambo group, as being separate nations? If we can, then I would like to ask where this right of self-determination comes from. Is it in any law, Mr. Speaker? Do you know what its origin is? I have sought it, Sir. It is not in the mandate. Is it a principle of natural justice? To what units does it apply? When does one acquire the right to self-determination? How big a group must one be? What characteristics must one have to have the right of self-determination? Sir, when one goes into the history of this talk of self-determination, then one finds that the principle derives from a familiar set of doctrines whose apparent simplicity conceal a multitude of complexities and difficulties. The starting point seems to be the old 18th century doctrine that there must be government by consent; the power of the government must rest on the consent of the governed. Then in the 19th and 20th centuries it was developed a little further and the view was expressed and the addendum made to this concept that man being a national animal, the most likely government to which he would consent is a government of his own nation. Then, Sir, with the passage of time came a third new principle and that is that it was a principle of natural law which entitles nations to their own states.</p>

<p>My hon. friend over there says that that is the correct definition. Then I hope he accepts the other side of the coin and that is that it is illegitimate for states to exist that are not on a national foundation. Then, Sir, when you go into this doctrine you find that by a further sleight of hand the original principle that individuals must consent to the rule of a government, is developed and changed to mean that nations have the natural right to determine their own statehood. Where does it come from, Sir? I have been at pains to go into some of the authorities on the subject, and here is what one finds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The difficulties of self-determination become most serious when the doctrine is brought down from abstraction to working reality and when an effort is made, as in the United Nations&#x2019; Covenant on Human Rights, to translate it from ethical and political precepts to binding legal norms. In the current temper of world opinion no one can in principle oppose what has come to be the almost self-evident right of peoples to dispose of their own destinies, but it is unfortunately equally impossible to formulate this right in such terms as would make it meaningfully applicable to reality. Who can say the nations nay, and yet who can say what nations are and when and how they may assert themselves?</block>

<p>Sir, if you go back even to the time of the French Revolution, you find Carnot, one of the philosophers of the time, speaking of this right of self-determination, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If any community whatever had the right to proclaim its will and separate from the main body, under the influence of rebels, every country, every town, every village, every farmstead might declare itself independent.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we find ourselves in a whole series of difficulties. The old League of Nations went into this matter, and a commission of rapporteurs reported to <span class="col_5013-5014" refersTo="#page_1140"/>the Council of the League of Nations in 1921. It was asked whether it was possible to have a general rule that a minority can separate to join another state or become independent&#x2014; that is singularly applicable here&#x2014;and it stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The answer can only be in the negative. To concede to minorities either of language or religion, or to any fractions of a population, the right of withdrawing from the community to which they belong, because it is their wish or their good pleasure, would be to destroy order and stability within states and to inaugurate anarchy in international life; it would be to uphold a theory incompatible with the very idea of the State as a territorial and political entity.</block>

<p>Then one last reference and that is to India. India demanded self-determination when she wanted to get rid of British rule. When Pakistan demanded self-determination it cost something like 13,000,000 lives. Sir, later they had a commission, a commission which was to go into the reorganization of states, and that commission held that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If self-determination were the governing principle, the possible demand for separate states would be unlimited. Every linguistic or other minority group might demand a state for itself and the wishes of the people would be swayed by purely temporary considerations.</block>

<p>Sir, I take it no further.</p>

<p>Here we are with a Bill which provides for self-determination as an inalienable right, but it has determined in clause 2 to what groups self-determination will be given. Supposing there are others? Is clause 2 (g) going to be made use of if smaller groups decide that they want self-determination? What principles are to be applied? What principle has been applied in setting out the areas for the so-called nations set out in clause 2? I must confess that the Bill, perhaps conscious of its own shortcomings, provides that the State President may by proclamation indicate areas to be set aside for any native nation to be recognized by the State President in the future. What is envisaged there? We find a Bill here talking of &#x201C;nations&#x201D; in respect of groups of people that do not equal the population of a small town or a fair-sized village, with the exception of Ovamboland. We find it even talking of the sacred right of self-determination, which has no basis at all in history and seems to be used as an excuse by this Government for the fragmentation of South West Africa. Sir, I accept at once that this Bill does not provide for the independence of any individual nation. But it does provide for the establishment by proclamation, of six native nations and such others as are to be recognized by the State President by proclamation.</p>

<p>The powers to be given them are very unimportant, because they are all permissive. The Bill empowers the State President to give certain powers. It also empowers the State President to withdraw those powers. The powers outlined in the Bill are nothing more than a sort of blueprint for the establishment of legislative councils, tribal and community authorities, regional authorities, but they are always subject to the powers of the State President who may repeal or amend any law in force or coming into force in any area, or make new laws applicable to such area and amend or repeal such law. Therefore, what the Bill sets out is not of great importance. What is important is what the State President decides on the advice of the Cabinet. All this Bill is, is a blueprint to set people on the way to nationhood, self-determination and ultimate independence. I know, of course, that the Bill says that the proclamations have to be Tabled in this House and in the Other Place within 14 days of their promulgation, and, if put into force during the recess, within 14 days of the reopening of the Session. Sir, when one has regard to the fact that the State President acts on the advice of the Cabinet, then one appreciates that this is of very small importance, because what has been done will have the support of the Government of the day, and there will be the overwhelming power of the Government in power to enforce those proclamations without Parliament being properly consulted. One knows that by section 38 of the South West Africa Constitution Act, the State President, as the hon. the Minister has said, has certain very great powers of legislating by proclamation in the Territory over all those matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly cannot act. He has power to act by proclamation in respect of Native affairs which are not controlled by the Legislative Assembly and what limitations there were are removed by this Bill.</p>

<p>The State President not only has powers generally. He has powers generally to make proclamations in respect of any matter in regard to which the State President or the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development can make regulations. That means that the State President, advised of course by the Cabinet, can develop the powers of these legislative councils operating in various areas defined&#x2014;and to be defined&#x2014; to a point very closely approaching independence. He can, of course, take away again all the powers he grants. He has that power. He, advised by the Cabinet, is the virtual dictator to what powers shall be given to these councils, how far they develop and what powers should be taken away from them.</p>

<p>I say at once I concede this Bill does not grant independence but it does permit the building up of a foundation and a development towards independence up to a point where retreat may well prove to be impossible. The executive power, consisting of the <span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="#page_1141"/>State President acting with the advice of the Cabinet, may face Parliament at some time in future with what is virtually an accomplished fact, a state of affairs where there is no road of retreat, in which development has taken place and promises have been made which does not make it possible to resile without enormous difficulties and perhaps the use of force.</p>

<p>One appreciates what the object of the Bill is as set out in the preamble and one appreciates how it is going to be administered, how it is going to operate and one asks oneself at once, &#x201C;To whom does it apply?&#x201D; It does not apply to the Whites in South West Africa. It seems to be regarded as unnecessary for them to develop to independence or to have a right to self-determination. That apparently is decided for them by this Parliament. But for the non-White it appears that he must first develop to independence before he has a right of self-determination whereas the White has it decided for him now by the Republican Parliament. If one looks at the South West Africa Survey on pages 49 and 50 this becomes very evident because there it sets out that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another important consideration is that the political and economic organs and institutions developed among the non-white people, the importance of contact and consultation between them and their central governing authority must necessarily grow, and in increasing measure their wishes will have to be taken into account on matters of mutual concern. However, at this stage it is impossible to foresee with any degree of accuracy the ultimate inter-actions of the various population groups. Circumstances will alter radically&#x2014;what is considered anathema to-day may well become sound practical politics to-morrow, and <i>vice versa</i>, nor is it necessary to embark on speculation as to what the ultimate future political pattern will be, that is whether and to what extent there may be amalgamations or unions of some kind, federations, commonwealth or common market arrangements. The people themselves will ultimately decide.</block>

<p>When will they decide I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After self-determination the groups would be free to make other arrangements by agreement among themselves if they should so wish to do.</block>

<p>That is the position then, it does not apply to the Whites; it does not apply to the Rehoboth Bastards; it does not apply to the Coloureds; and it does not seem to apply to the Hottentots or the Namas. I think that perhaps the hon. the Minister would be kind enough in his reply to indicate to us what his plans are with those separate groups in South West Africa. It does not seem to me that they can be intended to be included in paragraph (g) of clause 2 where the State President may by proclamation recognize any native nation.</p>

<p>I accept that at once and I do not propose to debate it any further, but I think the House would like from the Minister some indication of what the Government&#x2019;s plans are with those people as fitting into the general scheme of things.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>But it is irrelevant.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="#hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I would submit at once that it is indeed relevant because they are still part of South West Africa in respect of which this Bill is dealing with the majority of the people.</p>

<p>The Bill does apply to the Damaras. The Minister has spoken of consolidation and he has spoken of drawing boundaries in a vague sort of way. But those Damaras are spread over eight reserves and if one is to go according to the map of the Odendaal Commission&#x2019;s report only some 5,000 of the 44,000-odd Damaras counted in 1960 were in the area set aside for the future Damaraland. Maybe there have been changes since then, but that is the latest information I have. It means that almost 90 per cent are outside.</p>

<p>It applies to the Hereros. They are spread over 13 areas ranging from the far south to the north of what is known as the Southern Area inside the police zone. There are many thousands of them on the platteland and on European farms. So far as one can judge the present Hereroland at the moment is providing a living for only about 11,000, leaving approximately 24,000 Hereros who will have to be moved. The Minister very frankly said that this plan will involve some movement amongst the people. I think that is a vast under-statement, if I may say so, because already we have 39,000 Damaras to be moved; we have 24,000 Hereros to be moved, and when one starts looking at the other groups I am afraid we are going to find population movements which, relatively speaking, are unrivalled, almost, in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Then we have the Bill applying to Kaokoland which also has only 10,000 people in it. How can one describe that as a nation, how can one grant that &#x201C;nation&#x201D; self-determination, to decide whether it will be independent or not?</p>

<p>Then we have Okavangoland which, when one includes the Bushmen and the inhabitants of the Western Caprivi, have a population of roughly 29,000, and we have the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel which has 15,846, according to the figure given.</p>

<p>Then there is Tswanaland which is not mentioned . Tswanaland has only 425 Tswanas in it out of a total population of Tswanas of 2,600. Then there is also the Western Caprivi. <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="#page_1142"/>Then there are some Bushmen who are also, I believe, very largely left out.</p>

<p>I think one begins to see what sort of units you are faced with when you look at the proposals in this Bill. One begins to feel that the whole concept is unrealistic. One begins to feel that the suggestion of this type of fragmentation is totally impractical. When the good offices commission was out here we were told that South West Africa itself was not a viable country. To-day with the possible exception of Ovamboland with its 250,000 inhabitants in one consolidated area it does not seem to me that there is the slightest prospect within generations, of anyone of these areas or racial groups ever becoming economically viable. In fact I would go so far as to suggest that it is utterly preposterous to talk about them as nations or to suggest that they have a right to self-determination to be led to independence, with the possible exception of the Ovambo group. Independence for such little groups can only be a mockery and a delusion and make us look ridiculous in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>The other thing that worries me is that under clause 11 (1) these areas are set aside as belonging to those native nations. It seems to me that if the same policy is adopted there as here in the Republic then it means that no private white capital or initiative will be allowed in those areas, and by the very fact of setting them aside and passing this legislation we put an end to any prospect of their rapid industrial development.</p>

<p>I say I believe it is impractical. What are the dangers involved in a scheme of this kind? Quite apart from the economic impracticability of this fragmentation it would seem to me that a number of independent states in South West Africa in the light of the world threat to governments in Angola, in Rhodesia, in South West Africa, and in South Africa itself, is the height of folly and irresponsibility. We are in fact now establishing independent states between the Republic and that portion of South West Africa falling under the white government and the northern territories of Angola and Zambia, and we are placing ourselves in a position where our lines of communications with those territories flow through independent sovereign states. We have the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland, Okavangoland on the border with Angola, and we have the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel on the border with Zambia. We are severing our lines of communications.</p>

<p>I know I will be told that of course times will change; there will be no independence until these people are regarded as fit for it. But if it is inherently dangerous now to give these people independence at this moment because of the danger of cutting our lines of communication, then should we be making promises now in respect of the future when we have no idea what the situation will be? I do not propose to labour this point but I believe in the light of the discovery of large supplies of oil in Angola an action of this type is utterly reckless. Angola now has oil which could be supplied to the Republic; it could be brought overland to the Republic. What is going to happen if that pipeline has to go across a sovereign independent territory hostile to the Republic of South Africa, if it is to be made a jumping off ground for terrorists both in Angola and in South West Africa? In evaluating that situation we cannot forget the fact that there is a vacuum in the Indian ocean at the present time and it would require very little activities by Russian naval forces to make our supplies of oil from the East very uncertain indeed. Yet here we are going blithely on with the one secure source of supply to the north, indicating in the preamble that by means of self-determination we are leading these people to independence. When primitive people are promised independence in the future they tend to think it means tomorrow or the next day.</p>

<p>There is a further point that has to be remembered in connection with the proposed creation of sovereign independent states and that is the World Court opinion of 1950 in respect of South West Africa. That opinion indicated that South West Africa has a peculiar international status which cannot be unilaterally changed by the Republic of South Africa. When you develop states to independence within the Territory of South West Africa it is implicit that you change its international status. Is this not asking for trouble? What is the object? The hon. the Minister could have passed this legislation with no reference to independence or self-determination. He could have given the State President powers within certain limits to develop forms of local government in those territories, and there would not have been a squeak out of anybody anywhere in the world. There would have been no dangers for the future. He would not have been creating hopes and aspirations in these people for the future which may be extremely difficult for us. I warn that this may result in our losing some of the friends we gained as a result of the judgment of the International Court. One cannot accept the judgment when it suits you and refuse to acknowledge the authority and wisdom of a court, even if it is only in an advisory opinion, when it does not happen to suit one. I want to say at once that nor am I impressed by the argument that, as a result of the case, it is accepted that the mandate no longer exists. Whatever the decision of the court, all the dissenting judges endorsed the view that the mandate still survives. Even our own judge, Judge Van Wyk, in his concurring separate opinion was not prepared to deny the mandate&#x2019;s continued existence as an institution. Why are we heading for trouble at this time, when there are alternatives in respect of South West Africa which could be applied with probably greater advantage to the population and which would not involve any of the difficulties which I have outlined so far? What is the object of embarking upon what the White Paper describes as an &#x201C;irrevocable first step&#x201D; when there are other <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="#page_1143"/>alternatives which could develop these people without any of the dangers involved? I have said, and I say again, that the development of the non-white areas in South West Africa deserves special consideration. In that regard there are two points which should be specially noted.</p>

<p>The first is that the non-Whites must be helped to help themselves by means of a system of what could be called &#x201C;industrial partnership&#x201D;, which would ensure them a share in the economic development of their own country. Of course they will need money, guidance and training and they have to rely on the know-how of other groups for some time. But it may be that the Industrial Development Corporation could be instructed to ensure them a share of investment opportunities, and also their share in the various types of concessions that are granted in the territory.</p>

<p>The second point is that we believe that the advancement of these non-white areas must be tackled on a basis of South West Africa remaining a closely integrated economy, one economy for the whole territory, and while enjoying a measure of autonomy, nevertheless having a close association with the Republic of South Africa. I have outlined before in this House what we believe the formula should be, a formula based on the acceptance of a federal concept and federal links. We accept that it is a historical fact that the territory has been divided into two areas, that north of the red line, which has always had a measure of autonomy, and that south of the red line. We have suggested that these regions have their own form of autonomy, and that that traditional constitutional pattern should be maintained. We believe that further subdivision is not practicable, nor useful, nor in the interests of the population. We believe that the division between the north and the south should be recognized. We have suggested that the administration of the northern region, that is to say beyond the police zone, the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland, Okavangoland and the Caprivi Zipfel should be modernized as fast as possible to the point where each group manages matters of intimate concern to itself by way of communal councils, and that these also should be a northern legislative body, which has either a federal link with the southern area or directly with the Republic. We have suggested that in the southern area, rather than limiting the powers of the present legislative assembly, it would be more in the spirit of the mandate to extend those powers and make that legislative assembly responsible for the whole southern portion of South West Africa with the representation of the non-white group in that assembly, and a federal link with the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I think it is quite clear from what I have said that we are in favour of a great measure of autonomy and of local self-government and the maintenance of federal links between the Republic and the peoples of South West Africa. I believe such an arrangement could lead to friendly co-operation between the racial groups, the development of one loyalty to one state and to one central government, that it would enable the various groups to retain control of the matters of more intimate concern to themselves, and that friction on these matters could be avoided, while matters of national importance will be decided by the central Government of the Republic and South West Africa.</p>

<p>To sum this up, I would say that the plan as outlined by the hon. the Minister is unwise and unsound, and that it leads to the political and strategic fragmentation of South West Africa. I would say that it is impracticable, because of the movements of people, the lack of viability in the areas envisaged, and the smallness of the units which will have to be established. I would say that it affects the safety of South Africa and South West Africa because of international threats and because of the dangers to internal law and order of the establishment of a whole series of independent states within that territory.</p>

<p>Therefore I move the following amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Development of Self-government of Native Nations in South West Africa Bill <i>inter alia</i> because&#x2014;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. I am particularly sorry that he made one statement very explicit, namely that with this legislation we were going to change the status of South West Africa. Apparently the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not understand this legislation at all. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would look at his arguments again, he would see that he contradicted himself in his own arguments in regard to that statement he made. If he maintains that the idea of self-determination, which we are offering these people in South West Africa, the fact in itself that we are affording them the opportunity of achieving self-determination, is going to entail a change in the status of South West Africa, then I do not know from whence the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to derive support for this argument of his. The hon. the Leader quoted long sections from definitions. I want to say at once to the hon. the Leader that if he does not know <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="#page_1144"/>where the right of self-determination comes from, I can furnish him with a great deal of reading matter on the subject. I want to inform him that it goes back to the beginning of the doctrine of sovereignty in the law of nations, namely the fact that in natural law each nation is granted the opportunity of working out its own salvation. This system is also acknowledged in the Manifesto of the U.N. Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not know where it comes from. Article 1 of the Manifesto of the U.N. provides explicitly that it is an objective of the U.N. to develop friendly relations between nations&#x2014;and remember these are nations and not states&#x2014;on the basis of respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of ethnic groups&#x2014;that is to say &#x201C;peoples&#x201D;. Here the principle of self-determination of nations is clearly set out. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows that the Manifesto of the U.N. is a treaty to which South Africa has been a signatory for more than 20 years. The hon. the Leader also knows that the United Party under General Smuts was also party to this Manifesto of the United Nations.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not know where this idea of self-determination comes from. In his amendment the hon. the Leader called this plan of ours fragmentation. Then he came along afterwards and himself suggested that South West Africa be divided into a northern part outside the police zone, and a southern part. Is that not fragmentation? I should like to say the following to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: He advocated an autonomous legislative assembly for these northern areas where the Ovambos at present, according to the Odendaal report consist of 239,363 individuals out of a total outside this police zone of 304,080. They therefore comprise 80 per cent of the total. In other words, when an autonomous legislative body is established for them, they are going to dominate these peoples completely. But let us see what is happening in the south. In the south there are the Whites, the Damaras, the Hereros, the Tswanas, the Rehoboths, the Bastards and the Namas, who according to the Odendaal report, number 201,403 individuals. But the Whites, of whom there are approximately 73,000 comprise only 35 per cent of the population. In other words, in the southern part into which the Whites must be added, the Whites will only comprise approximately one-third of the total population. This is an example of the fairness of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated at the beginning of his speech that the attention of the outside world would to a large extent be focused on this legislation. To a certain extent I want to agree with him, and that is why in the few remarks I want to make to-day I want to adopt the attitude that the statements I want to make are for the most part addressed to those, the Opposition included to a certain extent as well, who see South West Africa as a country with boundaries in which various nations have to be thrown together into one pot. I want to indicate that this system which is now being advocated by the liberal world in the first place, but also by bodies in South Africa, in the second place, has already in the past led to chaos. Secondly, I want to indicate how all attempts to preserve the peace between these various units failed completely in the past. Thirdly, I want to indicate that autogenous development was discovered by the Bantu themselves in South West Africa and that they called in the help of the white man in order to implement it. Fourthly, I also want to indicate that the League of Nations gave this system its blessing and fifthly, I also want to quote a few experts in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Of all the misconceptions in regard to the policy of separate development, and believe me there are many, the one which perhaps cries to high heaven the most, is the misconception that separate development is a whim which we only recently discovered and fabricated for opportunistic reasons in order to maintain white domination in South Africa. In fact the process of settlement and development of various Bantu homelands is the logical result of historical facts which are as old as those which led to the present geographical pattern in Western Europe where various nations arose out of a political confusion which prevailed well into the middle ages. In the Republic and the majority of Africa states we know little about the forces which led to the formation of various ethnic groups and tribal groups, because there was no written language by means of which this history could have been recorded for us. But if there is one historical process which confirmed and recorded the process of autogenous development very clearly, it is the history of South West Africa. Only if one analyses the history of South West Africa does one understand that all we are doing to-day is to grant legal force to national boundaries and authorities which have become established in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer in the first place to the chaotic conditions which prevailed when that system still applied which liberal opinion in the outside world, and in South Africa as well, would like to force upon South West Africa. In the 60 years between 1830 and 1890, when the history of South West Africa was written, there were no fewer than 56 different wars between the various tribes. It is not necessary to go into the details of those wars now. Perhaps it is sufficient if I quote Missionary Van Rhoden when he stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="#page_1145"/>When the Herero were not being attacked by the Oorlams and the Nama, they were fighting amongst each other with even greater enthusiasm. It was a struggle in which everybody fought everybody else.</block>

<p>These wars did not acknowledge international legal rules. Often entire nations were wiped out. In fact I want to mention a few examples of that. In the first place the Nama and the Afrikaner tribe under the leadership of Oasib attacked and murdered all the Mbanderu in 1849&#x2014;including the women and children when they could not endure the long journey back. Secondly, on 23rd August, 1850, Jonker Afrikaner attacked the Herero under Kahitjene at Okahandja and only 20 souls escaped. Thirdly, in 1852, Jonker attacked the powerful tribe of Katjikurure and wiped it out completely. Fourthly, Jonker Afrikaner&#x2019;s entire tribe was subsequently liquidated in South West Africa. Fifthly, on 23rd August, 1880, all &#x2018;the Namas at Okahandja were murdered at the command of the Herero. These are only a few examples.</p>

In this struggle and chaotic situation it is interesting to note how the nations of South West Africa dwindled in numbers. If one looks up the minutes of the Conference of Rhenish missionaries, which was held at Otjingbingwe in March, 1856, one finds the following (translation.)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Herero nation as we knew it no longer exists. All that remain are individuals without any ties. They find themselves in an extremely unfortunate position, and wander about the country.</block>

<p>That is the result of this chaotic state of affairs which prevailed in South West Africa. Of course these various nations did on various occasions try to preserve peace amongst them by means of peace treaties. For example they tried to achieve this in 1859 at a place called Hoachanas. They even established a kind of U.N. there. Section 1 of that manifesto was drawn up in High Dutch and makes quite significant reading (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No chief with his nation will have the right to defend himself when a conflict arises between him and another chief who is more powerful &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, one nation may attack another, but the other nation may not defend itself. In this confusion the Bantu of South West Africa during this time turned to the white man in their efforts to preserve the peace. In 1863, for example, the researcher and hunter C. J. Anderson who had no knowledge of government whatsoever, was appointed by the headmen and councillors of Hereroland as regent and commander-in-chief of the tribe. On 9th September, 1876, 58 head-men of the Hereros submitted a petition to the Cape Government in which they stated that they wished &#x201C;that our children may grow up more civilized than we ever had the chance of doing. Consequently we have, after many meetings, agreed amongst ourselves to request your Excellency to send someone to govern us and be the head of our country&#x201D;. In exchange for this they offered the entire Namib, the entire Kaokoveld, the areas adjacent to Waterberg, Otani, Grootfontein, Tsumeb, Out-jo, etc.</p>

<p>I want to point out that the system of autogenous development with fixed boundaries was a system initiated by the Bantu themselves. For example, at the peace conference of the Nama chiefs and the Herero chiefs on 13th June, 1882, this significant clause was included in the peace treaty (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the signatories to the peace treaty deem it necessary to provide that members of the various tribes shall in future be prevented from living and hunting amongst one another, and that at first, until such time as final arrangements are made under this treaty, all migrant Nama, Bastards and Herero shall carry a pass from their headman.</block>

<p>In other words, they introduced the pass system themselves. When the German r&#x00E9;gime set foot in South West, it saw only one solution for maintaining the peace between the various tribes, and that was to proclaim separate areas, each one with a fixed boundary. This was subsequently done. The first area was proclaimed on 10th April, 1898. Because they could not determine proper boundaries immediately, they even went so far as to draw furrow lines with a plough in order to indicate the boundaries of the areas which the various tribes could occupy. In 1904 this system of allocating territory to each nation reached its peak, and 33,600,000 hectares had been proclaimed. According to the plan of the Odendaal Commission a surface area of 32,629,364 hectares had been proclaimed.</p>

<p>The Bantu themselves welcomed separate development, particularly after they saw how it worked. Let me quote in this regard from the report of the South West Africa Commission of 1936, and I want to quote only the evidence of two chiefs. The first is Chief Muala of the Okualuthi tribe (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the Union Government took this country we have been living on a much friendlier footing with the other tribes than before. Previously a man had to carry a knobkerrie and a knife with him when he wanted to pay a visit to a friend, but to-day we are all good friends and there is no <span class="col_5025-5026" refersTo="#page_1146"/>need to do so. All is going well with us and we are satisfied and we hope that all is going well with the Union Government.</block>

<p>In addition, Headman Elize Nejulu of the Ukuayama tribe said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the Union officials were established here by the Union Government there have been no complaints. At first there were many complaints from the Natives, and they were accustomed to fighting.</block>

<p>I will let these two statements by these two witnesses suffice, because my time is limited. But the League of Nations also welcomed this system of separate development, not only between the Bantu nations separately but also between the Bantu and the Whites. In this way, for example, the Permanent Mandate Commission decided on 2nd August, 1922&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is desirable out of respect for the principles defined in article 22 of the Covenant that the Native inhabitants of the territories of Mandates B and C should receive a national status clearly distinguished from that of the nationals or subjects of the mandatory power.</block>

<p>In other words, they were opposed to the Bantu of South West acquiring citizenship of the then Union of South Africa. However, they resolved on 7th August, 1922&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission expresses the hope that the primitive organization in tribes may be maintained unaltered wherever it still exists.</block>

<p>In other words, that the tribal system should be preserved at all costs. That is why the then Union Government, in terms of section 26 of the South West Africa Constitution Act, Act No. 42 of 1925, reserved Bantu affairs and did not transfer it to the local Government in South West Africa. It is also significant that in 1926, when the Permanent Mandate Commission resolved to draw up a questionnaire in respect of South West Africa&#x2014;a questionnaire which differed radically from the first questionnaire they sent&#x2014;the following significant question was asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Question d (12): &#x201C;Do Natives take part in the general Administration and, if so, to what extent?&#x201D;</block>

<p>That was the question. Those persons representing the Union Government who went to the Permanent Mandate Commission in order to reply to this question and explain it, stated the situation quite correctly. The Commission was satisfied with that. I am referring for example to the minutes of the 9th session, 1926, page 35. During the 1935 session Lord Lugard expressed his satisfaction that the Bantu were also being consulted by the South West Africa Commission in regard to a suitable form of government. He added at once that he was not very hopeful &#x2026; &#x201C;as constitutional questions were beyond the understanding of the masses&#x201D;. It is also significant that General Smuts, in his Draft Constitution, &#x201C;the Representation of South West Africa Act, 1946&#x201D;, a constitution which was drawn up but which was never laid upon the Table in this Parliament, provided that South West Africa would be represented by four members of the House of Assembly and two Senators, but that the Members of Parliament would all be Whites, and that only Whites would be able to participate in elections. This process of autogenous development, which this legislation is completing to-day, is not the result of something which we discovered a decade or two ago. It is a long process which was welcomed by the Bantu. I want in fact to point out how the Bantu in South West Africa have increased in number under the peaceful circumstances which have prevailed since then. In 1925 the national census recorded 186,175 Bantu. In 1935 there were 248,000. In 1939 there were as many as 283,000 and in 1960 there were 526,004. In other words, over the last 20 years the population increase amongst the Bantu in South West Africa has been 187 per cent. There is no other country in the world that can beat that. During the last 35 years, from 1925 to 1960, the increase in population amongst the Bantu in South West Africa was 282 per cent. I reiterate that there is no country in the world which can beat that.</p>

<p>I should also like to quote a few experts. Perhaps I should, however, first quote a layman. This is a layman who analysed this situation very carefully, and who acquired first-hand knowledge in South West Africa for many years. I am referring now to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I am calling the hon. member a layman because he stated his standpoint in a rather banal fashion. He stated it in a pamphlet which he published during an election in South West Africa in 1947 when he was still organizer of the United Party, and not the National Party. He compared the situation in South West Africa to that of the Republic. I want to mention this because it is being said to-day that the Republic of South Africa is forcing its apartheid policy upon South West Africa. I now want to quote to you precisely what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said in this pamphlet. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is in this country no colour question as the Union knows it. There are in this country no mixed residential areas. There are in this country no mixed transport facilities. In South West Africa apartheid between White and Coloured has been successfully applied for many years. Consider this: it is the U.N.S.W.P. which has been governing South West Africa for the past 21 years already.</block>

<p><span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="#page_1147"/>The U.N.S.W.P. was the South West United Party. It is interesting that these &#x201C;mixed transport facilities&#x201D; and &#x201C;mixed residential areas&#x201D;, are his &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D; which he gets so upset about every day. I want, apart from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout whom I regard as layman in this field, to quote from the doctoral thesis of a person whom, in my opinion, is a real authority. In the first instance this person is a South West African. He lived amongst the Ovambos for many years, and got to know them very well. He is not a Nationalist. This man, Dr. Louis L. van Tonder, grew up on my neighbouring farm as the son of a well-known United Party supporter. They still do so to this day. I want to quote him for this reason, because I believe that he did not make these assertions on the basis of his political convictions, but purely from a scientific point of view. In the first place of course he rejects integration. On page 17 of his thesis he writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any man who believes that &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, equality and integration bring about civilization or racial harmony is living blindfolded in a fool&#x2019;s paradise.</block>

<p>He goes further and makes the statement that the multi-racialism of Ovamboland has been solved there by territorial separation. Hon. members who accompanied the tour there, would have seen that in Ovamboland the Okavangos, the Ondanguas, the Ogandjeras as well as the other tribes are living separately. He has the following to say about Ovamboland&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The northern part of South West Africa is indeed the only part of Africa north of the Zambezi where tribal conflicts as a result of ethnic heterogeneity have been completely resolved through territorial division. It was a natural movement long before the white man came, when war and bloodshed persisted because of ambitious black leaders. When the tribal borders were eventually settled, it was simply making something legal which had long existed and which had to be from then on observed without further conflict.</block>

<p>He went further and praised this system of the development of the tribal system and of autogenous development. He stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is, in fact, the only way of self-determination and justice where domination and exploitation by one superior group is completely ruled out.</block>

<p>He went further and spoke with appreciation of the development of the tribal system and the value it had for the Bantu. In respect of these values he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These values mean more to the indigenous man than anything the white man can ever hope to offer him. When these values are lost it leaves behind an empty shell in mind and spirit, devoid of all feelings of traditional pride which more often than not can only prove its individuality through the expression of violence and racial hatred.</block>

<p>He is convinced that this system is the only positive system which can be followed in South West Africa. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Natural segregation between different ethnic groups and races seen as separate homelands with adequate land from which to develop into an independent economic and political unit, is a justified and balanced process. To advocate or force detribalization and integration, or even partial integration, on different ethnic groups who have nothing in common, not even the colour of the skins, is to advocate perpetual dependence and conflict, domination, racial discrimination, upper and lower social strata, and unequal distribution of rights and privileges, and also duties and responsibilities.</block>

<p>He also compares separate development with integration and he states that autogenous development is the only and the best guarantee for true peace. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Different ethnic groups or races have never yet been able to inhabit permanently the same country without each having its own territory. There has come about either complete disaster, or entirely new boundaries creating new independent states. Also, different races with varying numerical strength cannot be kept together in the same territory even with a single government representing all races. Sooner or later there must come political catastrophe, domination and exploitation. With separate territories, where both black and white can live independently, the situation is altogether different. New states will have to be created not by physical force, but by the sheer spirit of the people concerned. There will be no domination or advantages, but both black and white will give and take the highest possession of all&#x2014;security.</block>

<p>There are reasons why this lecturer described this system in the way he did. He analysed it with reference to the writings of many world experts on this matter. It is very clear that when there are various races, which differ from one another, such as the Damaras and the Ovambos, or the Ovambos and the Hereros, and those groups are equally strong, one finds a virtually equal division. There is then the tendency to break down or to separate, as is happening to-day between Nigeria and Biafra, and also in the Congo. Where there is a minority, it is the tendency to build the political system of that country on that tribal division. In other words, the tribe which is in the minority, is thrown into the opposition benches for all time and it will never get out of those benches to take over the government. Of course no success can be achieved with this <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="#page_1148"/>system of government. When one has the situation where a tribe is associated with its political party, it does not hate the government because it is the government, but because the government comprises members of another tribe. That is the reason why there is so much hatred and envy in African states to-day. This is the fundamental cause of the problems in South Africa, as they exist to-day. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has just spoken about self-determination. Self-determination is the basic right to which every nation in the world to-day can lay claim. Why should only America, Russia and other great nations of the world be able to do so? Why not the Hereros, the Damaras, and the other groups that are in the minority? Why cannot they lay claim to self-determination? Self-determination does not normally mean that they are now going to become independent nations and that fragmentation will take place in South West Africa, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggested. Self-determination does not mean that it is going to be left to those nations to decide what they are going to do in the last instance. As far as the Hereros, for example, are concerned, they can, if they have self-determination, make attempts to integrate with the Ovambos for example. They can do that. That is their self-determination. It will of course not be self-determination for the Ovambos if the Hereros integrate with them unilaterally. It must come from both sides. It furnishes them with a system which is acknowledged by the modern world and by every political system which exists to-day.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with the speech of the hon. member for Middelland, who has just sat down, before dealing with the Bill. Firstly, may I say that the question of integration does not arise in this Bill, nor, as far as I am concerned, should it find any place in the debate. [Interjection.] If the hon. member has that in mind, he should come clean and tell us so, but as far as we on this side of the House are concerned there is no question of integration in this Bill; it does not arise and we should not waste time debating it.</p>

<p>I am going to say clearly and categorically that this Bill is a Bill which will lead to the Nationalist Party policy of integration south of the red line, because with this principle once established here the Minister will never resist the temptation to carry out south of the red line the policy he applies to the north of the red line. He cannot help it, and the Nationalist Party policy of integration south of the red line will follow just as night follows day.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down gave us a dissertation in regard to the early wars in South West Africa, which one can read in the hon. Heinrich Vedder&#x2019;s book on South West. It is all set out there in detail. The hon. member went on to say that that is what happened when they had all these separate Bantu tribes, Native tribes and Coloured tribes.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member has not read the Rev. Vedder&#x2019;s book if he says it was because there were no boundaries. They had their boundaries, and what happened? What happened was exactly what happened to the pastoral tribes in the olden days, in the days of the Israelites; they encroached on each other&#x2019;s grazing. Let me bring to the hon. member&#x2019;s mind a very well-known and apt principle where you are dealing with people. The point of contact is the point of friction. I hope the hon. member will bear that in mind, and the more points of contact the Government proposes to create, the more points of friction will they have. But the hon. member made the point again that when the white man came in there he brought peace, and the white man did that here in South Africa as well. He agrees. But what is he proposing in this Bill? To take away the white man and to take away the peace. Sir, he cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p>What we cannot rely upon is that when white suzerainty is removed from savage people, from people who have not yet risen in the scale of civilization to our level, the aboriginal Natives of Africa, etc., they will still remain your friends when that guardianship is removed, when the discipline and control are removed, and that is why I say to the hon. member: Take away the white man and you will have trouble again. Why are we maintaining peace in the Transkei? It is a normal, law-abiding part of our own country, but the white man maintains the peace. We all know that. Proclamation No. 400 is still there. The Minister does not come to Parliament to have it re-enacted year by year so that we can discuss it. He keeps that proclamation there. For how many years has <span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="#page_1149"/>it been there now? It must be four years now that they have had self-determination or self-government or independence, or whatever you call it. They cannot rely upon the friendship of those nations when the time comes and the white man is not there. What happened to the metropolitan powers? What happened to the people over whom Britain was the sovereign power? What happened to the people over whom the French and the Belgians were the sovereign powers? They turned round and fought their previous masters. There is some of the bitterest hatred to-day on the part of those black peoples towards the metropolitan powers who were their masters. That is the position to-day still. We have to bear this in mind continuously.</p>

<p>The circumstances are not different; the hon. member is different, and that is why he thinks the circumstances are different. But the situation is not different.</p>

<p>Let us deal with this Bill for a moment. We all want to see peace and security in South West Africa. We all want to see a settlement there where the aboriginal inhabitants, or at least those who have been there for the past 50 or 60 years, are happy and living in contentment. As opposed to what the hon. member for Middelland said, the Minister was quite right when he said that north of the red line there had not been so much civil war between the various tribes there; the wars had taken place south of the red line. It did not take place to the same extent north of the red line. Those people have been there for a longer period, living in peace and amity together. When I say that we want them all to live in peace together and we want a settlement there, we want it in terms of the security of South Africa as much as for the sake of the security of the people of South West Africa and the people north of the red line. The peace and well-being and security of South Africa must at any rate be of equal importance to us as the peace and security of the people who are there. I want to describe this Bill as the Bill which should never have been. This Bill should never have been. Why in heaven&#x2019;s name does the Government come at a time like this with a Bill of this nature? Have we not got enough pointers and indications already that we have the attention of the hostile part of the world concentrated on us in South Africa? Have we not sufficient indication of it from almost every publication that comes from overseas, in every walk of life, from our sportsmen, whether they are white or black, to give us a clear indication of how far that hostility will go and this concentrated hatred of South Africa? But the Government chooses this moment to come with a measure such as this which, no matter how mild it may be, will trigger off a fresh outbreak of virulent hatred towards South Africa. Why do it? There was no need for it. This Bill is a thing with two faces. If you take one face, looking at it from one angle, it looks as if we are offering self-government to the people in Ovamboland, and this can be a basis upon which the other tribes referred to in the Bill can in due course get what is called self-government. May I define the term here at once, because I do not want to see it misused; I refer to the term &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D;. Let us get it clear that self-determination is an absolute. You can talk about independence and find that it is not sovereign independence. You can talk about self-government. You can even talk about sovereign government and you still do not mean what it says, but when you talk about self-determination, then you are talking about an absolute, something that brooks no qualification whatever. With regard to the Bill before us, I say that on the one side, looking at one face of the coin, you see something which looks as though the Government is proposing to give self-government to these people in Ovamboland, up to the point where they do not get self-determination. In terms of this Bill, they cannot get self-determination. On the other side, this thing is an empty husk. By proclamation the Government will control every single step taken by the people of Ovamboland. They have that power to-day through the Administrator. I repeat, why do they come at this time with a measure of this kind, of such far-reaching importance and so open to criticism, which will give our enemies a two-edged sword with which to hack at us? On the one hand the criticism will be that this is an empty husk because there is nothing in it; the white racialists of South Africa are using it for the purpose of proclamations and they will continue their control over the Ovambo people, and there is nothing whatever in this Bill which will give them any kind of self-determination whatsoever; and on the other hand there will be the criticism against us that we are going much too slow. We profess to be giving them self-government; we profess to be allowing them to develop as they go forward to self-determination and the criticism will be that we are going too slowly and, Sir, on top of all that, as my hon. Leader has pointed out, will lie that main criticism which will be based upon the mandate. Again I say, why should we? Let us take a wider view. I want to come back for a moment to a couple of points made by my hon. Leader and elaborate on them. Sir, here we are in South Africa at the present time with a defence ring to the north of us, a defence ring which is of incalculable value to us in terms of human lives and happiness in South Africa, our well-being economically, the lives of our women, children and men as well as of our institutions, because we are defended by the Portuguese, by the people in Rhodesia and the Portuguese on this side. In everyone of those spheres there is fighting taking place. I am sick and tired, Sir, of hearing talk about <span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="#page_1150"/>people who are called terrorists and saboteurs and that sort of thing.</p>

They are aiming at us, Sir, but they still have to get through those other countries which are defending us. I hope that the hon. member for Middelland, who sits there with a smile on his face, is going to accept this as far as South West Africa is concerned. The Portuguese who are fighting in Angola are fighting to defend the people in South West Africa. And what does the Government do at a time like this? They come with the profession, as set out in the preamble to this Bill, of giving the people of Ovamboland the right of self-determination, the absolute.</p>

<p>Sir, I take the White Paper as being part and parcel of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech. It has that value to me. It is not part of the law but it has a value; it means something, and when the White Paper says that this is an irrevocable step which the Government is taking towards such-and-such an end, which, as set out in the preamble, is towards self-determination, then I say that that is as good as though the Minister said it. He quoted at length from the White Paper himself. Once we create the position that south of Angola we have an area in which people will be entitled to say, &#x201C;self-government has been conferred upon this territory&#x201D; they can leapfrog the whole of the Portuguese troops in Angola and the terrorists or Freedom Fighters&#x2014;call them what you will &#x2014;have a ready-made launching pad right there on our borders. Sir, could anything be more utterly stupid and more unwise in the context of current affairs? As my hon. Leader has said, to-day we are getting oil from Kabinda. Do we know what further oil is going to be found further down in Angola? The exploration is coming from the north of Africa, right in Algeria. It has come down step by step from Nigeria where one of the biggest oil wells in the world has been found near Port Harcourt. It is coming down now to Kabinda, still further south.</p>

<p>All that oil can be brought to us overland by pipeline if South Africa&#x2019;s need comes to the worst. But what do we do? We are going to establish independent Bantustans between us and our friends and our armed allies fighting for us. We are turning their flank. What will the Government of Portugal think about this little co-operation as far as the Government of South Africa is concerned? Sir, we are turning their military flank and we are turning our own. This Bill should never have been brought before Parliament and it was not necessary. There was an opportunity in a matter of this importance for the hon. the Prime Minister, by making some opening, by offering some kind of opportunity for discussion, for a dialogue with the Leader of the Opposition, to have prevented any kind of a debate of this nature taking place here. This does no one any good, South Africa least of all, and the Government is entirely responsible because they are the people who have the initiative. Is this the time and place for it? They have chosen an opportunity like this to come with a measure of this kind. Sir, can anything be not only more unwise but catastrophic in its possible consequences for South Africa?</p>

<p>Sir, have hon. members opposite not given any thought whatsoever to the consequences which can flow from a Bill of this kind? Throughout history the metropolitan powers have said: &#x201C;We will determine when the subject people get their freedom&#x201D;, people of the standing of the French Empire, of Britain, of Belgium and of Holland, but, Sir, when the time came not a single one of those nations was able to determine the date on which freedom came. In every case, when the time came, the nation that was hankering for its freedom, fixed the time. And here, in spite of the lessons of history, we still get hon. members on the Government side saying, &#x201C;We will determine when the time comes and when we are going to give them their freedom&#x201D;. Sir, it is against history. [Interjections.] Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister must not speak; he has said that they are ready for freedom now. He said that the other day in South West Africa.</p>

<p>As I say, the Government had the initiative and has chosen in cold blood and after proper consideration to bring this measure here at this time, at a time like this in the history of South Africa, never mind the history of the world. It is incredible, Sir, and it will stand condemned in the eyes of every South African who gives thought to this matter and realizes the implications of what the Government is doing. Mark my words, Sir, this measure is going to lead to an upsurge of criticism of South Africa. Instead of making the friends that we so badly need in the world, we are going to do nothing but add to the ranks of our enemies, and this Bill, which is a Government measure for which they are responsible, will be responsible for that upsurge of hostility against us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#frank">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. FRANK</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place the hon. the Leader of the Opposition congratulated the hon. Minister on the fact that he was now introducing a form of direct taxation into these areas, whereas the Minister of Coloured Affairs had refused to do so. There is a world of difference between this Act and the other one, since it is precisely the purpose of this Act to establish separate areas, and since it is of course quite possible to introduce a form of direct taxation.</p>

<p>Then, too, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave us a very fine philosophical lecture on the word &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D;. But unfortunately international world opinion, specifically the U.N., is insisting to-day that the right of self-determination be granted to nations. Whether we understand the definition or not, international world opinion is insisting upon it and consequently we must, as a member of the U.N., develop in that direction in our various areas. I just want to make it clear that this Bill itself, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition also stated, does not of course grant independence in any sense of the word. It merely makes provision for this right of self-determination.</p>

<p>There is also the point that in terms of this measure the State President is being granted wide powers. It is true that these powers he is being granted here are very wide, but this has to be the case. Of course the position in South West Africa is very much in its initial stages; it is a very fluid position. There are many different tribes in different areas, and it is obvious that the hon. the Minister cannot return at frequent intervals to this Parliament to obtain approval of the various authorities, etc. I assume&#x2014;and this is of course the case&#x2014; that as soon as governments in the different areas begin to take permanent shape the hon. the Minister will in fact come to this House in order to have the powers of the different legislative assemblies defined, as subsequently happened in the case of the Transkei. I just want to point out that, in regard to these wide powers of the State President, they form an inherent part of the Constitution in South West Africa. These were created when the Mandate was introduced in 1919, i.e. these powers of the State President to make laws applicable in the territory by way of proclamation. Under the Constitution Act of 1925, which followed, the State President, at that time the Governor-General, retained the same powers. It is interesting to note that in 1949 here was a departure from this provision in the Act, but it was very soon found, in 1951, that the Constitution was inadequate without those powers, and for this reason that the laws of South Africa can from time to time be made applicable to South West Africa. The laws of South Africa are not all made applicable to South West Africa. From time to time, while Parliament is not in session, certain circumstances arise which make it necessary for a piece of South African legislation to be made applicable there. I have in mind the case which cropped up in 1950-&#x2019;51. In 1949 sudden devaluation took place. It was then found that the Financial Institutions Act did not apply to South West Africa. Consequently the assistance of the State President had to be called in so that his powers could be used. In this way there were various cases which necessitated the use of those powers. According to section 14 (2) of the Act it is true that a month&#x2019;s notice has to be given before a State President can proclaim any such Act there, and that he must also do so after consultation with the Legislative Assembly, unless compelled to do so immediately as a result of emergencies. Apart from the fact that it is desirable to have these powers because, as I have said, the laws of South Africa are not all applicable to South West Africa, there is another essential reason for these powers having to be included in the Act&#x2014;it is an existing power which the State President already has, and it is inherent in the South West Africa Constitution: It was provided in terms of the Mandate Treaty of 1919 that the Union could apply its laws in South West Africa, with amendments owing to circumstances in South West Africa. That is why the State President must also have the power to amend acts which have to be made applicable in South West Africa.</p>

<p>At this juncture, when the U.N. is questioning our jurisdiction over South West Africa, it is in fact essential that we retain this inherent right of the State President in order to confirm our sovereign power over South West Africa. Now I just want to point out that the South West Africa Constitution Act introduced this year also provides that the State President continue to retain his powers, except over those matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly. Since <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="#page_1152"/>these separate areas are now going to be established, it is obvious that the Legislative Assembly is going to lose certain powers over these areas. That is why it is necessary that provision should once again be made by this legislation for those powers through the State President.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader also emphasized that the non-Whites will be consulted in regard to their right to self-determination&#x2014;their future &#x2014;and not the Whites. But he forgot of course that the Whites of South West Africa have full representation in the Legislative Assembly, as well as in the Parliament of the Republic. The white representatives in the Republic of South Africa have full say, together with all other members here, in regard to the fate of South West Africa. In other words, the white inhabitants of South West Africa have as much self-determination to-day as the white voters in South Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to Damaraland and Hereroland it is true that by far the greatest portion of the population of these areas is to-day living outside the areas. However, we must bear in mind that the thousands living outside the areas do not own any property. They are receiving major benefits in that tremendous areas are being granted to them. I think that R30 million has already been spent in purchasing farms from Whites for the Damaras and Hereros who are to-day living outside their homelands. This land is being consolidated for them.</p>

<p>The hon. Leader and the hon. member for South Coast expressed the fear that we are now going to create a danger in Ovamboland in that this country lies between us and Angola to the north. Later on I shall analyze in broad outlines the position as it will be in terms of this policy contained in the legislation before us, and what it would be under the policy which the United Party advocates. Now the truth of the matter is that we simply have no alternative. The hon. member for South Coast made the statement that where the Whites are governing, there peace prevails. Of course he is quite right, because wherever the Whites went, peace followed. Wherever the Whites are governing, there peace prevails, but unfortunately the world does not want to allow this. We would all have been pleased if the world had allowed the Whites to remain on elsewhere in Africa. Then we would of course have had peace in all those States. For years England maintained a peaceful situation in her territories. We are also maintaining peace here in South Africa. But now the world does not want to allow this. The hon. member for South Coast knows what resolutions have been adopted in regard to South West Africa.</p>

<p>No, it is not a question of pressure. After all, the whole world is changing. It is merely a question of evolution. We must accept that developments are taking place in the various tribes. As underdeveloped countries and tribes develop they demand more and more rights, and because we have to grant them these rights, that is why we are doing so. As people develop, they are granted more rights. We are not granting them more rights because we are compelled to do so; we are granting them more rights for humane reasons. As people develop historically, one has to grant them more rights.</p>

<p>We must choose a form of development. I shall discuss this at greater length later on, but at the moment I want to ask the hon. member: What do we prefer? Do we prefer a dangerously independent South West Africa with its boundaries at the Orange River, 300 to 400 miles from Cape Town, or would we prefer such a state to be above the Etosha Pan? In terms of the policy of the United Party the non-Whites, owing to their numerical superiority, will have to take over in South West Africa. That is obvious. If that must happen, then we have an independent non-white state, not above the Etosha Pan, but with the Orange River as boundary, near to us, and that is the difference between their policy and ours.</p>

<p>South Africa has given the world the assurance time and again that we will govern South West Africa in the spirit of the mandate, namely to promote, to the greatest possible extent, the material and moral welfare and the social development of the inhabitants. This legislation envisages the continuation of that kind of government. The question now is whether with the legislation now before us, we are in fact on the right road. I think that it is generally accepted that an ideal situation prevails in a country when that country has a homogeneous population which governs itself. The Opposition are probably in agreement with that. They have stated repeatedly that they would welcome such a system in South Africa as well, but they maintain that they regard it as unpractical. The question now arises as to whether the policy is practicable in South West Africa. If we here in South Africa had had a homogeneous population it would have been a true Utopia. The United Party would have welcomed it.</p>

<p>If we look into the history of South West Africa we find it to be an account such as the one sketched by the hon. member for Middelland. <span class="col_5039-5040" refersTo="#page_1153"/>We find an account of disunity, murder and destruction, of one war after another between the various races, and all this with only one end in view, i.e. to dominate through conquest. We who know South West Africa also know that it will be an impossible task to bring about co-operation between the various race groups and the acceptance of a joint mixed essential authority. I can state that with the utmost conviction here. I can say beyond doubt that if the Whites, to please the United Nations, were to withdraw from South West Africa to-morrow, the country would go up in flames within a few hours. The reason for that is the enmity between the various non-white groups, and enmity which assumes alarming proportions. I am simply stating a fact. They have absolutely no time for each other. There is a deep-rooted historical hatred between them. We will never obtain their co-operation in appointing a composite government consisting of the various racial elements over them. The situation that if races were to be grouped together it would lead to an internal struggle for domination, is a situation which of course is not unique to South West Africa. We find similar situations in most of our developed countries. We find this fierce struggle in the U.S.A. and even in Great Britain. We have proof that even if races do enjoy a large measure of development, the integration of various races&#x2014;and I am speaking more specifically now of white and black races&#x2014;is an impossible task. In this regard I want to refer to a very interesting leading article which appeared in <i>The Cape Argus</i> of 30th April, barely a week ago, under the title &#x201C;The Nigerian Crisis&#x201D;, I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hopes for peace talks on the Nigerian crisis stemming from Biafra&#x2019;s armed breakaway bid remain high in spite of both sides insisting on their own terms. The difficulties in getting talks going bring into sharp focus two of the most insistent problems in present-day Africa: the resurgence of tribalism against regionalism and the ready resort to force of arms to dissolve conflict. Tanzania&#x2019;s belated recognition of Biafra&#x2019;s claim to independence from Nigeria, and speculation on further formal African support, are a significant departure from earlier insistence on the sanctity of firm, centralized government.</block>

<p>That is what the Opposition advocates. There is a &#x201C;significant departure from earlier insistence on the sanctity &#x2026;&#x201D; I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the immediate post-independence years African politicos argued passionately for a centralized structure as a foil to inherent tribal fissures. Indeed, so vociferous was the protest at Katanga&#x2019;s secession that the United Nations itself was persuaded actively to intervene in the name of Congolese unity. It is a matter of history that Mr. Tshombe and his copper rich province were brought to heel. Yet a striking parallel, with a reverse current, exists in present events in West Africa. Biafra, which taps the major share of Nigeria&#x2019;s expanding oil economy, defiantly follows Katanga&#x2019;s course&#x2014;and now, perhaps even in her death throes in the armed confrontation with Federal Forces, the breakaway state suddenly finds herself championed by influential friends. Whatever the outcome, in the final analysis the Biafran affair again points to the sorry chapter of African federation; starting with the ill-fated Mali union, and near home, the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Nor is the oft-considered East African alliance apparently any nearer political acceptance. Furthermore, the fashionable creation of military establishments as national cure-alls in Nigeria and elsewhere have, far from inspiring new progress, brought bloodshed, counter-revolution and a stifling of legitimate political expression.</block>

<p>I am reading this last sentence particularly because the United Party states that they will maintain the races, even if it has to be with force. But this writer states that steps such as these &#x201C;brought bloodshed, counter-revolution &#x2026;&#x201D;, etc. This is what happens if countries are forced to remain within a framework, and they do not want to remain within that framework.</p>

<p>In view of what I have quoted here, it is clear that it is essential to allocate to each race its own homeland and then develop it. That is what we are doing. In this way they can in due course obtain self-determination. The point was raised here in regard to how long it was going to take before those areas became independent. It was suggested here that we were going to grant independence immediately and that we would be creating a danger by doing so. I want to point to a few parallels. This state of South Africa was established in 1910, and it took us 50 years to decide of our own free will to become a Republic. We are a highly developed nation, nevertheless we waited 50 years before we decided that we were powerful enough, defensible and economically strong enough to take the step we did in fact take.</p>

<p>How long is it going to take the undeveloped tribes in South West Africa to become viable, capable of defending themselves, and economically strong enough to be able to maintain their independence? That ought to serve as a reply to the question.</p>

<p>It has also been asked here: What about our foreign relations with these countries? According to the United Party we are going to create hostile states on our borders. Let us take another look at the historical situation, and we can take South Africa as an example again. Since 1910 England has not prescribed to us what our political development should be. She has not tried to dominate us through a federal or central parliament, particularly <span class="col_5041-5042" refersTo="#page_1154"/>not through a federal parliament, which is what the United Party is now suggesting, where proportionately we would have had practically no say. England supported us in the economic field by granting us preferential tariffs for example. In the military field she supported us by training men, and supplying us with weapons. She maintained our overseas services. Since 1910 she virtually granted us self-determination. What was the result of her attitude towards us? Our relations throughout were on a friendly basis, and when we decided to become a Republic, we were still desirous of remaining in the Commonwealth. However, that was refused us. But up to this day the relations between ourselves and Britain have been very friendly, and this is so because England has, over the years, adopted a certain attitude towards us. To-day certain defence agreements still exist between us. That is why I cannot see how these areas which we want to guide towards self-determination in the same way with this economic and other assistance, will develop into hostile states. Another factor is that in the 50 years between 1910 and 1960 there has in South Africa never been any important question of revolution, but rather of evolution.</p>

<p>Let us consider what will happen under the United Party if they were to apply their policy. Let us take the case of Ovamboland. They want to give Ovamboland representation in a federal parliament. They say that at first they will be represented by Whites. Now the question is: What Whites? We will once again have the position which arose when we had white Coloured Representatives in the House. Such improper interference took place that a Commission had to be appointed. We will have precisely the same thing happening in respect of Ovamboland with its white representatives. Whom would they elect as their representatives? The Liberal Party? The Progressive Party? Who can incite them the most, who can promise them the most? The same thing will happen that happened here in regard to the Coloured Representatives. How many representatives will they have? We must remember that their ratio to Whites in South West Africa is four to one.</p>

<p>The question then arises: Why should they be Whites? Can you see what a conflict would be unleashed if the United Party&#x2019;s policy were to be applied? The United Party will ultimately have to give way to pressure. Let us argue like adults now, and admit that their representatives will not continue to be Whites for all time. Non-Whites will subsequently have to be allowed. Then, Mr. Speaker, a fierce struggle will arise because they will want proportionately as many non-White representatives as the Whites have in the federal body. Then the non-Whites will dominate the federal parliament owing to their numerical superiority, or otherwise the Federation will fall apart in the same way as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland fell apart because the Whites will not be satisfied with that. And that, in my opinion, is what will happen. Then you can ask yourself the question: Why set a process in motion which after years of discord and struggle will lead to a fierce racial conflict? A chaotic explosion will then take place in the race federation, in the same way as this happened in the Federation. To-day we have the position of Rhodesia and Zambia. Then we will also have a hostile state, and that is precisely what the United Party is now warning us against. The result of our policy will be that we will develop in the opposite direction. We will have a friendly state on our national borders, a country which we will, over the years, help as much as we can. But the policy of that party will lead to a conflict. When the Federation fell apart, the hostility was there. The Federation was forcibly broken up, and now we have eternal enmity prevailing there. We shall have the same situation here, and then that is what the United Party predicts will happen under our policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast said that this measure was creating even further dangers for us abroad. I predict that as soon as the implication of this legislation are realized, and as soon as the tangible results begin to appear, the world attitude will change. We know what the position in Ovamboland is. There we have already seen the tangible results. We are inviting representatives from other countries, as well as from the U.N.. to visit Ovamboland. We need not fear a referendum there. This is an extremely important point. If we can prove by way of a referendum what the Ovambos in Ovamboland, and the Whites in the white part want, then nobody in the world can object to that. In the meantime we can show the world that we are offering each race full rights in its own area. What is the policy of the United Party? They maintain they will introduce a federal system where the non-Whites will be represented by Whites. Will the U.N. and the rest of the world, be satisfied with that? Will they be satisfied if the number of representatives is quite out of proportion? I do not think it is necessary to make any further comparisons: To any unprejudiced person it is probably clear which policy is the best one.</p>

<p>I return to the point as to whether it is practicable to create areas with homogeneous populations in South West Africa. We are fortunate in that we have sufficient land for all the races in South West Africa. We have already purchased all the necessary land, so that there is more than enough land for all the races. This land allocation which will now take place means that it will be possible to allocate better cultivated and larger areas of land to every indigenous race group than they have ever, in the course of history, effectively controlled or occupied. Any unprejudiced person will have to admit this.</p>

<p>No servant is compelled to work overtime or Sunday time. Service requirements are, however, such that the working of Sunday time and overtime by a large number of servants in various grades, e.g. Locomotive Drivers, Firemen, Guards, Shunters, Crane Drivers, etc., is unavoidable. Cases do occur occasionally where servants who are booked to work Sunday time or overtime fail to do so without advising their supervisors beforehand that they are unable or unwilling to work such Sunday time or overtime, thereby disrupting essential services. In such instances the servants concerned are dealt with under the Disciplinary Regulations. During the period 1965 to 30th April, 1968, 22 cases of this nature have occurred.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We shall oppose the third reading of this Bill because of two clauses, Nos. 3 and 4. The necessity for this legislation arises because in the case of clause 3 there are fears that the administrative steps contemplated by the Government in terms of the legislation passed in 1964 may be declared <i>ultra vires;</i> and in the case of clause 4 the Government has to meet the position where the court has in fact already declared the steps taken there to be <i>ultra vires</i> and illegal. As far as clause 3 is concerned, we opposed its aims and consequences in 1964, and we are still opposed to it. It seeks to extend the migratory system with all its evils of the destruction of family life and insecurity to the rural areas, as well as to urban areas where the Government in fact so desires. Clause 4 extends the powers of the Government to declare prescribed areas in released areas as well as rural areas. This was not contemplated even by the Government members when the 1964 legislation was passed, because it was understood then that released areas, in terms of the definition of the areas to which the Act would be applied, were excluded. The Government, however, sought to apply it to the released area of Evaton and the court ruled that that was not possible. This Bill now, in terms of clause 4, will in fact apply the law to the released area of Evaton. It seeks to go no further as far as released areas are concerned, because the Minister has withdrawn one of the provisions which would have given him the power to extend it to any released area.</p>

<p>Our objection to the provisions of clause 3 applies even more strictly to clause 4, because, a released area is an area where Bantu are allowed to own property and in fact one would expect them to be free to move about in that particular area. The Government&#x2019;s reason for introducing these measures is to be able to control the movement of Bantu and living conditions in congested areas. Now, we are just as keen as the Government to see that there is proper control in congested areas, but as we pointed out in our second-reading speeches, there are other methods of dealing with the problem, and we are still as opposed to the proposition now as we were in 1964 when the legislation was passed in its original form, and we will vote against the third reading.</p>

<p>I, too, am going to oppose the third reading of this Bill. I objected at the second reading to the two clauses which <span class="col_5059-5060" refersTo="#page_1163"/>the hon. member for Transkei has now discussed, as well as to two other clauses in the Bill. The reasons I gave during the second reading still obtain because there has been no change during the Committee Stage of this Bill. I objected to the basic provisions which give the Government complete control over the mobility of South African-born Africans, and also I see no justification for setting up links between the so-called tribal authorities and urban Africans, most of whom have lost all connection with the homelands and consider themselves as urbanized people and wish to be considered as ordinary citizens of the towns in which they live. For the reason that this Bill extends the authority of the Minister in all those spheres, I, too, will vote against the third reading.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to discuss this matter any further. It has been discussed carefully. The hon. members for Transkei and Houghton put forward no new arguments. The only thing the hon. member for Transkei did was to say they had been opposed to this legislation in 1964, and that they were just as opposed to it to-day. I am very sorry that the hon. member and his party have made no progress and have not become more sensible since 1964, but I am not giving up hope and we will simply carry on and see what the position in another four years will be.</p>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>When the Group Areas legislation first came before the House, we on this side of the House warned the Government that the legislation lent itself to a great deal of hardship. Over the last few years this warning has proved to be justified and our worst fears have been proved correct. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I believe the time has come when we on this side of the House have every justification in calling upon the Government to appoint a full-scale commission of inquiry into the functions and operations of the Department of Community Development. Sir, every race group that has been affected by this Department&#x2014;and there is not one race group that has not been affected&#x2014;has been sorry to fall within its tentacles. We find that in the main it is helping no one; that it merely serves to confuse, confound and constrict the population of South Africa. We have heard it said here that this Department is the biggest estate agency in the world. One can add to that that it is certainly also the most heartless estate agency.</p>

<p>In the last three years, according to the figures given to me by the hon. the Minister, the Department has sold over 6,000 houses and 179 blocks of flats. Being an estate agency of the size that it is, it has the great advantage that if business is not good as far as it is <span class="col_5061-5062" refersTo="#page_1164"/>concerned, it merely alters the law and digs deeper into the taxpayers&#x2019; pockets. The Department has not assisted in solving the problem of the shortage of housing, and when they build houses, they build houses for that section of the population that can well afford accommodation in any of our main cities of South Africa. We have had the experience in Durban and elsewhere that blocks of flats have been built for people who are certainly not of the poorer class.</p>

<p>One might say that they are of the class that can well afford to find accommodation, and there is plenty of accommodation of that sort all over the cities concerned. We have had the experience, where flats are built for the Department, that these flats do not in any way measure up to the flats built by private enterprise. We find that houses built by the Department and which sell at the same prices at which speculative builders sell, appear to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Sir, the problem of the shortage of housing has not been solved by this Department. We have the position here in Cape Town that hotels take over the leases on blocks of flats and turn them into hotel annexes. This does not solve the problem of the housing shortage either.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to raise a matter, apart from housing, and that is the question of the hardships created by this Department for the various population groups. I want to quote here a paragraph of a letter addressed to me by a member of a population group which has been affected by the activities of this Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I agree entirely with your demand for a commission of inquiry into the ruthlessness, psychological methods, gross form of intimidation and threats that some of the officials of this Department resort to in their dealings with affected people. One such official has threatened to do all he can to &#x2018; fix me up&#x201D; at a later date.</block>

<p>If this was an isolated incident, I would not have brought it to the attention of this House but in Durban I know there are numerous cases of this happening, day after day. There are cases where the favoured few seem to get hold of the right sort of property while the others have to go without it. I make no apology for saying that an investigation into this Department is not only necessary&#x2014;it will also serve a good purpose for every population group affected by it. We have had numerous cases of people being evicted from their homes, leaving these homes standing empty year after year. In that way they deteriorate. In cases where there were expropriations, people have had to wait years for their money, and not only that. When they get the money ultimately, they find that they have been paid no interest. We have had cases where people were evicted from their homes without there being any alternative accommodation available for them. Why should the Department evict any person from his home if he cannot be offered alternative accommodation?</p>

<p>To take members of the Coloured group or of the Indian group and kick them out of their homes and offer them no alternative accommodation, is a disgrace and a shame on South Africa and on everybody supporting that type of thing. What is more, this has been going on for very long. We as a Christian country cannot any longer tolerate these inhumanities to our fellow human beings.</p>

<p>In areas like Durban the homes of Indians are expropriated at prices bearing no relationship whatsoever to the costs they have to incur to settle elsewhere. If we allow this to continue, we shall stand convicted for years to come. There are so many aspects of the activities of this Department that it is impossible for me during the time at my disposal to deal with them all. Consequently, I want to confine my remarks to saying that the time has come when this most ruthless of Departments, this heartless Department, which deals with so many different sections of the population, and which has ignored the inconvenience caused to people when they have to be shifted from one place to the other, that the activities of this Department must be investigated from top to bottom, and if the hon. the Minister does not agree with me in this, then I say the Government has something to hide.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I think that it is necessary for me to reply now to a few aspects raised so far. Since the scope of the activities of the Department is so extensive, quite a number of the aspects of its work have already cropped up. Therefore, if I do not reply at this stage, but wait until the end of this debate. I shall be on my feet for a very long time if I wish to reply properly to all the points that have been raised.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the request made by the hon. member for Umlazi, i.e. the appointment of a commission to inquire into the activities of the Department of Community Development. I want to point out to the hon. member that in his argument he made the basic mistake of suggesting that it was primarily the task of the State to provide housing. Of course, that is not the case. The responsibility of providing housing is primarily the task of the local authorities and, in fact, this is what the Slums Act explicitly provides in section 3 (b). In that subsection it is provided that it is the duty of every local authority to see to if that in general and as far as circumstances permit the inhabitants of its district are provided with suitable housing.</p>

<p>Therefore it is not primarily the duty of the State to provide the inhabitants of the country with housing, but this is in fact primarily the duty of the local authorities. The Government&#x2019;s contribution is to provide auxiliary machinery. To enable local authorities to carry out properly the task imposed upon them by I this Parliament, the State has established auxiliary <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="#page_1165"/>machinery in the form of a National Housing Fund, the National Housing Commission and the Bantu Housing Board. All three of these bodies operate within the framework of the Department of Community Development. The aid granted to local authorities by the Department, in the first instance, is in the form of assistance in respect of the financing of housing. Building plots and the services required in that connection have been included in that. This applies in the case of people from the lower income groups of all races. The other day we dealt here with the various income groups and explained what each of them was entitled to.</p>

<p>In addition to this financial assistance, the Department provides local authorities with technical advice. For instance, the Department undertakes research in order to effect, for example, the standardizing of structures and to arrange the services in such a way that the best possible standard may be possible at the lowest possible costs. The services Of the C.S.I.R. have been enlisted for this task, and to establish a commission of inquiry into this aspect is not really to the point. In fact, everybody will agree with me that throughout the world building research institute of the C.S.I.R. is being recognized as one of the best institutes of its kind. I had the opportunity of speaking to the head of the Canadian building research institute, an institute which also receives world-wide recognition for the work it carries out. Subsequent to that the director of that institute visited the Republic and amongst other things he paid a visit to the building research institute of the C.S.I.R. in Pretoria. He informed me afterwards that the institute in South Africa had made greater advances in the field of research concerning housing for the lower income groups than any other bureau in the world has done. It is therefore unnecessary to investigate this aspect.</p>

<p>In addition to these services the Department also supervises the work done by local authorities so as to ensure that local authorities perform their duties. It activates local authorities which fail to do so. As regards the smaller local authorities, they are requested from time to time to undertake physical surveys in their areas so as to determine the actual housing needs. Subsequent to that those in need of housing are classified into the various income groups so as to ascertain what category of aid they qualify for. In accordance with that the smaller local authorities are then assisted in working out and providing the schemes they themselves require. Technical and other assistance are being provided in that regard.</p>

<p>The position in respect of the larger local authorities, particularly the urban areas, is that in the housing department of its town clerk each local authority has machinery which deals with these matters, the task of which it is to determine needs. The hon. member for Umlazi is making a major argument out of this, namely that nobody knows what the housing needs are. Where must one go to if one wants to find out what these needs are? It is not the task of my Department to determine these needs; it is the task of the local authorities to determine these needs in their own areas.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My Department activates them from time to time and encourages them to determine those needs, but at this stage I am not prepared to take over the functions of the local authorities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>You have taken them over in every other respect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We must choose between these two alternatives: it is either my task or that of the local authorities. I stand by the view that it is correct that this is the task of the local authorities, because they are best equipped to gauge the circumstances within their areas. They are best equipped to make physical surveys. They are best equipped to assess the trends in their areas, and they are getting from my Department all the technical and other assistance they want. In accordance with their needs and the demand in their areas they must then draw up a programme for the implementation of services. That is why my Department provides the income groups which fall within the scope of the activities of my Department, with the necessary financing, once again in respect of services, housing, and so forth.</p>

<p>Therefore the hon. member for Umlazi can and should, in the first instance, go to the local authorities if he wishes to find out what the actual needs are. But now it is also true, as the hon. member for Langlaagte said, that where one deals with local authorities in a metropolitan area, one often comes across the case of a person whose name is not only on the waiting list of one local authority, but also on those of adjoining local authorities. In that way his name may appear on the waiting lists of three, four or five different local authorities. Merely to add up those cases and then to attempt to determine the extent of the need, as one of the newspapers on the Witwatersrand did recently, gives one a quite distorted picture of the position, because one finds duplication of names on the waiting lists of various local authorities. That is why my Department has found that even the physical surveys made by the various local authorities &#x2014;surveys made by means of a mere arithmetical addition of the names on waiting lists &#x2014;do not reflect the actual needs, and that there are many other factors which should also be taken into account. That is why my Department obtains from time to time projections made by the C.S.I.R. as well as by demographers, <span class="col_5065-5066" refersTo="#page_1166"/>whom we employ to make the necessary investigations. These projections give us an indication of the trends in connection with housing needs. On that basis we look at what is being done, and we see whether the general picture in respect of the provision of housing falls within the course indicated by the demographers. In a previous debate I indicated how both the Government and the private sector had succeeded in the past year to come very close to that goal which is being set on the basis of the research done by demographers. In other words, I have indicated that as regards the provision of housing in general, especially in respect of Whites, the position in the country is sound at the moment. As regards housing, the Department of Community Development only steps in in cases where local authorities have obviously fallen far behind in regard to making provision for their needs, or where emergency housing is required as a result of immigration programmes and rapid new development taking place in an area, which makes it difficult for the local authority to handle everything by itself.</p>

<p>The third respect in which the Department steps in, is in cases where new projects and new kinds of projects in connection with housing have to be undertaken on an experimental basis. Let me mention the example here of Bothasig in Cape Town which is an experimental scheme for testing a certain type of house-building and its acceptability to the public. It is a huge success. In the same way Algoa Park, with the pre-construction methods applied there, is in the first place an experimental scheme. Even if we were to lose on that scheme, it is an essential experimental scheme for testing the achievements and possibilities of those private enterprises that have entered the field of preconstruction. I myself am not completely happy about the planning of that area and the lay-out of the scheme itself. The flats are in a particularly good condition and are good flats. In that respect, too, it is possible to effect changes, because any person who has built a house usually finds that once that house has been completed, there are changes he could have effected here or there. We are therefore not concerned about minor changes that can be effected. It is the scheme in itself which is a necessity. I shall return to the question of pre-construction later on.</p>

<p>While I am speaking about Algoa Park, I might just indicate that the reason why a number of the flats are unoccupied at the moment, is that three years ago there were 2,000 persons on the waiting lists of Port Elizabeth in the income group for which these flats were built. Port Elizabeth itself simply could not make provision for this, and that is why the National Housing Commission stepped in and said: Since there is such a great need in these income groups, this is an opportunity for launching this experimental scheme in connection with pre-construction. In the meantime the development of Port Elizabeth has not come up to those expectations. In the first place, the motor-car industry did not experience the development that was expected; instead there was a recession in the motor-car industry. As a result of that people have been leaving Port Elizabeth on a large scale.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members should not discuss matters of which they know nothing as yet. I shall deal with this question of the sale of properties in a moment, and then I shall deal with it in full. I want to emphasize that the number of flats that are unoccupied in Port Elizabeth at the moment, are unoccupied, firstly, as a result of this circumstance and, secondly, as a result of the fact that because they were of the pre-construction type&#x2014;where a large number of units were completed at the same time&#x2014;800 new flats were made available over a very short period of time. From the nature of the case the leasing of such flats cannot be done as rapidly as the delivery takes place, especially where the work is completed at the same time. The leasing of units is going on systematically and is progressing particularly well. In addition it is possible, and it will be considered, to convert those flats into sub-economic dwellings to help the lower income groups until such time as those people can be provided with inexpensive housing elsewhere and those flats can once again be made available to the economic group. Such an interim arrangement can and will be made if necessary.</p>

<p>Therefore I do not think it is necessary for the housing arm of my Department to be investigated. In a moment I shall come to another reason for my saying that it is not necessary. However, I just want to emphasize here that according to my own observations and those of my Department, it is noticeable at present that local authorities are slow to provide the public with sub-economic and low-rent residential units. It is obvious that local authorities are giving preference to economic houses for selling purposes. I have nothing against the provision of houses for selling purposes, because we want to encourage house-ownership. But in every community there is a certain number of persons who cannot or do not wish to buy houses, owing to financial or other circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Is it a very extensive number of houses that these municipalities build for sale?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_5067-5068" refersTo="#page_1167"/>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The vast majority, I should say 90 per cent of the houses with which Whites are provided by the municipalities, form part of selling schemes. Very few houses are being made available in the form of letting schemes. In respect of the non-Whites the position is exactly the opposite. In that respect the local authorities are over-anxious and more than willing to provide the non-Whites with sub-economic and inexpensive housing. However, they are, as I have said, slow in doing so for the Whites. In one case a certain local authority explicitly told me, &#x201C;We do not want to house the poor families in our area; they can go and live in another area.&#x201D; There I said explicitly that it was the duty of every local authority to house those lower-income group people who work in its area. That is why I issued instructions last year already that when an application for an economic housing scheme was received from a local authority, my Department had to make sure that that local authority was actively engaged in a scheme, irrespective of the stage it had reached, to provide inexpensive and sub-economic housing. I shall not appropriate funds for economic schemes until that is the case. I hope that this will be instrumental in wiping out the existing backlog. This is at the same time a reply to one of the questions put by the hon. member for Umlazi. He wanted to know whether we were perhaps providing houses that were too expensive for the people to live in. It is the local authorities that are so slow in providing inexpensive and sub-economic houses. Must my Department intervene every time because local authorities are not providing that type of housing? Must the local authorities be allowed to get away with the fact that they are only providing housing for the higher income groups and that consequently my Department has to provide for the lower income groups every time? After all, for the local authorities to expect that from me, is unfair. My Department grants assistance where it is justified by circumstances, and in cases where it can lend a helping hand.</p>

<p>The only other matter which could possibly be investigated in regard to the housing arm, is the financial implications of house-rent for the population. In that connection we have more than enough information. On my overseas tour last year I inquired in all the various countries into their housing and financing methods and so forth. One can hardly compare these aspects, because circumstances differ from country to country. For instance, in one country certain methods can be applied which simply cannot be applied in another country. Let me mention a few examples. Let us take countries such as Portugal and Italy where the employer and the employee make contributions towards a fund out of which housing is provided. In Portugal the lessee pays approximately 16 per cent of his wages in house-rent, but prior to that he and his employer have jointly paid roughly 21 per cent of his wages into the fund in order to provide the house. In other words, in reality he pays much more than one-fifth of his wages towards the rent of the dwelling in which he eventually lives. In other countries again, the lower income groups are subsidized to a large extent as far as their house-rent is concerned. However, they bear a much heavier tax burden than is the case here. I asked the Governments in question what their experience had been and why that was being done, and they replied that it was their policy to impose heavy taxes on the lower income groups and then to return that money to them by way of subsidies, so as to ensure that their incomes were being used for the right purposes. With one hand they take away the money by way of taxes, and with the other hand they give it back by way of a subsidy. In that way they ensure that a portion of the worker&#x2019;s income is being used for an essential necessity of life such as housing. This approach is totally different from the one we have in our country. This is to a large extent an encroachment upon the freedom of the individual. I think that we, with our free economy and less socialistic approach, cannot follow this method. We have therefore gathered information about all the various methods followed in all these countries in this regard, and to my mind it is simply unnecessary to want to investigate this matter now.</p>

<p>Let us look at the other arm of my Department, i.e. the Community Development arm. The Community Development Act provides explicitly that the Community Development Fund in my Department is being established for the purposes of developing certain areas, promoting community development in such areas, controlling the alienation of affected properties, and assisting persons to acquire or hire immovable property. Consequently my Department, through the Community Development Board, is obliged by law to act as an intermediary so as to see to it that affected properties are placed in the right hands. When affected persons have to be resettled, it is necessary for them to have their money free. They do not immediately find a ready buyer who would pay the market-value price for their properties, and this is where my Department steps in and pays that price. In that way the money of such a person is freed and he can be resettled.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Natal referred here to the so-called harsh action taken by my Department. He referred to &#x201C;ruthlessness&#x201D;. I repudiate the accusation completely. My Department&#x2019;s approach throughout&#x2014;and I have considerable proof to this effect&#x2014;has been one of absolute obligingness. When a case where unfair treatment was meted out, is brought to my notice, I see to it that the matter is put right. In recent times the hon. member has brought to my notice only one case of so-called &#x201C;ruthlessness&#x201D;. It was a case where a person had sold his property before the Act had been amended in respect of the appreciation contribution, when he was obliged under the Act to pay that contribution to my Department.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#winchester">

<from><span class="col_5069-5070" refersTo="#page_1168"/>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. E. D. WINCHESTER</person>:</from>

<p>He still has not got his money.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In that case the hon. member asked that he should be exempted from the payment of the appreciation contribution. We cannot do so; that is impossible. One cannot act outside the provisions of the Act. The hon. member refers to cases where there have been lengthy delays in regard to payment, but the owner is often to blame. If he is prepared to accept a reasonable amount, the payment is done very soon. It is only when he resorts to arbitration, as he is entitled to do, that delays take place. In such cases, of course, one cannot pay out until one knows what amount has to be paid out. As soon as this is finalized, payment is effected at once, and if hon. members would bring to my notice specific cases where there is any delay, I would go into them and put them right, because it ought not to be like that. Delays only occur where there is an actual reason why finality cannot be reached at once.</p>

<p>I say that my Department is obliged to act as an intermediary so as to ensure that those affected properties are placed in the right hands. The Development Board is often obliged to buy the properties so as to enable such disqualified persons to resettle elsewhere. In that regard the hon. member for Port Natal also referred to cases where certain persons were required to resettle elsewhere without alternative accommodation having been available to them. That is not true. In every case where a disqualified person is obliged to resettle elsewhere, a house is available and is offered to him, provided that he falls into the income group in which he has to or can be provided with housing. In every case where he falls into the category in which he himself has to or can provide his own housing, plots on which he may settle have been made available. But now we must remember that many of these disqualified persons are wilful. They remain where they are and do absolutely nothing to acquire another plot in the qualified area or to build a house there. This is particularly true of those people who are capable of providing these things for themselves. They do not do anything before I give them notice that they have to move. Only then do they start and only then do I receive their appeals and requests to be allowed an extension of time, and then they delay the building of their houses in the new area as long as they possibly can. I cannot permit the object of the Group Areas Act to be defeated by private persons in that way.</p>

<p>In those cases where persons are not willing to meet on their part the obligation imposed upon them by an Act of Parliament, I shall do my duty in terms of the Act by compelling them to take those steps. In addition the Development Board is the instrument of government which has to provide for the financing of replanning and redevelopment in respect of areas that have lagged behind. In this process of purchasing the properties of unqualified persons, and especially in the process of redevelopment, you must bear in mind, Sir, that no area can be redeveloped unless all the properties in the area which is about to be redeveloped, are in the hands of one body or person. Most of the time one has to replan streets and services. I cannot do so across properties which are in the hands of other people. One cannot undertake the rezoning and the reclassification of an area if it belongs to a large number of owners. That is why it is essential that the properties should be in the hands of one body, and that body is either the local authority or the Community Development Board; and since the local authorities do not have the necessary finances at their disposal, it is normally the Development Board which owns those properties. That is why my Department has a large number of properties at its disposal. Those properties are in turn disposed of as quickly as possible. In the case of properties purchased from disqualified persons, such properties are disposed of as soon as it is at all possible. I expected my Department's revenue from the sale of properties to have been more or less R5 million in the past financial year, but owing to the rapid resale of those properties to private bodies and persons, that amount was closer to R10 million.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My Department advertises these properties from time to time. In the larger areas it employs strings of real estate agents who have to sell these properties on a commission basis, because it is essential that the turnover should take place as quickly as possible, and that those properties should come into the hands of qualified persons as soon as possible. My Department is geared for that, and this is being done.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? Does the Department ever advise private individuals before the agencies are aware of what properties are available?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Any person who is interested in any area is welcome at any time to approach the regional offices of my Department and to learn what properties are available. This happens on numerous occasions, and any person who is interested in property can at any time make inquiries at the regional offices and tender for such properties. In this way it is available to the public as a whole. As regards the sale of these properties, there is no favouring.</p>

<p>It was said here that through these sales my Department was making good profits. It does not only make good profits, but often suffers great losses as well, because it often has to buy up properties, especially those of disqualified persons in the white area, where the structure on the property is of such a nature that it <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="#page_1169"/>actually constitutes a drawback as far as the property is concerned, since one has to demolish it. But one has to compensate that person for the house in which he lived, irrespective of the poor condition of the house. In those cases my Department suffers considerable losses. On the other hand, in cases where in the course of time there is appreciation in value owing to development and owing to the normal appreciation of properties, my Department makes profits, but it is geared for that and that is how it ought to be. I do not think that there are any objections to this. I think it would be unfair towards the taxpayers of this country if properties were not sold at the best possible market value prices. If I did not do so, my Department would have to answer for that before the Committee on Public Accounts. I may not neglect to meet my obligations towards the taxpayers simply because certain individuals would like to obtain certain plots from my Department at a cheap price. Since mention was made here of the sale of properties, let me refer to the flats in Durban. The hon. member for Port Natal also referred to that matter, and on several occasions references have been made to them by other hon. members. Hon. members will remember what criticism was expressed in this House in the past and is still being expressed against those flats. All those flats have been leased and offers have now been received from private bodies which want to buy those flats from my Department at an economic price.</p>

I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, that in a recent issue of a world magazine on architecture, those flats were commended as architectural masterpieces. That is how people&#x2019;s taste differs. The hon. member for Port Natal and the hon. member for Durban (Point) and I may perhaps not think so, but in a world magazine on architecture those very flats were pointed out as examples of architectural masterpieces and of what can be done in the sphere of architecture.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is the block near the race-course. I cannot remember its name. I repeat that it is my task to dispose of those properties as quickly as possible so that the money may be returned to the Fund and be utilized for other purposes again. In this respect I just want to clear up a misunderstanding. The hon. member for Umlazi said that I had allegedly announced that three different advisory committees would be appointed to advise me in connection with the implementation of the Group Areas Act. That was pursuant to a report in the <i>Daily Mail</i> of 1st May, where reference was made to a deputation of Durban businessmen who had had discussions with me. On that occasion not one single reporter was present. Not one single reporter approached me in regard to this matter. They must have obtained their information from one of those businessmen, and it is clear that the information is wrong. I repeat that the information is wrong. I never held out the prospect that committees would be appointed to advise me on the implementation of the Group Areas Act. What I did envisage &#x2014;in a moment I shall deal with it in detail&#x2014; was that later on when we reach the stage where there are proper co-ordination and cooperation among the State, the local authority and the Provincial Administration in regard to ultimate plans, over-all plans for cities, we would also be able to appoint private bodies such as the Chamber of Industries, the Chamber of Commerce, the welfare bodies, the transport authorities, etc., to an advisory body, which would advise, on the part of the private sector, these bodies that are jointly responsible for the planning and development of the towns and cities. This is something quite different from the implementation of the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>I said that it was unnecessary to have the activities of my Department investigated by a commission or committee of inquiry, for hon. members should bear in mind that I already have certain full-time statutory boards at my disposal. There is, for instance, the National Housing Commission. Let me read out to you who the members of that Commission are: The chairman is Mr. J. H. van der Walt, a retired head of the National Housing Office of former years. The vice-chairman is Professor T. H. Louw, a consulting quantity surveyor and professor in the faculty of architecture. The members are Mr. T. B. Floyd, a town-planner ; Mr. M. J. Joubert, a medical surgeon; Professor R. Straaten, a medical doctor and professor in Public Health at the University of Pretoria and at the same time a qualified social worker and sociologist; Dr. W. B. Anderson, a sociologist and professor at the University of Port Elizabeth; Mr. J. M. Rothman, a retired provincial secretary; Professor Erica Theron, professor in the Department of Sociology and Social Work at the University of Stellenbosch; Mr. A. T. W. de Klerk, an attorney, and Mr. J. R. Steenkamp, a farmer. Therefore you will see, Mr. Chairman, that in this Housing Commission experts in various fields as well as laymen have been drawn together.</p>

<p><span class="col_5073-5074" refersTo="#page_1170"/>Once every three months they must meet for a full-scale meeting, which usually lasts from two to three days. They have been instructed&#x2014;and they do so&#x2014;to meet by rotation in the various cities of the country and there to conduct personal investigations into the whole question of housing. This is therefore a body which from time to time conducts regular investigations into housing circumstances and conditions all over the country and which then advises me and my Department. In addition, their task is, of course, that of approving schemes and funds, etc., which is usually done by the executive committee and approved by the Board. Besides that I also have the Community Development Board, another full-time board. There are five fulltime members and two part-time members. The full-time members are Mr. Strydom, chairman, a deputy secretary in the Public Service; Mr. M. P. Prinsloo, a retired undersecretary in the Department of Community Development; Dr. A. G. Kellerman, a sociologist; Mr. H. P. Malan, a retired deputy secretary in the Department of Housing, and Mr. C. V. du Toit, a chief accountant. The part-time members are Mr. Eben Cuyler, M.P.C., a businessman, and Mr. J. H. van der Walt, the chairman of the National Housing Commission. This Board also meets in the various centres of the country, and it does so every three months. In addition, its executive committee meets daily in Pretoria. Therefore, side by side with my Department, with its various technical and administrative officials, we have these bodies conducting the necessary investigations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi asked, &#x201C;Are we not creating problems by removing whole communities instead of supplying new houses?&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, the removal of slum areas and of unqualified persons usually living either in slum areas or in backward areas, is an essential prerequisite for obtaining building sites and development sites for housing schemes, and in that respect the hon. member for Langlaagte is absolutely correct. While there are backward and poor areas in and around the city centre, one cannot merely move away from the city centre and simply develop towards the perimeter all the time. Let me take Durban as an example. Should we, for instance, simply have left Riverside and Cato Manor as they were and only have provided housing at other places? We must clear up those areas, as we did in regard to Sophiatown in Johannesburg in order to launch a new housing scheme there. These things go hand in hand. One cannot do one and neglect the other. I want to add that I am determined that we should terminate mixed residential conditions, where they still exist, as soon as possible. Over the past few years we have restricted to a minimum the funds required for resettlement, our aim having been to have as much money as possible available for housing. But now that the housing position is improving, we shall in future make more money available for resettlement in order that we may clean up our cities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow referred to a deficiency that existed in this regard, i.e. as regards this resettlement and development. This is a deficiency of which my Department and I are well aware, namely the lack of proper co-operation and co-ordination among local authorities, provincial administrations and my Department. As the position is at present, my Department can by law identify any area as an area for redevelopment and freeze development there until such time as re-development can take place. By way of legislation, without having any regard to local regulations, my Department can also develop townships and do certain other things. As regards the development and progress of their respective areas, local authorities do a very great deal off their own bat. But the necessary co-ordination and co-operation in this regard do not always exist. It often happens that there are problems and impediments. Let me mention one example to you, Sir. The hon. member for Berea referred to the Coloured township Wentworth and to the delay that occurred in connection with its development. That is true&#x2014;there was a delay, an unnecessary delay. But does the hon. member know what it can be attributed to? The City Engineer informed my Department that he simply could not make the sewage mains available within a period of five years or so. It was only after the Secretary for my Department had reported the City Engineer to the Mayor and the matter had subsequently been investigated that it was found that the mains could in fact be provided. Only then could they proceed with the planning of the scheme. Well, the development of that scheme is now being proceeded with, and we hope to develop between 13,000 and 14,000 plots there within the next two years. At the same time other areas are being developed so that, as far as the Coloureds are concerned, the position in Durban will be considerably better within the next two or three years.</p>

<p>Another problem is the absence of a yardstick by which we can identify backward areas&#x2014;not so much areas in which unqualified persons are resident. Sometimes local authorities wish to give preference to the development of a certain area whereas my Department wishes to tackle another area. We do not have any yardstick by which we can judge. On the Witwatersrand, as the hon. member for Langlaagte said, there is a considerable number of places that ought to be re-developed, but, as I am saying, we have not yet developed a yardstick to enable us to determine what has to be given preference to, since there is no proper ultimate plan for the whole area. But discussions with the Administrators have already been requested for the purpose of trying to devise a method and obtaining a <i>modus operandi</i> in accordance with which we may obtain more co-operation among local authorities, provincial administrations and the Department in connection <span class="col_5075-5076" refersTo="#page_1171"/>with these matters. I hope that in this way we shall find a <i>modus operandi</i> which will effect better co-operation between local authorities and the Department, without the Department taking over the functions of local authorities. The object is rather to assist local authorities financially and technically in getting their town planning&#x2014;their guiding plans, their ultimate plans&#x2014;drafted properly, and to devise methods which will make it possible for us to reach decisions jointly as to what areas should be given preference as regards development.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River referred to District Six. Since this area was proclaimed, 53 Coloured families have already been resettled in their own areas. The programme for the resettlement of all slum dwellers and lessees is being continued at a rapid rate. All the physical surveys of the socio-economic and structural aspects, the use of land, and so forth, have already been completed. We have already reached the point where we can appoint consultants to put forward proposals, after which we can re-plan the area in detail. The pattern we shall follow will be to submit to three or four leading planners, independent of one another, proposals in connection with the new development and lay-out of the area. Subsequent to that we will designate a senior and leading consultant to assist Corda in considering the proposals made by these three or four consultants. Once a decision has been reached in regard to the course to be adopted, the senior consultant and the other consultants will form a team for drafting, with the assistance of as many experts as may be necessary, a final plan for the area. In this way we hope to draft a plan for the whole area within 18 months to two years. It is simply impracticable to start with development now, before such a plan for the whole area has been drafted. We must ensure that the use of land and the development there will fit in with the urban development in general. We hope, therefore, to be ready to start with physical development within four years after the proclamation of the area. Boston in the United States is often held up to us as an example in this regard. There it took them six years before they had drafted a general plan for re-development, and that was done in respect of an area smaller than District Six. In addition they have a staff of 540 working on that renewal project alone. The planning and implementation is expected to take 15 years. Therefore, when we talk of a period of ten to 15 years in the case of District Six, it is not too long if we measure it against what is being done elsewhere. I think that the entire project, including the re-development, ought to be completed within the next ten years. I just want to add that disqualified persons are not moved without their being provided with alternative housing, and that the existing unoccupied spots are areas that have already been cleaned up, particularly by the City Council in terms of the Slums Act. These are for the most part properties which have been purchased since 1938 by the City Council, in terms of the Slums Act, with housing money. Many of these areas will be necessary as green belts. As I say, one cannot start development before the whole plan for the area has been drafted. Serviceable buildings are not demolished but maintained as far as possible and inhabited as long as possible.</p>

<p>Now I want to say a few words about preconstruction. This matter was raised by the hon. member for Umlazi as well as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North). I want to point out that over the past few years authentic manpower surveys have shown that there has been a rapid decrease in the number of artisans employed in the building industry, and that there is a serious shortage of artisans and apprentices in the building industry. Let me furnish the figures to hon. members. The number of White artisans in the building industry was 38,880 in 1961, and 40,717 in 1963, a fine improvement. In 1965 it dropped to 32,749. The figures in respect of Coloureds and Asiatics jointly, are as follows: 1961&#x2014; 12,725; 1963&#x2014;12,967; and 1965&#x2014;12,389. Therefore, also in respect of Coloureds and Asiatics there was a drop from 1963 to 1965 as far as the number of artisans was concerned. The figures in respect of the number of apprentices employed are as follows: In 1961, there were 4,463 white apprentices. In 1963, there were 2,812, and in 1965 there were 2,745. It is clear, therefore, that there was a drop in the numbers of apprentices employed in the building industry. One sees the effect of this in the fact that the present average age of white artisans in the building industry is 47 years. This is alarming, and the age is rising. Similarly, as far as the Coloureds and the Asiatics were concerned, there was a drop of 1,792 to 1,409 from 1961 to 1963, but after 1965 there was a slight improvement, i.e. to 1,808. I think that the building industry and the Apprenticeship Board should now pay serious attention to this alarming state of affairs. My personal opinion is that the training of apprentices in the building industry is outdated, that it is no longer necessary to-day for every artisan in the building industry to be able to do every type of work in connection with the building of a house. There could be much more specialization in the training, and consequently a shorter period of training. I think this is a matter which ought to receive the attention of the Apprenticeship Board and the building industry. But since this is the position, since the number of artisans is decreasing rapidly, since an insufficient number of apprentices are being trained, it is essential for us to think of the future of the building industry and the construction industry in South Africa. We must be positive in our thinking in this regard. We must consider that in view of the growth in population, the growth in industrial development and auxiliary services which are necessary and have to be catered for, the building industry will be faced with a serious challenge in the next 30 years, and that with this shortage of artisans the <span class="col_5077-5078" refersTo="#page_1172"/>conventional building industry will simply not be able to fend for itself. That is why we must do something positive in this regard. The Government has therefore decided that preconstruction should be promoted in South Africa. The problem in connection with preconstruction is that the private sector has in effect simply been unable to render any substantial contributions to large-scale pre-construction. The simple reason for this is that it entails major expenditure to establish a factory which manufactures pre-construction building materials. If such an undertaking does not have an assured market over a period of time it cannot incur the capital expenditure for establishing the factory.</p>

<p>I referred to this in the past and also to what was being done in certain overseas countries, namely that in order to establish the pre-construction industry, government bodies became shareholders in such companies. After serious consideration this Government decided that that would not be done in South Africa. I want to repeat that the Government will not take up shares in pre-construction factories, but that a method should be devised in terms of which we shall, in some way or another, be able to guarantee to the pre-construction factories in given areas, an assured market over a period of at least five years. At the same time attention will be given to providing the conventional industry, too, with more certainty in regard to building programmes and building projects so that they, too, may undertake projects on a long-term basis instead of merely working on a year to year basis.</p>

<p>This matter has been referred to a committee of officials to be worked out in detail in conjunction with the Tender Board, since it will entail a deviation from our normal tender procedures. As soon as we have received their report, this matter will receive further attention.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>So you are accepting my five-year approach.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am the one who mentioned five years first. The hon. member heard it in the speech I made after I had come back from abroad. However, it does not matter, because we are agreed, and that is the important point.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Karoo referred to several matters, and one of them was the delay in connection with applications for permits. I want to make it clear now that it has repeatedly been said here and elsewhere that persons who want permits should apply for them at least a fortnight in advance. However, there are numerous cases where large functions are involved and where the persons concerned apply for the permit at the last moment, offering the excuse that they had overlooked the necessity of obtaining a permit. Since by that time they have allegedly sold tickets and completed all the arrangements, I am confronted with the accomplished fact of either causing the public to lose that money or of placing the organizers in a very embarrassing position, or of issuing them with the permit. I want to repeat my warning that in future I shall pay much stricter attention to this period of 14 days. I am simply not going to allow persons to place me in such an impossible situation for all sorts of reasons&#x2014;and I wonder whether at times these late applications do not involve a certain measure of wilfulness. I want to refer to the case to which the hon. member for Karoo referred, the case to which the <i>Diamond Fields Advertiser</i> also referred, namely the cricket match in which Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira was to play. The hon. member said that the permit had been received only one day before the time. That match was to take place on Friday and Saturday, 2nd and 3rd December, 1967. The application was received at the Kimberley office of my Department on Monday, 27th November, only four days before the match was to take place. Is my Department to blame for the fact that the organizers received the permit only one day before the time? Surely, it is their own fault. In addition the application explicitly requested permission for the players only, and not for the public as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The application has to go to Pretoria and that is why a period of at least 14 days is required. Arrangements of this nature should not be made four days before the time. Why was the application submitted only four days before the time? It is obviously the fault of the organizers of the match and not that of my Department. My Department issued the permit three days after it had been received. My Department took three days to consider the application&#x2014;both in the regional office and in the head office&#x2014;and to issue it. I honestly feel that this is a very short period and that the hon. member cannot object to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the location of Indian shops near the Coloured group area. Is the hon. member pleading that the Indian shops and traders should be placed in such a way that it is difficult for the Coloureds to buy from them?</p>

</speech>

<p>That is not the point at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If that is the case, what is the hon. member objecting to? He is throwing principles overboard very easily. He is trying to create the impression that he is pleading for the Coloureds here, that he wants to safeguard their interests, and for that reason <span class="col_5079-5080" refersTo="#page_1173"/>the Indians may not be placed near the Coloured area. But that is not true either. The Indian traders are not specifically placed on those sites so as to have them close to the Coloured area. The area where they are being placed, is close to the area where the market will eventually be developed, close to the future market area; in other words, the point where all race groups will be concentrated. Consequently all race groups will be able to buy from these traders. The best place for locating businesses of that nature, is where there is a concourse of all race groups and national groups. That is what was taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said a few words about the standards of sub-economic houses. He is obviously not in possession of all the facts. Flooring and ceilings are generally permissible for sub-economic houses. Any local authority can have these fitted, if it wants to do so and if it applies for them. Furthermore, large families, non-Whites as well, are not placed in two-roomed dwellings&#x2014;up to four-roomed dwellings are permitted. The rental varies in accordance with the size of the house. The Coloureds in the sub-economic group usually pay between R4 and R6 per month for these sub-economic dwellings. It depends on whether it is a four-roomed or a two-roomed dwelling. Why does the hon. member say that large families are being settled in small houses? After all, that is not true.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) referred to the poor standards of old-age homes. I just want to inform the hon. member that the old-age home to which he is apparently referring, is being erected under the supervision of the local authority in question. When the plans were approved, my Department noticed that the unit cost only amounted to R800 per person, whereas the permissible unit cost amounts to approximately R1,200 per person. My Department immediately made inquiries to ascertain why a place of such a poor standard was being built, and the reply was that they did not want a better type of institution in view of the fact that only people from the very lowest group would be housed there. The local authority is responsible for that particular place being built in that way. I want to see whether there is a possibility of compelling local authorities to maintain at least a minimum standard in respect of old-age homes. The hon. member also mentioned several other matters on which I shall reply to him in person. I do not think it is necessary for me to do so in this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown referred to the Malays in Simonstown. I agree with him about their constituting a specific national group. I agree that Malays in general should, in cases where they prefer it, be settled in communities. We shall approach this problem most sympathetically, and if the hon. member so desires I shall furnish him with particulars in regard to what we have already done in this connection. I do not consider it necessary to do so here.</p>

<p>As regards the fishermen, I had an interdepartmental committee constituted, a committee consisting of officials from the Departments of Community Development, Coloured Affairs, Planning, and from industries to find the best possible solution for meeting the needs of the Coloured fishermen in the best way.</p>

<p>I think I have replied to most of the points raised in this debate up to now.</p>

<speech by="#smith">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. D. SMITH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in his speech the hon. the Minister referred briefly to the world&#x2019;s biggest slum clearance project, namely the District Six project, and I should like to take this matter of urban renewal a little further with the Minister because it is clear that it is fast becoming one of the major tasks of his department. I want to ask the Minister whether it is not possible for him to elaborate a little more on the short but very interesting statement he made in the Other Place concerning his intentions regarding urban renewal and slum clearance projects in the Republic. We should also like to hear from him whether his investigations during his recent overseas visit, when he also visited the U.S.A., put more and new information at his disposal, compared to what his department already knows.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, however, I want to thank the Minister and his very efficient officials of the Department of Community Development for the very expeditious and assiduous way in which they have tackled this rather pressing problem in the past year or two.</p>

<p>The first point I want to deal with now is this. In view of the increasing ramifications of urban renewal schemes in South Africa, I wonder whether a separate Department of Urban Renewal with a separate director or secretary could not be established under the control of the Minister&#x2019;s department. The matter has become so urgent that urban renewal cannot be treated any longer as just a small cog in the vast community development machinery. If a separate department is established, I am sure the Government will be able to pay better attention to the vast question <span class="col_5081-5082" refersTo="#page_1174"/>of urban renewal on a far more co-ordinated scale than has been the case up to now. I am also convinced that a separate Department of Urban Renewal will be able to tackle certain important matters regarding urban renewal and slum clearance more speedily and more effectively than in the past.</p>

<p>There are certain aspects I should like to mention and which I am sure could be tackled very effectively by such a department. Firstly let me say that I think the country would like the department to capture the imagination of the people in every city, and one way to do this is to start a gigantic slum clearance project or urban renewal scheme in every major city in the country. To do this, as the hon. the Minister pointed out, it is urgently necessary that every urban renewal area where such a project is to be undertaken must be clearly and distinctly identified so that one knows exactly which area is to be cleared up. Furthermore, all dilapidated and depressed properties in the area should be acquired either by the local authority or by the Department of Community Development. In order to provide for the effective planning and financing of such a distinctly defined area, the planning and finance costs as well as the yield from the sale of stands must, I feel, be precisely calculated beforehand. If a local authority is not in the position to supply the finances to acquire the land or to pay the planning costs, I want to suggest to the Minister that the Central Government should provide loans at a reasonable rate of interest. It is also essential, as the Minister pointed out, that seeing that the Government is at present contributing some R80 million a year towards urban development and urban renewal, the Government should have a say in the comprehensive urban planning of any particular city. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we have learned that the Minister is thinking along those lines, in other words, to take just these powers without infringing the powers of the provincial authorities.</p>

<p>Much of the urban deterioration which we have experienced over the years in South Africa and also in my own constituency has been caused by the lack of co-ordinated planning, and also by the lack of purposeful city planning. It is not only the Government and the local authorities which must tackle this vast problem of urban renewal, but I think it should also be tackled by the private sector. I hope the Minister will in future do everything possible to stimulate the interest of the private sector so that they may contribute their share as well. I see no reason why private housing agencies, for example, or private companies should not undertake urban renewal as well, provided it is done under the supervision of the Department of Community Development. In order to stimulate interest on the part of private entrepreneurs in the redevelopment of such a slum area, I think it would be a good idea for the Government to take the lead wherever possible by starting a Government scheme or erecting Government buildings, because we all know that whenever the Government is interested in a new area it serves as a new growth point for other private buildings as well. I am also convinced that this matter should not be approached only from one angle. There are other angles also, but I do not have enough time to deal with all of them. But in the first place measures should also be taken to prevent buildings and private residences from deteriorating into slums. In America they have what they call urban conservation measures, and this takes the form of a strict building code to which all specifications in regard to the structure, the building materials, etc., must conform. I am very glad that in this respect the Minister has already briefly stated in a speech in the Other Place that he is thinking along the lines of having a national building code drawn up eventually. It will indeed be a very happy day for this country when a national code of that nature is eventually introduced. I think private house-owners should also be encouraged to do that by having housing loans or renovations loans offered under favourable conditions by building societies or by the Government making tax concessions to people who want to renovate or restore their own private houses. I also think that a big publicity campaign should be mounted in this country to enlighten the public about the necessity of having their properties restored, as well as to tell them that if they do not do so, when this national building code is introduced, they will be committing an offence under that code if they do not look after their own buildings and their private houses. But having done all these things, I also feel that these urban conservation efforts will be of no avail if the families removed from these depressed areas are not helped to adjust themselves psychologically as well. When they moved into a new environment, into the new towns, as they are called in Britain, we have seen all over the world that in that new environment they allow those new properties to lapse into the same state of physical decay as the properties where they came from, if they are not adjusted to that new environment.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to do everything possible to have more city and town planners trained in this country. There is an alarming shortage, I am told, of these people, and it is an urgent prerequisite for implementing urban renewals and for replanning and redevelopment that this position should be countered.

<p>The hon. the Minister demonstrated this morning that in addition to his well-known energy and ability to embark on joy rides and other activities, he can give a very detailed and conscientious reply to questions. The marathon reply he gave this morning is one which it would not be possible to deal with in the brief space of ten minutes. However, one or two points arise from it to which I must refer. I want to thank him for the courtesy with which he dealt in detail with all the points raised.</p>

<p><span class="col_5083-5084" refersTo="#page_1175"/>I want to say at once that the manner in which the Minister rejected the appeal for an inquiry was simply passing the buck and whitewashing. On the one hand he passed the buck for anything which he did not like and everything that was wrong to the City Councils, and on the other hand he shrugged off any criticism of his Department. It will be impossible to deal in detail with that other than to say that this continual shifting of responsibility from the Department to the local authority, and from the local authority back to the Department, merely leads to delay after delay, and the person who suffers in the end is the one who is waiting for housing. I am sorry, but I cannot accept the Minister&#x2019;s statement that the position in regard to housing for Whites is healthy. I cannot accept it because of the case after case that one comes across with this problem of a man with his wife and family of four or five living in one room and asking where he can find a home. He goes to the City Council and they say it will take four or five years on the waiting-list. He goes to the Department of Community Development, and often they cannot help him either. In fairness I must say to the Minister that I have had nothing but courtesy from the officials of his Department, both at local level in Durban or at head office level, but they do not have the facilities to offer. It is no use offering a man who earns R100 a month a flat at a rental of R75 a month, leaving him R25 a month on which to live. There are not the facilities available, and because I know from personal knowledge of case after case of people either living in flats or houses for which they are paying too much, or else living crowded together in a room or two or with relatives, I cannot accept the Minister&#x2019;s self-satisfied assurance that the position in regard to white housing is so healthy.</p>

<p>It is the lower income group that is suffering. There is plenty of housing for the rich man. In my own constituency something like 14 blocks of flats have gone up in the last few years. If you can pay R80 a month for a one or two-bedroomed flat, you can get it. You have to pay from R80 to R150 for it. That constitutes no problem to the rich man, but if the man can only afford to pay about R30 or R40 a month, or even less, he is in trouble.</p>

<p>The position is being aggravated. The Minister said that this question of selling buildings, etc., was common practice, and that it turned over the money, but one of my complaints against it is in regard to the people who are looking for accommodation. I want to give him a specific case. I questioned the Minister on 11th April last year in regard to flats built in Durban and their cost. There was a block of flats, Streliziahof, which cost, for the land and the building together, R286,000, and Ulindihof cost R187,000. The Department should not be a profit-making institution. It is there to serve South Africa with the taxpayers&#x2019; money. Therefore one assumes that in determining its rental it is simply aiming at covering costs, and not at exploiting the public. I want the Minister to tell me whether the rentals are based on basic costs, or whether in fact rentals fixed by his Department aim at making a profit for the Department. When these buildings were offered for sale, only a few weeks ago, I find that Ulindihof was advertised for sale, and not by tender as the Minister said in his reply. He said they were put out to tender. But here I have an advertisement in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 16th April, 1968, and it does not say that it is for tender, as the Minister told the House. It gives a description of the block of flats and says it is for sale at R117,782. It is a fixed price which is R10,000 more than the building cost to erect. The other one, Strelitziahof, was built at a cost of R286,000, and it is offered for sale at R310,000, giving nearly R25,000 profit. Now, if the rents established when the Department of Community Development was running this were simply economic rentals to cover costs, and the Department is selling it at a profit of R25,000, the new owner who obviously buys it as a business proposition wants a profit also, even if it is only 8 per cent as laid down in the Rents Act. That means that those tenants will now have to pay a far higher rental, firstly to give the Department its R25,000 profit and then to give the new owner an 8 per cent profit on his investment. I cannot see how that sort of negotiation can be regarded as being in the interests of the public whom this Minister must serve.</p>

<p>Sir, the Minister spoke of the basic determination of value. What he forgets is that when a person is shifted from a house in an affected area, that person gets compensation on the value probably of an old house. I had the case of a Coloured woman who came to me in tears. She had been offered R7,000 odd. Eventually, by negotiation, the Department brought it up to R8,000. But in that house for which she was going to get R8.000 she herself, a crippled husband and a mentally deficient son and three other children were living in half the house and she let the other half for R40 per month. She supported her mentally deficient son, her crippled husband and her other children with that income of R40 a month which she received by way of rental for half the house and with her own wages. Nowhere else can she get a house where she can house her family and get an income of R40 per month. All she can get for R8,000 is a house just to house her own family. How is she going to live? Eight thousand rand may be a fair valuation but the Minister forgets that these people are being paid that sum for an old building and they are having to spend that money on a new building at far higher costs.

<p>I do not want to react to the points touched upon here by the hon. member for Durban (Point). Most of the points he touched upon, such as the question of the determination of rent, were dealt with by the hon. the Minister in his previous speech. The hon. member for Durban (Point) probably found himself in the same situation here to-day as the hon. member for Umlazi was in the other night. The hon. the Minister, with his preceding announcement and explanation, took the wind out of their sails to such an extent that they had to mark time in their speeches. I must admit that I am in almost the same position because what one wanted to advocate here has already been announced by the hon. the Minister. But we in the Cape Peninsula and immediate environments still have a problem which we should like to bring to the urgent attention of the Minister and his Department. The problem is that we in white areas are, to an increasing extent, having to contend with Coloureds who are making a public thoroughfare of our white areas to an excessive extent. For the most part, this movement of Coloureds in our white areas takes place at night. The problem arises from the fact that uncontrolled numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the Coloured servants in these areas, and not only to visit, but to spend the night with them. In terms of the Group Areas Act it is possible for those visitors to remain overnight with such a servant on 90 occasions per calendar year. In certain of our areas the position has become so critical now that I feel myself at liberty to say that in certain parts there are almost as many non-Whites spending the night as there are Whites in that area. In other words, a situation could arise where one would have back yard locations in the white areas. All we need do is see how many Coloured men leave those white areas in the morning with their lunch pails to go and perform their daily task elsewhere. I am certain that in most cases the white owners of those dwellings are not aware of these unauthorized persons who spend the nights with their servants. There are cases&#x2014;and I believe that there are many such cases&#x2014;where the Police are quite unable to take action because the owners are afraid to prefer charges. They are afraid that they may lose their servants; that the servants will leave to go to another employer who is more favourably disposed in this regard. Recently I saw in the Press that the Police had, during one of their nightly raids, disclosed malpractices which had arisen as a result of this situation in certain of our best residential areas, but they are not able to take steps against all these persons who spend the night there. One asks oneself whether it is not time we did something to combat this sordid situation. What I am asking to-day is not that a total prohibition should be imposed on Coloured servants sleeping in in the white areas, but that we should take steps against this uncontrolled number of visitors and those who spend the night with servants in the white residential areas. Nor is this problem restricted to our residential areas where we have separate dwellings. Possibly the situation is far worse in flat complexes. I am sorry the hon. members for Sea Point and Gardens are not here this morning. I should like to request their friendly co-operation in these representations. If they did not agree with this, then we would at least know where they stand in this matter. We have this situation in regard to flats that various types of living quarters for servants are being provided. In some cases there is a separate block at these flats where the Coloured servants are housed, a separate block in which there are at night large numbers of persons sleeping over. Then there are the other cases where servants&#x2019; quarters are provided on different stories of a specific block of flats. Of course it is not a desirable situation to have this concentration of Coloureds bordering on one&#x2019;s white flats, because there are people who can do nothing about it, and who take exception to Coloureds being accommodated adjacent to them. Then there is a third type of Coloured servant quarters, and one finds this particularly in the more densely populated flat areas. One finds that inside the flat a small room has been provided for a servant without provision being made for any separate entrance for that servant. In other words&#x2014;and this is definitely the case in Sea Point&#x2014;this is a situation of shared living quarters which people who are basically opposed to it find goes against the grain. Of course these servants can also receive visitors who may spend the night with them on 90 occasions per calendar year. I really feel that it is time we cut out this canker, and that we cut very deeply. I realize only too well that we often run to the hon. the Minister with our problems when we as Whites actually created those problems for ourselves, but now it is also true that there are many innocent people involved in this matter who are really suffering while others are getting off scot free. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to plead for an amendment to the Act here this evening; you would not allow me to do so. I am merely pleading for a change in the regulations. If we should allow this uncontrolled situation to continue, we will ultimately arrive at a situation where a Coloured family will be accommodated in almost every backyard. We would then, to an increasing extent, have to deal with an integrationistic situation in those flats with interior servants&#x2019; quarters, an integrationistic situation in regard to people whose moral values have been dulled as far as these things are concerned. I want to promise the hon. the Minister our support in advance here in the Cape Peninsula if he and his Department should decide to combat this situation with very strict measures. Since we are promising our support I believe that I can also speak on behalf of the hon. members for Gardens and Sea Point here, who have recently become so apartheid-conscious. [Interjections.] Yes, Simonstown as well.</p>

<p>I therefore hope that we will have the co-operation of the Sea Point people as well. Nor must we forget the hon. member for Newton Park, because there are such flats in his area as well, although they do not have many Coloured servants there. But he does not know what the situation in regard to such flat-dwellers is. At Richmond he does not have the problem of his Coloured servant living in his farmhouse without a separate entrance, but he need only go to Parson&#x2019;s Hill to see what the problem there is. There are solutions to this problem, but a restriction must be imposed by the hon. the Minister against this excessive sleeping-over of servants in our white areas.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We have just had a second exhibition of buck-passing adroitly performed by the hon. member who has just sat down. He has mentioned the problem; we know that that problem exists in every place where you have domestic servants. They must have their facilities, or are they not to have visitors? The hon. member does not want to do away with servants, but then he does not know where to house them, so he says, &#x201C;I pass the buck to the Minister; here is the problem, and I hope that you will have the wisdom of Solomon and tell us how you are going to solve it.&#x201D; The hon. member has posed the problem to the hon. the Minister without offering any suggestion as to how it can be solved.</p>

<p>I want to revert, if I may, to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that responsibility for housing primarily rests with the local authority. Sir, the hon. the Minister should realize that over the last few years the Government has done everything it possibly can to frustrate the local authorities in their efforts to tackle the problems of planning and of development of housing. It has passed laws to say that it can ignore every municipal regulation. The hon. the Minister has said that he can ignore town planning conditions. The hon. the Minister has introduced laws to say that he can ignore conditions of title, and he is now busy assuming unto himself the right of a licensing authority. He can ignore all the building regulations which are prescribed by local authorities and, furthermore, if the local authorities want to build anything they must put the plans up to the Minister&#x2019;s Department. And then, Sir, he says that the local authorities are not accepting their responsibility. I want to give him one example where a body, which is not even a local authority, attempted to deal with housing. What happened as a result of Government action? The hon. the Minister will be aware that some years ago a housing scheme was started by a non-profit company, a company registered under section 21 of the Companies Act, to provide home-ownership for Coloureds in the Somerset West area. What happened? This company, financed by private individuals and co-operating with a building society, embarked upon a scheme in terms of which they obtained a piece of ground at a very reasonable price from the owner of the property. They subdivided the ground and built a number of houses in the Coloured area. These houses were sold on the home-ownership basis to Coloured owners. A number of Coloureds were interested in acquiring land for themselves and it was arranged that they could obtain 90 per cent bonds, without a cent of assistance from the Government, but through this organization they could get 90 per cent bonds; so a number of them set about buying their plots. They were paying off the purchase price on an instalment basis, and as soon as they had paid 10 per cent they could proceed to build their homes. Everyone of these was done with permit, authority, and approval. This was a Coloured area to be developed as a Coloured residential area. Out of the blue, three years ago, the Government said: No, this is now going to be a white area. I must say for the Department concerned that they saw to it by purchasing rapidly the ground that was unsold or on hire-purchase, that the Coloured people could get back the money that they had been paying. But they frustrated a 100 Coloured people and that they certainly frustrated a number of white people who were interested in housing.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>You must raise a matter pertaining to that area with the Minister of Planning.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am just coming to this point. That is where an attempt was made to provide housing. The hon. the Minister said I must raise that with the Minister of Planning. That is exactly the point I am coming to. The Minister of Planning goes on declaring group areas, and the area is then cascaded into the lap of the Department of Community Development. &#x201C;You get on now and do something with it.&#x201D; Where is the coordination? How is it possible that a scheme like this can be approved at one moment where housing is required, and the next moment it is collapsed in the way that this one has been.</p>

<p>Let me take another instance. This hon. Minister has now had deposited into his lap the Macassar Beach township at Eerste River. What is happening? First of all, the Minister&#x2019;s Department has to set about fixing proposed basic values. Does the Minister know that everyone of those basic values was upset when they went to the Revision Court and that everyone was increased? Every owner had to wait until those valuations could be revised. The valuations, even as they are now, result in a loss to every white person who purchased property there. But what is happening to the Coloureds and the development <span class="col_5089-5090" refersTo="#page_1178"/>of this area as a Coloured township? Are they going to pay interest on the capital investment which the Government has made, or are they going to get these sites at a figure which they can afford? I ask that because I have an instance here of a person in the lower income group who inquired last year for an opportunity to buy a property which was for sale in the Goodwood West area. He was told that there was no property for sale. This year he has been offered a vacant residential plot in this particular area at the price of R1,300 for 5,000 square feet, which is some R650 higher than that property was worth a year ago. It has appreciated, and now he is being asked to pay the appreciated price. I refer to these matters, because here we have again the problems which exist because of this lack of coordination. In 1957, 11 years ago, Rylands Estate on the outskirts of Cape Town, was declared an Indian group area, and was handed over to the Department. The Indians in Cape Town have been told: Get out of the white areas; you must move to Rylands. There was an announcement two days ago that something has been done about putting on services, 11 years after this was proclaimed a group area. So far as the Department was concerned, in 11 years it has built 35 low-cost houses, which were built in 1963. They built 12 for the higher income group in 1967. This is a resettlement of the Indian community in the Cape Peninsula.</p>

<p>I believe there are three aspects which fall under the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department, which are interrelated. The one is the group areas determination; the other is the group area implementation, and the third matter, which was referred to by the hon. member for Turffontein is the slum clearance or urban renewal. I believe that, if ever there was a time for an inquiry into the Department to see how these three aspects can be coordinated, and better co-ordinated, it is now, as has been requested from this side. The senior staff of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department are swamped, as one knows, by their responsibilities. We have reports from the Minister&#x2019;s other arm of public works that it is impossible for them to find the technical and professional staff that they require. The reasons are obvious, namely the rates of pay offered to architects, town planners, and so on. Of course they will not get the staff. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I believe very strongly that unless there is an investigation now into the whole future of housing and the overlapping that exists between the Department of Planning and the Department of Community Development, as well as the Department of Social Welfare when it comes to the question of the housing of the aged, we are going to find ourselves in this country in some serious difficulties in the not too distant future. These are urgent problems. The country is in need of housing. This housing problem cannot just be solved by saying that when people can afford to pay for reasonably priced accommodation, they must go and find it for themselves. That is what is happening in the Sea Point/Green Point area. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#delport">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. H. DELPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat began to sing another song after the hon. the Minister had dealt with this major request in regard to an investigation. The hon. member is now advocating an investigation into the activities of the various Departments, in other words, Departments which are divorced from the hon. the Minister of Community Development. He is now dragging in other Departments. They are beginning to sing this new song now after the hon. the Minister gave an adequate reply here this morning to the objectionable idea that the activities of the Department of Community Development, after all the indubitable success and progress it has made, should be investigated. What is more, the hon. member stated that the municipalities and local authorities are frustrated as a result of the extensive powers which are being granted to the hon. the Minister enabling him to take action without their consent.</p>

<p>Only last year the Removal of Restrictions Act was passed unanimously by this House after it had been referred to a committee of inquiry. Not a word of protest or objection was made by any member on the opposite side. In terms of that Act considerable powers were granted the hon. the Minister. Where does this sudden frustration come from which they are looking for in regard to our municipalities? There were many complaints on the part of hon. members opposite. Most of them were imaginary. I do not want to mention them one by one, but want to refer to another matter which is important to me. I want to refer to urban and physical deterioration. There are only two methods of dealing with this matter.</p>

<p>The first is to apply active urban renewal, as is being done in most modern cities where this problem occurs, and as it is already being done by the hon. the Minister and his Department on a large scale. Important projects have already been set in motion. Where there is existing urban deterioration, the reply is the active implementation of urban renewal. We have many examples of that in history. One example of this is Paris. If it had not been for Eugene Hausman who, almost 100 years ago, made a start with the beautiful boulevards, new bridges and new state buildings in Paris, Paris would not subsequently have been one of the most beautiful cities in Western Europe.</p>

<p>Other examples of this are Birmingham and Glasgow where, many years ago, major urban renewal schemes were undertaken so that the inhabitants to-day are able to reap the benefits. South Africa presents a different picture. Relatively speaking our cities are much younger than the cities of Europe, and particularly Western Europe. The problem of urban deterioration or physical decay, is of much more <span class="col_5091-5092" refersTo="#page_1179"/>recent origin in comparison with the cities of the Western world. It is so that in the thirties and forties&#x2014;and hon. members on the opposite side will as usually deny it&#x2014;urban deterioration on a titanic scale began to take place here. In 1948 when this Government came into power urban deterioration in these areas was an established fact. However, the hon. the Minister and the Department is already engaged on major projects in this regard. We from the Western Cape can testify to the tremendous project which is going to be tackled in regard to the South End area.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the factors which make for urban deterioration. Experts on this problem mention many factors which cause urban deterioration. However, there are two phenomena which in my opinion are the most important of all. The first is when one allows a mixed population in the same residential area, when persons of different population groups live in the same area. We have many examples of that in South Africa. In my constituency there was such an area where Whites, Indians and other non-Whites lived together during the thirties and forties. This situation prevailed until, in terms of the Group Areas Act, that area was proclaimed a white area, and in terms of the Community Development Act the people were accommodated in their own separate areas. To-day that part of the constituency is a peaceful residential area. Then, too, I should like to pay great tribute to the hon. the Minister and his Department for this major task which has been performed in this area.</p>

<p>The other factor is that of incorrect development, this takes various forms. As hon. members also mention here, one finds incorrect development when areas which previously were exclusively residential areas are subsequently zoned for light industries. Consequently the houses, which in many cases are occupied by people in the lower income groups, are neglected because the plots on which the houses stand are sooner or later going to be utilized for light industrial purposes.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon we find is that in modern times broader or new streets are planned in existing and built-up town areas, streets which will not be built soon, but which the local authority in question wants to lay out in the future. Consequently the owner takes no further interest in his building in that area and which will subsequently have to be demolished because it does not pay to spend money on the maintenance of that building. This we find in our country as well. I see it in my own constituency. I know of numerous houses which are going to be demolished when new streets are built.</p>

<p>That is why I want to make the submission that the Central Government, through the hon. the Minister and his Department, should acquire a measure of co-responsibility in regard to planning and developing of our cities. When I say that, I do not want to be misunderstood. I on this side of the House have great appreciation for what many of our local authorities have already accomplished in many areas. But I think there should be co-responsibility, in consultation with our local authorities, in order to prevent the incorrect development from taking place. I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department with their resources, knowledge and other experience will be able to make a tremendous contribution to the benefit of our local authorities if the Minister can find ways and means of effecting co-responsibility with the local authorities, in consultation with those authorities, in respect of the planning and development of our cities.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we were not surprised to hear from the hon. the Minister this morning the figures he gave us regarding the drop in the number of artisans and building workers in the building trade. We have known for some time that this has been going on. Unfortunately, one of the reasons for this drop is the fact that the industry has been faced with controls. Building control and rent control. It is the old story that every time you set up a control it has its long-term effects and it has a broadening effect because it spreads throughout business and industry.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the Minister is correct when he mentions the matters which he is going to tackle, that is the question of the training of artisans, and the fact that he will give the building industry the assurance that there will be continuity of building. I think this will help the situation considerably. The Minister could of course have taken another line which would have helped the industry. He could, in consultation with the trade unions, allow the Bantu to play a greater part in industry. The interesting thing is this. When the Minister talks about industrial housing, he is allowing the Bantu to do more. Because what is industrial housing? It is in the main houses built by Bantu labour under white supervision and that are taken from the factory to the sites where they are erected by white labour. The Minister is using Bantu operatives now and he might as well extend the system to normal building operations.</p>

<p>In his opening speech in this debate the Minister gave us certain new figures regarding bonds, loans and wage ceilings. I want to support what was said by the hon. member for <span class="col_5093-5094" refersTo="#page_1180"/>Umlazi. The Minister has told us that if a man has an income of not more than R5,000 per annum he will be able to get a 90 per cent bond not to exceed R9,000; that is a bond on a property costing R10,000. I think here the Minister has not matched his figures. The average person who to-day earns R5,000 a year does not live in a house that costs R10,000, he lives in a house that costs more. Therefore what the Minister is trying to do will not be achieved at the top bracket of the figure of R5,000. I hope the Minister will consider lifting that ceiling value of the house because it is not a practical one.</p>

<p>What I really wanted to raise with the Minister is this question of the purchase of land surrounding the urban areas. In his speech when he took part in the Part Appropriation debate the Minister told us his department was giving attention to the whole question of availability of land and was negotiating the possibility of purchasing land around metropolitan and town areas where there are growth points. He could then, among other things, provide for the sustained and systematic development of these areas. He also said the matter was being investigated in consultation with the municipalities to see whether a better method could not be found of eliminating speculation in land earmarked for middle and lower income groups. I hope the Minister will be able to give a little more information on this new development, namely the purchase of land in the peripheries of the large cities and towns in conjunction with municipalities, to provide for housing. I think what the public wants to know is this. First of all, what does the Minister mean by the middle and lower income groups? Who is he going to provide this land for? When he purchases land and develops it by changing it into a township, will the land only be used for housing to be provided by the Minister&#x2019;s department? Or will the land be sold to the public for development by the public themselves? Perhaps the land will only be used for uneconomic development by the Minister. Can the Minister tell us? Depending on his answer to the question whether the land will be sold to private individuals, will the Minister tell us whether he intends co-operating with land developers?</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when we adjourned for lunch I was discussing with the Minister the statement he had made in the Part Appropriation debate, namely that it was the intention of his department in conjunction with the municipalities to buy land on the peripheries of our metropolitan areas and towns. I was asking the Minister to tell us what his intention was in this matter so that not only the public but those people who are interested in the purchase of land and land developers could also know what was happening. There has been an enormous amount of land development over the past two or three years. While it is true that the price of residential land just as that of industrial land has risen considerably, there is no doubt that the land developer has been performing a service to the community, because the land is at least available. We have discussed with the hon. the Minister previously some of the factors that contribute to the increases in the price of land which we have experienced, such as the delay in the establishment of townships, etc. I do not however want to deal with that matter today. What we would like to know from the Minister is generally what this statement of his really means in so far as the public is concerned and in so far as those people who normally develop land are concerned. For whom is he going to provide this land? Is the policy going to be a long-term one? I mentioned in the Part Appropriation debate that the purchase of one area of land really did not take the matter very much further, because as soon as that had been acquired and utilized the same problem would crop up again. It might be that to achieve what the Minister wants to achieve he will have to have a long-term programme of purchasing land, so that as the cities and the towns expand he will always be in a position to make provision for that housing he has in mind. I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could tell us what his plans are.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown said at the beginning of his speech that Bantu labour should be utilized to a greater extent. Here, once again, we have the old difference in regard to policy between this side and that side of the House. We on this side of the House believe in the protection of the Whites in white areas. We believe in a colour bar. But on that side what is believed in is economic integration, with its end result&#x2014;social integration. The people outside realize this and we on this side have a sufficient sense of responsibility to realize this at all times, and to accept it. Secondly, the hon. member for Parktown mentioned the restriction of R10,000 in respect of the middle income groups. He said it was inadequate. He also expressed concern in regard to the purposes for which the land is going to be utilized, the land which is being purchased by this Department. The hon. member must not take it amiss of me, but it is obvious to me that he is concerned because this land is going to be used, as laid down by the Department, to make provision for housing for all sections of the community, and that we are not dabbling in snobbishness and status-mania as the hon. member for Park-town is doing. Since we are in Committee and I only have a short time at my disposal, I want to use my own constituency as an example in my speech. As background I want to state at once that the Department of Community Development has accomplished a tremendous task, and not only in regard to <span class="col_5095-5096" refersTo="#page_1181"/>the amount of money which was made available to the local authorities of Rustenburg. In the short period of five years no less then three-quarter million rand has been loaned in my constituency to the local authorities for economic and sub-economic housing schemes. More than 200 units have been erected, and the National Housing Scheme has also lent money to the private sector. That is not all the Department has done. On the contrary, if it were not for the close contact and cooperation, and the advice which has been made freely available, this measure of success would never have been achieved. The local authority was absolutely at liberty to approach this Department, and a great measure of success has been achieved with these schemes. Since it is my privilege to live near to my people and be aware of their problems, I want to say this statement made by the hon. the Minister will alleviate the bottle-necks which exist there. It will greatly benefit these people in the sub-economic and economic groups, and those in the middle income groups. These differences in interest will mean a great deal to my people. However, I want to concentrate on the middle income group this afternoon. I want to state that these concessions which have been made by the hon. the Minister, particularly in respect of our own housing commission in regard to the limit of R300 per month will now make it possible for many Government officials to qualify to live in these houses. It is of vital importance to the Government officials for the simple reason that from the nature of their work and their conditions of service, they are subject to frequent transfers. I want to express the hope that local authorities throughout the country will make a survey and make provision for these people who are serving them.</p>

<p>There is one problem in regard to the statement made by the hon. the Minister. The hon. member for Parktown stated that the solution lay in the fact that the limit of R10,000 was too small. It is not too small. In relation to a income of R5,000 I do not believe that more ought to be spent on a house than R10,000. But the bottle-neck to-day, and the Department cannot be blamed for this, is attributable to one reason only, namely that the prices of residential plots have been increased disproportionately in places where there are points of growth in the Republic of South Africa. Around our cities and towns where large-scale mineral exploitation is taking place, the prices of residential premises have been increased quite disproportionately. I want to state that one of the most vexing problems is the fact that those private companies which made a start with town planning schemes, laid out large plots, mostly as a result of their business acumen. They do not make provision for smaller plots in the same way as a local authority has to make provision in order to be able to qualify for loans from the Department. Most of these new urban areas have been laid out on a snob basis. This constitutes social evils for the development of our nation. I cannot associate myself with any status-mania. I want to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to persuade local authorities, where there is land which belongs to them, to make it available for housing and that this should be done on the pattern which has been laid down by the Department of Community Development. Then you will find that there are smaller plots, but plots which are closer to essential services, because ultimately the taxpayer in such a town must bear the expense of the capital himself.</p>

<p>It would be of great value if local authorities could be persuaded to establish their own residential areas. Essential services would be cheaper, it would be easier to comply with the pattern which has to be followed by the Department, because I refuse to believe that with all these new residential areas which are being established, the local authorities in those areas do not have adequate land which can still be used for this purpose. With smaller plots we will find that it will be possible to leave larger tracts of land open, and lay out parks which can be utilized by the community. The local authorities which are now cooperating with the Department&#x2014;this is the case in Rustenburg&#x2014;are faced with a tremendous problem. Several years ago when they foresaw that the development of minerals would take place on a large scale, they began to undertake new residential area planning, in close co-operation with the Department. It was found that notwithstanding the advance planning, there were a tremendous amount of channels through which this residential area planning had to go before the residential plots could be made available. This was some years ago, and it has not yet been done to-day. Now I want to suggest that the private companies have business acumen and can spend more time on it, and that is why the proclamation of these areas takes place at a more rapid rate, because there is continuity in regard to the scheme with the various departments through which it has to pass. I want to suggest that, since the Minister has appointed a committee to see whether matters can be expedited in any way, these two factors, namely private companies, which are laying out new residential areas, and local authorities, should be related to each other. I am talking about local authorities which also want to lay out residential areas. And the local authorities ought to receive preference in regard to the provision of residential plots. You will then find that when a person from the private sector spends R10,000 on a house, it will not be an unrelated matter. But the problem is that the private sector has to compete with major undertakings such as mining organizations, and others, which purchase plots in order to alleviate the housing shortage for their own employees. It will then be possible for the middle income group to purchase land at a fair price in those areas where there are growth points. The difference between a private company and a local authority is that <span class="col_5097-5098" refersTo="#page_1182"/>the point of departure of the local authority should be to make available residential areas without any profit motive. All they ought to pay for are the services and the value of the land. But that is not the case with private companies. In that case there is only one motive, and that is to make a profit, and this brings about a completely disproportionate increase in the price of the plot and the price of construction of the house. I want to ask the Minister to give consideration to these ideas, as well as to the delays which are being experienced in regard to the proclamation of residential areas. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg made the point right at the outset of his speech that the United Party was trying to dilute labour in the building industry by suggesting that greater use should be made of Native labour. I think that is a very important point, and I am sure the Minister will assist us by answering the point put to him very pertinently by the hon. member for Park-town, namely, if black labour is not to be allowed to participate in the building of houses, will the Minister take steps to prevent black labour from being used in the manufacture of the component parts of prefabricated houses? Because he knows that to a very large extent black labour is used in those factories and then the prefabricated house is brought to the site and white labour spends some hours erecting the building. I think the Minister should give us an analysis of how many man-hours per house, including the making of the component parts, are spent upon a prefabricated house and upon a house built by the orthodox, normal methods, and how many of those man-hours are provided by black labour and how many by white labour. It will be a most interesting comparison and it will do much to expose the falsity of the argument that we of the United Party want to create unfair competition with white workers; because if that is so, the unfair competition is coming from the prefabricated houses which the Minister favours, and there is a larger proportion of black labour used in the manufacture of prefabricated houses than in the building of orthodox houses.</p>

<p>But when we discussed the Main Budget on the motion to go into Committee, I raised a matter with the Minister in a friendly spirit, namely his extraordinary expenditure when he travelled overseas, and I gave examples which on the fact of it seemed to be quite shocking. I made it perfectly clear that it was merely a <i>prima facie</i> case and that we were keen to hear the Minister&#x2019;s reply. The Minister immediately responded, defending his expenditure, and he indicated that members of the Opposition would be free to inspect the actual documents, the actual vouchers in his Department at any time. This offer by the Minister was taken up on behalf of the Opposition by our Chief Whip, the hon. member for Von Brandis. He took this up with the Minister before the Easter Recess, and the Minister, for good reason, I take it, replied after the Easter Recess and then indicated that he stood by his undertaking to make full information available, but he had certain difficulties. One was that he was told that the vouchers could not be taken out of the Accounts Department of his Office and it would cost at least R400 to make photostat copies of the various documents. Therefore he suggested that the only way to inspect the documents would be for one or more of us to go to Pretoria, where this information would be made available to us. Now, we understand the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties, but I think it is not satisfactory. The Minister in the meantime made available to us an itinerary of his journey as Minister of Housing and gave us an analysis of his expenditure under certain heads. I think I should say at once that we find that unless we can accept the offer made by the Minister and see the actual vouchers, this is completely unsatisfactory as far as satisfying anybody that the Minister&#x2019;s expenditure was reasonable. There is not enough information here, and what there is strengthens our doubts about the extravagance of the Minister when he travels overseas. [Interjections.] I say that the information given to us by the Minister, far from satisfying us that the Minister acted reasonably on his travels, strengthens our opinion that the Minister acted extravagantly.</p>

<p>I want to give one example. We find from the figures the Minister has given us that he went on a trip to Europe and to the USA., including Canada for a few days, in a party of six, and this party spent R74 per day per person. That included fares and other travelling expenses, hotel expenses and diverse expenses like tips and gratuities and entertainment by officials. We find that the air fares amounted to R10,330.75 on a trip of 63 days for six people. It means that the air fares were on an average R27 per day per person. The hotel expenses were, in the case of Europe, about R19, and in the case of America about R20 per day. Let us take it at R20 per day per person. Other transport costs, apart from the air fares, were R12.9 in Europe and R18.5 in America per day per person. The longest period was spent by the Minister&#x2019;s party in Europe, but let us assume that they spent an equal time on the two Continents. Then it is fair to say that this expense item would average R15 per day. That gives us R27 for air fares, R20 for hotel fares, R15 for other transport, making a total of R62.3, but the average expense was R74, which means that there was another R12 per day per person for six persons for 63 days not accounted for.</p>

<p>That is the point I am coming to. I have not included this last item. I will come to that last item now, but leaving that out, there is R72 a day for the party not accounted for, R12 per day for each person. But then in addition&#x2014;not as part of this, but in addition&#x2014;we are given this item under &#x201C;Miscellaneous expenses&#x201D;, namely: Prescribed allowances to officials, R16 per day in Europe and R20 per day in the U.S.A. for entertainment expenses, gratuities, etc.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>That is the prescribed allowance and the amount in some cases also includes expenditure in connection with services that were not given in the hotels.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That strengthens my case. In other words, officials are given in Europe R16 a day, and in America R20 a day for expenses, and in addition they also get allowances, where necessary, for entertainment and gratuities, making a total of R4,100 for the four officials over 63 days. That means, surely, that these other miscellaneous expenses for officials must be covered by that amount, and it strengthens my argument that there is still R72 a day unaccounted for. It is R12 a day per person, or R72 per day for the party. That is still unaccounted for, because it was not included in this last amount. I think the Minister should tell us what happened to that amount. How does he account for that? We cannot account for it because we have not seen the vouchers. We have been given globular figures, which I have analysed now, and we find that for the party R72 a day is unaccounted for, but officials get a special allowance over and above the expenses given here, which I assume would account in their instance for the extra expenditure. So it would seem that the R72 per day is for the Minister alone, or perhaps for other people who accompanied him from time to time. But we do not know. [Interjections.] It was a party of six, but in the case of four of the officials that is accounted for because they get a special allowance. I want to know what the Minister did with R72 a day? This Minister has not given us the answer and the facts are not available to us in Cape Town. Why not in Cape Town? Why cannot these documents be brought to Marks Buildings? Why should we have to make an expedition to Pretoria to get the information? What does the Minister want to hide? I want to believe that there is nothing to hide, but these figures reveal a most shocking state of affairs, and I think the Minister owes us a much more thorough explanation than he has given us. I have had the advantage of discussing these figures with members on this side of the House who are accountants. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I am surprised that the hon. member for Yeoville is unable to read and interpret a simple statement properly. The explanatory statement which I made available to the Opposition divided the expenditure in regard to my overseas trip into various items. Firstly there was the question of airline tickets. The cost of airline tickets is determined by the various places one visits. I stated emphatically in the letter to the Chief Whip of the Opposition that the places visited were determined after careful negotiations between our representatives overseas and the various Government Departments in the countries I visited. After they had been determined in this way, the full itinerary was submitted to the Government for approval, and it was approved by the Cabinet. As far as travelling expenses are concerned therefore, in regard to airway tickets, there is no single item where there can be any question of extravagance. I think the hon. member will concede that I am right in this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that visits to many of those places were totally unnecessary; it was a &#x201C;joy ride&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may think that it was a &#x201C;joy ride&#x201D; but let me inform him that my Department and I have to deal with various local authorities each day as well as with the various organizations who are faced with these problems, and that one has to inquire into the different circumstances in the different countries; the circumstances differ from place to place. One cannot visit only the major cities, one also has to visit the smaller places which have problems similar to those in South Africa, and one has to investigate different kinds of circumstances. We may differ in regard to that, but then it is merely a question of judgment in regard to what is necessary in the interests of the country, and what is not. In this case the Government decided that this itinerary was satisfactory. Secondly, I furnished information about the hotel expenses. In Europe it amounted in my case to R19.60 per day; in the United States and Canada it amounted to R20 per day. The hotel expenses as far as my wife and I were concerned included the renting of accommodation plus all meals and other refreshments, and it included the renting of accommodation, without meals, of the officials. The hon. member will see in the comparative statement which I furnished to the Opposition and in which I also furnished examples of the journeys of my colleagues, Minister De Klerk and Minister Haak, that in the case of Minister De Klerk the hotel expenses on his European journey were R20 per day, whereas mine were R19.60 per day. In the case of Minister Haak these were R23.30 per day, as compared to my R19.60. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Durban (Point) has no knowledge of these matters, and he should keep quiet. I stated emphatically in the explanatory letter that in the case of my journey this amount per person per day for hotel expenses ought <span class="col_5101-5102" refersTo="#page_1184"/>to have been lower than in the case of my colleagues, because in my case the party consisted of more officials, and because the accommodation obtained for the Minister and his wife is usually more expensive than the accommodation obtained for the officials, although it is in the same hotel.</p>

<p>That is why the average expenditure in my case is less.

In the United States and Canada the hotel expenses in my case were R20 per day, and in the case of Minister De Klerk R36 per day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did not listen; I am not going to repeat it four times. Now take transportation expenses. The transportation expenses in Europe in respect of Minister De Klerk and his company were R11.50 per day. In the case of Minister Haak and his company they were R12.50, and in the case of my company and myself, they were R12.90 per day. In the United States and Canada they were, in the case of Minister De Klerk and his company, R16.20 per day, and in my case, R18.50 per day. In my explanatory letter to the Chief Whip of the Opposition I stated that in the case of both my colleagues they were able, owing to the small size of their company, i.e. a total of four persons, to make use of one vehicle, whereas in my case, with a total company of six people, I had in all cases to make use of at least two vehicles, and in a few cases where the social welfare official had to go to a different place, we even had to use three vehicles. This happened in exceptional cases. For those reasons the average cost per day must of necessity be higher in my case than in theirs. All that amazes me is that there was so little difference between mine and theirs. But now the hon. member for Yeoville has stated that if the cost per day, the hotel expenditure plus the transport expenditure, is taken and compared with the daily total expenditure of R74 per day, there is still a remaining amount for which no explanation has been furnished. But this amount of R4,100 is included in the total amount, from whence the average of R74 per day was derived. If the hon. member works out what the expenditure was in respect of the prescribed allowances for the four officials who accompanied me, for the period they were in Europe, at R16 per day&#x2014;this is the prescribed allowance they received in order to pay for their accommodation and meals etc.&#x2014;as against the R20 per day which they received in the United States, then he will find that that in itself is more than R4,100 which is indicated here, because the meals they enjoyed in the hotels where they were staying were included in the hotel expenses and were recovered from them out of these prescribed allowances upon their return to South Africa. There is no single amount for which an explanation has not been furnished; it is all included in the statement which I gave the hon. member, and it is clear from the statement that my expenditure compares favourably with that of my colleagues.</p>

<p>If he has any criticism to make, then he should not level it at me alone; it should be leveled against the entire pattern according to which all Ministers travel overseas, because all of us act in accordance with the same pattern. But, Mr. Chairman, it is not only we who travel overseas. When the United Party was still in power, they also travelled overseas, not only Gen. Smuts, but other Ministers as well, and hon. members must remember that the cost of living and the standards at that time were much lower than they are to-day. Here I have the details of the cost of one journey undertaken in 1947 by the Minister of Economic Affairs and Mining. It cost an amount of &#x00A3;33,724, more than R67,000 for one journey, and they merely went &#x201C;home&#x201D;. They did not undertake the study tours which we undertake. In our case it was an essential study tour.

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is volume 96, 1958. The information was furnished in reply to a question. I do not know in what column it appeared; I can furnish that information to the hon. member at a later stage.</p>

<p>I furnished hon. members with full information. They are welcome to look up the receipts. They ought to know that the receipts and accounts are filed in the accounts section, and that the receipts have to be retained for the Auditor-General. One cannot merely eliminate those receipts; some of the accounts may get lost; this can happen quite easily, and it is simply not done. Since I have now given hon. members a clear indication that the costs of my journey compare favourably with the costs of the journeys of my colleagues, I cannot see why I should incur the additional costs of having special copies made for submission to hon. members. It would be much cheaper for hon. members on the opposite side to send one or two of their members to Pretoria to have a look at those receipts. They are welcome to do so. My Department will afford them every co-operation in order to peruse those documents. Mr. Chairman, I can give you the assurance that when Ministers of this Government undertake study tours overseas, then there is no time for &#x201C;joy rides&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) suggested. We look after our affairs in a responsible way. We conduct interviews and hold discussions not only by day, but also to all hours of the night. Very little time remains for private matters. In all the time I was overseas I went to private shows on four nights, for which I paid myself. For the rest my time was fully occupied with official work, interviews and inspection tours. I paid private visits to places such as a few opera houses, and for these visits and other private visits to shows I paid out of my own pocket. The one exception was when I was invited by the local authority of Berlin, as their guest. The officials who paid visits to the aforementioned places also paid for that themselves. No Government expense was incurred for anything which we did in our private capacities. We paid for that ourselves.</p>

<p>I shall now refer to matters which have been quoted here in the debate. The hon. member for Durban (Point) referred to the selling of flats. I want to tell him that the expenses which were originally furnished in respect of the flats does not include my Department&#x2019;s administrative costs and supervision expenses. Actually they disappear in the administrative costs of the Department. They are actually included in the calculation thereof. When one sells a project of this nature to a private investor who is interested in it&#x2014;provided we find someone who is prepared to pay a reasonable price&#x2014;then an amount in respect of that has to be added. We cannot erect buildings which have been erected in the time of officials of the State, buildings over which they have maintained supervision and control and in regard to which one perhaps had to pay inspection fees and consultation fees, and then sell them at the actual building costs. The other costs must to a certain extent be included.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Then the reply to my question was incorrect, because I asked what the costs of the land and the buildings were.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member ought to know what the position is where officials have to deal with a matter. I am thinking for example here of the chief building official, the quantity surveyors, the technicians and administrative officials. It is not easy to calculate the time they spend on a specific project in financial terms. But this aspect has to be taken into account very carefully when the project is sold to a private entrepreneur.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked whether we originally charged more rental than we were entitled to, whether we wanted to make a profit out of it, etc. It is general practice with all building projects that after they have been completed but before the final accounts have been closed, an amount is charged which is slightly more than the final account is expected to be. It is only human to decrease the rent or the purchasing price later on, rather than to increase it. That is why all sale houses, rent houses, etc., are loaded in the initial stages in regard to the rental or the selling price. When the final accounts are closed the price is adjusted so that it equals the normal tariff.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Were they adjusted in this case as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In this case they were adjusted and decreased, yes. At present the rental is lower than the rental a private investor would charge if he had bought that place at that price. That is the private buyer&#x2019;s own affair. If he buys at that price he will, taking into consideration the rent control formulas, be entitled to a higher rental than the tenants are at present paying.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>That was my point precisely, that the tenants would have to pay more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a matter which has to be settled between the buyer and the tenants. If the tenants prefer to go somewhere else then provision can be made for them there. I also want to make it quite clear that <span class="col_5105-5106" refersTo="#page_1186"/>it must be borne in mind that this is not a National Housing Commission scheme. It was a Development Board scheme which was simply introduced as a temporary relief measure in order to render assistance where the need existed. It is clear that the need in respect of that income group has, in the meanwhile, disappeared in Durban and that is why it is no more than right that the Development Board should withdraw from it in order to free its money and invest it in some other place. It is not, in the long run, a proprietor who has to sell properties. It must intervene to try and alleviate pressing conditions, and subsequently it withdraws. This has a bearing on what the hon. member for Green Point said here. The hon. member for Green Point referred to the prices at Macassar and asked what was going to happen. He wanted to know whether the Coloureds were going to pay the same high rentals. Now, the hon. member must bear in mind that my Department is not involved in the determining of basic values. It is not my Department which determines the purchasing prices. This is done by an independent panel of appraisers which are appointed, and if the owner is not satisfied with their evaluation, the matter goes to arbitration.</p>

<p>Yes, they are valuators who have been appointed by me but I do not prescribe to them. Does the hon. member now wish to intimate that I and my Department prescribe to those people the valuations they have to lay down? It is a drastic charge and I want to reject it completely. The fact that I appoint them does not mean that I influence them.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One finds time and again that valuators differ as to their valuations. I can inform the hon. member that in my capacity of Minister of Public Works I recently had a property valuated, and I asked three different sworn appraisers to valuate the property. Their valuations differed by as much as 33 per cent one from another. Ultimately the basic value is determined, and that is the value at which I purchase the property. If I do not purchase it for that price, then I purchase it for at least the market value. If It is less than the basic value, then we pay the person concerned a value depreciation contribution of 80 per cent. It will probably be true in the case of Macassar that those prices will be higher than the prices at which we ultimately sell to the Coloureds. Hon. members must bear in mind that the basic value is based on Macassar as a beach resort for Whites, which of course is a very expensive place. Everyone knows that if one buys a plot at the beach one is in fact paying much more for it than its intrinsic value, merely to have a place near the sea. That is why it can and will happen that my Department will lose on the transaction when it sells to the Coloureds there, because those properties will be sold to them at the market value which they will have for a Coloured housing scheme and not for the value they had as a white beach resort. My Department is geared to do precisely that. The contrary is also true. The hon. member referred to Goodwood West. He stated that the land had been purchased at a certain price and that the Department subsequently made a considerable profit on it. But what he did not inform the House about is the fact that services were laid on there before they were sold again, services for which my Department had to pay. He did not include that in his figures. Surely the hon. member knows how expensive it is to lay on services to-day. Services are a tremendously expensive item.</p>

<p>I want to come to the hon. member for Parktown, Yeoville and others, who spoke about the question of the utilization of Bantu artisans in the building industry. Let me make it very clear that this Government stated emphatically in the past and still maintains to-day that we will not use Bantu artisans in the building industry in white areas. The Bantu artisans in the building industry are being trained and are, as soon as they have completed their training, being used in the Bantu areas and Bantu residential areas for the construction of Bantu houses. But now hon. members are asking me whether&#x2014;and I hope the hon. member for Yeoville will listen to this now&#x2014;Bantu labour cannot be utilized in regard to the pre-fabrication of houses in factories. How many were being utilized for this purpose, and what was the result, they wanted to know. I do not have figures at the moment. I do not know how many unskilled Bantu labourers are at present being utilized in the conventional industry. A great number of unskilled Bantu labourers are being utilized. In the pre-fabrication factories, the factory manufacture of buildings, Bantu are only being used as unskilled or semi-skilled labourers and not as artisans. That is the difference. If we can solve our problems in this way, and if, where we have an adequate supply of non-white artisans, we can produce factory manufactured buildings in a border industry with unskilled and semi-skilled Bantu artisans and then simply erect them in the white area using skilled Whites, with the aid of unskilled Bantu, then we can to a certain extent solve the problem.</p>

<p>One would be depriving the white artisans of work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But there are none. The hon. member must not say this to me; it is merely another election story. Nor will he get away with it. The point is that pre-construction, factory construction, will never replace conventional building methods. It can only be an auxiliary means, a supplementary means. Nowhere in the world has it replaced conventional building methods. What it is physically possible to do in regard to conventional building methods, will be done. In other words, we are not depriving the white artisans of work. They will continue to have every opportunity. Because, in the long run, one cannot compare factory construction with conventional building methods. It may perhaps be possible for one to erect houses more rapidly with the latter methods. It may under certain circumstances assist one, but it can never replace conventional building methods entirely. That is why I said&#x2014;the hon. member was not here then&#x2014;that at the same time as we were encouraging pre-construction we would also make special arrangements to afford equal treatment to conventional building methods in long-term projects.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown addressed an inquiry to me in regard to the purchasing of land. It is a long-term project. The intention is not merely to purchase land sporadically, as the need arises. The intention is to see to it continually that there is always land available which can be utilized for the housing of lower and middle income groups in our major urban complexes and at places where difficulties are being experienced with growth. That is why my Department, in consultation with the local authorities, will from time to time and as land becomes available and development makes this possible, purchase land. As development takes place this land will also be developed. This land will not be reserved solely for the income group which falls within the limits of the National Housing Commission. We want diversified communities there, as far as this is possible. We also want to bring in the higher remunerated persons, the persons who are economically better off, into those areas, for the sake of the social influence which they have on the underprivileged, and on the neighbourhood. To a certain extent therefore these people will be able to obtain plots in these schemes on which to build, but these purchases will, for the most part, be made for the lower paid and middle income groups, in other words, those persons who fall within the scope of the Housing Commission. The exception will be that a group of other people will sporadically be distributed throughout the area. For the rest the higher middle income group and the higher income groups will as usual have to have recourse to the normal market. I am in entire agreement with what the hon. member for Rustenburg said. He said that local authorities who owned land should make it available for housing in an orderly way. We have tackled this scheme in conjunction with the local authorities precisely in order to make this possible in future. We will still have to work out the way in which the land will ultimately be made available because, in my opinion there are still far too many local authorities who are offering the public too few plots at a time at public auctions. Only the more well to do people are being benefited by this, and not the lower income groups. In due course we shall have to come to an agreement with them in regard to the method which will be applied.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to urban decay, but I am not going to discuss that again since I gave a full summary of the position in this regard in the Other Place. The hon. member for Turffontein, in the questions he asked me, mentioned precisely those things I had in mind. The reply to the questions he put to me is that we are in fact working along those lines.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few things about the matter touched upon here by the hon. member for Tygervallei. I am sorry that the hon. member for Green Point is not here at the moment. The hon. member for Tygervallei referred to the large number of non-Whites who are at present living in the white areas. He said the problem was that <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants could, in terms of the Group Areas Act, be accommodated on the premises. In terms of the Group Areas Act, unless it is prohibited by regulation, they are entitled to allow all visitors to them to remain with them for a certain period each year. The result of this was that not only the domestic servants, but many other persons as well apart from the domestic servants, were living in the servants&#x2019; quarters. He asked me to put an end to this by way of regulation. He specifically asked me the Peninsula members of the United Party what their attitude in this regard was. I should like to know what it is, because I think that it is a serious problem. Loitering and skolly elements are becoming more and more of a problem in Cape Town and its environments. The place where there is the least control at present as far as lodging is concerned, is in the servants&#x2019; quarters of many houses. Nor can the employer say anything, because he then loses his employee. That is why it seems to me that the time has come for us to do something about this problem. That is why I am giving serious consideration to it, and I am having an investigation made into it. I am also giving serious consideration to the fact that there are many houses and flats, particularly in Cape Town, where the servant&#x2019;s room is inside the house or the flat, without having a separate entrance, or separate facilities. That is the case.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Minister has referred to his trip overseas and I think that all he has convinced us of is that his own expenses were not as extravagant as those of his colleagues. He compared his daily costs with those of Minister De Klerk and tried to prove that he was not as extravagant as he was. The Minister then threw across the floor of the House the total figure of a trip made in United Party days, but he did not apply the same rules as he applied to his colleague, Minister De Klerk. Minister De Klerk&#x2019;s total expenses came to approximately R19,073. His own expenses came to R28,071. Then he started to break it down by taking the number of days and the size of the party to show that the cost of the trip per person per day was less. I invite the Minister to apply the same rules to the 1947 trip. The Minister did not give us the folio reference and the details. He did not tell us that there were two Ministers who went overseas without their wives and in addition 17 officials. He did not tell the Committee that these men went to the International Trade Conference at Geneva to hammer out the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs. If the Minister refers to Hansard he will see that they went to the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the International Trade Conference at Geneva. Why did the Minister not tell us that? Why did the Minister not analyze those figures on the basis of the cost per person per day. The Minister has not told us the size of the party and the number of days spent overseas. He did not give us the cost per head per day, but he applies that rule when he wants to compare the costs of the Minister of Information. Our criticism is that while the Minister offered to give us details he has not yet given us details which will satisfy us. I am sorry that the Minister of Finance is not here. It is not his duty to be here this afternoon, but if the Minister of Finance were here he would know the standard he expects from the ordinary citizen.</p>

<p>The Minister of Finance through his Secretary for Inland Revenue demands certain details before a taxpayer can make a deduction under section 11 of the Income Tax Act. For example, if a senior executive goes overseas on business and then makes a claim under section 11 of the Act, he is bound to furnish certain details. As far as the accounts I have seen are concerned, I am satisfied that no Inland Revenue official will allow costs at this rate per day. For a senior executive to go overseas on the basis of R74 per head per day, is extravagant. An Inland Revenue official would query every item and disallow certain sections. I challenge the Minister to go to his colleague, the Minister of Finance, and ask him to lay this down as his standard for senior executives going overseas on business. That is a fair standard. I am not talking about the junior official or a junior executive. I am talking about a senior executive, a managing director or a chairman of a company. Ask him whether the Inland Revenue authorities will allow such an executive R74 per person per day as a reasonable item of expenditure and let us have his reply. That is a fair test because, Mr. Chairman, you will find that time after time business executives go overseas genuinely on business, such as export business, get contacts and then afterwards claim expenses from their income tax. When they go to the Department of Inland Revenue, the officials there examine their figures critically. They then say that they cannot allow these expenses because they do not regard them as reasonable. Less than half this rate is the rule.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>It is less than half this rate, including air fares. I went over to the U.S.A. doing almost the same trip as the Minister at less than half the cost of the hon. the Minister. I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and at Hilton hotels in Phoenix and San Francisco. It was considerably less than half this rate. I did not go on a business trip. I paid my own expenses. I went on an education trip approximately three years ago. My expenses were considerably less than the Minister&#x2019;s. Why was it necessary for the Minister to go to New York and then spend four days in San Francisco? It is very pleasant in San Francisco. He then went down to Los Angeles. It is true that he could see housing and housing schemes in San Francisco but would he see any different schemes or anything more by going to Los Angeles? [Interjections.] He spent from the 20th to the 24th October in San Francisco. From the 24th to the 27th he was travelling from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Then from the 27th to the 29th he spent in a place near the Grand Canyon. He then spent three days from the 29th to the 31st in Sun City in Phoenix to see the sun setting. He did not need three days to see Sun City. You can see it in a day. Sun City is a city for elderly people. It is a very fine concept indeed, and I myself spent a day there. What we are concerned about is whether this journey was necessary. Was it all essential and did it warrant this standard of expenditure? If the Minister can satisfy me that his colleague, the Minister of Finance, in future will allow this standard for business executives, then we <span class="col_5111-5112" refersTo="#page_1189"/>will see a considerable increase in the deductible allowances in terms of section 11 of the Income Tax Act. When the hon. the Minister throws across the floor of the House this figure of &#x00A3;33,724, he should apply the same test to that party as he does to his colleague, the Minister of Information. When he gives us all those vouchers and we are satisfied with all that expenditure, then we still reserve our right to say whether we regard this as reasonable expenditure or extravagant expenditure or even necessary expenditure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Pinetown should take another look at the reply to the question to which I referred. He alleges that there were two Ministers who undertook that journey in 1947. It is clearly stated here, &#x201C;the Minister of Economic Affairs and of Mines&#x201D;. The names of the persons who accompanied him are clearly stated in column 4 here. There is no second Minister. The other Minister who went over at the same time is dealt with under another head. In the specific reply which is furnished here, namely in respect of R33,724, there was only one Minister with his private secretary, the chairman of the Board of Trade and Industries, members of the Board of Trade and Industries and other officials who accompanied him.</p>

In this information it is emphatically proved that in respect of myself and my colleagues there was no fundamental difference.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then it is a matter which you must discuss with the Prime Minister. Then you must tell him that the entire Cabinet is paying visits overseas on the wrong basis, because we are all going overseas on the same basis and under the same conditions. We also have a standard which we have to maintain there on behalf of South Africa. We are not going overseas as representatives of a second-or third-rate nation. We are going overseas as representatives of South Africa. But now the hon. member for Pinetown is trying to justify the case of that side by asking why it had been necessary for me to go to San Francisco and Los Angeles; what could I have seen in Los Angeles which I could not have seen in San Francisco. But apparently the hon. member was never there. Does he not know that Los Angeles is the only city in which, up to two years ago, no buildings higher than two storeys were allowed? The conditions there are completely different. The problems experienced there were building on a flat trajectory over a wide surface area. The situation there differs completely from the one in San Francisco where one can see the best renewal schemes in the world, but where one can at the same time see what one should not do in respect of the under-privileged. Each place has its own particular circumstances. Then the hon. member asks me why it was necessary to spend four days in San Francisco. What the hon. member is losing sight of again is the travelling time between one place and another. The hon. member knows that a day is lost if one flies from New York to San Francisco. A day is lost if one does that. One of those days was a Sunday. Did the hon. member take that into account?</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to my visit to Sun City. It was not only Sun City I visited. I stated emphatically Phoenix and Sun City. Sun City is one of the places I visited. I also visited the Indian Reserve there and saw their housing schemes.</p>

<p>One feels disappointed with the behaviour of the Opposition <span class="col_5113-5114" refersTo="#page_1190"/>in this House to-day. This behaviour is childish. The Minister very clearly furnished the figures and mentioned the number of days he had spent abroad. Now the Opposition wants to present the Minister in a ridiculous light. If it is true that a great deal of money was wasted, why do those hon. members not accept the offer made by the Minister? Why do they not check those accounts and then come to this House so as to enable us to investigate the matter very thoroughly. Why speak in generalities only? All we had to-day and before was a general discussion. [Interjections.] If the hon. member feels that that amount per day is too high, let him make a thorough analysis of that amount and let us ascertain whether it is too high. As the hon. member for Pinetown has just said here, he wants to compare the Minister to a managing director of a company, but is it fair and just to do so? I now ask the hon. member for Yeoville whether he honestly thinks that when a Minister of the Republic of South Africa pays a visit to countries abroad, he should spend the same amount per day as a managing director of a company, or is that merely the amount which can be deducted for income tax purposes? Can a fair comparison ever be made? But is it not merely a case of the Opposition now wanting to sow suspicion? Has it not become the habit of the Opposition to select one of our Ministers and then to try to disparage him? That is what they have been doing lately, but it cannot be done as easily as they seem to think. What we ask of them is to go into the facts and to come to this House with those facts, but not to come here with insinuations and a lot of gossip. Present us with the facts and say, &#x201C;In this case you have spent too much.&#x201D; But it is definitely unfair to compare three different Ministers with one another. I think the Opposition is treating this Minister in a very unfair manner. If those hon. members feel they do have a case, let them accept the offer of the Minister to investigate those matters and let them present the facts to this House. But the hon. members are too afraid to institute that investigation. They are too afraid to accept that offer. The only thing they want is that this gossip mongering should continue unabated and they do not want to put an end to it.

<p>I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to convey heartiest congratulations to the hon. the Minister and the Department of Public Works on behalf of this side of the House on the excellent arrangements made by the Department on the occasion of the recent inauguration of the State President. As you know, Sir, the Secretary for Public Works and the Parliamentary Officer were the chairman and the organizer, respectively, of this function and I think hon. members on both sides of this House will agree that in spite of very unfavourable and even stormy weather the night before, the officials of the Department deserve every praise for the outstanding arrangements made by them and the flawless way in which the proceedings went off the next day. The arrangements made this such a neat and stately occasion that for a long time to come it will leave an impression on hon. members and other honoured guests who attended it and especially on the public of the Mother City. We want to convey our gratitude and appreciation to the Department and the Minister for these excellent arrangements which definitely added lustre to this solemn occasion.</p>

<p>Allow me a single moment to refer to the announcement made by the Minister during the discussion of this Vote last year, when he said his Department of Public Works was to be re-organized. The report of the Department was tabled some time ago, and now it is gratifying to take note of the enthusiastic and purposeful manner in which the Department has lately been tackling and executing its work. The techniques employed are in agreement with the latest standards of production and control, with the result that buildings are now provided much more quickly than before. In spite of the shortage of professional officers and with very few additions to the administrative staff, this Department has succeeded in virtually doubling its production since 1965. I think that this is a fine achievement which we should not overlook. The Department is at present systematically engaged in a five-year programme of works which includes more than 1,000 projects at an estimated cost of more than R200 million. In order to illustrate what the Department can do, I want to refer to the crash programme in connection with the provision of Indian schools which was launched by the Department at short notice. Within the past 18 months 15 Indian schools have been completed, seven others are under construction and the paper work in respect of 17 other schools have been completed to such an extent that the work can now commence. In addition I just want to refer to the fact that a very important advisory board has been established in the Department in the meantime, namely the Building and Construction Advisory Board, which has been created with the Secretary for Public Works as chairman. The Department has been entrusted with the secretarial work of this board. I want to point out that the Department of Public Works also deals with the legislation in connection with the registration of engineers which is before a Select Committee at the present time, and that the administration of the Act on Architects and Quantity Surveyors has also been transferred to this Department. It is gratifying to see what this Department has accomplished <span class="col_5115-5116" refersTo="#page_1191"/>within a very short period, and the re-organization of this Department has definitely had fine results.</p>

<p>In so far as the hon. member for Parow has touched upon the induction of the State President, I must add my thanks to his, to the Department, for the split-second timing of this function. I have certain criticisms, and I am sure other hon. members have too. I believe, for example, that the State President could have been brought nearer to the people who wanted to see him. If I have any criticism to level, I want to level it now and not later. I want to say that the function appeared to be too official. It was not sufficiently &#x201C;of the people&#x201D;, to my way of thinking, but I stand open to correction. But I believe that the organization and the split-second timing were very good indeed. Apart from that, I believe that the people should have been nearer to the State President on this occasion.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to say to the hon. member for Parow that he has been used here as a red herring. He has been drawn across the trail to put us off. Let us look at the report of this Department which was tabled here on the 8th and which was put on our desks on the 9th. I cannot go into the report in detail because time does not allow of it, but its opening words are that &#x201C;notwithstanding the serious shortage of staff, especially on the professional side, with which the Department has had to content during the period covered by the report&#x201D;, it again succeeded in doing certain things. I want to go back to the previous Vote, when I brought to the notice of the Minister who administers the Public Service Commission that only 7 per cent of engineers in the Public Service qualify for a salary of R7,000 per annum or more, whereas in the private sector, with a smaller number of engineers employed, more than 40 per cent qualify for a salary of R7,000 or more per annum. The hon. the Minister said I need not worry about that, because the State offers greater security and all that sort of thing. But this report gives the lie to that, and obviously this Minister has not informed the Minister who controls the Public Service Commission of his plight, or else the Minister of the Interior, who controls that Commission, has taken no notice of the facts. What runs right through this report? The fact that this Department of Public Works is grinding to a standstill. In three years&#x2019; time it will be in such serious trouble that it is doubtful whether it will be able to carry on. It has already palmed off part of its work to the Department of Community Development. What is the position at the moment? Let us have a look at the staff. I have not the time to quote all the facts which would fully prove my case. But let us look at the question of vacancies referred to on page 5 of the report. Paragraph 8 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst the Department does not normally experience serious problems with the filling of posts in the promotion grades, the position remains alarming in some of the entry grades, as will appear from the following data.</block>

<p>Then it gives the data, and it is alarming. If nothing is done, this Department is going to come to a standstill because it cannot carry on. I am wondering whether this Department has not been a little too honest and if this does not in fact reflect what is happening in other Departments also. Let us look at it. Out of 724 approved posts in 1967, 121 were vacant. That does not sound too bad, because it is only 16.6 per cent. But let us look at the civil engineers. Out of the 19 posts, 18 were vacant, and I am talking about the entry grades. Take the electrical engineers. There six posts were vacant out of eight approved posts; of the mechanical engineers, two posts were vacant out of seven. Of the quantity surveyor posts, 18 were vacant out of 30. Take the architects. This is a planning department, but 17 out of 33 posts were vacant. In regard to inspectors of works, they were quite well off because they appoint quite a number of people who have come up through the ranks. Take the specification writers. This is where the specifications originate, and here seven out of 12 posts are vacant. I do not want to go on <i>ad infinitum</i>. Where are we going? How can this Minister sit down complacently and hope that his Department will carry on in spite of these figures? These figures are given for three years. I congratulate his Department upon having the honesty to face the situation and to put it down in black and white. This is one of the few Departments that has had the guts to do it. This gives us a picture of the seriousness of the position, and the time has come for the Government to face up to this problem. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Positive efforts were made to recruit professional and technical staff in the Republic as well as overseas. Towards the end of 1966, for instance, advertisements were published in nine British publications. The result was most disappointing.</block>

<p>It goes on in paragraph 11 to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vacancies were also advertised repeatedly within the Republic. Here too the response was most disappointing. Posts in the professional entry grades evoked no interest worth mentioning.</block>

<p>Then it goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The salary structure now obtaining does not lend itself to the recruitment of professional officers in the entry grades.</block>

<p>Here they are facing the facts; they are telling the Minister what the position is, but what gets done about it? Absolutely nothing. Sir, the provision of the facilities which are necessary <span class="col_5117-5118" refersTo="#page_1192"/>in South Africa, the provision of public buildings, the provision of places to house the services we want, is grinding to a standstill, and we are going to get nowhere. But, Sir, other things are well looked after. In paragraph 7 (c), for example, the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So that prestige residences may be better cared for, their control was transferred from the district offices of Cape Town and Pretoria to the parliamentary division of the head office establishment.</block>

<p>What does that cope with? It copes with ministerial residences. They are well looked after. A special section has been set up because the Department can no longer cope and keep these ministerial residences up to the standards that the Ministers want. So special provision is made to cope with them.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members who referred to the inauguration ceremony for the friendly words which they addressed to my Department. For many years the Department of Public Works has been known under various nicknames, and I think that we are now arriving at the stage where those nicknames are becoming something of the past. I think that is attributable to the dedication of the officials and to the fine manner in which the officials of the Department are doing their work as, <i>inter alia</i>, the arrangements in connection with the inauguration ceremony prove.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi referred to the shortage of staff existing in the technical division of the Department. It is true that a serious shortage does exist, just as serious shortages exist in all professional divisions throughout the Public Service.

<p>That matter has been looked into from time to time not only by that Minister but by all Ministers who are faced with this problem and therefore I too have from time to time given personal attention to this matter as the shortage is very serious. Hon. members should remember that two years ago the remuneration of professional officers was improved to a considerable extent and that their salary progression during the first four years of their service were accelerated considerably. In spite of that there has been no improvement; a further drainage has taken place for the simple reason that entrepreneurs in the private sector thereupon immediately increased their salaries to a higher level than the Public Service had done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. M. LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>There are other factors too.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="#hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One has this devilish spiral and the Public Service simply cannot keep up. The State makes bursaries available for the training of people who then undertake to remain in the employment of the Public Service for a certain period, but private entrepreneurs purchase the discharge of one official after the other before that period has elapsed, and as soon as such officials have served their full contract period they are employed one after the other by private entrepreneurs at double their salaries in the Public Service and more. I have had the experience in the Department of Public Works that when an official has been engaged in the preparatory work in connection with a specific project and that project is given out on contract to a firm, that firm ascertains in a subtle way what official in the Department has done that preliminary preparatory work. That official is immediately coaxed away from the Department by offers of a much higher salary. As a result of that I have now introduced the provision that if a person is awarded a contract by the Department of Public Works and he employs an official of the Department for the execution of that contract, he immediately forfeits his contract. [Interjections.] This has the effect that more and more members of our present staff are appointed to supervisory posts in our technical divisions. Consequently we are being obliged to an increasing extent to give out on contract all services&#x2014;architectural services, engineering services, quantity surveying services, etc. The officials the Department still has at its disposal then only do supervisory work in that connection. In this way we are in fact able, with the smaller staff, to cope with the heavier burden which has been placed on the Department, admittedly at a higher cost, because we have to pay the necessary fees to the consultants.</p>

<p>At the moment we can still cope, and with the staff we do get, we are in fact able to keep the senior posts filled. As a matter of fact, our problem relates to the less senior posts, those posts to which people without experience or with little experience can be appointed. One cannot employ a person without experience, even if he has the best qualifications, in a supervisory post; he first has to acquire the necessary experience. Our major problem is to keep the less senior posts filled, but we do have the necessary staff for supervisory posts.</p>

<p>Revenue Vote 15,&#x2014;Social Welfare and Pensions, R117,643,000:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the privilege of the half-hour. This is a most important vote in that a sum of nearly R120 million is to be voted by this Committee to-day. During the Budget debate we discussed the various concessions that were made and announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions participated in the debate and replied to some of the points I raised during that debate.</p>

<p>However, certain other matters also require the attention of the Minister. I wish to refer first of all to the Minister&#x2019;s overseas trip to the U.S.A. and Canada. I know that this matter was raised under a previous Vote, but I wish to raise this matter in an effort to ascertain from the Minister what steps he took in regard to investigating the system of social security in the U.S.A. I believe this to be an opportune moment for the Minister to give a report to this Committee as we on this side of the House have made a particular study of this system in the U.S.A. We have often argued that a contributory pension scheme for all would be in the interests of our economy and the country as a whole but this suggestion has been opposed by the Government. The Minister&#x2019;s predecessor also went overseas and studied various systems in Europe.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House believe, however, that a study of the American system is of paramount importance. The American system originated in 1935 when they had to face problems very similar to those we are facing to-day and which are present in a young and developing country where you have certain social problems as a result of rapid industrialization. We have a similar position in South Africa. It is to be hoped that the Minister will become more sympathetic towards the idea of introducing a more comprehensive system of social security in this country. During the 1930s certain social security measures were enacted and many of these Acts have been amended and improved since then. The National Welfare Act of 1965 was a particularly interesting Act and during discussions here it became clear what social work is being done in South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>However, we feel that we are lagging to a certain extent as regards the provision of adequate security particularly for the aged and those persons who have become permanently disabled. If we look at the situation throughout the rest of the world we see interesting developments. I have here a report made available to me by the Social Security Administration of the U.S.A. and it tabulates social security programmes throughout the world for the year 1967. Of the 120 countries listed here South Africa is one of the very few countries which does not have a contributory system of social security, apart from our labour laws, such as the Unemployment Insurance or Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation legislation. I believe the experience of other countries in the development and application of their social security measures is helpful in providing a perspective of and solutions for the problems we encounter in this regard in this country. The South African economy has, of course, been built up on the initiative of the individual and of private enterprise, and we certainly do not want to see a system embarked on in this country which might lead to a welfare state.</p>

<p>Consequently if we look at the American social security programme&#x2014;and the U.S.A. cannot be described as a welfare state&#x2014;we might be able to find a happy medium as far as the provision of a satisfactory system in South Africa is concerned. I believe the American system has not dampened private initiative and indeed if one looks at their reports, for instance the Report on Social Security Programmes in the United States issued by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare we find a comment which I believe is a complete answer to the question as to whether the introduction of a more comprehensive system of social security might not bring about a dampening of the efforts of the individual. The report states the following on page 15&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The growth of Government social security programmes in the United States has not diminished the role that private enterprise and individual effort play in providing family security. The benefits under the Government social insurance programmes are payable as a matter of right and as an addition to, and not a substitute for, other financial resources. The individual is thus encouraged to supplement these benefits and build up additional protection through his own initiative, thrift, and personal efforts. Moreover, the benefits vary in amount according to past wages and employment, thus serving as an added stimulus to regular employment at high earnings.</block>

<p>I think this is an important view and it is based on experience gained since 1935. This is, of course, a matter of principle, of policy, and having returned recently from a visit to the U.S.A. it is hoped the Minister will now give this Committee further information regarding investigations he carried out whilst overseas.</p>

<p>There are other matters influencing our present system which I dealt with during the course of the Budget debate and I do not intend to deal with them in detail now. However, <span class="col_5123-5124" refersTo="#page_1195"/>I think the hon. the Minister should give an indication as to whether it is possible to review the position of the means test in South Africa. Earlier this Session legislation was passed which has the effect that the means test will be regulated by regulation and not by legislation, as was previously the case with an amending Bill coming late each session. We understand that the old system will be discontinued and the means test will be regulated by way of regulation. Before dealing with that matter, I also wish to ask the Minister whether he can give us an indication as to when the various Acts governing social pensions will come into effect. During 1967 we passed an important Act. It was first known as the Aged Persons Protection Bill and later it was changed to the Aged Persons Act of 1967. This Act made important provisions for the registration of homes for the aged, it altered residential qualifications, and so forth. Similar legislation was introduced amending the War Veterans Pensions Act, the Disability Grants Act and the Blind Persons Pensions Act. However, none of them has as yet come into operation. I realize the Minister had to delay the coming into operation of the Aged Persons Act until the other social Acts were amended. They have now been amended and it is hoped the Minister will give an indication as to when these Acts will come into operation.</p>

<p>The relaxation of the means test was dealt with during the Budget debate. One important aspect the Minister did not reply to, and I believe that aspect to be of paramount importance. This aspect is the means test as it affects the manpower position in South Africa, as it affects the incentive for persons to continue in employment or to seek full-time or part-time employment and thus alleviate the present manpower shortage. We find the concessions announced during the Budget speech did not in any way improve the position as far as income limits are concerned, apart from the concessions made in respect of family allowances and maintenance grants where in future only half the amount earned will be regarded as the income of persons applying for such allowances. I believe the income limits to be a restrictive factor which do not encourage a person to remain in gainful employment. For instance, the pensioner between 60 and 69 years of age, the age group which perhaps is able to play the major part in alleviating the manpower shortage, has not received any concessions as far the income limits are concerned.</p>

<p>A person between the ages of 60 and 69 who is receiving a social pension or who wishes to apply for one, is allowed a free income limit of only R16 per month in the case of a single person. In the case of a married person the combined income is taken and divided in two. It means that if a person has assets not exceeding R3,600 he can receive a reduced pension if his income is between R16 per month, which is the free income limit, and the maximum of R42 per month. This means if a person is receiving more than R42 per month from for instance part-time employment he is disqualified from receiving any pension at all. I feel the Minister should consider alleviating the position as far as the income limits are concerned and as they affect the means test.</p>

<p>Certain steps were taken to encourage people to remain in employment for a longer period by the payment of a supplementary allowance. We on this side welcomed this decision. However, we find there are various difficulties involved in the payment of this allowance, because it is not paid in certain instances. I feel the Minister should give consideration to having this additional allowance paid more easily. In terms of the legislation passed the payment would depend on the age of the applicant as at the date of application. It excluded one group, namely those persons over 70 years of age who qualify for a war veterans&#x2019; pension and who qualified only by virtue of the means test applicable to the war veteran over 70 years of age. That is understandable. They are allowed a higher assets figure because they are permitted to have up to R16,400 and they are dealt with more leniently. However, there are cases where a person has remained in employment until he was over 70 years of age and then made application for a pension, only to find that because of his extended period of service his assets exceed those allowed for applicants under 70 years of age.</p>

<p>When this is the case the Minister&#x2019;s Department does not approve the supplementary allowance of R10 per month. It means if they do not qualify under the means test applicable to people of under 70 years they do not qualify for the additional allowance. Very often this comes as a shock to a person who has deliberately remained in employment for a longer period of time so as to make better provision for his old age and who was under the impression that he would qualify for the additional allowance. We also have cases of people who have become naturalized South Africans and they find that if they did not become naturalized at least one year before the date of their application they too, irrespective of their age, do not qualify for the allowance.</p>

<p>The question of a person remaining in employment and the position as regards this extra allowance also apply to other aspects of this matter. First of all there is the question of the working wife. The Minister made the concession that only one-third of a working wife&#x2019;s income would be taken into account for assessment purposes. We find that this concession is also qualified, because the husband must not earn any income from any source whatsoever. I know of cases where a person received a grant from a trade union of R1.50 per week and because of this payment his working wife&#x2019;s total income was taken into account and then divided for purposes of the means test. If only one-third of her income had been taken into account under this concession it <span class="col_5125-5126" refersTo="#page_1196"/>would have meant that in fact only one-sixth of her earnings were taken into account and he would have qualified for a war veterans&#x2019; pension in this particular case. I think the hon. the Minister should investigate the whole question of the concession in the light of these circumstances with a view to making a concession in respect of the amount a husband may receive while his wife is in employment. If the wife gave up her job they would both qualify for a social pension. That is defeating the object that people should remain gainfully employed as long as possible.</p>

<p>As regards the question of income limits there is another weakness in our system. I wish to refer to a certain case which I think illustrates this point very well indeed. A certain woman of 64 years of age was almost completely confined to bed following a stroke. She purchased an annuity upon the death of her husband which gave her R45 per month. It was taken out some time ago and allowed her R45 per month. However, this amount is regarded as income. If that annuity was R42 per month, it means that she would qualify, provided she did not have assets in excess of the amount of assets permitted, for a basic pension of R2 per month plus R3 per month bonus, plus R10 per month supplementary allowance because of her age, plus R10 per month attendance allowance, giving her a total of R25 per month as an old-age pension, which, taken at R42 per month, would give her a total income of R67 per month. However, because the means test prohibits her from receiving a pension, due to the fact that she exceeds the ceiling of R42 per month, she is excluded entirely as far as qualifying for an old-age pension is concerned. Now, we know that the means test was relaxed as far as assets were concerned. So, in drawing a comparison with this person&#x2019;s particular circumstances, one finds that, if this person, at the age of 64, had assets of R12,000 and no annuity, she could qualify for the pension of R25 per month. In addition to that, her interest received on her investment is disregarded as an income, so that, if that amount was invested at 7 per cent, earning her R70 per month, it would mean that she could qualify for a pension of R25 per month, taking into account the various allowances, in addition to the R70 a month, which is earned from her investment, giving her R95 per month. I believe that these are circumstances which arise and which illustrate the difficulty in applying a means test and the administration of a means test. These various difficulties which arise I believe cause a considerable amount of hardship. As one can imagine, a person having to live, and if confined to bed because of ill health, on R45 per month, is exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>However, the other concessions which I believe the hon. the Minister should pass some comment on, is also in regard to blind persons. We know that encouragement is given to the blind to be gainfully employed, in that only one-half of their earned income is taken into account. When they apply the means test, many of these people do qualify for a blind person&#x2019;s pension. However, there are cases where increases have been granted in terms of their employment, due to the fact that they have become more productive and useful in their employment. They receive an increase in income from employment, but 50 per cent of that increase is then removed from them due to the fact that their blind persons&#x2019; pension is reduced. I believe that at least the hon. the Minister could give a concession to the blind social pensioner, so that only one-third of his earned income is taken into account, in other words, at least the same concession that is applied to a working wife in cases where the husband is not in employment or is unable to receive any income. I believe that the blind are performing an excellent job in South Africa as far as employment is concerned, and they must be given every possible encouragement so as to make themselves more productive in the economy of the country as a whole.</p>

<p>The other points in respect of which I would like the hon. the Minister to give some indication as to his policy, concerns subsidies to various welfare organizations. We know that clubs for the aged are doing a tremendously good job amongst the aged persons in alleviating loneliness and bringing a great deal of joy to many through the services that they are providing. However, these clubs are subsidized on a very limited basis. Indeed, if one looks at the Estimates, one sees that the amount allocated to the subsidization of clubs for the aged only amount to a very small sum indeed. However, there are certain aspects of clubs for the aged, and certain tasks which they are undertaking which I believe are doing a great deal for the welfare of the aged section of the community. For instance, the Vote before us only provides for R5,000 for the whole of South Africa as subsidies for the clubs for the aged under item P. These clubs for the aged have embarked upon other forms of assisting the aged in keeping them out of homes by providing meals on wheels service, and also a home help service to these people. Unfortunately, the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions has up to date not yet agreed to any form of subsidization being granted for this meals-on-wheels service, nor for the home-help service. I believe this is a great boon to these old people, particularly where we find that many of them are widowed, living alone, waiting for accommodation to be provided at the various homes for the aged. Many of them have to wait for a long period of time. Others would rather not be in homes for the aged. They would like to retain their independence and remain within the community, which I believe is the best way for them to spend the latter part of their lives. The meals-on-wheels and the home-help service for these various clubs for the aged, which certain church denominations also are <span class="col_5127-5128" refersTo="#page_1197"/>making available in various centres, should be encouraged by the hon. the Minister by granting them some form of subsidy, so that they can expand their work. They are only scratching the surface at the present time, particularly as far as the urban areas are concerned. Every day their task becomes greater and greater, and they should receive some assistance from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>In dealing with homes for the aged, I would also like to mention another very severe problem which is facing many of the welfare organizations, and also the welfare officers why are attached to various provincial hospitals. We find that in many instances these aged persons receive medical attention at a provincial hospital. When the stage is reached where no further medical attention can be of any assistance, and they have to receive a form of permanent nursing, there is virtually no accommodation available for this type of person. In Natal there is a provincial hospital for the chronic sick, which has a tremendous waiting list, and I understand that the provincial administration is not prepared to expand this institution, as they feel that it is not their responsibility to provide accommodation for the chronic sick, as far as the aged community is concerned.</p>

<p>I was interested to read in the &#x201C;Professional Journal for the Social Worker&#x201D;, in the quarterly edition for March, 1968, named <i>Social Work</i>, an article which is written by a welfare officer at a provincial hospital. The article refers to &#x201C;Geriatric patients requiring institutional care&#x201D;. Here the problem is highlighted by the fact that this welfare officer, in common with many other welfare officers, finds that it is virtually impossible to place many of these chronic cases in the proper institutions where they can receive care. For instance, many of these people require attention which makes it impossible for them to return to their homes, or even for their relatives to undertake the necessary nursing that they are required to receive. Consequently, in taking these figures which this welfare officer provides, it shows that the vast number of them are delaying the discharge from hospitals. In actual fact, it is stated that 61 per cent of the cases referred were unable to be discharged as patients, which was due to the lack of institutions which offered nursing care to the aged and infirm. Over the total 12 months there was an unnecessary delay of 240 weeks.</p>

<p>This means that the average delay per geriatric patient was 7&#x00BD; weeks. These figures indicate how the delay is causing congestion at many of these provincial hospitals, due to the fact that there are not sufficient institutions which are able to take these cases. I believe that the stage has perhaps been reached where the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions should have an inquiry to see what steps can be taken by the State to encourage the creation and establishment of suitable institutions to cater for these chronically sick people who require attention. It was found too that, of these persons, 22 per cent of the sample could in fact afford to apply to economic nursing homes. Only 22 per cent of those awaiting discharge could afford the high costs that are involved in being accommodated at a nursing home for the aged. It means too that this lack of accommodation is a distinct gap in the welfare services that are being provided for in South Africa. The fact is also mentioned here that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the policy of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions that once a resident of a home, whose residence is subsidized by the department, becomes chronically ill, his residence is no longer subsidized.</block>

<p>I believe this is another important position creating tremendous difficulty as far as the welfare organizations are concerned, which are caring for the aged in our community.</p>

<p>The other aspect which I believe is important, is the whole question of the position concerning the welfare services provided for the aged, and the subsidization of welfare posts. We know that, in the broader sense, taking into account all welfare organizations, they are concerned over the fact that many of their posts take a considerable time to be approved by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions as a subsidized post. In the interim, these organizations have to carry the entire cost of these professional social workers, who are doing tremendously important work, and indeed, in many instances, undertake essential welfare services. They have to carry the entire burden until such time as the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions has approved of their post.</p>

<p>The other aspect which I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister, deals with part of the functions of the National Welfare Act, which was passed in 1965. In terms of this Act, provision was made for the appointment of four commissions on various aspects of welfare work. One of those commissions deals with family life. At the time when this Bill was discussed, in considerable detail in this House, it was difficult to ascertain exactly what the function would be of the commission on family life. However, we welcome the news that this commission is investigating the high divorce rate in South Africa at the present time. However, I believe that this whole concept should be taken over a wider field, to cover an investigation of family allowances in South Africa and its effect on family life. We know that the Piek Commission, which reported in 1961, recommended that, rather than increasing family allowances, the existing provision, in terms of other legislation, should be enlarged and extended so as to give a greater degree of efficiency as far as the work is concerned in establishing and encouraging family life. Since then there have been other opinions expressed, for instance the Administrator of Natal, Mr. Theo Gerdener, made a very strong plea for a <span class="col_5129-5130" refersTo="#page_1198"/>&#x201C;cash for babies&#x201D; campaign. If one looks at the views expressed by the administrator, it is obvious that he had in mind that the present system is not working, in that it is not having the desired effect as recommended by the Piek Commission. If we look at the figures in South Africa, and these are vitally important figures in a multi-racial country, we can see whether the White birth rate can be improved so as to keep pace at least with the ratio of the population groups in South Africa. If we look at the figures for the 1960 census, we will see that white families on census day only amounted to 3.7 persons on an average, whereas the average for Coloureds and Asiatics were 4.9 and 5.3 persons, respectively. If one looks at the figures, one finds that the birth rate amongst the white population per thousand in the year 1911 was 32.2 births per 1,000 of the population, whereas according to the 1960 figures, this had dropped to only 24.2 births per 1,000 of the population. Our system of family allowances is on a very limited basis in South Africa. If we look at the figures that were provided in a memorandum submitted by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, I believe that only 1,335 persons were receiving family allowances in the year 1967, an expenditure of approximately R600,000. This means that our system of family allowances is extremely limited. It means that the Piek Commission which made various recommendations concerning other departments, as well as the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, should be further investigated by the hon. the Minister to ascertain whether or not it is possible to devise some other system which would encourage family life and family allowances in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Piek Commission provided information on the various social factors that are concerned with family life in South Africa, for instance, flat life, the employment of married women on an exceedingly increasing scale, the lack of creches, the high divorce rate, alcoholism, lack of preparation for parenthood, religion and depopulation of the rural areas, plus various other items, which show what social factors are involved in studying this problem. The Piek Commission&#x2019;s report recommends on page 92 that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is proposed that the present limited system of family allowances should be modified and improved so that it would have a wider compass and contribute more effectively to family care.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have been listening attentively to the whole series of things mentioned by the hon. member who has just sat down. He commenced by referring to the overseas trip which the hon. the Minister had undertaken, and expressed the hope that from the experience the hon. the Minister had gained overseas he would present us with many matters for our consideration. I want to tell him that the Minister was accompanied by very experienced and well-trained observers from his Department. They returned with a mass of information. From that they are extracting for us everything we can learn from that information so as to present that information to us in a form which will enable us to derive the greatest benefit from it. We had the opportunity of talking to some of the officials. They gave us the assurance that they had collected a mass of information which would be properly processed in due course. One thing we should bear in mind is that we should not&#x2014; like the hon. member who has just sat down &#x2014;rely too heavily on what is being done abroad and pay too little attention to the fact that we have to develop a welfare policy of our own, one which will be founded on local conditions and will be better suited to our own conditions. What is applied successfully in America cannot necessarily be applied successfully here. Circumstances are quite different. The formulation and development of such a policy require thorough and careful research so that in future it may be applied to good effect, particularly in view of the different circumstances prevailing in the country. I expected that the hon. member would have said something more about what their experience had been over the past two years since the passing of the Welfare Act of 1965, about what their experience had been in the field of welfare services in South Africa. Are the possibilities that we shall be able to formulate such a policy in the future not much greater? Do we not see the signs of much more comprehensive research being conducted? Are the signs not there even at this early stage that we are reaping the fruits of that legislation? As far as welfare services are concerned, that was one of the finest pieces of legislation ever piloted through this House, and we are all very interested to see what the fruits of that legislation and its application will be. As the hon. member said, there are four different commissions, each consisting of highly qualified experts, and each one is concentrating on different aspects of this matter. We are already reaping the fruits. I want to say without any fear of contradiction that as far as welfare services are concerned there has never before been such fine co-ordination as there is at the present time. This is one of the fine fruits we are reaping. We can elaborate on this and say that never before has more emphasis been placed on study and research than has been done since the passing of that legislation by this House. Each of these different committees is drawing up and conducting its own research project in co-operation with the Department. I think we do not take sufficient cognizance of this fact, but since 1963 up to the present time the Department alone has issued no less than 54 different reports on different projects studied by the Department. The Department processed the results of these studies and made them available to us. Therefore I say we may expect a Department which is so energetic, along with a vital board such as has now <span class="col_5131-5132" refersTo="#page_1199"/>been established, to formulate for us in due course a welfare policy born on our native soil and based on our own circumstances, from which we will derive more benefit than from a ready-made policy imported from overseas and enforced on South Africa.</p>

<p>As regards the different concessions, I want to say that the hon. member has made a very accurate study of the matter. We are grateful for that. He closely studies the Pension Acts and of anomalies which arise. We can learn from him. For the past 20 years there has never been one year in which concessions have not been made as far as pensions are concerned or in which the means test has not been relaxed. We are already eliminating certain anomalies and I am convinced that we shall be able to eliminate many more of those mentioned by the hon. member if we proceed as the hon. the Minister and his predecessor have been doing. The Minister and his Department are tracing such anomalies. They will eliminate them as they have eliminated many of them in the past. One thing is very clear and that is that when we closely examine these research projects of the Department we find that one matter which arouses a great deal of interest and which the Department has near to its heart is family life in our country &#x2014;the family and the child in that family. The hon. member said that we should do a great deal more in respect of family allowances. He referred to the important report of the Piek Commission who analysed the entire matter and said that we should not, like France and other countries, grant families a specific global sum, but that we should rather grant them assistance by way of concessions. However, we should not labour under the misapprehension that there are no family allowances in South Africa. There are in fact family allowances for which families, indigent families, families with the required number of children, can qualify. In 1961 R75,000 was voted for this purpose. In 1968 this amount was not R75,000, but R800,000. In other words, we are able to say that the Government is giving the necessary attention to the family and to the requirements of the family to an increasing extent. This is happening not only in respect of those families, but also in respect of children in general. In this regard I want to refer especially to children cared for in institutions. This year a further concession has been made. That allowance has been increased by R3 per child per month. In 1955 that allowance was R96 per child per annum. That has been increased now to R240 per child per annum. That was done after proof had been submitted to the hon. the Minister and the Treasury that the cost of providing proper care for such a child amounted to approximately R400 per annum. We are very grateful for these concessions. If one pays a visit to any of the children&#x2019;s institutions, one will see that that money is not being used injudiciously but for raising and improving the standard of the care provided in those institutions. In this regard I want to refer in particular to something which is of great importance to us. It will be of no avail to have all the money in the world, to have beautiful buildings and similar things, if one does not have the right staff to care for those children. They, after all, are the ones who have to see to the rehabilitation of those children. In the past this was our biggest problem, namely that we did not always have the right staff for the simple reason that the institutions could not afford to employ them. The institutions could not afford to pay the salaries which trained workers wanted. The result was that we had to be content with employing poorly remunerated people for seeing to what is really the essence of institutional care, and that is the care and education of the child.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to agree wholeheartedly with the previous speaker that the Department we are discussing at the moment has been doing exceptionally fine work over the past few years. The Department has been very fortunate because this hon. Minister, like his predecessor, is a man who is always prepared to heed the suggestions, the opinions, and the advice from this side of the House. That is why there has been so much progress.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that we are very pleased about the concessions which have lately been made in connection with civil pensions and that we are particularly pleased about the concessions announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance in connection with the 10-year restriction on ex-servicemen. This does not mean, however, that we are not asking for more. We want a great deal more. Today I want to make a special plea on behalf of three groups of people who have been mentioned in this House on several occasions for the purpose of obtaining relief for them. I think that now is the proper time for the hon. the Minister to meet our requests. I want to promise him that we will persist in delivering pleas on behalf of these people until such time as he does in fact make these concessions. I think that now is the time to prove to our people that when South Africa needs them in times of emergency, we will help them when they need us. In the difficult times in which we are living it is very important that our people should have the assurance that we will look after them when they are in distress.</p>

<p>The first group of people on whose behalf I want to deliver another plea, is the veterans of the First World War. This Government has accepted as a matter of principle that it will look after the veterans of this War. The means test for persons who participated in the Anglo-Boer War was abolished 50 years subsequent to that War. At the end of this year 50 years will have elapsed since the First World War. At the present time there is not such a large number of these veterans left. Because they cannot pass the means test, many of them at present do not qualify for the war veterans pension. I want to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to abolishing <span class="col_5133-5134" refersTo="#page_1200"/>that means test as soon as possible for that group of veterans. These people did exceptionally fine work. Large numbers of them helped us in South West Africa. What would have become of South West Africa and South Africa if these people &#x2026;</p>

What would have happened if South Africa had not conquered South West Africa? The mandate would have gone to another power, and South West Africa would then have been lost long ago and just imagine what dangers that would have involved for South West Africa as well as for South Africa. I trust that the hon. members from South West Africa are listening to me and will assist me. These people rendered very good services to South Africa. I think the time has now arrived for us to tell them that we are going to discontinue the means test.</p>

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. J. BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>This House has already passed legislation that rebels are to receive the same treatment. That is no longer relevant.</p>

<p>The second group of people to whom I want to refer, are those widows of men killed in the Second World War who for some reason forfeited their military pensions. They are either married or divorced or have somehow lost their second husbands. Consequently they have forfeited those military pensions. There are not many of these people left. Most of them are growing old now. I really think the time has now also arrived for the pensions of these women, who have lost their second husbands, to be reinstated.</p>

<p>The third group of people on whose behalf I want to deliver a plea are the Bantu veterans of the last World War. We have often discussed this matter in this House and we have been told time and again that the Bantu who helped us in the last war were not armed. Technically that is so, but there are many of them who were in fact armed and who served South Africa under fire. We are only asking that they should be treated like the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Chinese. That is all we are asking. What is the position today if a white man wants to qualify for a war veterans pension? We do not ask him whether he was armed or whether he served in the North or elsewhere. If he had joined, he qualified for a pension. Then he is a war veteran. We are only asking that this should also be done in the case of the Bantu. They are also growing old and many of them are also suffering to-day. What is more, we have to prove to the Bantu in South Africa that we will look after them as well. When we take cognizance of the pattern in Africa to-day, for example in Rhodesia and in Portuguese East Africa and in Portuguese West Africa, where a war is actually being waged, that provides proof to us that were it not for the Bantu supporting the white man in those areas, they would not have been able to resist those terrorists or freedom fighters or whatever one calls them. We have to see to it that these people continue to support us. We must have their loyalty. This is the way in which we can prove our goodwill to them so that when we need them again we will have their support.</p>

<p>These are the three groups on whose behalf I want to plead, and I hope that in the same way as the Minister has listened to us in the past, he will again listen to us and comply with our requests in this regard as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to complete what I was say-and that is that the staff in Children&#x2019;s institutions is a matter of vital importance. My wish would be for those children&#x2019;s institutions to have the best and most scientifically trained sons and daughters of South Africa for educating those children. From the nature of the case an institution with its limited funds cannot afford to employ those highly qualified people. The Minister and his Department have already accommodated us to the extent that they subsidise the salaries of the staff who have the necessary qualifications. But this is not sufficient. The institutions are still struggling along with that shortage and they are still compelled to rely on the services of people who do not have those high qualifications. But now I think something fine has happened, namely that the Department of Higher Education, in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, has earmarked one of the technical colleges in our country, namely the Witwatersrand Technical College, to draw up a correspondence course. There will be no age or scholastic restrictions. In other words, members of the staff of any children&#x2019;s institutions can enroll for that course. It will be a course which will be given on an elementary level, but which will more or less cover the following subjects: During the first year, principles of social care, child study, recreation and use of leisure time. During the second year the subjects will be the following: Health, hostel management and supervisory services, management of institutions, civics, religion and cultural education. That Department is prepared, if a member of the staff completes that two-year correspondence course, to issue a certificate to such a member. The Department has indicated that it is prepared to acknowledge that certificate for subsidy purposes. Even at this stage I want to express the hope here that the institutions which will make use of this scheme&#x2014;and I believe that all of them will do so&#x2014;will use the subsidy which they will receive not for decreasing the other obligations of the institutions, but for increasing the remuneration of the staff so that we can have better staff in those institutions to do this important work of educating those children. I want to predict that <span class="col_5135-5136" refersTo="#page_1201"/>this will prove to be one of the biggest steps in the right direction we have taken in recent years in connection with the question of care in children&#x2019;s institutions.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to a matter which was also raised by the hon. member for Umbilo. This is a problem which has arisen in recent years. We are doing a great deal in respect of the care of the aged, but we also know that as a result of better and more effective medical care there is a constant increase in the number of aged persons. We now have a larger section of our population who are growing old and there are more of them who are in need of care at a certain stage. The Department is doing everything within its power to provide in the needs of those people by means of housing and institutional care, old age homes, etc., but there is one section of those people whom one really pities, namely those old people suffering from an incurable disease, whether cancer, tuberculosis or whatever. If those people suffer from such an incurable disease the hospitals cannot keep them in hospital any longer. The hospital can do nothing more for them and discharges them. Those people have to go somewhere. There is no hope of their recovery. At that age and under those tragic circumstances they have to be thrown out, so to speak, to look for a place to die. One feels that this is an extremely tragic state of affairs. One feels that it virtually amounts to an indictment against our civilization that we have not yet made provision for those people. The position is as indicated by the hon. member for Umbilo. I too have the survey which appeared in a professional journal on social work of March this year in which an analysis is given of the position in a certain hospital in Pietermaritzburg. But here in Cape Town we can prove the same thing. Simply enquire from Groote Schuur Hospital how many cancer patients they have for whom they cannot do anything more and who now have to be discharged. Where must those people go? Family members do not always have the financial means to take those people. If they do take them, they cannot care for them. They do not have the financial means to incur expensive medical costs. It is not necessary for someone in those tragic circumstances to die in agony. To-day there are effective sedatives but those people cannot afford them. When he needs hospital care and nursing most, that man is, so to speak, thrown out. No-one shows him any mercy. Here in Cape Town there is the Conradie Hospital, for example, to which such people can go, but inquiries have revealed that there is an exceptionally long waiting list. They cannot accommodate those people. I may point out for example, that from April, 1967, to March, 1968, there were 69 such applicants of whom 43 were admitted.</p>

<p>Yes, but it also falls under Social Welfare. This is a matter which also concerns Social Welfare. Both these Departments can co-operate in this connection. There were 69 applications at the Conradie Hospital for the admittance of such cases. Forty-three applicants were admitted; 21 died before it was possible to admit them and the others are still waiting to be admitted. Therefore I think that this is one of those matters which deserves the attention of the Minister, the country, the churches and all welfare organizations, because when does one need more treatment and care than during the last phase of one&#x2019;s life? Therefore I want to plead along with the hon. member for Umbilo and other hon. members who will still deliver pleas in this regard, that this should be one of the matters which will receive urgent attention.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with the plea made by the hon. member for Kimberley South in regard to the care of the aged who are discharged from hospital and still need some sort of medical care. This is not altogether a matter for the Department of Social Welfare, and I would suggest that the Minister gets together with the Minister of Health. Perhaps they could devise a scheme whereby these people will find a place where they can receive treatment and care which need not necessarily entail great expenditure. This of course is not the only division of social welfare that needs further investigation. Dealing with the aged alone I find that it is not only the sick aged who have to be looked after, but those who are merely aged as well. Many of them are discharged from hospitals quite well enough to go home, but they do need some kind of care. There often seems to be a rapid deterioration in their general condition which requires care. I think that it is impossible with the rise in our population rate and the obvious inference that there are going to be more and more of these people, for this department to be able to go from one place to another and provide individual attention to these many people who are going to need help. What can we do? I have pleaded on several occasions for the department to devise a plan whereby we can have a village built for this purpose. The Departments of Community Development and Planning will have to co-operate in this matter as well. We must have a village built where these people can be housed. I was thinking about this very point a few days ago when I was in Johannesburg and I noticed that there is already a tendency for voluntary organizations to establish themselves in the same vicinity. In Johannesburg, for instance, the Civilian Blind Society has established very fine homes and a training centre for blind people. Immediately opposite this institution is the Hamlet which caters for retarded children. In that particular area there is a great deal of vacant land. I would like the Department of Social Welfare to acquire some of that land and start laying out a village. It will be adjacent to the new market near the City Deep Mine. On this piece of ground, which is very big, <span class="col_5137-5138" refersTo="#page_1202"/>I can visualize a home for old people which can be built on the same lines as Queen&#x2019;s Haven. This is within easy walking distance of the suggested site. It is probably only ten minutes&#x2019; walk from the Civilian Blind Centre. So you will have Queen&#x2019;s Haven, the Hamlet and the place for the Civilian Blind in one little complex. I would like to see a home on similar lines as Queen&#x2019;s Haven for the aged in that particular area. I should also like to see an establishment built there where the aged ill who are discharged from hospital and still need attention can receive it. In the same place we can cater for the blind who do not have their own homes. It is a very tragic thing that is happening to some blind people who do not get accommodation with the other blind. Blind adults lose their parents and are left alone to fend for themselves, and they must find refuge somewhere. What better place can there be than if they can live together in a community? One thinks of the retarded children, but not necessarily cheek by jowl with the others. They could be housed there also if land is available. It could be a complex where you could provide accommodation, dining-halls, recreation facilities and rehabilitation centres, and where doctors and nurses could go from institution to institution, from house to house, and from flat to flat, all in this particular area. It will mean that the district surgeon who is called to visit the aged, or a pensioner, will not have to go from one end of the town to the other just to see one or two people, probably spend his whole afternoon seeing just these few patients. If we could get these people in a nicely established village where the surroundings are pleasant, it would be an admirable thing and it would be a model for other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I am very pleased, because I have busied myself devising ways and means of doing this and I have tried to get some estimates as to how much a thing like this would cost and whether we could get sufficient personnel to run it. This is the only Department where the Minister has so many voluntary organizations working for him and where he has so many volunteers who want to help the unfortunate. I think we must get these people together so that they will know what the others are doing. That will be a spur to them. Surely we could get enough money then from the voluntary organizations, plus what the Government will give, to make a success of this undertaking. I should like the Minister now to investigate the possibilities in this particular area. It is one of the few parts of the Johannesburg complex which would lend itself to it and where land is available. The Minister must please investigate this further. If we could have these institutions as a nucleus, I think the same sort of thing could be done in the other cities.</p>

<p>But before that comes about, we have what we can do as a short-term policy. Again I must say that the medical treatment of some of the aged, the pensioners and of blind people is very unsatisfactory at present. They have great difficulty in getting medical care because they cannot afford it. Unfortunately most of them do not belong to medical aid associations or benefit societies. Most of them cannot afford to pay for their medicines. Again I say that as a short-term policy the Minister should take my suggestion seriously and institute the card system I spoke to him about last year and issue pensioners and blind people with these cards, which will enable them to get medical treatment from any doctor, so that they will not have to wait for the district surgeon. It will also enable them to go to a chemist and get medicines there. An arrangement can then be made with the doctors who, I am sure, will work for the same rates as they do for medical aid societies, or perhaps even less, as long as they know that they are helping this class of person who needs their help. The chemists, I know, will dispense their prescriptions at a much lower rate than it costs the pensioner to-day in the ordinary way. I also spoke to the Minister about the feeding of these people. I know the Dairy Board was going to accept the suggestion I made some time ago and make smaller packings of butter available for these people. You cannot expect an old age pensioner to buy a pound of butter, because they do not have refrigerators to keep it fresh. I say that the Minister must immediately press for smaller quantities to be made available, whether it be butter or milk or fruit. They must be able to buy these things in small containers and at a reasonable price. If it is a quarter-pound, they should not have to pay an extra cent, which some retailers add to the price because you buy a small quantity. If 1 lb. of butter costs 40 cents, &#x00BC; lb. should only cost 10 cents and not 12 cents. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>If there is one section of our social care in which a great deal of research still has to be done, then it is certainly in the field of the care of the aged, and I think we shall agree in general with the idea that drastic measures will have to be taken in the near future to cause research to be undertaken in this field and particularly to attend to the special needs of the aged.</p>

<p>But since a good deal has already been said in this respect, I want to discuss a different subject. I should like to pay tribute this afternoon to the great work that is being done by particular initiative in our country as expressed in practice by the voluntary welfare organizations and by the charitable organizations of the churches. It is impossible in these few minutes to present a complete picture of the great and comprehensive work being done by these people. But if we consider that approximately 8,000 aged and 10,000 children in need of care and about 8,000 retarded persons are being cared for in homes of these welfare organizations; that these organizations employ about 600 trained male and female social workers who perform professional social work <span class="col_5139-5140" refersTo="#page_1203"/>amongst these families; and if we add to that that these organizations probably collect more than R8 million and possibly even R9 million per year for these services; and furthermore that the various Government Departments subsidize these activities by between R9 million and R10 million per annum, then this brings us under the impression of the tremendous work that is being done. We are satisfied that this work is of a high quality for the very reason that these organizations are making more and more use of the professional social worker to assist in rendering these services.</p>

<p>The voluntary welfare organizations played a very great part in the establishment of the Department of Social Welfare. In referring to the work done by them and the contributions made by them, I should also like to mention the enormous amounts contributed by newspaper funds towards this work in recent years. I want to mention as an example the Christmas Fund of the Transvaler, which collected the large amount of R131,000 within the space of a few weeks last year, and the Springbok Radio Christmas Fund, which collected R219,000 in a single month. But what is important is that these organizations and these funds give virtually all that money to the voluntary organizations to do the work. These people do not do social work themselves. If they should do it, we could raise serious objections.</p>

<p>I want to mention another matter, and that is the good relationship existing between the voluntary organizations and the Department of Social Welfare. I want to refer to the emphasis which is placed on the importance of family life&#x2014;the approach adopted by both the Government and the voluntary welfare organizations in their activities that the family is at the centre of things.</p>

<p>If we see what progress has been made over the last 30 years since this Department came into being, then I feel that one matter requires our very urgent attention. I am referring to the fact that although we have a Department of Social Welfare which in fact determine the overall welfare policy of this country, we are finding more and more that various Government Departments are also concerned with some or other branch of welfare work. I refer to the Department of Community Development which provides houses for various people who receive welfare services. I refer to the Department of Education, which is concerned with the child in need of care and the socially disrupted child in the schools of industries. I refer to the Department of Justice, which is responsible for the administration of justice in the case of the child in need of care and the parent neglecting that child. There are many others that I can mention, <i>inter alia</i> the Department of Labour with its rehabilitation services.</p>

<p>We have two agencies at present which provide co-ordination in these fields. In the first place we have the Welfare Board, to which the hon. member for Kimberley (South) has already referred, and the work is being done there, and on the other hand we have the Inter-departmental Advisory Committee, which advises the various Departments on welfare matters handled by those Departments. The Departments of Coloured Affairs, Bantu Affairs and Indian Affairs will also develop their welfare departments soon. We shall eventually have four Departments of Social Welfare parallel to one another, which is quite correct, as we are dealing here with a welfare service rendered to various population groups.</p>

<p>What I want to plead for now, is that the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, who at present still exercises overall control over the various Welfare Services and who is aware of the great work performed in respect of the various welfare services by other Government Departments, should take the initiative to ensure what I want to call overall welfare planning.</p>

<p>As I see the position, it is the duty of this House to lay down the broad welfare policy and to give direction to it as it is submitted by the Government, but when we come to each of the particular population groups, the work for each population group should be done by persons belonging to that group. We therefore have four social welfare groups alongside one another, each with its own different welfare organizations, but we also need overall welfare planning for the country as a whole. I believe that it is time for the Department of Social Welfare to take the initiative. Although the present tendency is for the National Welfare Council and its Commissions to pay attention mainly, perhaps&#x2014;I shall not say exclusively&#x2014; to White welfare work, they will in future have to cover the wider field as well. In the interests of the non-Whites, in consultation with them, but not necessarily on a basis which might promote integration, we must convey to them the experience and the knowledge which we have acquired through the White organizations and through the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions over the last 50 years, and particularly over the last 30 years. The experience and knowledge must be conveyed to the non-White population groups, which will eventually have their own social welfare departments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Kimberley (South) said about the activities of the National Welfare Board. Sir, this Board is made up of a group of persons who are rendering a great service by virtue of their technical and practical experience. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I do not think there was anything particular in what was said by the hon. member who has just sat down to which I should make any reply, except to remind him that when he talks about the collection of funds by newspapers, he should read other papers as well as those in his own language, because the collection of welfare funds is carried out by most of our leading journals, or by our daily papers and credit should be given to them wherever credit is <span class="col_5141-5142" refersTo="#page_1204"/>due, instead of giving credit only to those which come to his particular notice.</p>

<p>Apart from that I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to certain undesirable features of new housing estates, undesirable features which are beginning to show themselves in other countries and possibly also in this country, as investigation might reveal. I refer particularly to the question of life in flats, and I want to pose the question whether it is desirable that our people should be supplied with flats through Government funds; whether the effect on people who live in these flats is desirable and whether their health is maintained in these flats. Sir, there has been a good deal of investigation into the effect on family life of life in flats. I do not particularly wish to refer to other questions; I mention rather the effect on health. Carefully controlled experiments have been carried out by British doctors who have found, in making a comparison between completely similar families, the one set living in flats and the other in houses, that the effect of flat life is deleterious to the health of the family. Amongst those living in flats there is about 67 per cent more illness than there is amongst those living in houses. There is a marked increase in the respiratory illnesses, particularly in the case of children under 10, to such an extent that it is extremely noticeable. The higher up the flat, the more noticeable it becomes. In other words, children living on the fourth floor will show a higher rate of chest diseases than those living on the first floor. This is quite appreciable and can be expressed in percentages. The incidence of bronchitis or pneumonia is 66 times higher amongst those living in flats than amongst those living in houses. Life in flats has an effect on the parents. Women who live in flats suffer frequently from neurosis and from most of the non-organic diseases prevalent amongst women. It has also been found that this illness is recurrent, long-lasting and disabling. The only thing that can be said in favour of living in a flat in comparison with living in a house, is that there are more accidents, minor accidents, to children living in houses. This gives the key to the problem. The key to the problem is that in the case of house-dwellers the children go out to play when they come home from school and they may get hurt. But at least they remain healthy, and it must not be forgotten that these chest conditions are carried forward into adult life, in other words, they persist over a long period of years. The neurosis amongst mothers who live in flats is brought about by loneliness. It is much easier to go out by your backdoor and talk to your neighbour over the fence than it is to come down three flights of stairs and then walk up again, after having had a few words with the baker or the butcher. These women complain that life is too easy for them; that they have nothing to do. They look after their children but there is nothing else for them to do. Shopping is easier because the flat is small, and all they can do is to sit in the flat and mope, without seeing or talking to anybody. If they are taken ill, the husband usually has to take time off from his work, which is undesirable. If a house-dweller is ill, it is not unusual for the doctor who calls to find that he is met at the door by a neighbour. That is the sort of relationship that develops amongst people living in houses. They develop a relationship of neighbourliness. That relationship is not found amongst flat-dwellers. Furthermore, these people are frequently cut off from their families or from their mothers. Children who marry move to a new estate and the parents remain in the old home. These people who are isolated in flats are tragic cases; it is not something to smile about, because the tragedy is that the effect of living in a flat remains with them in later life. We hear people talking to-day about family life. Many a divorce case starts when the wife has to live in a flat and sees nobody else. All she can do is to stay put and care for her children. I hope that the Minister will take an interest in this matter and try to have research done in this country to see whether it is worthwhile for his department to erect these flats.</p>

<p>Then I want to touch on another small matter and that is the provision of hospital attention for the aged sick for whom no provision is made at the present moment. These people do not require a great deal of care from the medical point of view and they do not require a great deal of nursing. They do perhaps need attention for an hour or two a day. The Department of Health has come to an arrangement with a private company to provide the tuberculosis people with hospital care. I am not sure whether this applies to Whites or only to the Bantu. Hospitalization is provided in hospitals which have been built by private enterprise and which from the nursing point of view, are staffed by private enterprise. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>We have seen two facets of the Opposition this afternoon, and I must honestly say that the hon. member for Durban (Central) really saved the Opposition. I want to congratulate him on his constructive effort&#x2014;the first from that side of the House&#x2014;to bring a social welfare problem to the notice of the Committee. I am convinced that the Department&#x2019;s research team will indeed go into the social problems of flat-dwellers. I can assure the hon. member that we have all agreed that a flat is not the most desirable place for building up a family and for building up a nation. What have we had from other hon. members on that side in this debate? The hon. member for Umbilo again brought up the question of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s overseas journey. None of the speakers on that side tried to find something constructive in that journey. They only criticized. The hon. member for Yeoville was possibly the victim of a social welfare problem, and we are glad that he is well again, but what does he do? He does not ask whether the hon. the Minister <span class="col_5143-5144" refersTo="#page_1205"/>did any research overseas, or whether he found new ideas for solving our problems. No, he asks the hon. the Minister: Was the Grand Canyon beautiful? We must not view social welfare only in terms of pensions or in terms of care for the poor and the needy. The task of social welfare comprises much more. After all, it is concerned with the welfare of the nation in all its facets. The work of the Department of Social Welfare was defined by a sub-committee of the Cabinet as being the rehabilitation of the socially maladjusted individual or family, as well as making a study of the conditions leading to social maladjustment or closely related thereto, and the subsequent treatment of those evils. The sub-committee found that it was essential to conduct research into the problems in respect of the practical implementation of the policy and to assess the value of the present services. This treatment should centre round the family and its object should be to return the persons concerned into society.</p>

<p>Many of us in this House have already had the privilege of visiting some of these rehabilitation centres. I am glad to be able to say that none of us has had to go there yet. But we have seen what excellent rehabilitation work is being done there. However, we must keep in mind that no rehabilitation&#x2014;be it in the case of an alcoholic, a drug addict, or a maladjusted juvenile delinquent&#x2014;is complete before that person is again fully assimilated into and accepted in his community. I want to consider this important part of the work of the Department for a moment. As I said, we cannot always talk about pensions only. We must also grant recognition to those persons who are undertaking this welfare work, and we must give more attention to them. I am referring to those persons who used to be classified as social workers, but are now known as professional officers. How many of us here realize how much work is being done by these officials? In cases where children are neglected they are the persons who have to go and investigate and who have to submit a report to the Juvenile Court. Then they also have to say what should be done with those children. They are the persons who are responsible for family care if as a result of circumstances parents are unable to feed their families. They are the persons who, when they hear of a person being an alcoholic, must go and investigate the matter. They are the people who have to sit in juvenile courts all day to hand in reports on ill-treatment of children. They have to carry out inspections at homes for the aged, etc. And now we find that most of these people are temporary employees of the Department, and that in most cases they are women. Do we realize that they are often brought into circumstances which may be prejudiced to their persons and characters? This is certainly no enviable work. After all, they do not visit healthy and clean-living people. I have come across cases where these professional officers had to suffer the worst possible insults, but I can proudly testify that these people endure these insults in the execution of their duty. I therefore want to plead with the Minister that efforts should be made to encourage those people, especially the men, to improve their qualifications for their work. Their working conditions should be improved, because, Mr. Chairman, social welfare problems do not occur only among the poor; the problems are creeping up to the higher classes. These people must have great integrity. For example, they must be able to deal with the manager of a large company who is an alcoholic. We cannot simply send a person with only ordinary training there. Such an officer must be able to talk to that person on his own level. I should like us to encourage these officers, through the agency of the Department, by means of bursaries and study leave, etc., to reach the highest level of development so that they may perform their duties in the best possible way. What is more, where we want to restore rehabilitated persons to the community, we must also make use of the services of the community to help assimilate those people and to help them to play their full part in that society. I can mention an example to you. An alcoholic may remain in a home for a year, and he may remain under the care of a professional officer for months after that, but I can assure you that it will take at least two years after that before he has rehabilitated himself to the extent that he is accepted by society as a man who can stand on his own feet. We cannot expect the professional officers to do this work on their own. I want to suggest that, just as we appoint justices of the peace in the legal field, we should consider the possibility of appointing a kind of justice of the peace who will act as guardian for those persons who are in need of rehabilitation in the community itself, not only those who have been in rehabilitation centres, but also the juvenile delinquents. They must know that that person is their guardian, and that he serves as a link between them and the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I believe there is a very great ignorance about when one may receive a pension, and I therefore want to raise one or two matters connected with this.</p>

<p>I would like to start by saying how useful I have found the memorandum issued by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions reflecting pensions as at the 1st October, 1967; and indeed, all the memoranda which are very regularly put out by the department and made available to members of Parliament. I have, like other hon. members, found them of very great assistance indeed in dealing with pension problems. I would like to place on record my appreciation of them and of the speediness with which they are made available to members of Parliament when there are changes. That may be good and well for members of Parliament, but there is a tremendous amount of ignorance on the part of persons entitled to pensions as to their exact rights. <span class="col_5145-5146" refersTo="#page_1206"/>This has been brought home to me in the last year very forcibly through an offer I made to help people in this regard. The amount of ignorance of people, who are in truly straitened circumstances but fully entitled to a pension, over and over again, as to their rights, is truly astonishing. I want to give one example only. A lady wrote and said that somebody told her that because she had some investments, she was not entitled to a pension. The actual amount of her investments was R2,000. She had not another penny in the world or any other source of income. She had been led to believe that she could not get any pension. I do not think that this is anything like as exceptional as one might think, because in countless cases people clearly entitled to pensions have not applied. I believe that people do not even know the age at which they become entitled to a pension. They certainly do not know what the means test involves. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister what steps are taken to bring the factual position to the knowledge of the public. One is aware that pension matters are referred to in this House and that pension improvements are mentioned from time to time. These are however, terribly complicated for the ordinary person to understand. I must confess that not being knowledgeable on this matter myself. I find the various announcements difficult to follow. I would not be surprised that the average member of the public is really none the wiser as to their rights in regard to obtaining a pension in the first place under these various Acts. I would like to know exactly how the department makes the position known to people on a continuing basis. I want to make a suggestion or two, but it is possible that these are already being done: if so, it can then be taken as read, naturally. Is it not possible, for example, to put up clear notices in every post office with just the outline, the age, perhaps the residential qualification and the means test. This could be done in the simplest form so that old ladies and old gentlemen can be alerted to this fact. Secondly, if it were possible for the department, to make available at convenient points such as their own offices, magistrates courts, or post offices, where people go more readily than to magistrates courts, a very short sheet on the subject, if not a little booklet. If these were available, I believe that they would, firstly, enable people who are entitled to this money, and indeed badly need it, to obtain information and make the necessary application. I think this would save a vast amount of time for the departmental officials. Speaking for myself, I have had the very greatest co-operation from departmental officials where I made enquiries about pension rights. I have gained the impression, however, that they are rather harassed and overworked. They are also short-staffed. The ordinary pensioner going round to the department may go to the offices and then not get immediate attention. Perhaps immediate attention is not possible and I think that, as a result, it is often required that appointments are made. This does tend to discourage people from going there. The hon. member for Umbilo, and other hon. members from Natal, have had the experience of operating an office in Durban where they have helped with difficulties in this regard. People simply streamed to these offices with their pension problems. The fact that they do come so readily, and in many cases are entitled to help, shows that perhaps the departmental offices do not make the pensioner feel quite as welcome with their enquiries as I am sure the hon. the Minister and his department would like to be the case. This is the one important aspect. Then there is the matter of the pension forms. These are very formidable documents and people get a bit frightened off by having to complete them. It is perfectly true that where there is a means test one has got to make enquiries, but these forms have to be filled in and several copies supplied. To older people and people who are ageing, perhaps failing to some extent in their powers, this does represent a pretty big hurdle to take. It is not every old person who is bold enough to approach a more knowledgeable person to help in these matters. The facts of the matter are that very many old people, entitled to pensions, are eking out an existence without a pension because they do not know their rights. If they are aware that they might get a pension they are too nervous and too terrified for some reason, to go and make the application. I can definitely say from personal experience&#x2014;admittedly only over a short time but very sufficient, where I have had reactions from approximately 70 people in this category of whom very nearly half were entitled to pensions&#x2014;that there is this gap. I believe we should do more to attempt to close the gap and attempt to put the matter right. I hope that the hon. the Minister will indicate how he sees this, whether it is concerning the department, and whether there are perhaps better ways than I have suggested in the short time available to me and my limited experience, as to how this problem can be overcome. I believe that these people do need the help of the State and I hope that the hon. the Minister will have ideas in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, must not blame me if I do not follow up on what he said. The hon. the Minister will probably reply to that. After what we have heard from hon. members on both sides of the House, we can only come to one conclusion, namely that we are all very satisfied with the work the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is doing. We consider that the Department is doing its duty and perhaps more than its duty in respect of the purpose for which it was instituted. What is more. I think we can be grateful that we have in the hon. the Minister a person with such an intense interest in the work which is being done there, and especially for the interest which he evidences in respect of our aged and the soft spot which he has in his heart for them. According to statistics, <span class="col_5147-5148" refersTo="#page_1207"/>the number of aged persons over the age of 60, has increased from 1.87 per cent in 1904 to 6.65 per cent in 1960. These figures are in respect of Whites. In conjunction with the increase in the number of aged persons, the problems in this connection have also increased. Pleas were advanced here this afternoon by a few of the previous speakers for the chronically ill. I should like to associate myself with those pleas and I want to describe a group of old people who create many problems, namely that group of old people whom we may call the infirm and helpless aged. They are persons who are physically incapable of looking after themselves and who therefore need constant personal care. They are people who do not necessarily need the services of a doctor or a nurse. They therefore do not qualify as hospital patients. It is this group of aged persons which not only creates a problem at present, but which is also becoming an increasingly great problem as the number of aged persons increases. Many arguments are put forward that those aged persons should be cared for by their children and families. It is no use arguing that it is the duty of the children to care for those helpless aged. In many cases it is not only the children who neglect their duty, but circumstances may prevent the children from caring for those aged persons. We think for example of houses which are perhaps not large enough. We think of economic conditions which do not make this possible, of cases where the wife perhaps has to go and work and where it is impossible for her to take care of these aged persons. But even where the children are willing to do so, it is in many cases physically impossible to expect one person to care for such an old person day and night. But our problem lies also in the fact that many of those old people do not have any children or relatives and that they are simply on their own. We must therefore accept one thing as a fact, namely that this state of affairs does exist and that we have to find a solution for it. Now the question arises as to what should be done with these infirm and helpless aged. The old age homes cannot care for them because the staff and the facilities to care for them simply do not exist. Neither can they go to a hospital because the Hospital Ordinance does not provide for the care of those old people. The hospitals only accommodate persons who are suffering from specific complaints. It is true that hospitals offer temporary assistance where those old people can perhaps be treated for a week or two for some complaint or other. We now have the position where one provincial authority or one department simply hands the matter over to another and we still have the same problem. I think that the time has now come for us to obtain clarity about the seriousness of this question. We as a society have an obligation towards those persons whose condition is such that they do not qualify for hospitalization, or who cannot or do not want to be cared for elsewhere. Therefore I want to plead with the hon. the Minister that positive measures be taken by the State to provide the best care for these old people who are left helpless in the eve of their lives and who must look to others for help. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would not perhaps consider appointing a commission of enquiry so that we can obtain finality in that matter, because it is a fact that these people simply find themselves in a no man&#x2019;s land. Personally I think this is perhaps a matter for the provincial authorities to be dealt with in their hospitals, because if institutions must be established for the care of those old people, then it can also not be expected that each town should have its own institution as is the case with old age homes at present. Such institutions can only be erected in a few towns in the whole of the Republic. Then again we will have the problem that those old people will be wrenched away from the surroundings to which they are accustomed and from their families. If, on the other hand, provision can be made in the hospitals for the care of these people, there will also be medical facilities available for their treatment, if necessary. What is more, if they are in hospitals, they are with their own doctor who knows them. They are then also near their own churches and their ministers who mean a great deal in their lives. Therefore I think that this is perhaps a matter for the provincial administration. But I nevertheless want to ask the hon. the Minister if he does not perhaps think it advisable to appoint a commission of enquiry so that we can once and for all obtain finality about who should accept the responsibility for the care of those helpless aged persons who cannot care for themselves, so that they do not find themselves in a no man&#x2019;s land, and so that their case is not passed from one authority to another.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that there is one matter which is abundantly clear from the speeches which have been made this afternoon. From both sides of this House there is an indication of concern as to the wellbeing of the aged. I want to say immediately to the hon. member for Boksburg that there is no need for a commission of enquiry. This matter is one of the subjects within the purview of the Schumann Commission. Reports in this regard are in the hands of the Government. I must say that I have tried all the subtleties of persuasion that I know to extract some information about what is in that report, but I am greeted by a stony silence from the front benches opposite. This is an urgent matter&#x2014;this matter of dealing with the three classes of aged, namely the healthy aged, the chronic sick aged and the helpless aged. I do believe that something positive must be done in the very near future. Mention was made by the hon. member for Kimberley South of the existence of facilities for the chronic sick for instance in our hospitals. He mentioned the Conradie Hospital. The cost per day for a patient in the Conradie Hospital is R6.78 according to the latest report of the hospital for 1966. It is an awful <span class="col_5149-5150" refersTo="#page_1208"/>lot of money to pay for someone who merely needs help and attention and not specialized nursing and medical attention throughout the day. On the other hand you can put up a home, even a convalescent home. For instance, in the Cape Peninsula complex there is the Eaton Convalescent Home and the cost there works out at R2.61 per day per patient. It is something of that nature which I feel must be provided soon. We need hospitalization for taking care of these chronically sick people who cannot be cured and who must live the rest of their days receiving some medical care. It is uneconomic and wrong to occupy hospital beds where the cost of hospitalization is growing every day. I believe that that is the problem which must be met. As I see it the trouble is that there is divided responsibility as regards the different classes of aged persons, the chronically sick and the helpless aged.</p>

<p>There is another problem in regard to the aged which has arisen and is arising in areas such as what I represent. I am thinking of the Green Point/Sea Point area and other areas in Cape Town. This is the problem of the aged who want a home of some sort and who perhaps have a little money. They can pay and therefore are able to stay in boarding houses or residential hotels. But these buildings are being knocked down wherever they are at present. These residential hotels are being knocked down and in their places blocks of flats are being built. These flats are too big and luxurious for these same elderly people who are fit and well. They cannot seek accommodation in these flats. A recent census in the Sea Point area by the Ratepayers Association shows that there are some 2,000 elderly widows in the Sea Point area who are living in rooms or boarding houses, many of which are now being demolished. They present a very real social welfare problem as to where they are to be housed. I believe that in some overseas countries&#x2014;I do not know whether the hon. the Minister will be able to enlighten me on this&#x2014;there is now an attempt by the Government to assist in erecting blocks of what one might call single unit flats, that is to say, one-roomed flats with a little kitchenette and a bathroom. There is then connected to the block of flats a sick bay or some attention at the ready so that the elderly person living in a flat does not feel all alone and terrified that something may happen to him in the dead of night as a result of a heart attack or something of that nature and have no one to assist him. I believe that in this country we could well do that. We could see to what extent through the Department of Social Welfare or non-profit institutions we could provide homes of this kind for the aged, and there are many people who require such housing. Those are the healthy aged who can pay reasonable rentals. They are not living on a sub-economic basis. They would then have a place which is suitably erected and planned for them.</p>

<p>If I may. I should also like to add to what was said by the hon. member for Durban (Central), when he referred to flat land existence. There is a development now in the Sea Point area, and I understand that the Minister has not said that he is against this proposal of an intensification of building by allowing tower buildings to be erected. The hon. the Minister has not expressed his opinion either for or against these projects. What I am trying to indicate is that it provides housing for additional numbers of persons in the same restricted physical area. It brings another problem in its wake, apart from those the hon. member has indicated, and that concerns the youth of the area. Attempts are made to find facilities for recreation and for sport. Young people should be kept occupied. This is a very serious matter. I have said I think it is a social problem which has to be faced in regard to the housing of the aged and the middle-income group, and in the same way I think something must be done to ensure that in these built-up areas there are facilities for recreation, namely youth centres or whatever one wants to call them. Some of the churches are acting in this direction, but they carry a heavy burden in so doing because they use expensive land, because no open spaces are available. They use expensive land where they erect some sort of a hall or else they use large old buildings which could be much better utilised. They provide a place where the young people can gather in the evenings and indulge in healthy activities. Cities at the seaside are fortunate in this respect. We have a certain amount of space during the summer season and during good weather. I believe this problem to be even more serious in the cities which are being more and more hemmed in and where more and more people are living in smaller areas of the cities.</p>

<p>I now wish to return to the question of war pensions and I wish to say at the outset that my association with the department and with those who handle these applications has been happy. One is left with a feeling of indebtedness to the officials who deal with the applications in Pretoria. One has a special feeling of gratitude towards those people who serve on the various tribunals. They do not have an easy task. It is not easy when someone comes in with a case, where a person claims to have some disability and they have to decide in a fair and objective way whether the case is deserving of a pension grant. I hope the hon. the Minister will convey to the people concerned how much we appreciate the way in which applications are handled at the head office of the department.</p>

<p>I want to come next to the matter that was raised here concerning the Bantu ex-serviceman. I believe we are boggling at a bogey at the moment.</p>

<p>I think this hon. the Minister is concerned because it is a social matter. I think we are anticipating a bogey far greater than it is. I wish to give the Minister <span class="col_5151-5152" refersTo="#page_1209"/>certain figures. During the First World War 50,000 Bantu, including men from the high commission territories, enlisted in the armed forces, and during the Second World War 78,000 enlisted. I think it would be a fairly accurate estimate to say that 25 per cent of these men were from the high commission territories. That means there were some 37,000 in the First World War and 96,000 all told in both wars. In the light of the experience of the former high commission territories it would appear that the number of Bantu entitled to a war veteran&#x2019;s pension would be something between 3,000 and 4,000.

<p>Mr. Chairman, quite a few pleas were delivered from this side of the House in respect of the chronically ill. I do not want to speak again about matters already raised by hon. members, but this is a matter about which I feel very strongly, because we are all concerned in our constituencies with numerous aged persons who cannot care for themselves and with the chronically ill who cannot be admitted to hospitals. One feels that something should be done for these people and therefore I want to associate myself with the hon. members for Kimberley (District) Westdene and Boksburg, who raised these matters here. I want to plead for the hon. Minister to give this matter his serious attention. These people deserve our attention and we have the fullest confidence that the Minister will do something in this connection. I want to associate myself with those representations made to him.</p>

<p>I listened attentively to the speeches made in this debate and I think that it speaks volumes for the Minister that no unfavourable criticism was expressed here. On the contrary, I am sure that the Minister himself will deal with the few points raised here. Even the matters raised by the Opposition were mentioned without their wanting to criticize the Minister. Nor did we hear the annual pleas which we had from that side in the past.</p>

<p>In South Africa there are 143,247 persons who receive social pensions and the amount involved is R65,574,600. It is indeed a colossal amount. The administrative work connected with this is done so well that even the Opposition, the watchdog, did not have serious criticism in this regard. I think it would be a good thing if we looked back and quoted a few comparative figures. Some members of the public are not fully aware of pension benefits. They are not always aware of the benefits which have been made available to them. I therefore feel that it is necessary to quote a few comparative figures and to bring these matters to the attention of the public. I went back to the year 1948 to see what amount was paid in pensions and social benefits in those days. The maximum amount was R10 per month. A married couple could therefore obtain R20. In 1948 the basic pension was R32. Since 1948 the cost of living has increased by 69 per cent, while basic pensions have increased by 320 per cent. This of course speaks volumes. Four years ago, the total maximum in pensions, including all benefits for a married couple was only R54. To-day the maximum, with the allowance, is R64, and if a person worked and waited four years before applying, he can receive an additional pension of R20. This then affords him a maximum of R84 per month. If persons need the assistance of attendants or such people, they can obtain a further R20 per month in attendant&#x2019;s allowance. This gives a possible total of R104 per month. As I have said, four years ago the maximum amount was R54, and to-day a family can get up to R104 per month. I want to express my sincere thanks to the Minister for that. It is an increase of more than 500 per cent.</p>

<p>I want to go further and mention certain benefits, because the public are not always aware of the benefits to which they may be entitled. The hon. the Minister has announced a certain benefit which will come into force in October, and which will be of particular advantage to the public. I am referring to persons who are already receiving a pension, for example from the Railways. A widow with three children who receives R94 in Railway pension will in terms of the present legislation receive no additional pension. But from October she will receive a pension as well as a bonus for each child, and she will then get R37 extra, which will give her R131 all told. I want to name the cases which will receive maximum benefits. If she has five children in high school, she will receive R59 in bonus, childrens&#x2019; allowance and subsistence allowance, which together with the R94 will afford her R153. After October pensioners will therefore receive up to R153 per month. If the widow works and earns R100 per month, then under present circumstances she will not qualify for an extra pension, but after the 1st October she will, if she has five children at high school, qualify for the maximum allowance.

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the period in which we are living to-day, where man lives so far beyond his income that one can almost say he is living apart from his income, where well-to-do people are not doing their duty towards parents and children in need of care, where man is so geared to the moment that he makes no provision for the morrow; in these days it has become necessary for the State to pay ever greater amounts to an ever greater number of people by means of allowances and pensions. It is doubtful whether this phenomenon is really conducive to the development of the character and pride of South Africans, but that is not the point here.</p>

<p>This Government has always realized and carried out its duty in this connection. Over the years the allowances payable to pensioners and others were increased from time to time and the conditions to which these payments were subject, were also considerably relaxed. Just like the Government, the taxpayer of South Africa is willing to contribute his share <span class="col_5153-5154" refersTo="#page_1210"/>to caring for people who are sick or who do not have the necessary financial means at their disposal. But the taxpayer will object to malpractices in respect of the granting and utilization of these allowances. Unfortunately malpractices do exist to-day, and here I refer in particular to the country districts. I just want to mention a few examples. In the country districts we find that the pensioners, on receiving their pensions, immediately choose the shortest path to the public bars and spend their allowances there, to the detriment of themselves and their dependants. In the country districts there are agents who draw the allowances and pensions on behalf of the non-Whites, and for that they charge a considerable premium. The payment of this premium is also prejudicial to the pensioner and his family. Then there are members of the pensioner&#x2019;s family who do not want to work but who live off the pensions and allowances which their parents or other members of their family receive. They refuse to work because they have a refuge in the pensioner&#x2019;s house.</p>

<p>Some people beget children without the intention or the desire to support those children. They know that the State will not only pay the hospital fees, but also look after their children in other respects if they are in need of care. Just as little as the State can allow children to go hungry, so little can it allow a parent who is physically fit to pass his obligations towards his children onto the State. These malpractices are to be found among the non-Whites in particular. One of the corner-stones of our policy is that there should be as little friction as possible between the various race groups, and this matter must receive attention because it causes discord between Whites and non-Whites in the country districts. People say that they do not want to contribute indirectly towards supporting work-shy persons and others who do not want to meet their obligations in respect of themselves and their families while they are able to do so. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister cordially to consider the re-establishment of local committees in the country districts. These people know the persons living in their vicinity and they know their conditions and circumstances, and they can keep excellent vigilance over the utilization and the granting of pensions. We must also give consideration to the problem of parents who are not prepared to work and to pay for their children. These persons ought to be compelled to work in Government works. I feel that a person who is physically fit, should do his share as regards supporting his children. In my constituency, many of these malpractices occur, and I request that these points of friction be eliminated. As I have said, people feel dissatisfied, because although they are willing to contribute towards the payment of pensions to persons in need of care, they are not prepared to contribute money for the benefit of work-shy persons and persons who refuse to carry out or who do not know their duty.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are one or two matters which I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister in the short space of time left for me. The first matter deals with the representations that have been made on behalf of the physically handicapped. Some of these people may be paraplegics but do not need rehabilitation. Their physical handicap is of such a nature that they do need help to get about. The assistance they require may be the simple matter of helping these people to get out of bed, help them to get dressed and put them into a wheelchair. That may be the sum total of the help they require, but they need that help or else they cannot get out of bed and move about. There are very many of these people. This is the sort of letter one gets, and I have many of them here. This particular letter makes these points. Many of these people live with their parents, enjoying their care and understanding, but this state of affairs could come to an abrupt end at almost any time because of sickness or death of the person who cares for the handicapped individual. This possibility causes such great concern. The question the handicapped people asked themselves is: &#x201C;Where will we go and what will become of us?&#x201D; This question constantly hangs over their heads. They need a place to stay, not a hospital or a rehabilitation centre, but a place where they can live together. There are very many of these people and I would suggest to the Minister that he make a survey in those larger towns where there are many of these people to see how many there are and to try and establish, if it is worthwhile, a little home, a living place for these people so that they can have a minimum amount of care and be able to get about in the way they are used to. Some of them are artists, some are sculptors, and they do many different types of work from their chairs.</p>

<p>There is another matter I wish to refer to, and in regard to which I should like a reply from the hon. the Minister. Under sub-head P there is an item &#x201C;Special grants to Welfare Organizations in connection with the provision of Homes for the aged and infirm.&#x201D; This special grant was introduced by Mr. Serfontein when he was Minister and much play was made of the fact that R250,000 was voted for these people. I see now that R100,000 is to be re-voted. Will the Minister tell us what has happened to the other R150,000? Did welfare organizations make use of it? Was it granted to them? Originally it was going to be given to them for the purpose of buying land and fencing their properties. Will the Minister in his reply please tell us which organizations received this money, how it was spent and how he intends to spend the balance of that money?</p>

<heading>DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT FOR NATIVE NATIONS IN SOUTH WEST AFRICA BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, after the hon. the Minister, so far only the hon. members for Middelland and Omaruru have spoken on behalf of the Government. And they have attempted to justify this measure, with its framework and plan for breaking up South West Africa into a number of mini-states. Sir, they made reasoned speeches, and I think in their speeches they gave a clear picture of the Government&#x2019;s reasoning and indeed of Nationalist interpretation of local and world events of recent times, and I believe they also gave a clear picture of the lessons which hon. members opposite believe one should draw from the events of recent times. I disagree with many of those interpretations and those lessons, and I shall first of all attempt to show that that interpretation and those lessons are unsound and incorrect; and, secondly, I should like to criticize the timing and the terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>I think it is notable that as far as the second aspect is concerned, neither the hon. member for Middelland nor the hon. member for Omaruru had anything to say about it. I am speaking of the timing of this measure and its particular terms. That is so, notwithstanding that this aspect was raised by my hon. Leader in his speech at the very outset.</p>

<p>I think it is agreed between both sides that there were murderous inter-tribal wars in South West Africa before the advent of the white man. That was painted in graphic terms by the hon. member for Middelland, and that refrain was taken up by the hon. member for Omaruru. They both said that with the coming of the white man that picture changed, and indeed it did. Whereas before there were these inter-tribal wars, thereafter we had peace, order and good government. Now I would have thought that that was something to latch on to and to remember most firmly. So, notwithstanding what one might expect, we see that the framework of this Bill provides for a withdrawal of the white man&#x2019;s influence, and we feel that we must most strongly warn against this. I cannot see what reason there is for expecting that there should be piping peace when that influence is withdrawn. The hon. member for Middelland gave one reason. He said that the difference between former times and now is that now they would each have their own definite area. [Interjection.] He confirms that that is what he said. I do not concede that initially they did not have their own areas substantially, but assuming that they did not have their own areas substantially, surely we cannot take any comfort from the fact that they will now have their own areas. Does he forget the history of Europe? Does he forget that the nation states of Europe have thrown us into two of the bloodiest wars in history? All those states, Germany, France and others which participated, had their own territory, but this did not prevent them from becoming involved in the most convulsive wars.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says there will always be wars, even in the Western world. He based his hope for a different future for those territories on this aspect that they would apparently have their own areas. I do not concede that that is entirely so by any means, in terms of the Nationalist plan, but even if it were so, there is no justification for his statement whatsoever. Indeed, it is as the narrow Nationalism of Europe has yielded to a broader co-operation, with the European Common Market and the political developments flowing from that, that we are perhaps entering upon a more hopeful time there.</p>

<p>I would have thought also that the hon. member, with the recent war in Israel so fresh in his mind, would not have had the confidence to say that having separate territorial areas for states makes so much difference. After all, we have now had three wars between Israel and the Arab states, and a former Israeli Prime Minister said recently that we must assume that there will be continual war between these various states. I would have thought the other examples in the world, like India, could be cited to show that there will be no reason for confidence based on the fact that there will be a certain area allotted to these countries.</p>

<p>Take our own experience here in South Africa. We know before the coming of the white man there were many internecine tribal wars and they ended after the white man arrived. We remember that where there was the sharpest territorial division between the White and non-Whites was the very place where we had wars between them. The various Kaffir wars were fought on the very border between the Whites and the non-Whites. Therefore I cannot see how hon. members opposite can say that the designation of areas will result in peace.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland also said that different ethnic groups cannot inhabit the same territory without hostility between them, and the hon. member for Omaruru rather took the same line and said you cannot have a central government of different groups. I want to suggest again that those statements fly in the face of historical facts. In South West <span class="col_5157-5158" refersTo="#page_1212"/>Africa under the leadership and guidance of the white man these different ethnic groups, which we are told cannot possibly live together, have in fact lived together in amity since the white man came there. We have many ethnic groups living in the Republic itself and they have lived here for a very long time in perfect amity. Hon. members opposite want to suggest that this cannot be done. Indeed, many members of the party opposite hold the view that the Afrikaner and the English-speaking peoples of this country are two separate &#x201C;volke&#x201D;. But these people, who could be referred to as of potential separate Nationalisms, have lived in this country in amity, notwithstanding the most unfortunate war which took place in South Africa at the beginning of this century. They have lived in amity ever since and that too disproves the theory of the hon. gentlemen opposite.</p>

<p>We have a similar situation in Switzerland. There the Germans, the French, the Swiss and the Italians are living in amity in one country with one central government. We also have this harmony among the Belgians, where we have the French-speaking and the Flemish-speaking Belgians living in one country. Hon. members opposite may say, &#x201C;Ah, but they have been having their little troubles there.&#x201D; That may be. They have had their few little riots, no larger than what has been taking place in Paris itself over the past few days. They may have had a riot or two in those countries, but the trouble cannot be compared to the situation where nations go to war and move over each other&#x2019;s boundaries. We find the same position in Canada, where there are two entirely different ethnic groups living in amity. They have also had little troubles, but they are minor ones compared to what takes place when nations wage war. Then there is Yugoslavia with its Croats and its Serbs and other minority groups. We have Czechoslovakia with its Czechs and Slovenes. These are all different ethnic groups living in complete amity, certainly greater amity than most nations have been able to maintain. I think the same is true of many South American states. In India, too, we find countless different ethnic groups, and, as my hon. Leader indicated, it would be ridiculous to attempt to give independence to each one of these small groups.</p>

<p>I think the hon. members for Middelland and Omaruru both pointed to Nigeria and said, &#x201C;Ah, there you are, there is an example of our proposition that different groups cannot live together.&#x201D; But I would in the first place remind hon. members opposite that Nigeria with all its different ethnic groups had perfect harmony within its borders whilst the British were in control and maintained their leadership there. The trouble only started when that was removed.</p>

<p>I wish to stress that trouble arose there and in other places when the hand of the white man was withdrawn, and this is exactly what hon. members opposite are proposing to do in South West Africa. The very same thing happened in the Congo. All the different groups were living in amity there until the white man&#x2019;s hand was withdrawn and then all the trouble started. The hon. member for Middelland cites the Central African Federation. I know it is the habit of hon. members opposite to take comfort from the events in Rhodesia to bolster their approach and theory.</p>

<p>But the various groups were co-operating quite well in the Federation whilst there was the leadership of the Whites, but Britain, who had the power to do so, removed that leadership. As a result of that we have had the break-up of the Federation. We on this side certainly do not follow the policies of the Rhodesian Government in regard to race relations, but the fact is that to-day we have various ethnic groups living in one country under one central government. Therefore I want to indicate that there are countless examples in our contemporary history where you have different groups co-operating in one territory and in one government. In addition you have a second class where they are doing so under the hand and leadership of the Whites.</p>

<p>I am not now arguing the rights and wrongs of the British withdrawal from Nigeria or the Belgian withdrawal from the Congo. Those were entirely black countries. But South West Africa is an entirely different proposition. We have a solemn duty to promote to the utmost the material and moral wellbeing and the social progress of the inhabitants there. This is a duty we have. I suggest that one can see clearly that that cannot be adequately promoted if the white hand is withdrawn. The hon. member for Omaruru and other hon. members opposite indicated that there was such great enmity among the tribes there. Surely it could not possibly be to their advantage if we were to revert to that situation. This alone would justify the pursuance of the spirit of the mandate in that respect. One can see also that it would not promote to the maximum their material benefit if the economy of the whole country were broken down by the creation of different states. It is therefore necessary to maintain this leadership there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru says that the United Nations say that we must give self-determination to these people or nations. My answer is that we have a duty to promote their wellbeing in every respect. This is also a country <span class="col_5159-5160" refersTo="#page_1213"/>of many groups, including the white group. The white group there must not be forgotten. Therefore I say that it must not be what the United Nations tells us to do there but what our own conscience dictates that we should do.</p>

<p>Finally, it was either the hon. member for Omaruru or the hon. member for Middelland who said that these new independent states that we wish to create there are bound to be friendly towards us as we will have given them their independence.</p>

<p>That might have been so in a perfect world but this is not a perfect world. There are all kinds of sharks and wolves in red and other clothing that are moving about this world attempting to poison the minds of people in order to achieve their own ends. We have had so many examples of that in Africa that one hardly needs to multiply them. I would say indeed that such mini-states in such a rough and unfriendly world, would very easily come under their influence, if they had the full independence which is to be promised them.</p>

<p>I should now like to move to the second part of the Bill and touch upon the timing of this measure as well as the language of this Bill, which I must say, with regret, seems to me to have provocative elements in it. It is still not too late for us not to pursue this particular measure. I do sincerely hope that hon. members opposite will consider closely the timing of this measure before us.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. O. N. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think that it is perfect. I am indeed astonished that the Government should introduce a Bill in these terms at this time in our history. I am very surprised to learn that the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs apparently agrees with this. I suggest that this puts in jeopardy the improvement in our position which was won in the South West Africa case at the International Court. What have we had since that time? In their frustration and anger, we have had political attacks upon us, because of South West Africa. Neither we ourselves, nor the major powers who can influence affairs, have been concerned about countering such moves. It seems to me that we are opening a door to a new legal attack upon us. I do believe that we are definitely opening the door to a possible new legal assault upon our position. It is clear that South West Africa, the mandated territory, is being broken up. The states are to move to sovereign independence. This is clear from the Bill. Each of the groups mentioned is to have exclusive use and occupation of a contrary to what must originally have been contemplated there.</p>

<p>My hon. Leader mentioned, but I feel that it must be said again, that at the time of the South West Africa case the hon. late Prime Minister had set in motion through actions in the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa, steps in the direction of this Bill. But he suddenly stopped these moves. I believe he did so because it was made clear to him that there were appreciable legal risks involved. Unfortunately this matter is now being pursued. So, Mr. Speaker, I believe that our enemies could seize upon the Bill as perhaps changing the position in South West Africa, and they could approach the court again. The composition of this court is continually changing. We have to face the fact that our victory last time was by the narrowest of majorities. Then we will have the position, if we were to get a judgment unfavourable to us, that there are certain states whose policy it is to uphold the United Nations and all its organs. They are then placed in a very difficult position. Are they going to remain with us in the sense of taking it no further, and thereby see one of the organs of the United Nations, its International Court, treated perhaps with contempt, or are they going, however reluctantly, perhaps to feel they must maintain the authority of the United Nations?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with great respect, I will not, of course, follow the interjection, but I am sure that you would want me to make it plain that the timing of this measure could have very serious implications. We of the Opposition have a duty to warn the Government here. If there are good reasons why this timing is right, let us hear them. Certainly we were given no opportunity at any prior stage to know what they were. Indeed, I believe that the average member of the United Nations, and this perhaps includes most of the young ones, will possibly view this measure with a certain degree of apoplexy. One realizes that the Government most probably have considered this aspect, and one is driven to thinking they may be taking a calculated risk. What is the need for taking a risk? The actual degree of self-government given here is not stated, but one can assume that it will not go a very long way. Why, therefore, was it necessary to have in this Bill a framework indicating how far the position could go? These various aspects could quite easily be omitted from the Bill, <span class="col_5161-5162" refersTo="#page_1214"/>and should have been omitted. In addition this measure will undoubtedly speed the move to independence in these territories. A few of us were privileged to go to South West Africa and to see the peoples in certain of the northern territories. This was a very valuable opportunity to inform oneself. But, with great respect to all concerned, one came back with the impression that these were people living a very simply nomadic life, and that they would not have the faintest idea of the implications of modern government. One can, therefore, not help feeling that this measure is unrealistic and that it would be unwise to press and foist extra powers&#x2014;powers far beyond their requirements or wishes&#x2014;upon them. For all these reasons, and many others, we still hope that the Government may take a different view in regard to the precise terms of this measure. We therefore oppose this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, all three speeches made so far from that side of the House about this measure referred to the so-called &#x201C;breaking up of South West Africa into mini-states&#x201D;. But what we had from them were mini speeches, and of all these the speech to which we have just listened was the miniest. We felt very sorry for the hon. member for Pinelands this afternoon, because he struggled to get through his speech. We know why he struggled with it&#x2014;it was because they do not have a case. If there is one member opposite who knows that they do not have a case, it is the hon. member for Pinelands. I want to congratulate that hon. member on the fact that, in contrast with the other two speeches we have had&#x2014;the speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and that by the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;he at least, although the Opposition does not have a case, delivered a responsible speech. We are grateful to him for that. However, we cannot say the same for the other two mini speeches; in fact, they were not even mini, but &#x201C;topless&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to deal with only one aspect of the speech made by the hon. member for Pinelands, and that is the question of timing to which he referred. The other two gentlemen also referred to it. The hon. member says that our timing is wrong. What is the implication when they come along with the statement that our timing is wrong? This is typical of the United Party. They want us to yield to pressure from outside and if we do so, then our timing will not be wrong. That is the point. We refuse to yield to pressure from outside, as opposed to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does. We say that there is only one criterion which we can apply in respect of South West Africa, and that criterion is what is right and what is in the interests of the order, quiet, peace and prosperity of each population group in South West Africa. That is our criterion, and therefore our timing is correct, in that it is in the interests of these people to initiate this development at this juncture, as we are in fact doing there. We refuse to yield to pressure from outside. The hon. Opposition asked why the timing was not right at an earlier stage, but they should bear in mind that there was a court case and that the matter was <i>sub judice</i> at the time.</p>

<p>What amazes me about the United Party is that they are really as useless as we say they are. This is proved by the speeches of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast. Before I came to this House, I often wondered why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and in particular the hon. member for South Coast, were always in trouble. However, now that I am here I am beginning to understand. This is demonstrated very clearly by particularly these two speeches made by these hon. gentlemen, as I shall indicate. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, <i>inter alia</i>, &#x201C;Sir, can we in all honesty describe any of the groups in South West Africa, with the possible exception of the Ovambo group, as being separate nations?&#x201D; I just want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a straightforward question now. Does he regard the Herero as a nation or not? If he does not regard the Herero as a nation, because in terms of his definition he says that the Herero are not a nation, I want to ask him to go to South West Africa and say to the Herero that the United Party do not regard them as a nation. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition betrays basic ignorance, which one does not expect of someone in his position. I want to read to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition from a book by Professor Bruwer, an authority on South West Africa. He says, &#x201C;Some two centuries after the advent of the Ovambo and the Okavango peoples, another group of Bantu people migrated to this part of Africa. They were the Herero, a pastoral people, who did not practise agriculture, and were ethnically of totally different stock.&#x201D; There is an abundance of scientific evidence that the Herero are a completely different nation and people to the Ovambo. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, however, is so irresponsible as not to try to understand the basic concepts of these ethnological matters and then to stand up here and say that he regards the Ovambo people as a nation, but not the others. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he, in terms of his definition and policy of above and below the red line, would say that the Xhosa people were a nation, but not the Zulu and the Sotho? This is an analogous case. One could advise the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to take a first-year course in ethnology at the University of Stellenbosch. I can very strongly recommend the University of Stellenbosch to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Then there are also the Dama people in South West Africa. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition know that the Dama people do not even speak a Bantu language? They speak a Khoi language, a Hottentot language. <span class="col_5163-5164" refersTo="#page_1215"/>Does he want to lump these people together with the Herero? If he does not regard them as a nation, will he go and tell them that he does not regard them as a nation? I am of the opinion that ethnologists who have taken note of the speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will have a good laugh at the hon. Opposition. I think that every student in South Africa will laugh at the hon. Opposition when it asks in a theatrical way here whether we regard those people as nations or not. The Herero, for example, pursued the Dama for years and &#x201C;dispersed&#x201D; them, which is the term used in most books. Throughout the years they waged war against the Dama. The hon. member for Pinelands also says with the same eloquence how peaceful matters were in South West Africa. Surely this does not accord with the facts at all. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, for example, denies that this is the situation. This is what we inherited, as the hon. member for Middelland indicated very clearly here. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition really want to lump these people together like a Canute of old and then think that he will be able to maintain peace in this area? This is too childishly na&#x00EF;ve for words. It seems to me as if the Opposition has an obsession for integration, because they are forever wanting to lump everything together and thinking that they can maintain peace and order in that way. One feels sorry for the hon. member for South Coast, because he is trying terribly hard to get rid of this integration bug which is clinging to the United Party. However, it is the warp and woof of the United Party&#x2019;s policy and they cannot get away from it. Their speeches in this connection once again display this same disease in the United Party. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked, &#x201C;When does one acquire the right to self-determination?&#x201D;, as if he were making a very important point. As if he were making a terribly important point, he asked, &#x201C;How big a group must one be to become a nation?&#x201D; And then he asked, in the same way, &#x201C;What characteristics must one have to have the right of self-determination?&#x201D; Here again the hon. the Leader of the Opposition betrayed a basic ignorance, as I shall now indicate to you, Sir, which one would not expect of a man in his position. He does not know the history of his own country. [Interjections.] Sir, the Opposition knows that the blast is going to come now, and they will get it.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to know how large a group must be and what characteristics it must have before it can obtain the right to self-determination, will he tell us how many Afrikaners were self-determined and demanded the right to self-determination for themselves in this country at the time of the Great Trek in 1834? I shall tell him how many they were. Walker, in his book &#x201C;History of the Great Trek&#x201D;, indicates that in that entire decade of the eighteen-thirties they did not even number 14,000. The &#x201C;Kernensiklopedie&#x201D; states that there were 10,000, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to know, &#x201C;How big a group must it be?&#x201D; before one can regard it as a nation. What stupidity! And then he wants to know what characteristics a nation must possess before it can obtain the right to self-determination. The United Party is really displaying its lack of character by asking these questions here in all seriousness and then thinking that they are making a tremendously important point in asking these questions. When the Voortrekkers trekked away from here in 1836, they were far fewer in number than the smallest group now being discussed under this Bill, but he wants to know, &#x201C;How big a group must it be?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, I want to go much further on this point. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to know how big a group must be before it can obtain the right to self-determination, then, because one finds small nations and large nations, and if he wants to create the impression in this House that a group must consist of a certain number before it can be regarded as a nation and before it can obtain the right to self-determination, then surely he is denying and negating the concept of small nations. Then surely he will argue just now that our nation, which only consists of 3&#x00BC; million people, is not a nation, but that the Chinese, who number 700 million, are a nation. That is the position in terms of his definition of a nation. I honestly think that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should not only take a first-year course in ethnology at Stellenbosch, but should also take a course in history there, because then he will learn that a nation can be small but can at the same time be powerful and strong and big-hearted. Numbers have nothing to do with the matter. There are nations with seats at the UNO which consist of 80,000 people. Gambia consists of a population of a little more than 80,000. But the Leader of the Opposition in this House wants to know how large a group must be before you can regard that group as a nation. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to know, &#x201C;When does one acquire the right to self-determination?&#x201D; then I shall just refer him once more to the history of his own nation. All that you need is a will; all that you need is a common language; all that you need is a common culture; all that you need is a territory, and all that you need in addition is a group consciousness. These theoretical matters which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised here, therefore, do not hold water at all. Surely the history of Africa in recent years has provided abundant proof of the fact that nations simply move in the direction of independence and the right of self-determination does the whole world take cognisance of that, but the whole world is deeply aware of the tion and that no one can stop it. Not only necessity and importance of it and of planning in that direction, but somewhere in the world you find an insignificant Opposition which is either too dense or too clever to <span class="col_5165-5166" refersTo="#page_1216"/>grasp this basic concept. That is why the hon. member for Pinelands could not make a speech here this afternoon, because he is at least a responsible member and he knows that he does not have a case.</p>

<p>I want to go further and refer to one of the authorities which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself quoted, apparently without knowing what he was quoting. One of the authorities which he quoted states explicitly what I have just tried to tell him here. That authority which he quoted, states: &#x201C;Who can say the nations nay and yet who can say what nations are and when and how they may assert themselves?&#x201D;</p>

<p>His own authority which he quoted confirms what I have just said here, but he quotes that authority as if he wanted to use him to prove his point. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to use this statement as the corner-stone of his charge against us, then, surely, he is telling us that we are right in our actions and that we are following the right road in preparing these people for the day when the nations of South West Africa may be ready for the right to self-determination. Then, surely, we are providing the right guidance in preparing them for that and by being prepared for it ourselves when it comes, because if we are not prepared for it, if it should come, then we will surely have chaos in South West Africa. Therefore one thanks heaven that the Opposition are not governing and that the Opposition are not in a position to handle these matters, because one would be amazed at what they would have committed. We know, precisely because they have again come along with the aspect of &#x201C;timing&#x201D;, that in connection with this matter the Opposition have once again betrayed their old characteristic; in other words, they would have done nothing about the matter; there is a better word for it, but I think Mr. Speaker would call me to order if I used it. They would have done nothing about the matter, because it has always been typical of them to let things slide. That is what they wanted in this case as well and that is why they come along with these accusations.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">P. G. J. KOORNHOF</person>:</from>

<p>After the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had given this theoretical exposition which does not hold water at all, he made this incredible statement in his speech; he made a complete backward somersault and came up with the statement&#x2014; and the hon. member for South Coast did the same thing here&#x2014;&#x201C;What the Bill sets out is not of great importance&#x201D;. Then the hon. member for South Coast came along and said, &#x201C;This Bill is an empty husk because there is nothing in it&#x201D;. But in the meantime they had raised the devil about the wretchedness of this Bill. Why? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went as far as to say. &#x2018;The State President can, of course, take away again all the powers he grants. He has that power. He, advised by the Cabinet, is the virtual dictator as to what powers shall be given to these councils, how far they develop and what powers should be taken away from them. I concede at once that this Bill does not grant independence&#x201D;. But while conceding all this, he comes along and sets up skittles which he then knocks down one after another. If one makes a careful analysis of the speeches made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast, then it is very clear what they were busy doing here; they were indulging in the cheapest, most reprehensible politicking imaginable. They do not care one jot whether that politicking is in the interests of the people of South West Africa or in the interests of the people of South Africa; they do not care a jot whether they harm South Africa by it and how it would harm South Africa. Sir, it is when this sort of thing happens that one really becomes angry at the United Party, because that is when they become irresponsible.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say this, but if one looks at the speeches by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast, then you cannot escape from the impression which we have had for a long time, i.e. that at the back of their minds the United Party have the idea that interference from outside will afford them the chance of getting into power here in South Africa. There is no other logical explanation for their actions. I am saying this with the fullest responsibility. Let hon. members go and read the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition; then they will see for themselves. Why do they make such irresponsible speeches as those two gentlemen made here. That is why I say they are an irresponsible Opposition and that is why the people of South Africa will not forgive them for these things which they are doing to our country.</p>

<p>But then we come to the most poisonous piece of politicking in the speech by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill does not apply to the Whites in South West Africa. It seems to be regarded as unnecessary for them to develop to independence or to have a right to self-determination.</block>

<p><span class="col_5167-5168" refersTo="#page_1217"/>I now want to look the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the eye and ask him this straightforward question. Does he believe this nonsense which he uttered here? Does he want to make the people of South West Africa and the people of South Africa believe that this Government is granting the Bantu the opportunity of developing along the road to self-determination, but that the Government is denying it to the Whites? Because that is what he said.</p>

<p>I have read it carefully, but I want to say this to the hon. the Leader. I am very young and I regret to say this, but I have never heard such nonsense from a man in his position. Surely it goes without saying that the Whites in South West have self-determination. Why should it then be laid down somewhere? It does not befit the hon. the Leader to make such statements to the people of South Africa and to the outside world.</p>

<p>But then the Leader of the Opposition came along and towards the end of his speech spoke of the dangers to South Africa inherent in this Bill. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are severing our lines of communication.</block>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast also fretted about the dangers connected with these so-called independent states next to Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Rhodesia. I now want to ask those two hon. members this. On the one hand they say, and they tell the world, that this Bill means nothing, because the State President has all the powers; he can delegate powers and he can take them away, and he has the Cabinet behind him. But in the same breath they talk about these dangers. Surely this is senseless. That is why we ask: Why do they do it? Are they doing it for South Africa&#x2019;s edification? Surely they can only be doing it for the edification of UNO, and that is what we blame them for, and that is why we knew that the hon. member for Pinelands would make a responsible speech here, I expect that the hon. member for Transkei and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will do the same, but these two gentlemen, the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast, with all due respect, did not know what they were talking about. They only wanted to indulge in politicking, to besmirch South Africa&#x2019;s name, the devil take the consequences, and their speeches prove it. Read the speech, then you will see for yourselves. I therefore say that they are really flagrantly irresponsible in their actions. Listen to this ridiculousness, and both those hon. members referred to it: The Leader of the Opposition spoke theatrically about the oil in Angola and about the vacuum which is developing in the Indian Ocean, and do you know with what foolish statement he then came to light? He said that our Government was giving the Ovambo independence, but in the same breath he said that we were not doing so, because the State President still had all the power in his hands. He said that a vacuum was developing in the Indian Ocean and that the only place from which we would be able to obtain oil, would be from Angola, because under those circumstances the Russians would cut off our oil from the Middle East, but that we ourselves were now severing the only line of communication that would then remain by giving the Ovambo independence. What utter nonsense! I think the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast put a nail into the United Party coffin with these speeches. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I want to go still further. Do you know what motivation the Leader of the Opposition used for these stories about a vacuum and oil? It is childishly na&#x00EF;ve, but he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When primitive people are promised independence in the future, they tend to think it means to-morrow or the next day.</block>

<p>But he himself said that the State President had all the powers. He could take and he could give.</p>

<p>This is not what one expects from the Leader of the Opposition. I just want to say that since he runs with the hare and hunts with the hounds in this way in connection with an important matter, with his stories of &#x201C;timing&#x201D;, and so on, if I were sitting on those benches, I really would not have been proud of the hon. the Leader. I want to say this and I say it calculatedly. I wish the day would rather come when we could really accuse the hon. the Leader of the Opposition of being a wolf in sheep&#x2019;s clothing, because that would be much better. You know, Churchill on occasion said to Attlee that he, was a sheep in sheep&#x2019;s clothing. But then comes the real sting in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition. Referring to the World Court&#x2019;s decision of 1950, he said that the Court had found that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South West Africa has a peculiar international status which cannot be unilaterally changed by the Republic of South Africa. When you develop states to independence within the Territory of South West Africa, it is implicit that you change its international status.</block>

<p>Now I want to ask him again, is he saying this for our edification in South Africa? Surely that is not true. Surely we have nothing to do with that. He is saying it for the edification of UNO, is he not? It is irresponsible. Then they have the temerity to speak of &#x201C;timing&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_5169-5170" refersTo="#page_1218"/>I must hurry. I want to come to the hon. member for South Coast. Oh, if I had the time, I would really have taken him to task! The hon. member for South Coast is the man who described this Bill as &#x201C;the Bill that should never have been&#x201D;. That is typical of him. After all, he is the man who said that blood would flow about the establishment of the Republic of South Africa. He is the man &#x201C;who felt like saying yes to the rebellion&#x201D;; when they asked him &#x201C;whether he intended to lead the rebellion against the Republic&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;I felt like saying: Yes, I am.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I quote from <i>Die Burger:</i> &#x201C;Banana Rebellion in Natal: Mitchell talks strangely.&#x201D; He is the man who said: &#x201C;This is the Bill which should never have been.&#x201D; But I shall quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No province deserves what Natal has had to endure at the hands of its politicians down the years. Now feeling foolish, fearful and frustrated, it is having to face the fate it has been persuaded is far worse than death &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was written on 2nd February, 1961&#x2014;</p>

He must pardon us, but we do not take the wild assertions which he made during this debate about this Bill, seriously, because we cannot do so. What we are doing with this measure is this. We are only building on the existing systems in South West Africa, systems which we are expanding, which we are developing, systems which are very well known to those people&#x2014;everyone and every group of them. Therefore we believe that new systems should not be forced upon those people, because they will never work in practice. Consequently we are now, in good time and at the right time, when it is in the interests of these people, providing for existing systems to be developed and modernized and for allowing higher governing bodies to be established properly, due regard being had to prevailing circumstances and the wishes of each member of each group. This is an evolutionary process and it can happen that a specific group accepts a system of government recommended for it by the Odendaal Commission from the beginning or in the course of time, or the group concerned may find that for practical reasons it would rather accept another system. This is a matter about which each group must decide for itself. Surely this is a basically sound philosophy, basically sound politics, scientifically based politics, practicable, and the only acceptable position for all the various population groups of South West Africa. It will bring them order, quiet, peace and prosperity. The proof of this is that we have that order, that quiet, that peace, and it is an example to the entire world and to UNO as well. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast tried to use the floor of this House to oblige those people to the detriment of their own country, their own nation, and South West Africa. We think that the nation will never forgive them for this.</p>

<p>The hon. member is the perfect example of the wisdom of what the hon. member for South Coast said when he said this Bill should never have been, and he is absolutely right. We heard from the hon. the Prime Minister that he is pleased when we have a bipartisan, a common approach to our problems in the field of foreign affairs. My hon. Leader said, when he started off this debate, and in this he was followed by the hon. member for South Coast, that this Bill was introduced without there having been any consultation with this side of the House. [Interjections.] When we complain hon. members opposite criticize us became we say across the floor of the House what objections we have to the Bill. What must we do? What do they expect us to do? To sit still and saying nothing whatever? [Interjections.] Is that what they expect? The offer has been made by my hon. Leader time and time again that when it comes to matters which affect South Africa, especially those matters relating to foreign policy, we should like a bipartisan approach, we should like to be consulted. We have some thoughts on the matter. But this is not the place for those matters to be debated. They should have been debated elsewhere. But having brought them here, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to keep quiet? The hon. member for Primrose has not in fact dealt with the Bill at all, he has not dealt with one bit of the Bill. All the hon. member did was to state some <span class="col_5171-5172" refersTo="#page_1219"/>woolly conclusions. If he wonders how the debate in this House is going to look to the outside world, I must say the hon. member&#x2019;s contribution is going to bring some disgrace to the dignity of this House. What does the hon. member say? He says we on this side are just making speeches to try and help people who are against us at the U.N.O. What a disgraceful thing to say! [Interjections.] This is precisely what we are trying to avoid. If this Bill is passed in its present form we are going to place sticks in the hands of our enemies, and we wish to avoid that.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and said the United Party wants interference from outside because that is the only way it is going to upset this Government. What a disgraceful thing for anyone to say. And it comes from that side of the House!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Primrose, if I may answer some of his arguments, said our attitude was we wanted to give in to pressures from outside South Africa, and then we would not have any more trouble. But that is precisely what we want to avoid. There is something which is called wisdom that one must employ when dealing with the outside world. What is the hurry? As the hon. member for South Coast asked, why now? Surely we do not need any more troubles and difficulties, we do not want to invite more troubles and difficulties now? I do not think the hon. member has read the Bill, but I want to ask him whether he thinks that what is required in the immediate future in these troubled times could not be done in terms of section 38 of the South West African Constitution Act? The section says that &#x201C;The State President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> and in the official <i>Gazette</i> make laws for the Territory in relation to any matter in regard to which the Assembly may not in terms of section 22 make ordinances&#x201D;. Those matters are Bantu Affairs or any matters specially affecting Bantu, including the imposition of taxation upon the persons, land, habitation, and earnings of Bantu, and so on. Surely at this initial stage whatever the hon. the Minister has in mind could have been done under that section. Surely, and even if the hon. member for Primrose seems to concede this, this independence is not to take place immediately. Surely there is an awful lot to be done? Why come now with a Bill of this sort stating the ultimate aim at this stage without any consultation whatsoever? The fact of the matter is that there is not one single matter that this Government, that this Nationalist Party can deal with which it does not treat as a party political matter. It has no sense whatsoever as to what is good for South Africa as a nation. If it did it would surely take the preliminary step of trying to speak from strength with the Opposition behind it regarding whatever plans it has for South West Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and talked about these &#x201C;klein nasies&#x201D;. Then he made a strange analogy and said that that meant that we with a population of 3&#x00BD; million are not as big a nation as China with her 700,000,000. [Interjection.] No, he did not say that. One has to determine when one has the right to become a nation. When does one have the right to become a nation? How can anyone pretend to be a nation? I shall come back to this point and deal with the relevant figures. If one of these groups, such as the Kaokovelders with 10,000 people, can become a nation and have independence, then I should like to know why the Indians in South Africa with 500,000 people cannot become a nation and why not the Coloureds with 1&#x00BD; million people. This is the kind of nonsense the hon. member speaks. I shall return to that very point. As the debate progresses we see that this is indeed a Bill which, as the hon. member for South Coast said, should never have been. Emerson whom the hon. member for Primrose quoted, asks whether the good of the world is promoted by the multiplication of weak and perhaps irresponsible states.</p>

<p>Yes, I am also now quoting from Emerson. That is the question <span class="col_5173-5174" refersTo="#page_1220"/>he poses. It is a very good question. Is the good of the world promoted by a multiplication of weak and perhaps irresponsible states? Surely the same applies to us here. When one remembers all the things that were said on that side of the House about the creation of black states to the north of us, and then considers what is in this Bill, then one finds difficulty in appreciating just what the philosophy is in regard to South West Africa. Surely this is even more true of us in South Africa. By this Bill it is planned to do exactly the same, but with smaller nations than the world has ever seen, if they are to be nations. The hon. member must not shake his head. Where is there a nation of 10,000 people in the world? Where is there a nation of 20,000 or 40,000 people in the world? There are all sorts of things that worry one about this measure. In 1958 the Good Offices Committee was appointed and came to South Africa. It consisted of Great Britain, the United States of America and Brazil under the chairmanship of Sir Charles Arderne Clark. They put forward a solution in the form of some kind of partition as a basis upon which some agreement could be reached with the Government of the Union at that time. They put it forward on that basis and it was rejected by the Assembly. It was rejected and a counter suggestion was made. The basis of this recommendation was that some northern part would fall under a trusteeship agreement and that the southern part should be incorporated with South Africa. That was also rejected. They tried again. The mandate then was that there should be no partition and obviously no incorporation of any part of the territory. If partition might have been a basis for agreement then&#x2014;and one wonders what is exactly behind all this&#x2014;then the circumstances have changed completely at the present time. I think the hon. member for South Coast dealt with that very adequately.</p>

<p>Of course they are not getting it now. Anyone who has read the Bill will appreciate that they are not getting it now. When he introduced the Bill the hon. the Minister said that this Bill does not make provision for independence. There will have to be separate legislation. My hon. Leader confirmed that that was the case. The intention of the Bill is stated in the preamble:</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is desirable that the native nations in the territory of South West Africa should in the realization of their right of self-determination develop in an orderly manner to self-governing nations and independence:</block>

<p>What does that mean? It means what it says and that is the intention of this Government. The White Paper also bears it out. In the White Paper there is talk of this being an irrevocable step in this direction. Another thing that worries me about this Bill is that it is, by the same token as far as that area is concerned, the end of any negotiated incorporation of those territories in South Africa. Is that the intention? Is that what they want? I would have hoped that we would never have abandoned the thought that we might have a negotiated incorporation of the territory of South West Africa. Why is this now abandoned by this Government in respect of those territories? The fact is that it is abandoned. It is abandoned if this means anything at all?</p>

<p><span class="col_5175-5176" refersTo="#page_1221"/>That is the fact of the matter and my hon. friend opposite nods in agreement. That is the tragedy of this Bill. That is true of the international forum in New York at any rate. Whether they are right or wrong is not the point. The fact of the matter is that that is what they do. Here we have the tragedy that we have a Bill before us now which has all sorts of national and international implications and all are now being given the wings of South African party politics. We do not deserve this. We do not deserve to have this kind of attitude against us. Do you realize, Sir, that what this Bill does in effect is to apply to South West Africa the very policy of this country which people overseas want to talk about. Does that help? Let me say that I do not think that it is necessary in relation to South West Africa that you have to, if you are the Government, apply your own policy every inch of the way. You do not have to. The situation is quite different. It is quite a different country and the circumstances are quite different there.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. I do not have time to read all that I wanted to read, but I want to refer once again to Emerson. Emerson deals with self-determination in plural societies. He deals with the difficulties that there are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The coming of nationalism to a society which is politically united but made up of communities divided from each other by race, language, religion, or historical development often works to produce very much the same effects, emphasizing inner cleavages and setting one community against the other.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to deal with the situation of the Jews and Arabs in Palestine, and the Moslems and Hindus in India, and the difficulties they had, one with the other, each laying claim to a piece of land or to certain rights, ending up with the only solution, which is trial by battle. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is basically at stake is the control of the State which will itself thenceforth direct and control the lives of those within it. In a state composed of diverse and perhaps hostile peoples, this question must be translated in simple language to read: who rules whom?</block>

<p>Now I am going to come to the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s point. He goes on, having dealt with this difficulty, to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crux of the matter in a plural society is that it is not one people which is determining itself, but two or more, and it should not be ignored that the United Nations Charter speaks in the same breath of self-determination and of the equal rights of peoples. If they are actually to be equal, then the subordination of one to another is evidently ruled out. As the international system has been built around the doctrine of the sovereign equality of states, so likewise nations assert themselves as separate and ultimate entities which cannot legitimately be subjected, particularly in the great issue of independence or state allegiance, to the actions of majorities which they regard as alien.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, the Government recognizes this. I presume the answer is going to be that they recognize that this is one of their difficulties and that, in fact, what they are therefore going to do, is to avoid there being any competition for control by one group over another in that state. And so what will they do? They will say: We will create separate states.</p>

I think it is quite clear, if one reads Emerson, that his <span class="col_5177-5178" refersTo="#page_1222"/>concept of what a nation is, is not a group of people in the Kaokoveld, called the Kaokovelders, with 10,500 people. Nor is it the Eastern Caprivians, with 17,900 people. Nor is it the Okavangos with 31,500 people, nor the Hereros with 40,000 people, nor the Damaras with 50,000 people.</p>

<p>Emerson asks the question: When is one entitled to ask for nationhood? What is a nation in that sense, Sir? It is certainly not one of these groups that are to be given independence. If there is a plural society, there is one inescapable fact, and particularly is this so in South West Africa. If there is a plural society, and one wants to overcome one group dominating another group, then we have to have a federal link between all those various groups. There is no other basis upon which it can be done. If there is no federal link and federal elements in that society made up of the members of that society, the distinct different ethnic groups in that society, then there is no other way of avoiding the one group dominating the other group. Then one must have a further federal link with the Republic of South Africa, so far as this is concerned, because only in that way can one ensure that there will be no fighting, that they will not be at each other&#x2019;s throats and that all the history that we have heard from that side of the House will not repeat itself.

Because, although this is the stated intention, in fact everything that has been built up can be knocked down again by proclamation. I think we are entitled to say: If you are leading people to independence, you lead them there in stages, and the stages that you have reached, you may not go back on. Surely, that is true.

<p>That brings me to my last point, namely that there is a most objectionable feature of this Bill, which is that Parliament is not only excluded altogether, because this is to be done entirely by proclamation, but it is deliberately affronted. If you look at clause 18, which amends section 38 of the South West Africa Constitution you will see what I mean. The law at the moment is that a proclamation issued by the State President, in effect by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, shall apply in the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel only inasmuch as it is not repugnant to an Act of Parliament. That has been taken right out. Now, although an Act of Parliament is passed and in the Act of Parliament it is stated that it shall apply in the Eastern Caprivi Zipfel, this clause gives to the Executive the power, despite what Parliament&#x2019;s wishes and commands are, to ignore Parliament altogether and do something else by proclamation. I think we have reached a very sorry pass. When we deal with South West Africa, the country with sovereignty there is South Africa. Surely that sovereignty must remain with the sovereign Parliament, and must not go to the Executive. We hope that, even at this very late stage, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will consult his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and perhaps together they will be persuaded by what they have heard, that they should withdraw this Bill.</p>

<p>It has been asked whether South Africa deserves this legislation? Does South West Africa deserve this attitude on the part of the Opposition? That is the question I want to put. I think it is with the greatest irresponsibility that the opposition is opposing this Bill to-day, because we who live in South West Africa realize what the position there is, and know what is happening there, I want to maintain that the bitterness with which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. the member for South Coast, who is walking out now, approached this Bill, is not to the credit of the Opposition. Nor can it do South Africa and South West Africa any good, because their entire argument is aimed at seeing whether they cannot make any political capital out of this matter. They leveled the reproach at us that with this legislation we are going to estrange the friends we made in the past.</p>

<p>In the same breath they say to the Whites in South West Africa that the Government, with this legislation, is not looking after their <span class="col_5179-5180" refersTo="#page_1223"/>interests. Sir, the Opposition is displaying the greatest irresponsibility here. The Opposition maintains that we should not divide up the population of South West Africa into small groups. What is the factual situation in South West Africa? We all admit that there are different nations with different languages, traditions, etc. What would the ideal situation be? The ideal situation would be to give each one of these nations their own territory in which they would in future have the right to acquire self-determination. I think it is essential that we should also state the positive aspects of the policy of the Government here to-day. What are the facts? What has South Africa done for the nations of South West Africa in this process of development? The Opposition did not even refer to this, but under the circumstances in which we are living to-day, it is, after all, extremely necessary to recognize what South Africa has done in the interests of the development of South West Africa and its population groups.</p>

<p>Sir, do we deserve an Opposition such as this which accuses the Government of not having taken any constructive steps in this measure? One finds this negative approach of the Opposition really disappointing. The question was put here by the Opposition as to whether the timing was correct. Sir, if your case is a good one, then one need not ask whether your timing is correct; if your case is a good one, then the best time to act is immediately. As a result of the extremely responsible way in which South Africa has acted and met its obligations towards South West Africa, the inhabitants of South West Africa have undergone developments, for which all the inhabitants of that area have great appreciation to-day.</p>

<p>In the past 15 to 20 years considerable changes have taken place in South West Africa. The area has developed at an accelerated tempo in all spheres of life. This development is the fruit of many years of hard work. This increased rate of development has also resulted in the fact that provision had to be made for affording these under-developed groups an opportunity of realizing their aspirations. It makes no difference whether these various groups number 2,000 or 270,000; they all have the same political aspirations. For this Government the crucial question was how to do justice in a responsible way to all the ethnic groups, on a basis on which it would be possible to continue to build. Before one can find a solution, one must surely institute a proper investigation; one must have all the facts at one&#x2019;s disposal. The hon. member for Middelland has already sketched the historical background for the House. A few years ago this Government, because this development fell to the lot of South West Africa and because the various nations began to display political aspirations, appointed the Odendaal Commission to institute an investigation and make recommendations, and subsequently the Commission made recommendations in respect of the economic development of the area, and secondly in respect of the political development of the various ethnic groups there. I should like to quote briefly from the explanatory memorandum (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the aim of self-determination for the various population groups, under the circumstances prevailing in the area, will not be promoted by appointing one mixed central authority in which the entire population could potentially be represented, but in which some groups would in fact dominate other groups.</block>

<p>If it were not for the provision which is being made in this Bill, then it is logical that certain groups would be dominated by other groups. Further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government also subscribes to the view that it ought to be the objective, as far as this is practicable, to develop a homeland for each population group so that it can attain self-determination and self-realization in that homeland. In addition the Government accepts that for this purpose considerable additional portions of the Territory, including portions which are at present in white possession, ought to be made available to non-White groups, and it shares the view that there must be no unnecessary delay in respect of the next step in the development of the groups in this important sphere.</block>

<p>Seen against this background, and the increasing degree of development in the area, the Government has seen fit to submit this Bill to the House. In reality this Bill is merely a confirmation of what has already been acknowledged and accepted in South West Africa by all the groups in that territory. However, it is essential to motivate this statement and to indicate that this policy of the Government can withstand any test which may be imposed from abroad or from the interior or specifically by the inhabitants of South West Africa. When one says this, then one thinks involuntarily of the South West Africa court case and Dr. Verwoerd, who on 18th July, 1966, after the verdict of the World Court, commented on this matter in his last public speech. This speech was broadcast over the radio, and I should like to quote these few striking words to indicate once again the honesty of this Government&#x2019;s policy and to indicate that this policy is not a new one, but that it has been the policy of this Government for many years (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa would not like to see in this verdict an opportunity of crowing over its opponents. We would rather see it as an incentive to cause us to dedicate ourselves anew to the trusteeship which we have accepted over the under-developed peoples of South and South West Africa. We shall <span class="col_5181-5182" refersTo="#page_1224"/>continue with the task of leading them to self-realization in a way which will make peaceful and friendly co-existence between all the nations of South Africa possible. No greater service can be rendered mankind than to bring about peaceful co-existence between nations, in which each is granted his own opportunity towards development in his own way.</block>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd emphasized that one could only obtain peaceful co-existence and harmony if each nation acknowledge the territory of other nations. That was the only way of preventing chaos. The Opposition asked the question here, and wanted to know why the Bill should be introduced at precisely this juncture. The same question was put when the World Court was in session, and when the Government submitted its White Paper to the House in 1964. In the same way as they did at that time the Opposition has again in this debate asked whether the Government&#x2019;s timing was correct. Sir, the reason why the Government is now coming forward with this Bill is because this Bill is a just measure, because it has merit, and that is why we cannot let any opportunity of putting our case slip. We felt in the World Court case that our case had merit; we stated our case with conviction, and we proved the honesty of our policy and our intentions in regard to all the nations in South West Africa. After all, the only question is: What is in the interests of all ethnic groups in South West Africa? The accusation was made against us, and is being made against us again now, that the inhabitants of South West Africa are being suppressed and that the freedom of the individual is being prejudiced. We put our case and, with an overwhelming amount of evidence, proved the reverse. With this Bill we are once again coming forward now with a positive approach which proves again that the inhabitants of South West Africa are not being suppressed. The policy of the Opposition amounts to enforced integration, in which one would be forcing together groups which do not want to be together. If that policy were to be applied, then one would encounter greater opposition. We accept that the approach which is fundamental to this Bill does have disadvantages, but it will constitute fewer disadvantages for few people, whereas enforced integration will entail more disadvantages for more people. The verdict in the World Court case is regarded by some people as a technical one, but do hon. members really think that those judges, with the entire world opinion against us, would have acknowledged that we were right if they really believed that this monstrous charge of suppression was a well-founded one? They would never have given the verdict they did in fact give, unless they were sure that this policy was not one of suppression but that we were sincere in our intentions in regard to the nations of South West Africa. The assertion is being made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that we are losing friends again. He alleged that with this Bill we were destroying what we had achieved with the verdict of the World Court, but surely the reverse is true. Each time we state our case positively we are winning friends &#x2014;because it is based on Christianity and morality&#x2014;in the right-minded world, and amongst honest people. The point of departure of the Government in regard to this Bill is the following: How can we achieve the best results for all inhabitants of South West Africa? In other words, the interests of all ethnic groups must be taken into consideration, and in that lies the guarantee of peaceful survival for the various nations in South West Africa, and when I speak of the various nations in South West Africa I am not only taking about the Natives. The Opposition said here: &#x201C;Provision is being made here for the Natives; what about the Whites?&#x201D; Provision is by implication also being made here for the Whites who, in the same way as the Natives of South West Africa, surely also have a right to exist and a right to acquire self-determination. Peaceful co-existence with the various nations can only be effected by what is being envisaged in the Bill, namely the creation of homelands for the various nations and the recognition of territorial boundaries.</p>

<p>The historical background has already been dealt with here. The historical fact is that over the years various ethnic groups in South West Africa have been formed, groups which owing to their different languages, their different cultures, different ways of life, etc., have clearly distinguishable identities. These groups are not prepared to sacrifice their identity. You can approach any one of those groups, and you will find that not one of them will be prepared to sacrifice that which they have achieved; they are not prepared to sacrifice their land, their way of life, their language, or their form of government. What is being done here, must be seen as a step forward in the development of South West Africa and its people. Nations who want to integrate still have the freedom to do so, and this Bill is making provision for that. But it is not trying, in a tyrannic way, to force people who do not want to integrate, to do so. In those home territories each population group will have the right to develop. Each copulation group will have proprietary rights. There is no fear that one population group will be dominated by another. Each individual is being granted the opportunity of living free of tension and of developing without any group conflict to the highest level. Inherent in this policy and in this measure which is based on that is the possibility of satisfying all demands which the international world are making on us to-day, and it also contains the guarantee of domestic peace and co-operation, as is always the case when neighbours acknowledge one another and do not threaten or force one another to integrate. What is important, what is perhaps most important at this stage, is that there is the inherent guarantee of domestic peace and co-operation, as is always the case when neighbours acknowledge one another and do not, threaten one another, and are not compelled to live on a mixed basis. <span class="col_5183-5184" refersTo="#page_1225"/>Reference was again made to the economic viability of these smaller groups, but has it ever been essential in recent history that these newly independent nations should be economically independent while they are obtaining political independence? All are to a greater or lesser degree economically dependent upon one another, and this applies even to the most developed countries in the world. That is why I do not think that this argument holds good any more, namely that these people are not economically viable. South West Africa forms part of the economic complex of Southern Africa, and its ethnic groups will obviously prefer to form part of it; they will prefer to remain part of it and they are not being prevented from doing so. But each group, if it can accept the necessary responsibility can ultimately develop itself in the political field to such an extent that it will be able to achieve self-government. Protection is being afforded a group in order to allow it to develop within its own group and not be dominated by other groups. It has been stated repeatedly that this fact that we are allowing them to achieve self-government will go hand in hand with the greatest degree of responsibility, and that is why I do not want to go into the matter any further. Our approach is that the resources of these countries are going to be developed, that a process of upliftment is going to be applied to the inhabitants of these homelands are in order to ensure that they will gain an understanding of stability and law and order, and realize that they will have to maintain it in this way; and with this approach we will be able to obtain what we are all striving for, and in fact, a great deal of this has already been achieved in South West Africa. It is a pity that there are so few members of the Opposition who accompanied us on our visit to the Bantu areas in South West Africa. What did we find there? That we have already achieved the following, because this Government has an honest policy, and because the Natives believe in this Government, because they realize that we are honest. We have achieved a tolerant attitude between the various nations. But now the Opposition is coming forward with these scare stories and they are trying to make the inhabitants of South West and South Africa believe that when Ovamboland achieves its independence it will become a communistic state. I want to give hon. members the assurance that this will not happen, owing to the good relations between the Bantu and the Whites there. On the borders of Angola, where there is terrorism, one can sleep easily, more easily than one can in Johannesburg. One need not lock one&#x2019;s doors, and one need not have burglar-proofing on one&#x2019;s windows. One can leave one&#x2019;s doors open; all one has to be careful of there are the mosquitoes. This the Government has already achieved. But we are being accused, and the people are being intimidated, in spite of the fact that we have already achieved something which other nations are envious of. What have we achieved further? That in South West Africa each one of these various ethnic groups acknowledge the borders and the territory of the others, and do not violate these. That is why we have peace and quiet there. We have security in that area.</p>

<p>A further result of this policy is that there is economic progress for all, and as a result of the responsibility of South Africa towards South West Africa, circumstances are so favourable that no other country in Africa can compete with us there.

Do they think that they can throw these various groups together and enforce integration without causing conflict, tension and chaos?</p>

<p>The hon. member obviously does not know what he is talking about. Each one of us who has knowledge of this matter, will realize that we are living in peace to-day, not only the Whites but all ethnic groups. But now the Opposition come forward with their approach and their solution, but they leave the back door open by saying that those people should be consulted first and that in that case they would perhaps have decided differently. Surely this is not an argument which holds water. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has stated that they are prepared that the northern areas develop into autonomous states. Who lives in the northern areas? The Bantu live there. There are no Whites there. The Whites living there are only there for administrative purposes; they may not own land there. They maintain that the southern portions must not obtain this; here we must live together. Who live in the southern areas? The Damaras, the Hereros the Namas as well as the Whites.</p>

<p>Now they maintain that in this legislation provision is not being made for the Whites as well. But they are prepared to say that the Whites should share sovereignty in the southern sector. Where is the logic of this? If one wants to give all nations the same rights and opportunities it must not be in favour of a few only, and one must at least be consistent. Surely this idea clashes with the idea of the promotion of all racial groups. The idea of a federation in the north and a federation in the south has been raised. Then these two areas most probably form a federation again, and when it comes to closer ties with South Africa, it will probably have to be a confederated federation. Where is the logic of this? And what does it imply? In this federation one of two things must happen. Either the majority is going to dominate the minority or a privileged position will have to be created for certain minority groups. This policy of theirs will not hold water in countries abroad, nor at home. Why place the Whites in this unenviable <span class="col_5185-5186" refersTo="#page_1226"/>position and say that they must, at some time or other, make regulations by means of which they will have to dominate these minority groups? Why not give each population group the right to its own development? And then the Opposition in South West Africa &#x2014;I do not know whether this Opposition agrees with them&#x2014;do not talk of a federation, but of one white representative for the four largest non-white racial groups. Why the four largest? And if these four are still the same four to-day, will they still be the four largest in ten to 20 years&#x2019; time? Will the overseas countries be satisfied with this? Can it be expected that the non-Whites of South Africa will accept this? Why should the Whites be placed in this position if they know that it will not hold good? Why cannot we allow this development to take place from the outset on a sound and practical basis? Why must the Opposition always put forward these complicated and unrealistic suggestions? Let us be practical and realistic and let us look after the welfare of the people, and let us leave aside this political argumentation when it comes to important matters. Why not allow justice to be done to all groups? Does the Opposition really think that it can pull the wool over the eyes of overseas countries and the voters at home with this offer of limited powers to certain groups? Because that is what their policy implies. Can this policy of theirs succeed anywhere else in the world? No, the standpoint of this Government is clear. It is a responsible standpoint, and it is being accepted by all because it is an honest one, and those who do not accept it to-day will accept it in future. But what is most important is that this standpoint of the Government is acceptable to the people of South West Africa, because they see in it their salvation and their future. The Opposition do not have the contacts there as we do who come from South West Africa. They have had one person there, and what happened then? When the hon. member for Bezuidenhout changed his opinions, he could not defend his seat there, and he remained here. I want to warn the Opposition that they must not make accusations against us which can be used against us when we defend South Africa abroad. One of the only politicians, a member of the House of Assembly, whose evidence was used in the United Nations by Ethiopia and by Liberia in the South West case, was that of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout.</p>

<p>They were not used against us. The policy of this Government is clear and honest. There will be ultimate autonomy for every group, provided that this is requested and proof is given to the effect that it will be maintained with all the necessary responsibility and that the change will take place in accordance with the desires of every ethnic group, and with the purpose of promoting the welfare of all ethnic groups. It means that with this legislation the Government is also looking to the future of all people in South West Africa and in South Africa as well. It foresees a future for every group&#x2014;and I emphasize every group&#x2014;which will have their own rights, the white group as well. The Whites must also retain their own authority and territory, and may not share it with anyone else. Why should they share it with others? In this way they should be able to work out their own weal and woe, and ensure their continued existence. South Africa is not there to deprive people of their rights. The reverse is true. Our duty is clear. The rights of each group will be protected by us.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Karas has, I think, advanced the best reason for not changing the <i>status quo</i>, because he has done nothing else but tell this House how peaceful things are in South West Africa, how happy and contented the population groups there are. Consequently I cannot see why the Government should be rushing into a complete change in the constitutional status of the various race groups there. To the best of my knowledge, the last real trouble which took place in South West Africa was in 1959, at the time of the Windhoek <span class="col_5187-5188" refersTo="#page_1227"/>riots. But hon. members here&#x2014;like the hon. member for Middelland and the hon. member for Primrose&#x2014;talk about chaos unless things in South West Africa are changed and unless the different racial groups there are put on this road to self-government. I fail to see how they have come to that conclusion, particularly as the hon. member for Karas has been telling us how peaceful and satisfactory everything in South West Africa is at the moment. I wonder whether it does not occur to the hon. member for Primrose that one of the main causes of the Windhoek riots in 1959 was the attempt by the Government to move the Hereros to the Katatura township&#x2014;at least it was the main reason; there were other reasons as well. Does it not occur to hon. members that the plan they are putting before the House now involves a major population movement? Because practically all the tribes, with the exception of those living north of the red line, are going to have to be moved around. According to the South West Africa Survey, something like 50,000 South West Africa Africans live in urban areas, nearly 65,000 in white rural areas, while something like 134,000 of the indigenous groups live outside the proposed homelands. Now, if they had all that trouble in 1959 with the proposed removal of the Hereros from Windhoek, does it not occur to hon. members that they are looking for trouble when they start these vast population movements while, according to the hon. member for Karas, people there are living in peace and harmony at the moment? I am going by what the hon. member for Karas has told us. In addition, I have read the report of the Odendaal Commission as well as the South West Africa Survey. Furthermore, I have read in some detail this Bill which the Government has now placed before this House.</p>

<p>I am one of those who believe that the Government did the right thing in 1964 when Dr. Verwoerd decided to embark on a five-year plan for the economic development and social improvement of South West Africa and of the indigenous peoples of South West Africa particularly. I think that was the right course, because there was much room for improvement in these respects. I also believe that a great deal has been done since 1964&#x2014; that is obvious to everybody. Similarly I believe the Government did the right thing when in 1964 it decided not to go ahead with the implementation of the political proposals of the Odendaal Commission. It did so for an obvious reason, although this is heavily disguised by the White Paper which has been tabled in conjunction with this Bill, because in this White Paper it simply says &#x201C;for various reasons&#x201D;. Well, I do not know whom the Government thinks it is fooling, whether it thinks anybody is under any illusion what these &#x201C;various reasons&#x201D; were which persuaded the Government to refrain from taking any decision in respect of the comprehensive recommendations concerning the constitution of self-governing areas for the different Native groups, the demarcation of their boundaries, and the changes in the form of Government. But there they go on to say, &#x201C;however, as a result of subsequent developments &#x2026;&#x201D;&#x2014; again a curtain of secrecy! Why is the Government not honest and why does it not come out with the obvious statement that in 1964 &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But it is so obvious, and I do not know whom the hon. the Minister thinks he is fooling. In 1964 the World Court had not yet handed down its decision on the Ethiopia-Liberia complaint but now that the World Court has decided, the &#x201C;various reasons&#x201D;, such as they were, have fallen away. I do not know why the Government does not come right out and say so. But apart from the fact that these &#x201C;various reasons&#x201D; have now disappeared, I believe the Government is doing the wrong thing now&#x2014;that is to carry out the political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission. I think it is a stupid thing to do, to fly in the face of world opinion on this issue, while there is no obvious justification therefor. Hon. members asked, &#x201C;Why now?&#x201D;, but I say &#x201C;Why at all?&#x201D; No cogent reason has been advanced, neither by the hon. the Minister when he introduced the Bill nor by any hon. member coming from South West Africa, nor by any other Government member who has spoken so far, why it is necessary at all to implement any of these political recommendations of the Odendaal Commission.</p>

<p>We know of course that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to set up these various population groups. To this end this Bill envisages the establishment of at least six homelands for six different population groups, with a possibility of more homelands coming as and when it becomes necessary in the eyes of the Government. Of course, all this represents, is a transplantation of the Bantustan plan which they have started to implement in South Africa, to South West Africa. I say which they have &#x201C;started&#x201D; to implement, because that is all they have done. Despite all the big plans we have had for the promotion of Bantu self-government, and so on, in South Africa so far there is only one self-governing, but by no means independent, Bantustan&#x2014;the Transkei. It was there more or less before, although it had certain powers under certain laws and perhaps some of them were not as far-reaching as the powers given them by the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act. But why go ahead at all? I say it is particularly unwise in view of the climate of world opinion against South Africa. All this step can do is to promote more hostility from our enemies, as other hon. members on this side have said, and what is more it is going to promote dismay amongst those nations which are well-disposed towards us at U.N. and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="col_5189-5190" refersTo="#page_1228"/>We surely do not deny the international status of South West Africa. At no time as far as I know have we denied that there is a peculiar, a unique status attached to South West Africa which of course is inherent in the Territory&#x2019;s history. We all know that. It is true we did not accept the World Court&#x2019;s advisory opinion which was handed down in 1950 which said that the mandate was still in force. We did not accept that. But nevertheless we have never denied that South West Africa does have international status.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<p>It may be different, but it nevertheless is international, something we do not say of our own country. We say South Africa is one hundred per cent autonomous, South Africa governs herself without any restrictions from anybody, without the world being able to determine anything that goes on inside South Africa. We have never maintained this, and correctly, if I may say so from the legal point of view, as far as South West Africa is concerned. I want to point out that the 1966 World Court decision on the case brought by Ethiopia and Liberia has in no way altered the advisory opinion handed down by the World Court in 1950, which in fact is the only clear law there exists so far on South West Africa&#x2019;s status.</p>

<p>What the hon. member must realize is that it is regarded as the only law in existence on the actual status of South West Africa, and until another case is actually brought before the World Court determining its status, that is the only thing which obtains at the present stage. In the meantime however there have been many decisions taken at the U.N. with which of course South Africa does not concur. I refer to the decision for instance which was taken quite recently to the effect that the mandate is at an end and the appointment of the 11-man commission to go into the whole question of South West Africa. Nobody even knows whether that is valid or not. We have said it is not valid but in fact the matter has never been tested in the courts of law. As I say, the international character, if the hon. member prefers it I will use that word, has not been denied by South Africa, and I think it is quite crazy for us at this stage to fly in the face of world opinion when there is absolutely no need for us to promote additional hostility towards South Africa. There is no need for the Government to be provocative at all.</p>

<p>I come back to what I believe we should be doing and partly we are already doing that, and this is the course I want us to continue to follow. I am talking about the economic development of the Territory. We should leave aside the political issues. The hon. member for Durban (North) has mentioned that partition was actually suggested in 1958. He said this idea of partition was suggested as a solution for the South West African problem in 1958 by the Good Offices Committee. That, of course, is absolutely true. Fifty-six nations spoke at the U.N. on that plan for partition and 56 nations objected to the plan, and it fell away.</p>

What makes them think that any similar scheme, such as has been suggested by this Bill, will be acceptable? It is not complete independence by any means but it is on the road towards a partitioning of South West Africa into six different areas to which the tribes concerned will have exclusive rights. That is quite obvious: Nobody else other than the particular tribe concerned&#x2014;or nation, if that terminology is preferred&#x2014;will have any rights to those areas. Surely this is going against the whole idea of the mandate, this whole idea of excising portions for the specific benefit of one or other race, or even excising the areas south &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, I wonder if I could do without these noises off just for a while, Mr. Speaker. South Africa has imposed laws on South West Africa in terms of which the right of movement and right of residence and <span class="col_5191-5192" refersTo="#page_1229"/>so on have been restricted for the indigenous people. No one is denying that. Indeed it is one of the big complaints at the U.N., namely that anybody who enters the Police Zone must have a permit. Moreover, the indigenous people who come from the reserves within the Police Zone cannot move freely around. They have to have passes, and residential permits, curfew regulations apply to them, and so on. We know that. But nevertheless the actual territorial ownership has not been designated in law the way we are now proposing to do. If that had been so, there would be no need for the legislation which is before us now. I say we are lending ourselves to further attacks by hostile nations at U.N. on the whole question of how we have been administering the trust which was handed over to South Africa many years ago.</p>

<p>I want to say I believe we should continue, from where we started in 1964, to put money into the economic development of South West Africa, to develop its agricultural potentialities, to undertake irrigation schemes, to build schools, to build clinics, and to provide all the necessary infra-structure, and so forth, for the development of the Territory. Then I think we are on the right lines; then I think we really have an excellent case when we do have to discuss the South West African position in the world forum, which we have to do whether we like it or not because of the international &#x201C;character&#x201D; of the Territory. I would have preferred to have listened to the hon. members who come from South West Africa, the six members in this House who are representatives of the white inhabitants, occasionally making a speech on behalf of the non-white inhabitants of South West Africa. I have sat here for a number of years and I do not remember ever hearing a single hon. member from the Territory making a plea for the improvement of the conditions of the indigenous tribes in South West Africa. I have never heard one of them complain about the restrictions on the free movement of those people. I never heard any of them complain about the low rates of wages, and they were very low indeed until very recently. Indeed, it was one of the features of the Odendaal Commission report that it made no mention whatever of the wage rates obtaining in South West Africa. It was a notable omission and I say it was a notable omission for a purpose, because the wage rate was so low at that time that it would have been a damning piece of evidence against South Africa and its behaviour towards the indigenous inhabitants. The more recent survey does mention wage rates because they have improved greatly since then. It required the World Court, it required the searchlight on South West Africa in order to improve those things. It is only in the last few years that those wage rates have improved and they are still pretty low. If one looks at the survey one sees that some of the minimum wage rates are very low indeed. The categories are divided as we can see in the survey.</p>

<p>So they should be, because South West Africa has got very considerable resources. The gap between white earnings and non-white earnings is enormous. I say all the people live in the territory of South West Africa. They do not live in their little isolated reserves as this Government would have the world believe. They all live in the mandated territory of South West Africa which was handed over to South Africa as a whole and not as an area divided into areas for the indigenous peoples and areas for the white people. I say the survey shows there has been a considerable rise in the wage rates in South West Africa. I am glad to see the philosopher of Primrose agrees with me, because he is nodding his head. But they are still very low. They start at R3.75 in some cases for the untrained, inexperienced worker.</p>

<p>The C category, which relates to juveniles. Admittedly it is for an inexperienced juvenile. It is the minimum wage for domestic servants and herdsmen. It is higher, of course, in mining. I will give the hon. member the figures if he wants them. The minimum is R3.75 in the C category, unskilled, going up to R5.25 per month in cash, with wages in kind, going up to R10 per month. That is food and quarters. The minimum wage for the A category is from R7.50 per month to R10.50 per month. In mining the average&#x2014;this is the survey figure, not mine&#x2014; unskilled wage is R17.50 in cash, plus about R15.25 in kind, which is still very low for a hazardous job. In fishing, the average is R18 per month for a semi-skilled worker, going up to the operator status of about R55.60. For domestics it is something like R7.50 to R12 per month plus food, etc.</p>

<p>We all agree that that should happen. Let us do that, and let us forget about all these grandiose political schemes which are costing a great deal of money. I do not think they are going to yield anything like the results which hon. members opposite hope they will yield. We must go ahead with providing employment opportunities, improving education, and so on. Then I believe that we really have a good case to put before the world councils, but not otherwise. It is on those matters that I should like to hear the South West Africa members speak up more vocally in this House, and, incidentally, the Senator who, I believe, is still sitting in the Other Place, who was appointed for his special knowledge of the indigenous inhabitants of South West Africa. To the best of my knowledge&#x2014;I have certainly never seen any publicity about it&#x2014;there has not been much said by him, either, on the question of the improvement of conditions for the indigenous inhabitants. The Government has made great play of all the support that it gets from the chiefs. I think the hon. member for Karas mentioned too that there is great support from the chiefs for all these plans. Of course this does not really surprise me, and I do not think it surprises any member in this House that the Government gets support from the chiefs. The chiefs are, I believe, appointed by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The whole of the non-white area, the indigenous tribal areas, Ovamboland and the reserves inside the Police Zones, are all administered from Pretoria, if I am not far wrong. It is in the hands of the Government to appoint or to depose chiefs.</p>

<p>The hon. member tells me that they are traditional heads. I understand that traditional heads have been known to fall. Traditional heads that do not agree with the Government do not stay put very long, just as traditional heads in other areas in South Africa have also been known to be removed if they get ideas contrary to the Government&#x2019;s basic policy. The same, of course, applies to the headmen. Of course these people are anxious to retain their privileged status, particularly, I might say, as the Government has enhanced the powers of the chiefs that they appoint and the traditional checks on unpopular chiefs that the tribes were able to exercise, have more or less gone by the board. Because the chief is no longer answerable to the tribe as he used to be; he is now answerable to the white authority over him, to the white official only.</p>

<p>It is not nonsense; it is absolutely true, and the hon. the Minister knows it is true. It is the hon. the Minister and his officials from Pretoria who have most of the say.</p>

<p>I noticed the other day that the hon. the Prime Minister quoted Allen Drury&#x2019;s book. I might say the quote was completely irrelevant. But I would like to refer hon. members to another portion of the book, which reports on his visit to the Transkei, when he remarked somewhat ironically about the fact, that, whenever he was cross-examining one of the Ministers in the Transkeian Government, he noticed that this man was constantly looking for approval or disapproval from the white official who sat there, right throughout the interview. I am quite sure exactly the same applies when people go and visit the chiefs and the headmen in South West Africa. They would be very brave indeed or very reckless if they did not purport to agree with everything that the Government is in fact doing.</p>

<p>I wonder how many of the younger men, those who are away, the educated young men, the ones who have left the tribal culture as such, would agree with what has been done in South West Africa. I wonder if the Government has thought of consulting any of those people, the urbanized people, the people who are already engaged in some sort of semiskilled occupation. I wonder if the hon. the Minister would find that those people want limited rights of self-government in their own little tribe or nationhood, or whether he would find they would opt for wider civil rights in the whole of South West Africa, with opportunities devoid of restrictions, the removal of pass laws, and the improvement in their employment opportunities. I am sure they would rather have such changes than this great nationhood which we hear propounded with such enthusiasm by the hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>I think, as I said originally, that it is foolish for us to go ahead with this Bill. This is not a Bill which is going to do South Africa any good. And I do not believe it is going to improve materially the conditions of the indigenous people in South West Africa.</p>

<p>I want to just draw the attention of the House to one final argument which I want to advance. I do not advance it purporting to have any legal knowledge as such. This point was drawn to my attention by a senior lecturer in law at the Witwatersrand University. It is whether or not this whole Bill in fact is not anticipating a ruling of our own Appeal Court. I believe that Bills do not fall under the <i>sub judice</i> rule of this House. But nevertheless, is it wise for Parliament to anticipate a decision which may be given against the Government, in fact, in a case presently before our Appeal Court. Since I am no legal expert, I would like to read out this opinion which was given to me. I might say, the Government, of course, has always maintained its respect for the <i>sub judice</i> law. We castigated our opponents when they attempted to prejudge <span class="col_5195-5196" refersTo="#page_1231"/>matters when the World Court decision was still pending on the South West Africa case. At the same time hon. members will remember, not so long ago, when the Terrorist Trial was on and there was considerable criticism of the sort of sentence which might be handed down, etc., at United Nations and in other international forums, again the Government came out with severe strictures, correctly, against people who were breaking the <i>sub judice</i> rule, and were in fact anticipating a decision before the court. Now, may I just say that it seems to me that the logic in this argument is quite good. It reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">It will be recalled that at the start of the so-called Terrorism Trial in September, 1967, the defence raised the special plea that the Terrorism Act, No. 83 of 1967, was invalid in so far as it applies to South West Africa, on the ground that the Parliament of South Africa received its competence to legislate in respect of South West Africa from the Mandate of 1920, and that this Mandate&#x2014;and hence the competence to legislate for South West Africa&#x2014;was terminated by the General Assembly of the United Nations by Resolution 2145 of 27th October, 1966. The Transvaal Provincial Division, however, held that it had no competence to examine the validity of the Terrorism Act because of section 59 (2) of the South Africa Constitution Act, No. 32 of 1961. This section provides that, with the exception of legislation purporting to repeal the entrenched language rights, &#x201C;no court of law shall be competent to inquire into or to pronounce upon the validity of any Act passed by Parliament&#x201D;, Defence Counsel argued that section 59 (2) applies to legislation for South Africa and not to legislation extending to South West Africa. In respect of the latter laws, courts may test their validity against the provisions of the Mandate. Consequently it was argued that, if the court had the competence to test the Terrorism Act against the provisions of the Mandate, it had the competence to inquire whether the Mandate still existed at all. This argument&#x2014;although it relates specifically to the validity of the Terrorism Act&#x2014;really calls in question the legal status of South West Africa. As already mentioned, this argument was rejected by the Transvaal Provincial Division in <i>S</i>. v. <i>Tuhadeleni</i>, 1967 (4) S.A. 511 (T.P.D.). But on 10th April, 1968, Mr. Justice Ludorf ruled that this question should be decided by the Appeal Court.</block>

<block name="quote">This means that there is a case pending before the South African Appeal Court on the question whether a South African court may test the validity of legislation purporting to extend to South West Africa.</block>

<p>There is therefore actually a case being heard now.</p>

<block name="quote">If it decides that there is a testing right &#x2014;and Parliament should not prejudge this decision&#x2014;then the matter will be sent back to the Transvaal Provincial Division for a decision on whether the mandate for South West Africa was lawfully terminated by the United Nations in 1966. And if it does find that the mandate has been lawfully terminated&#x2014;again a matter which should not be prejudged&#x2014;then the Government will have to revise its entire policy in respect of South West Africa. Until the Appeal Court gives its ruling, no legislation which assumes that the mandate has not been terminated should be initiated. This Bill does make such an assumption.</block>

<p>I am not a legal expert. I do not know whether there is any validity in this argument or not but it is important for the House to know that there is such a court case pending in our own Appeal Court. I cannot understand why the Government at least could not hold its horses until that decision has been made. I do not agree with members who ask &#x201C;Why now&#x201D;; I say &#x201C;Why at all?&#x201D; And I certainly do ask: Why bring this Bill before the Parliament of South Africa when our own South African Appeal Court is sitting on a case which may vitally affect this issue? It is anticipating the decision of the court. We have always in this House and in South Africa placed particular value on the <i>sub judice</i> rule. I am no legal expert hut this was submitted to me as an argument and I think it is important that the House be made aware of the fact that these thoughts are in the minds of certain legal experts.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to devote much of my time to what the hon. member for Houghton said. What she was actually saying was for overseas consumption, particularly when she quoted figures in regard to wages in South West Africa. According to her the non-Whites are at present being underpaid. I can assure her that the workers, on our mines in particular&#x2014;and I am thinking specifically now of the non-White workers on the Consolidated Diamond Mines, as well as those at the Tsumeb Corporation and other mines in South West Africa&#x2014;are being paid some of the highest wages in Southern Africa. I believe that they compare very well even with wages which Whites are earning in other parts of the world. I am thinking specifically now of the wages of white mineworkers in Europe. If she were to institute an investigation into this regard, she would find that they are earning considerably lower wages than the non-Whites in South West Africa who are employed in the mining industry are being paid. The same applies for the non-Whites in the other industries. I believe that the wages which we are paying on the Railways for example also compare favourably. If she has any complaint about that, then she must also have a complaint about the <span class="col_5197-5198" refersTo="#page_1232"/>wages which are being paid in South Africa, and not only those in respect of South West Africa. She made certain statements here, and said for example that the Republic of South Africa did not really have the right to deal with Bantu affairs in South West Africa. She must be a stranger in South Africa because it has been stipulated since the Peace of Versailles that the Republic of South Africa should control Bantu affairs there. At a later date it was delegated to the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa. Between the years 1949 to 1954 these rights were subsequently reduced by means of legislation so that Bantu affairs are now being fully dealt with by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development of the Republic. The hon. member also spoke about the people who are being transferred from the old native township area to the new Katatura township area, and then referred to the chaos which allegedly arose during the minor disturbances of 1959. She is labouring under a misconception in regard to the causes leading to this entire matter. I must refer her to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into that matter. It is very clear that it happened as a result of local instigation. The removal to the new Bantu township had nothing to do with this minor disturbance. It happened purely as a result of instigation by foreign influences there. I even wonder whether her view in regard to political race matters in South Africa did not contribute to that minor disturbance.</p>

<p>I come now to the Bill itself. I just want to point out what to me seems to be a contradiction to the recommendation of the Odendaal Commission. It affects clauses 5 and 8, and the schedule relating to them. The Odendaal Commission recommended that the mining industry and Water affairs should fall outside the ambit of the legislative powers which were being granted to these non-White homelands. It seems to me that there has been a departure from the recommendation of the Odendaal Commission, particularly when one takes the schedule into consideration. I think the Odendaal Commission had very sound and specific reasons for recommending that mining and water affairs should provisionally not form part of the legislative powers of these homeland areas. I do not want to elaborate on that any further because there are specific reasons for that. I only want to point out that in regard to water affairs in South West Africa, hydrology is in point of fact a large unit. It cannot be broken up into different units. We have always found in the past that if it is dealt with as a unit then the administration thereof is particularly efficient. Water is conserved in natural phenomenon which are called geological structures and these geological structures of course know no geographic boundaries.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for South Coast mentioned the importance of the question of the discovery of oil in Kabinda, in Angola. It was held out to be of vital importance to South Africa. It was alleged that if oil could be brought overland by means of a pipeline to South Africa the northern homelands would, for strategic reasons, endanger it. In the first place I want to allege that the geographic knowledge of those hon. members is limited. If they were, for example, to find out where Kabinda really is, they would see that it is further to the north of Angola. I think it is situated almost a 1,000 miles from the northern boundary of South West Africa. If one knows Angola and the regions through which such a pipeline will have to go, then you would agree with me when I say that security measures in such a territory are an impossible task, particularly if one understands the situation further to the north of the South West African border well. The Opposition are now suggesting to us that their independent Bantustan, in that same region, will present no danger of sabotage in respect of such a pipeline, but that homelands which will be established by the National Party Government ostensibly constitute tremendous dangers. I find the logic of the Opposition ridiculous. Now my question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and to the hon. member for South Coast is the following. If, according to your policy, you grant independence to Ovamboland, north of the red line, by what route are you going to conduct the supposed pipeline without bringing it through your Bantustan? Or are you going to bring it to Pretoria via Zambia and Rhodesia? Mr. Speaker, a more &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; idea of military strategy probably does not exist. If we in South West Africa had to be dependent upon such strategy then our future would definitely be a gloomy one. Since I am discussing this now, what about the communistic danger in their independent Bantustan north of the red line, or will the danger only proliferate in the homeland established by the Government?</p>

<p>Since we are now dealing with this question of strategy, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the geographic distribution of the homelands, in proportion to the white homeland. Apparently we do not all view this matter in the same light, but there is a special reason why the homelands have been distributed in this way. In the old days there were concentrations of people around waterholes, from which the various ethnic groups developed. Large tracts were unoccupied owing to the scarcity of water-points. They settled around and along the fountains and developed their traditions and own identity there. If you were now to glance at the map at the back of the Odendaal Report you would see that the Whites are settled along the central ridge of South West Africa, with the Nama and Rehoboth homelands surrounded by Whites. East of Otjiwarongo and north of Gobabis one finds the Herero country lying adjacent to the common boundary with Botswana, <span class="col_5199-5200" refersTo="#page_1233"/>surrounded to the south and the west by Whites, and separated from the Okavangos by the Bushman Reserve. To the west of the Whites, north of Usakos, are the Damara homelands. Their northern boundary with the Kaokoveld is mountainous and forms an ideal physical boundary line. Along there a road is being planned and constructed at the moment which will correspond approximately with the boundary. You find that all these various homelands are in point of fact geographically separated from one another. They are not in direct contact with one another, as they were before when the Whites settled in the unoccupied territory. In this northern homeland of both the United Party and the Government, one finds that the shortest common boundaries actually lie to the north, with the result that there is in fact the minimum chance of contact between the Kaokoveld, Ovamboland and the Okavangos. Mr. Speaker, I want to state that with this pattern of a boundary arrangement and this practical planning one immediately eliminates or restricts to a minimum all the former racial contact and the bloody struggles which arose in the past, before the Whites occupied South West Africa. One cannot remove the Whites from South West Africa. If one removes them from thence, there would be a repetition of the former bloody conflicts. The hon. member for South Coast stated here: &#x201C;The point of contact is the point of friction, and the more points of contact the Government proposes to create, the more points of friction will they have&#x201D;. But the very thing the Odendaal plan and this legislation seeks to diminish and eliminate are points of contact and friction; in addition the white man in South West Africa has no intention of leaving. I want to emphasize that. They are a permanent community in South West Africa, and they have as much right to be there as any non-Whites have the right to be in South Africa or South West Africa. I therefore reject the suggestion, that bloody wars would supposedly arise in the absence of the Whites, a suggestion made here by the hon. member for South Coast, with the contempt which it deserves. This legislation in fact consolidates the territorial rights of the non-Whites, and it definitely affects, though indirectly, those of the Whites as well. But I do not want to elaborate on that now; there are other speakers who have already given attention to that matter. It is where the Whites have established themselves, and it is their intention to preserve the peace there to the benefit of both White and non-White. Strangely enough, the hon. member is not concerned about the dangerous points of contact along the Botswana border, which for more than three-quarters of its length forms the common border between the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa. These points of contact have never constituted a danger for us before, but now all these points of contact with the proposed non-White states which will develop from the homelands quite suddenly constitute a great danger to us. The hon. member also made all kinds of wild statements, such as &#x201C;they have not studied human nature&#x201D;. He spoke about &#x201C;human nature&#x201D; and &#x201C;our history in Africa&#x201D;. Well, all I can say is that he definitely did not read the report of the Odendaal Commission. Such an excellent report as that of the Odendaal Commission has no equal in the world, because it is based on a fundamental study of human nature in the history of Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should now like to refer to a few economic aspects, and I shall confine myself to points which have not yet been touched upon here. Repeated reference was made here to the question of the viability of the homelands. The solution to the problem of economic and political independence is to be found in the fact that the various groups must be politically independent, particularly those who are endeavouring to keep their identities separate. If they do not care about their identity, then it is their business, and they are at liberty to amalgamate with other identities in order to form a larger whole. It is obvious that, with their restricted and undeveloped natural resources, they will at first not be able to stand on their own legs, and that the one ethnic group will, of necessity, have to lean upon the arm of another group, or even upon white South Africa as their neighbouring state, as is in reality the case today with states such as Lesotho and Botswana. But what state in the world is 100 per cent viable? Even the mighty U.S.A. cannot boast that it is self-supporting, because it would be very grateful if it could have had the chrome deposits of Rhodesia and the manganese and gold deposits of South Africa for itself.</p>

<p>When it comes to minerals and modern industries, and if economic principles are taken into consideration, there is no nation in the world, no matter how large or how small, which is independent of other nations. Common dependence&#x2014;the one upon the other&#x2014;is a bastion for security and peaceful co-existence. There are many examples of this in the world. The present Government cannot be held responsible for the present conditions, or the degree of viability in the homelands because those who were in power before it came into power did not concern themselves much about this and because it is a long-term facet of economy. I think that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, on one occasion, said the same thing in the House. The solution is to be found in having economic co-operation and mutual dependence, and in this way enjoying prosperity with their ties with an economically stronger South Africa as basis. The development of the one group would give impetus to that of the other groups.</p>

<p>Great play is being made of the absence of natural resources in the homelands. This statement reveals tremendous ignorance on the part of an ignorant Opposition because natural resources depend upon circumstances and unknown factors which are unpredictable and <span class="col_5201-5202" refersTo="#page_1234"/>which can only be brought to light through research. An example of this is the large subterranean salt lake which lies beneath the Ovamboland flats. If one visits Ovamboland, one does not see it, and one does not know what is going on there. This salt lake is a major potential source of various salts, but the economic factors of supply and demand are inhibitory of the maximum development thereof. Investigations have disclosed heavy low grade coal deposits at uneconomic depths. Important discoveries have been made since 1948, and research by the Government and other bodies is continuing unabated precisely with the view to making that territory economically viable. Therefore nobody can write off the homelands as being non-viable owing to the absence of natural resources, because the development of those resources is often dependent upon other factors, such as the level of civilization and culture of the people in the homelands. And the hon. the Minister has so often pointed out that the question of education is so important here for our non-Whites, because if it is possible for one to bring them to a higher level of civilization by means of education, then one is at once stimulating the development of viability in those areas, and needs arise which stimulate an interest in local raw materials.</p>

<p>In Ovamboland we bore this in mind with the development of hospital, educational and administrative centres. Hon. members who visited Ovamboland recently would have seen that a great deal of construction work is now being undertaken. When a start was made with this the problem was that of obtaining raw material for bricks. They had to import cement from Pretoria or Cape Town, at high cost, and manufacture cement bricks. Then a search was made for clay with which to make bricks. Quite a good deal of research was undertaken and small deposits were discovered, but up to now the development which is taking place there in the building industry could not afford to wait, and the manufacture of cement bricks with imported cement has been continued because of course there is a great deal of sand. The fact of the matter is that a need has arisen here for local industry.</p>

<p>As to viability, the question is often asked whether a country such as Ireland is viable. It does not have many natural resources or raw materials, but to a certain extent that country has been made viable. Think of Israel. What natural resources do they have? But their viability has been achieved through the initiative of the people themselves. That, after all, is what the Government is envisaging in the homelands namely to stimulate initiative amongst the Bantu so that they can utilize their energies in making the area viable for themselves. If Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana can have political and economic independence without viability, in order to retain their identity in this way, why should the homelands in South West Africa not have the same? The Opposition is not denying the Natives outside our borders any of the privileges of political independence, but they are denying this to those in South West Africa. This is a point which will certainly be settled later on the political platform.</p>

<p>A question incurred to me in regard to this Bantustan which they want to establish in the north of South West Africa: In what light do they regard that Bantustan? Do they regard it as being viable? Are they going to make it viable, and how are they going to do so? In its northern Bantustan the United Party wants to force the people to come together. Just consider the three tribes of the Kaokoveld. I can mention the names, but I do not believe it will have any significance here. There are the six of Ovamboland and there are the six of the Okavango. There are actually 15 different tribes. They differ as to culture and religion. In some cases the level of civilization is low.</p>

<p>I am thinking of the Tsjimbas of the Kaokoveld, where the level of civilization borders on that of the Stone Age, when people made their artifacts from stone. The level of civilization of the other Ovambo tribes, which has been in contact with the Whites from the south since 1850 is much higher, as a result of the invaluable work of the Finnish missionaries. Their level of civilization is somewhat higher than those of the people who are still living in the Stone Age. If one travels further eastward to the Okavango, one finds a level of civilization which is completely different. But the Opposition wants to force together all the various people with their differing religions, cultures and levels of civilization. The question has occurred to me: Where is the right to self-determination? In this regard I should like to quote the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition which he used in a different debate years ago. I am sorry. Sir, but I cannot find it at the moment, possibly I shall have an opportunity later on to refer to it.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the way in which this debate has been conducted by the Opposition, and express my disappointment at their attitude in this regard, particularly since it involves a matter which is of tremendous importance to us, this matter of political rights and political independence which has grown up on an evolutionary basis and which is now being developed on that basis and which will now grant the non-Whites of South West Africa this right so that they can see where the National Party Government wants to take them.

<p>At the outset I want to say that I am very disappointed at the remarks made by the hon. member for Primrose comparing the Voortrekkers with those tribes or Native nations in South West Africa. I have always honoured and respected the Voortrekkers because I have looked upon them as being civilized, religious, industrious and progressive people. How one can compare their political rights and their outlook with those of the raw Natives of South West Africa is completely beyond my comprehension. <span class="col_5203-5204" refersTo="#page_1235"/>[Interjections.] We have never on this side suggested putting these tribes or nations together. Somebody mentioned that we wanted to put the Hereros with the others. If the hon. member looks at the map he will discover that the Herero reserve on the far eastern side of South West, in the southern sector, is several hundred miles away from the nearest other Bantu tribe. Then I have to agree with the hon. member for Etosha regarding the remarks of the hon. member for Houghton about the 1959 riots in Windhoek. I must compliment the Windhoek Municipality on building this beautiful new township in the same complex, adjoining the old one, for the Hereros. But through agitation they refused to occupy these houses and so the municipality was unable to remove them from the slums where they were living.</p>

<p>As far as the pipeline and the oil are concerned, what worries me is not the pipeline, but oil has been discovered on the west coast of Angola and there is every likelihood, it appears to me, that that oil-field could carry on southwards into South West Africa. May I ask what the Minister has in mind if an oilfield should be discovered in the Kaokoveld area of South West? Also, they keep on arguing about removing the Whites from South West Africa. That, too, has never been suggested from this side. It would be a foolish thing and a sad day for South West Africa if the white man, with his know-how and his economic ability, is removed from South West, to turn those tribes back to what they were at the turn of the century.</p>

<p>We have had a lot of legal argument on the Bill, but what about the practical side? I want to congratulate my Leader for his practical suggestions for all the people in the Territory. He was not thinking of one group; he was thinking of everybody. One must realize that it is a very large country; it is two-thirds the size of the Republic. It has one of the lowest population densities in the world. There are fewer than two people per square mile. The lower half of the Territory, from Windhoek southwards, with the Namib Desert on the one side and the Kalahari on the other, and the central plateau with its limited surface water and its irregular rainfall, is probably fully taxed as far as its carrying capacity is concerned. Northwards of Windhoek the position improves progressively and beyond the red line we find the highest carrying capacity. There live two-thirds of the population of the Territory, and no doubt, with proper development, this area could carry many more people. History tells us that with the southward migration of the Herero, with their large herds of cattle, they were warned by the Ovambo and other peoples occupying the northern section, to keep going because the Herero believed that where his cattle grazed, that land belonged to him. But on reaching the Swakop River at Okahandja they first contacted the Hottentots, or as we now call them, the Nama. As the hon. member for South Coast says, this was the first point of contact and the first point of friction, and that friction lasted for more than 50 years, with both tribes being considerably depleted, the Hereros losing no less than 25,000 members of their tribe. But as the war went on power passed from the Hereros to the Namas and back again to the Hereros, until the chief of the Hereros asked the Germans to take over the colony and to bring law and order there.</p>

<p>The Germans raised their flag and Maharero said, &#x201C;The flag fluttered this way and the flag fluttered that way, but under the flag we live in peace.&#x201D; But they were not satisfied with that peace and in 1903 they rebelled against European authority and that war lasted another four years. The Hereros lost something like another 25,000 and the Germans had to bury over 5,000 of their own troops. This war finally ended in the Waterberg and the Epikero area and that is what is now called Hereroland. I must admit numbers of the Herero are scattered over the country on European farms and there is the large colony which caused the trouble in 1959 actually living in the Windhoek location. At this point I want to state that if there is a Bantu tribe which is politically educated, then it is the Herero.</p>

<p>After the First World War mandatory powers were granted to South Africa over South West Africa and article 2, which was read out here this afternoon by an hon. member, made it quite clear that it was the material and moral well-being and the social progress of the inhabitants of the Territory that the mandatory power had to see to. Let us be honest and admit that every successive government in South Africa has carried out that mandatory responsibility towards all the inhabitants of the Territory. As far as I know the Native peoples have been left in peace with perhaps the exception in the south of a small group of Namas who were resettled for economic reasons. That resettlement was agreed to between them and the authorities. I think it was in 1943, during the war years, that a small group of Damaras were removed from the foothills of the Khomas Hochland to the main Damara reserve adjoining the Okambahe reserve. This too was done with the mutual consent of the Administration and the Damaras concerned.</p>

<p>In any case, that is when it commenced, that it was agreed where they should be removed to.</p>

<p>During my period of duty in South West Africa I always looked upon the red line separating the northern and southern areas as something of great importance&#x2014;although not properly defined and imaginary at places, it has always been respected by both the peoples of the north and the south and also by the <span class="col_5205-5206" refersTo="#page_1236"/>authorities. Police authority of the south ceased at the red line and the only time that they entered the north was on the very rare occasions to investigate capital offences, otherwise tribal authority reigned supreme, not only this but to the satisfaction of both the people of the various tribes and the authorities. Now, after all these years, this sanctity of the north is being disturbed. The proposed Damaraland is now going to straddle the red line in proclaiming Damaraland from above Zessfontein in the Kaokoveld to join up with the Damaraland reserves in the south. Zessfontein Oasis has always been inhabited and owned in my opinion by the Hottentots; I believe they have lived there since the turn of the century. What is more alarming is the fact that the Damas have always been looked upon as the servants of the Namas, so much so that the Dama only knows the Nama language and has accepted it as their own. Now the Bill contemplates changing the tables about making the servant the owner and master. Is this not going to lead to friction, or is it the intention of the Government to relocate the Hottentots in some other area?</p>

<p>As this Bill only deals with Native nations, why was a Bill to deal with the Coloureds not introduced at the same time, and by doing so avoiding any misunderstanding?</p>

<p>Zessfontein has always been looked upon by all Kaokovelders in that part of the Kaokoveld as a place of refuge for themselves and their stock in time of drought. Are they now to be deprived of these waters and what is the Government suggesting as an alternative watering place for these peoples? I refer to the Ovahimbas, the Ovatjimbas and the wild Hereros.</p>

<p>The development to take place in these Native areas, according to the Bill, seems to be more of a political-social development, but surely what they want is economic development. If the large amount of money which the Minister contemplates spending on this political rampage in the Native areas is spent on schooling all over the territories and creating employment development which will give the people an opportunity of earning a living and providing them with trading stores spread throughout the areas, then I think the hon. the Minister is doing something worthwhile and cannot be criticized. As an example, the Zessfontein peoples in the Kaokoveld had to travel over 120 miles to Kamanjab, below the red line, to do their shopping. For all I know they may now have a shop in Zessfontein&#x2014; even a supermarket.</p>

<p>The South West Africa Survey published fantastic photographs of schools, hospitals, churches, and so forth. But this is only window dressing. At how many places in the various Native areas do these centres exist? How many thousands of children are not in school and not anywhere near a school? The photographs in the Survey certainly do not compare with photographs I have which were taken at the water hole at Zessfontein of raw Bantu people.</p>

<p>With this Bill has come the news that the Kaokoveld is going to be opened up, I take it by white capital. What benefit may I ask will the Kaokovelders derive from this exploitation of their country? Are they going to share the profits on a percentage basis? Is this a new departure of the Government as far as the Bantustans are concerned&#x2014;allowing white capital and white know-how to develop these areas? I wish to refer in this connection to <i>The Cape Argus</i> of the 29th April, 1968, in which a very interesting and long article appeared. I wish to read portion of the article which appeared under the heading &#x201C;Opening up the Kaokoveld&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The day of the bush pioneer is dying. There are very few virgin areas left in this jet-shrunk, tax-tamed world for the man who ventures out with lots of imagination, little money and a pick and shovel to make something out of nothing. But one of them is right here in Southern Africa: the Kaokoveld, some 18,826 square miles of beautiful, deadly desert, silent mountains towering over dark valleys and deep canyons, and riverine jungle hiding wild animals.</block>

<p>So the article goes on, and I also wish to quote the following few lines which I find rather interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But inaccessibility and high operating costs in this desolation still frustrated them. So Westies called in some big guns&#x2014;Sanlam subsidiary Mankor, plus General Mining, the Industrial Development Corporation, Volkskas, and a club of individuals called the Promoters&#x2019; Club.</block>

<p>Is this what we are going to do in the development of those native areas? The Ovambos and the Okavangos have practiced tribal segregation for their whole existence to avoid detribalization. Why not leave them alone and only help them economically?</p>

<p>It is said that Winston Churchill made a ten-minute speech and when he was asked how long it had taken him to prepare that speech he said, &#x201C;Ten years&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister said he worked nine months on this Bill and nine months to prepare a speech over 60 minutes in duration to introduce the Bill. I say to him: For South Africa&#x2019;s sake, for South West Africa&#x2019;s sake, listen to the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;postpone this measure and prepare it over the next nine years.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (City) cracked a joke at the end of his speech which all of us did not enjoy, but perhaps we shall appreciate it more later. He started his speech by congratulating the municipality of Windhoek on the fact that it had seen to the establishment of the new Bantu residential area, <span class="col_5207-5208" refersTo="#page_1237"/>Katachura, and he said that area was adjacent to the old location. That is not quite correct. If I am not mistaken, the new location is not adjacent to, but completely removed from the old location. I want to join him in congratulating the municipality on the establishment of the new Bantu residential area at Windhoek. If ever there were critical conditions in a slum area, those conditions definitely existed in the indescribably unhygienic old location at Windhoek. We also trust that there will be no obstruction when all the facilities have been provided in that new residential area. I trust that at such time too we will have the cooperation of the Opposition in this House as regards the moving of the residents of the old location, with all its problems, to the new residential area established by the municipality.</p>

<p>The hon. member paid tribute to his Leader for the attitude his Leader had adopted here. I suppose one could have expected nothing else from him as a loyal supporter of the United Party. At a later stage, however, I shall have more to say about the attitude adopted here by his Leader.</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. member correctly, he referred to the potential carrying capacity of the northern areas of South West Africa. He called attention to the large carrying capacity of those areas. We agree with him that those areas can possibly carry much more than they do at present, but we also want to say that the potential of that territory has to be reserved for the population of that territory and for future generations. That territory should not be exploited now. No, it must be preserved, and consequently I think this measure is very timeous indeed. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to discuss his remarks on Namaland. I do not think this Bill makes any provision whatsoever for Namaland, because the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development very clearly stated in his second-reading speech that special legislation would have to be passed and that the Namas would be administered by the Department of Coloured Affairs. Therefore I do not want to reply to that.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the hon. member referred to the carrying capacity and the potential of the northern areas, I want to tell him that we are deeply impressed by the possibilities of those areas, but especially of Okavangoland. We are of the opinion that there are very great possibilities, virtually unlimited possibilities, if that territory is utilized and employed correctly. That is why it is such a good thing that an opportunity will not be given to people who are only interested in the development of the Bantu areas and the Bantu themselves, in the case of the Okavangos for example, to exploit that territory, but that it will be reserved for that nation, and that they will be able to develop that territory to its fullest potential with the guidance of the white man.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to create a debating point here by making an incorrect quotation from what the hon. member for Primrose had said. But that is a matter which I leave to them, and they can settle that between them.</p>

<p>When the National Party took over the government of this country in 1948 it was deeply conscious, <i>inter alia</i>, of one of the greatest tasks with which it had been entrusted, namely the regulation of relationships amongst the various population groups in South Africa. That was one of the main principles on which the National Party stood, on which its manifesto was based, and on which it asked the South African nation for a mandate. That was to regulate the relationships amongst the various and involved population groups in South Africa. The legislation we have before us to-day is very clearly aimed at making it possible to proceed with the task entrusted to us. South West Africa and the Bantu population of South West Africa now have the benefit of the experience we have gained over a period of 20 years from other legislation in South Africa. Now we are very grateful that we have always had energetic and dynamic Ministers of Bantu Administration and Development, as well as a very efficient Department, during this period of 20 years to apply the Acts which have been placed on the Statute Book. That is something for which South Africa can always be grateful. In this process of regulating relations amongst the various population groups, the primary object of this side of the House probably is to ensure a permanent home for the white man in South Africa. Even if that is not done purely for the sake of the white man, but because a special task has been entrusted to this nation and to white South Africa since this nation has a calling to fulfill, if I may use the words of the hon. the Prime Minister, then it is necessary for us to ensure, by means of this kind of legislation, that the white man will retain a safe stronghold in Southern Africa. That stronghold is, and I say this without the least fear of contradiction, the Republic of South Africa. Under the Government of the National Party that stronghold for the white man will be protected and retained in South Africa and in so doing we shall fulfill our calling and carry our message to Africa. We shall try to share the knowledge which we acquire in this process with other nations and other countries that possibly have as many racial problems but are not constantly in the spotlight of the world. We shall try to share that knowledge with them to make it possible for them to achieve better race relations in their own countries. Therefore we do not apologize to anyone when we come forward with legislation such as this for regulating relationships amongst various nations in South Africa. In this process we are retaining a safe position for the white man and we are not denying any other nation the right to develop to the maximum of its ability. South Africa is more interested in the welfare and the development of the Bantu nations of South West Africa than <span class="col_5209-5210" refersTo="#page_1238"/>any other country or nation or than all members of the U.N. put together; hence this legislation. We are taking the trouble to place this legislation on the Statute Book and we are spending millions of rand on the development of those areas because, as I have said, South Africa and the white man in South Africa are taking a much greater interest in the development of the Bantu nations in South West Africa than any other country in the world. The U.N., the official Opposition and the Progressive Party, can fake cognizance of this fact: South Africa takes an interest in the development of those areas.</p>

<p>We had hoped that we would receive the co-operation of the Opposition in the regulation of these relationships, but we obviously did not. That became very obvious from the attitude adopted by the Opposition in this debate and from what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition as well as the hon. member for South Coast had said. Their attitude in respect of this matter is that they are much more concerned about what the outside world would think of this legislation and the development of South West Africa than about what is of vital interest to South Africa, to the white man as well as to the Bantu nations of South West Africa. They cannot deny that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition leveled the accusation at us that legislation such as this could only destroy the friendship which South Africa had acquired in the outside world as a result of the judgment of the World Court. Sir, I think the time has arrived for us to ask the Leader of the Opposition what price the Opposition is prepared to pay for the goodwill of the world and the goodwill of the U.N.?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member says that the Bantustans are the price we have to pay, then I want to tell him that the National Party is prepared to ensure that the white man will have his country and his legislative assembly just as we are prepared to take every Bantu nation in this country, and in this case in South West Africa, by the hand and lead him to the development of which he is capable, rather than allowing integration within this Parliament, rather than giving the non-white nations more and more say in the Parliament of the white man. Because the Bantu cannot hold his own against the white man, the Opposition knows that it is possible to exploit the Bantu. Therefore we are honest when we say that we want each one of these population groups to develop separately, as provided in this legislation and as recommended by the Odendaal Commission in its report. Let me just quote to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the considered conviction of the Commission that the continued existence of a home area for each individual population group as the inalienable area of that indigenous group would be in the best interests of the various population groups, and that, in accordance with their declared wish, these homelands should continue to exist as such and become increasingly independent.</block>

<p>&#x201C;And become increasingly independent.&#x201D; That was the recommendation and the essence of the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission, as embodied in this Bill at present before this House. It is our conviction that that is right, and the National Party, this Government, is prepared to do what it believes is right and in the interests of all the population groups in South Africa, even if that were not to the liking of the rest of the world and of the U.N. We are not, in the first place, looking for popularity at the U.N. By saying that I do not want to suggest that we are looking for a dispute with them, but we are not going to do something which is wrong merely for the sake of gaining the friendship of the U.N. and the world. This is the attitude which the United Party has adopted in respect of all legislation placed on the Statute Book over the past 20 years for regulating good relationships amongst the various population groups in South Africa.</p>

<p>Even before this Bill was introduced we had expected that the United Party would adopt this attitude. But, Sir, in this respect you should allow us to show South Africa what the result would be if the United Party were to have its way. If all these population groups in South West Africa were to be given representation in a Federal Parliament, as suggested by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, where would it end? If at the outset 16 representatives for non-Whites were to sit in this Parliament, where would it end? Especially in view of the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has already indicated to us that he is prepared to yield to pressure brought to bear on him, I have no alternative but to agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education that if the United Party were to have its way in South Africa, it would perhaps not even take 10 years before there could be a non-white Prime Minister in South Africa.</p>

We shall once again prove this to the people at the next election. We shall show them what could happen if one had partnership between White and non-White in the same parliament, which is the attitude which the United Party is adopting in respect of this legislation as well. If that were to be a democratic parliament and if they were not to discriminate against the non-Whites&#x2014; and how often have we not been accused by the Opposition of discriminating against the non-Whites&#x2014;then it would only be a matter of time before the majority in this Parliament would consist of non-Whites. If the pressure is strong enough, that majority will elect their prime minister in this Parliament and it is doubtful whether a majority of non-Whites would elect a white prime minister Those are the logical consequences of the policy of the United Party.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I gladly follow your advice. In view of the fact that this Bill is making provision for the development of the various Native nations in South West Africa towards self-government, you should allow us, Sir, to indicate the alternative as well, because if this development were not to take place, we ought to ascertain what the consequences would be, namely what would happen if this legislation were not passed. In terms of this legislation those areas will be reserved and retained for the indigenous inhabitants of those areas. Recently we were fortunate enough to pay a visit to that territory and we are very grateful to be able to say that what is being done here to-day represents not only the wishes and the policy of a party, but also the expressed desire of the inhabitants of that territory. The hon. members who visited that territory with us, like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and others, will agree with us that when these questions were put to all sections of the population of Ovamboland or Okavangoland they unanimously voted in favour of these steps and were impatient for this Bill to be passed so as to afford them the opportunity of developing under the guidance of the white man.</p>

<p>I shall be very fair and admit that I cannot speak in respect of the Hereros. I did not put those questions to them. I do not know whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout can speak on their behalf. I did not put the questions to them, but in the areas we visited, the people are very anxious to have this legislation and to be led to self-government under the supervision and guidance of the Whites whom they still call, politically speaking, their father and their mother. That is their desire and I do not think one of the other hon. members would deny that. What we are doing here, is to give expression to the wishes and desires of the inhabitants of those areas. I want to say that we are deeply impressed by the preparatory work which is being done there. What I am thinking of is the health services which are being provided there and the work which the Commissioner-General is doing. We are grateful to be able to say today that a very fine relationship exists at present between especially the Okavangos and the Ovambos and the Whites who are providing guidance there. I am pleased to be able to say that we all gained the following impression: If those fine relations are maintained, as we are doing here now, irrespective of what the world may then think of us, the terrorists who are trying to infiltrate into our country from the north, will have very little chance of success because the Okavangos and the Ovambos will not allow them to come into our country.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to reply to the political stories told by the hon. member for Wolmaransstad. They are anything but original. I can also tell him that the latest elections have shown that the people are no longer interested in them. They have heard them too often. He put one serious question, i.e. what price are we on this side prepared to pay for foreign approval. I hope he accepts my reply, because he is the one who put the question. Our reply is: Not a cent. We on this side believe that a clever government should outmanoeuvre its enemies. That can be done, but the charge we are leveling at this Government is that day in and day out it is thrusting weapons into the hands of our enemies, which makes it impossible for us to outmanoeuvre our enemies. The Government is continuously weakening our position. This is my reply to that question of the hon. member&#x2019;s. We believe that one should have enough sense to outmanoeuvre one&#x2019;s enemies and not to provide them with weapons.</p>

<p><span class="col_5213-5214" refersTo="#page_1240"/>Of all the problems we have to contend with in South Africa to-day, the problem of South West Africa is the one which will become our greatest challenge. In the case of the race problems of the Republic, we are in fact faced with strong disapproval abroad. We are even faced with an overdose of interference. But in the final analysis the relations problem of the Republic remain the problems which the two major race groups of our country can and will have to settle amongst themselves. In the case of South West Africa we find that a third element has unfortunately been added for us. It is a third element which we recognize officially. It is the international community. Admittedly the mandate is clear enough, and we do have every right to administer the territory as an integral part of South Africa in as far as we consider it necessary. But along with that the Government has recognized the definite international responsibility in respect of the destiny of the territory and its people. It is this third element which unfortunately gives a special dimension to all matters affecting the future of South West Africa. And it is for this reason that we, as the Opposition, have consistently adopted a specific attitude in regard to the South West question. In the first place, it is our view that, whichever party is in power, we should not necessarily mark out for South West Africa, down to the last comma, those party-political recipes and solutions we have for the Republic.</p>

<p>Historically, politically, geographically economically, ethnically&#x2014;in virtually every sphere circumstances in South West Africa are different. There is a certain otherness about that territory and it requires a distinctive approach in numerous respects. Secondly, we adopted the attitude that it was the duty of the Government of the day, and this holds good for any government, to make at least an attempt to approach the South West problem on a broader basis than that of ordinary party-politics. I am absolutely convinced that if the South West Africa case is handled correctly, South West Africa will cease to be a problem for us. On the contrary, it can indeed become a bridge of understanding between us and the outside world. South West Africa can, if it is handled correctly, become a link, an instrument, by means of which we may effect on the part of the outside world a complete change towards South Africa.</p>

<p>But the Government has chosen to follow another approach. In the first place, it has chosen to handle the problems of South West on a unilateral, party-political basis; in the second place, it believes in applying its local political recipes, chapter and verse, to the different circumstances found in South West. Of course, I do not dispute the Government&#x2019;s right to follow this course; it is in power and this is its choice. What we do dispute, is the wisdom of such a step. However, I mention this so that we may realize whose choice it is that we are involved here in an ordinary party-political debate on a delicate and vital question such as that of South West Africa.</p>

<p>We have before us a Bill which was fathered by the Odendaal Commission. That in itself does not make this legislation inacceptable. When the Odendaal Report was discussed here in 1964, we had a great deal of praise for the economic recommendations contained therein&#x2014;in fact, we associated ourselves with most of the recommendations which evinced that Commission&#x2019;s zeal for development. The criticism we expressed, was concentrated on the unpractical aspects of the Government&#x2019;s political plan. At that time our point of departure was, and it still is to-day, that historically as well as administratively one was in fact dealing with two South West Africas. Ever since the days of the German occupation South West Africa has been recognized and governed as two territories. White settlement and Western political institutions have strictly remained confined to the southern sector; the northern sector, predominantly Ovambo, has retained its indigenous character, its freedom and its traditional forms of self-government. In the case of the northern sector, therefore, we are dealing with an historically natural homeland or homelands. Nobody denies that. Those homelands have remained as intact as no other in Southern Africa. Consequently there can be no objection to the acknowledgment of this position, be it by legislation or by other means. Nor can there be any objection to any plans for developing this northern territory for the people there on an exclusive basis, both economically and politically. In fact, that is exactly what we proposed and advocated here in the course of the discussion of the Odendaal Report. We regard it as being particularly unfortunate that with this Bill the Government is now interfering with the dual political nature of South West Africa. But on one occasion we came to such a pass that even a U.N. Commission suggested a separate solution for the two parts. That was not accepted, because at that stage the &#x201C;climate&#x201D; was too unfavourable. However, this concept found favour with many people and even to-day it is still finding favour amongst the Native groups of South West Africa. We feel that, to start with, the Government should have come forward here to-day with a Bill seeking to modernize and co-ordinate the existing forms of self-government in the north. As far as the north is concerned, self-government is not something new. As far back as 1947, and subsequently in all the documents South Africa has sent abroad in regard to South West Africa, we ourselves described Ovamboland as a model of self-government, to quote the words of Lord Hayley, <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="#page_1241"/>the well-known Africanist. For instance, I have here a book, &#x201C;History of a Mandate&#x201D;, which the South African Government submitted to U.N. in 1947. It contains an entire chapter on &#x201C;Native Self-government&#x201D;. The position of the Ovambos is described as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Ovambo, numbering roughly one-third of all the non-Europeans in the territory, lead a free, reasonably prosperous and self-sufficient life that ranks as a model of Native self-government.</block>

<p>Even in the latest booklet published by the Department of Foreign Affairs this is emphasized, too. The booklet is called &#x201C;South Africa and the Rule of Law&#x201D;, and it emphasizes the fact that we are dealing with a form of self-government there. I repeat that we should have had before us a separate Bill seeking to modernize and co-ordinate the existing forms of self-government in the northern areas, which has a background completely different from that of the southern areas. In due course an advanced body would then come into being automatically, so that when we think it advisable for them to express their views as far as their own future is concerned, that body would then be in existence, and nobody would then be able to deny that this is a body with standing which can give an opinion as to what the wishes of the Ovambo peoples of the north are. That would then have been the position, without the impression being created at this stage, as this Bill is doing, that a unilateral fragmentation of the territory is being contemplated and that this is something which places the whole Bill on the level of international politics.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member whether, according to the view he has just stated here in regard to the northern areas where some kind of body is to come into being, in the view of his party it would be possible for that body to have adopted an independent course and not to be integrated with a federal form of government?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Surely, that stands to reason. Our policy is that we shall recommend to those people&#x2014;and I shall deal with that in a moment&#x2014;that it is in their interests to retain on a federal basis their ties with the Republic and the rest of South West Africa. After all, it stands to reason that once such a body is established nobody would prevent them from expressing their own wishes. You need not cast it in this mould in this Bill. Establish this body, and of their own accord these people will at any time which we or they choose, be able to express their wishes in regard to the future. In terms of our South West Plan we are in favour of acknowledging the distinctiveness of the northern sector. Fundamentally we are not opposed to the development of the existing forms of self-government in the north, which would then automatically become at the right time mouth-pieces through which they can at the right time express their views in regard to their future. What we should like to see, is that a legislative assembly, with the same standing and authority as that of the south, should eventually come into being in the north. I concede that problems may arise in connection with the Kaokoveld, but it is a good objective and adjustments can always be made. In his monumental work, &#x201C;Inboor-lingbeleid en Administrasie in die Mandaatgebied van Suidwes-Afrika&#x201D;, written by Dr. M. J. Olivier in 1961 as his doctor&#x2019;s thesis &#x2014;the person who is at present Commissioner-General of South West Africa&#x2014;he, too, envisaged that the Kaokoveld and the Okavango &#x201C;would eventually have to be included in Ovamboland.&#x201D; That is to be found on page 431 of the book. This statement corresponds completely with our own view, and we would have had no objection to any Bill seeking to promote such a development. However, here we have a Bill which includes the southern sector. The hon. the Minister himself admitted that in the south one was dealing with a quite different situation. Just as the north remained in the possession of the Ovambo peoples&#x2014;and they never laid any claim to any additional territory, nor do they do so-to-day, because the southerners and the Whites have been kept out of the northern sector&#x2014;so we have exactly the opposite position in the south. The south has become the possession of many. In the south there is no question of historical homelands. I shall quote what Dr. Olivier has to say in this regard (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that the reserves in the Police Zone (the southern sector) cannot be considered in terms of national homelands for the Natives.</block>

<p>From ancient times the ethnic groups have been scattered over most of the reserves and residential regions of South West. In fact, the southern reserves were originally planned with a view to having a labour force in almost all of the 18 magisterial districts of South West Africa. Here I do not want to go into the small percentage of each group living in the rural areas, and into the number of people who have been settled in each of the reserves. The Odendaal Report furnishes us with the facts in this regard. Earlier on I put a question to the hon. the Minister, namely how many Damaras were living in this proposed Damaraland of the Bill. His reply was 2,848. Out of a total of 44,000 Damaras in South West Africa, 2,848 are living in Damaraland. That is just enough to fill the Cape Town city hall. There are 35.000 Hereros in South West Africa, and only 9,936 of them are living in the proposed Hereroland. The density of the population in the south of South West Africa, the poor economic potential of these reserved <span class="col_5217-5218" refersTo="#page_1242"/>areas, are of such a nature that the development of homelands in the real sense of the word is out of the question in the south. If these homelands in the south were cut off politically from South West Africa&#x2019;s sources of revenue&#x2014;which are but a few and very vulnerable, i.e. the mineral resources, the fishing industries and the marine resources&#x2014;those areas would, as it was put by a certain author, remain economic and political vacuums. Nobody can deny that. To include the proposed Damaraland and the proposed Hereroland, each with its handful of people, under the heading of independence, is an illusion and is to my mind inconsistent with our accepted task as South Africans, namely to pursue the best interests of these people. I should like to make this matter clear. The hon. member for Omaruru said in his speech that it was right that everybody should be given his own territory. If that were possible, not one of us would have complained. If, let us say, the 35,000 Hereros were happy to leave the central part of South West Africa and to settle in a remote corner of South West, why should we be angry? It struck me that not one speaker opposite touched upon this aspect. I want to ask the Government to adduce proof to the effect that the 44,000 Damaras of South West Africa are prepared to exchange their citizenship of South West Africa for citizenship in Damaraland, large tracts of which are desert areas. The matter will then be settled and if those people want things that way, nobody will have objections. That is what the Government has to prove.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am convinced that the Ovambos in the north are not asking for anything more. There the Government has a case. However, my charge is that it is making the entire policy of homelands ridiculous by its actions in the south. There cannot be any objection to larger rural areas being created in the south so that there may be a better division of land. In other words, there is no objection to heart-lands which are predominantly Damara or predominantly Herero. There is no objection to a well-balanced division of land in the south, i.e. among the various groups. Nor is there any objection to prosperous farming communities being created. The concept homelands&#x2014;and I am asking this with no other intention except that we must have light on this matter, and the hon. the Minister can tell us if we are wrong&#x2014;as it is being used here in the Republic, has a specific meaning. It presupposes that all land rights, all permanent residential rights, all potential political rights, and all claims to the joint riches of a country lapse as far as a homeland is concerned. In other words, the citizenship of those persons diminishes. The hon. the Minister should not forget that at present it is still possible for a Native of South West to purchase land anywhere outside his reserve and outside the urban areas. However, when he accepts the homeland concept, he relinquishes something and exchanges a certain right for something else. His citizenship diminishes and all sorts of pressure&#x2014;and let the hon. the Minister deny this if I am wrong, because I should be glad to know that I am wrong&#x2014;is then brought to bear upon him in order to send him back, so it is alleged, to a place where most of them have never lived and with which they have no ties. It is easy to say, as the hon. member for Omaruru did, &#x201C;This is our policy and we stand by this&#x201D;. It used to be the Government&#x2019;s policy that the Indians should be sent out of the country. It was very easy to have such a policy. Later on one comes up against the facts of the situation. We, too, can rise here and say that it is our policy to cut up South West Africa and to say, &#x201C;Look, man, I am sharing out the cake; here is your piece and be satisfied with it&#x201D;. This is not a policy which is practical, for it will never be accepted. We on this side cannot be a party to something of that nature, because it is an illusion. It is a downright illusion to think that the Hereros, who moved into South West Africa in the sixteenth century, long before one single white person had set foot in South West Africa, would leave the Southern central parts of South West Africa merely to please the Whites, and then settle in a remote corner of South West Africa. Then they must sacrifice all their rights and dissociate themselves from every claim &#x2026; [Interjections.] When we were on tour in South West Africa recently, we were taken to the Augustineum, in Windhoek, that gigantic and impressive training centre for the non-white population groups of the south. And what was the lesson we learnt there? The lesson was very clear, namely that if there is to be talk of human development in the south, it has to be on a basis of centralization. It will not be possible for this to be done on the basis of decentralization, because the southern part is too poor and because the southern people have to fall back upon Windhoek and the few large towns, the southern sources of revenue, both as far as the present and the future are concerned. Other than that, there is no practical alternative. It would be very pleasant to be able to live in such a heaven that one could think that if one divided the territory and kept the best part to oneself, the others would be satisfied, but this is, after all, not practical policy. That is why we had the view during the discussion of the Odendaal Report that the Legislative Assembly in Windhoek should gradually be reinforced in such a way that it could serve as the centre of government for the southern group. Gradually, as the people develop, it must become more representative of all the southern areas, on the basis of recognizing everybody&#x2019;s identity. I repeat that it is not an easy policy, but there is no <span class="col_5219-5220" refersTo="#page_1243"/>practical alternative. The statement that what is suggested in the Bill is practicable, will only be true if the Government can adduce proof to the effect that 44,000 Damaras and 35,000 Hereros are happy to exchange their present rights for rights in a remote corner of South West.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Let us be practical. The Whites in the south constitute the most numerous group. The majority of the people live in the north, and under such a system there cannot be any question of one race dominating another. The hon. the Minister rightly said in his speech: &#x201C;We want to prevent domination.&#x201D; That is fine, of course, but the trouble with the Minister&#x2019;s policy is that he does not only want to eliminate domination; he also wants to eliminate all forms of co-operation. Owing to conditions in South West there will have to be political association, whether or not we want it; there is no alternative choice. The Government must prove to us that those people want it; if not, it cannot claim that it is putting forward a practical policy here. On the contrary, without the active guidance and assistance of the Whites in the south, politically as well, South Africa cannot hope to fulfill the task it assumed under the Mandate, with honour and success. I find it very interesting that an outstanding expert on South West, a person such as Dr. Olivier, endorses this point of view entirely. In his thesis, on page 432, Dr. Olivier wrote as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the fact that the possibility of developing these reserves (in the Police Zone) as homelands in the true sense of the word, is out of the question owing to their location, their scattered nature, their size and their poor economic potential, the Namas and Damaras as well as the Coloureds and the Bastard people would have to be integrated with the general political structure of the Whites.</block>

<p>This was said by the Government&#x2019;s own appointed expert&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The existing Legislative Assembly will have to be adapted and developed in such a way that it will eventually be the only legislative body for the Police Zone.</block>

<p>For everybody. I want to be fair towards Dr. Olivier. He differs from us on one point, i.e. in regard to the Hereros. Dr. Olivier would like to see an attempt being made to persuade the Hereros to accept a homeland, but although he says that, he himself has doubts as to whether the Hereros will accept it. He went as far as to say that it was na&#x00EF;ve and futile to think of a Bushmanland, and he wants the Bushmanland area to be given to the Hereros as well, but he obviously has doubts as to whether the Hereros would be amenable to that. However, as for the rest he is in complete agreement with us about its being inevitable that step by step a legislative assembly would have to be established for everybody in the south.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill before us embodies an attempt at establishing an artificial group of homelands for which there is no historical basis. I am now referring to the south. With the best will in the world they can never accommodate more than a fraction of the population for which they are intended, and that is why one can never, from the nature of the circumstances there, speak of distinctive, independent states as far as the southern areas are concerned. Here, in the &#x201C;South West African Survey&#x201D; published by the Government, they say that if South West were to free itself from the economy of the Republic, it would be ruined. Once a group has broken away politically, it no longer has any claim to the central riches. It can resort to begging and it may perhaps get something, but it cannot lay any claim to it. Do hon. members think that the people are going to be so stupid &#x2026; [Interjections.] That is why I say that one has an historical situation in Ovamboland, but in the south one has a position where there are six people and one apple and that apple belongs to all six of them. After all, it is inconceivable that one person alone can peel the apple, give a piece of peel to each of the others and keep to himself the rest of that apple. Would the others be satisfied with that?</p>

If they come forward with those practical arguments, the whole matter will become practical politics, but as it is now that is certainly not the case.</p>

<p>To my mind there is a specific danger implied in objects of the Bill as far as the southern parts are concerned, for if the vast majority of the Damaras or the vast majority of the Hereros were to gain the slightest impression that pressure is going to be brought to bear upon them so that they may move, a very dangerous situation can develop, which is exactly the sort of situation that cropped up in Windhoek in connection with the location. If they were to gain the impression that where they are living at present they will from now on be temporary sojourners only, then we would be doing something which could endanger our future.

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout toyed with a few <span class="col_5221-5222" refersTo="#page_1244"/>words and a few propositions in this House this afternoon. He said that South West Africa could become a link between the Republic and the world. That is a fine proposition. But the hon. member did not tell us how that link should be brought about. He made the proposition and simply left it there without elaborating on it any further. In speaking of South West as a link between the Republic and the outside world, does he want us to allow U.N. to enter South West Africa? Is that the link which he would like to see, or does he have another link in mind? The hon. member also said that we should outwit our enemies. Who are really the enemies of the Republic of South Africa or of South West Africa? The hon. member did not tell us how we should outwit them. He did not tell us how to do it. In addition, he said that we should tackle this whole matter on a much broader basis. I ask the hon. member: How can we tackle it on a broader basis than we are doing at the present moment, except by obtaining assistance from outside? Has this legislation not been tackled on the broadest basis? Then the hon. member said that we should modernize and co-ordinate this legislation. Is that not what is being done here? Is that not exactly what this legislation envisages, to co-ordinate the present system which obtains in South West Africa, to modernize it and to adapt it to the conditions of the day? No, the hon. member came along here with fine words; he played with words, but he really contributed nothing towards finding a solution for us to this great problem with which we are faced to-day. If we look back to the circumstances after the Second World War, we find that just after that war black nationalism swept like a gigantic wave across the Continent of Africa. We found that with the cry of &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Down with the white man&#x201D;, one African state after another obtained its independence and the white man had to flee from those African states which he had built up and where he had established something fine. Thus we found that the Dutchman could return to the Netherlands, the Englishman to England, the Frenchman to France and the Belgian to Belgium, but we here in the Republic of South Africa, the hon. members of the Opposition and I, knew no other fatherland. The Republic of South Africa is my fatherland, just as it is the fatherland of the hon. members opposite. Fortunately for those people they could return to their fatherland, and they were welcome in that fatherland, but we have no other fatherland, and it would have been foolish of any intelligent government simply to sweep aside this cry of &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D; and this black nationalism without paying any attention to it. It would have been unwise not to try to find a solution for black nationalism which was gaining a foothold here in the Republic of South Africa. We could not simply push it aside. We could not ignore it. It would have been very irresponsible of any government to do so. Therefore it was very necessary for us to find a peaceful solution in the Republic and in South West Africa, so that the black man could realize his own nationalism without prejudicing the rights of the white man. We believe, and it is the policy of the Government, that it would be fatal to suppress or obstruct the urge to freedom and independence of any nation, but that one should rather assist that nation along the road to self-government and eventually along the road to independence. We believe that we should extend a helping hand to it, that we should offer it the hand of friendship, and that we should not be hostile towards it. We believe that if we lead the black man on the road to independence, he will be our friend instead of our enemy. We believe that we should help him so that he may eventually obtain those things which he is striving for, in a peaceful manner.</p>

<p>They will come along and ask us and when they do we must already have placed them on that road, because the day will come when they will ask it, and then no one in this country will be able to stop it, just as the whole of the Western world could not stop it in Africa. Therefore we are one step ahead of the Western world.</p>

<p>Another milestone has been reached in the past 20 years of National Party rule with the introduction of this legislation. To-day is a memorable day in the history of this small nation on the southern tip of Africa. To-day the National Party is demonstrating to the whole world that we are prepared to extend a helping hand to those other national groups in our country and to lead them to independence. We do not ask how big is your country, how large are your numbers, or are you economically sound enough to stand on your own feet, as the Opposition does. We say that our policy lays down that we should help the Bantu nations of South West Africa along the road to self-government and eventually on the road to independence. We are making provision in this Bill for the recognition of the areas of the various Bantu nations of South West Africa. We do not want to force together what does not belong together. History has taught us that one cannot press nations together as in a mould. Especially the traditions of the Bantu nations in the Republic and in South West &#x2026; [Interjections.] I could not hear clearly what the hon. member said. On another occasion I shall be prepared to tackle him. If he will just give me a chance now, I shall proceed. We believe that the traditions and the customs of the nations differ so greatly that one would only create disorder and chaos if any Party, even the United Party, were to try to force together what does not belong together. I ask the hon. member for Durban (Point) and any hon. member who knows the history of the Witwatersrand, or any member who comes from Durban or from the large cities, just to <span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="#page_1245"/>consider what happened in past years and the faction fights which we used to have on the Rand every Sunday before ethnic grouping was introduced in our Bantu townships. The hon. member for Houghton will also remember it. [Interjection.] If she does not remember it, she is a stranger in Jerusalem. Since we have applied this ethnic grouping, even in the mining compounds, we no longer hear of those bloody fights which we had every week-end. [Interjection.] I do not know what area the hon. member for Durban (Point) is talking about, but I may tell him that since it has been applied in these areas, there is peace and quiet. I want to say to the hon. member that the members of each tribe, no matter how primitive it is, understand the form of government applied in their tribe, and however cruel and unjust it might seem in the eyes of the Western world, they want it. We heard in the Okavango of the punishment meted out to one Native. To us it seemed cruel and inhuman, but that is the language which that Native understands at the moment. But we as Whites do not want to leave him there to apply his cruelty and inhumanity. We do not want that form of government which he applies there so strictly to-day. It is our Christian duty to help him to modernize and adapt the system of government which he has. But for us simply to come overnight and say to that primitive Native that this system of his is altogether wrong, will be the biggest mistake we could make. But we must first place him on the road to self-government. We must indicate to him that, although the things which he is now doing are not proper and correct in the eyes of the Western world, he should gradually and slowly accept this form of government. Nor is it the policy of the National Party simply to give all those areas to them overnight. We do not believe in this platter-policy which was applied in the African countries, where the African states merely cupped their hands to receive. What was the result of that? Hon. members saw what happened. Ministers bought golden beds and built palaces for themselves, and even put the Opposition in gaol. We believe in helping these under-developed areas along, that we should extend a helping hand to them and help those who want to be helped. We must teach them the maxim of &#x201C;industriousness&#x201D;, so that they will be prepared to put the shoulder to the wheel and help themselves to forge ahead. We want to cultivate leaders for them in that area who can teach the people how to work and how to undertake tasks. We do not want to take their tasks over from them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) at the back there accompanied us on this tour, and he knows how eager the leaders of Ovamboland were to receive self-government He knows what their wishes were. But at the same time those leaders told us how grateful they were to the Government for what was being done for them. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; they asked, &#x201C;in Heaven&#x2019;s name do not withdraw your hand from us altogether, because we still need the white man to lead us on the road to independence&#x201D;. It is on that basis, in that way, that we should like to help these Bantu nations of South West Africa. We do not want to westernize them overnight. We do not want to grant them riches in gold and silver overnight. But we are prepared to impart our knowledge to them. We are prepared to help them where we can. We are only prepared to help them financially if they are prepared to put their shoulder to the wheel and to work, as is expected of any self-respecting nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to the unenlightened it might perhaps sound absolutely foolish that we want to group a small number of people together in one ethnic group in a small area. The outside world may perhaps say to us: Why can those northern areas not be consolidated into one area? Why can there not be one self-governing body to control the entire area? But history has taught us that, as soon as we do that, we will again experience chaos, disorder and wars in those areas. Those Bantu are proud of what is their own; they are proud of their borders; they are proud of their system of government. We want to say to hon. members to-day: It would be foolish of any government to try to bring these various Bantu groups together under one system of government, which the Opposition wants to force upon them, or to eliminate the boundaries among the Bantu nations and to string them together. It will only lead to mutual dissension and war once again, things that we should not like to experience again in those areas. The National Party is accused, and the accusation was repeated by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the course of this debate, of cutting up our fatherland. I ask hon. members opposite: Since when were these Bantu homelands a part of our fatherland? Has history not always determined that those homelands belong to the Bantu of the Republic of South Africa and of South West Africa? In my childhood days, when I grew up beside the Tyumie River, I was told, &#x201C;That area there is Native territory.&#x201D; Hon. members can ask the hon. member for South Coast. That is what we were told. History taught us that the Transkei was Native territory. We grew up with that idea. It was not laid down by some Prime Minister or another. These boundaries were not drawn by Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd or Adv. John Vorster or whoever. The history of our nation drew those boundaries for us. Therefore it is so senseless to suggest that this side is cutting up our fatherland. I want to say to hon. members opposite that this was laid down in the legislation of 1936. We on this side are prepared to accept a smaller South Africa, but it will be a white South Africa, over which we shall be the masters. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is not a policy of surrender. To the Bezuidenhout family there is no such thing as surrendering. My forebears died on the gallows; my forebears guarded the eastern borders to the very last. It was not my ancestors who smuggled guns to the Bantu in the Transkei and the Ciskei. Such things were not done by the forebears of hon. members on this side. But if we consult history, we shall see whose forebears smuggled guns to the Bantu. I say to-day that the United Party must look out. They want to keep South Africa as it is to-day. They are ignoring the Bantu&#x2019;s black nationalism, their urge to eventual independence. That side, which wants to keep South Africa whole, must watch out that the cracks in the homelands do not change to craters later on, and that those craters between the white man&#x2019;s land and the Bantu homelands do not become so great that they no longer can be bridged. Because if that happened, the United Party would be creating chaos. Then there would be no time to close the breach, then they would realize that it was too late. Then they would wish that they had accepted the policy of the National Party, namely rather to have a smaller Republic of South Africa but a Republic which is White, where the white man and the white man alone can be the master.</p>

<p>I want to say that I was very surprised to hear what the hon. member for South Coast said here on Friday. I have a great deal of respect for the hon. member and for his knowledge of Bantu affairs. But on Friday he got up here and said that we were leaving Portugal and Rhodesia in the lurch. What Government has kept Rhodesia on its feet in the past few years? What Government hastened to Rhodesia&#x2019;s aid in its hour of need? What Government helped Rhodesia economically to its present position? [Interjections.] I think that after he had read his speech, the hon. member for South Coast regretted what he had said. This is surely not how we know him. We have not left Portugal in the lurch. On the contrary, it is this Government which is once more showing the world that it is not here to suppress, but to uplift. We want to give the non-White his rightful share in the northern area of South West Africa, we want to give him what is his due, but we also want to give the white man of South West Africa his rightful share, so that the two groups can live there alongside each other in a peaceful manner, as it should be. In South West Africa, as in the Republic, they also have a two-stream policy. They also have Whites and non-Whites. All that this legislation is bringing about, is this. It is placing the non-White of South West Africa on the road to self-government. It is helping the non-Whites there to help themselves and to modernize and adapt their legal system to accord with the Western legal system. We are hereby extending a helping hand, and we are once again demonstrating to the world that the National Party of South Africa remains true to its word in saying, &#x201C;We are here to ensure that justice is done to all population groups in the Republic and South West Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must agree with the last few words of the hon. member for Brakpan. This Bill gives to the Bantu people of northern South West Africa, particularly, nothing more than what they have to-day; it gives them no more than that. They are already exercising local government as regards their own local matters, they already control all their local affairs, but with the guiding hand of the white Republican Government supplying the funds. The sting in this Bill is not in the body but in the preamble. I wish to address you a little later on this matter, Sir, and I think the hon. member for Brakpan must be patient until I get to that point.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan also seems to be very proud of the fact that some of his ancestors guarded some eastern frontier at some stage or other, I am not sure exactly which eastern frontier he is referring to. He also seems to be very proud of the fact that some of his ancestors even went to the gallows. I do not know for what reason they went to the gallows, whether there was a noble reason or an ignoble reason.</p>

<p>Let me say to the hon. member he is not the only one who can make claims of this sort. My forefather came out with the 1820 Settlers with ten sons and they had farms strung along the Fish River and acted as the buffer between the so-called white South Africa, as some people like to call it to-day, and the Xhosas in the Transkei. Only the old man and two sons came out of that Kaffir war. So the hon. member is not claiming anything which nobody else knows about. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Whilst listening to the hon. member for Brakpan the thought crossed my mind as to who wrote that speech for him. Because really and truly there were times when I was satisfied the hon. member was not expressing his own views and his own thoughts. I did not believe he was quite as stupid as he was trying to make out. After listening to him I began to wonder whether this is not part of the new history which is going to be taught, and I wonder if he has not been taught by the hon. member for Randfontein this new history which we have heard so much about.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about uhuru and said that the non-white peoples of Southern <span class="col_5227-5228" refersTo="#page_1247"/>Africa, including South West Africa, will demand uhuru.</p>

<p>There is no need for the Bantu people to demand uhuru, not under the Nationalist Government, because this Government has offered, no, has promised them uhuru. They have promised them this independence. This Bill, particularly the preamble, now recognizes this, and this legislation is the first legal document of this country which lays down that the Bantu people have the right not only to self-determination but the right to independence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan also spoke of the 1936 Act. Let me say he completely and utterly misconstrued the intentions behind that Act. He claimed something, and as this is the first time I have heard this claim made, I say I do not accept that the speech he made was indeed written by the hon. member. He claimed that the intention behind that Act was to create areas which would become free and independent countries for the Bantu people only. I am sure the hon. member will be disabused of that opinion in time, but let me say to him now that that Act merely set aside certain areas, and made provision for the extension of those areas, for occupation by the Bantu people and not to become free and independent countries. The legislature in those days never had the intention of creating independent countries by means of the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>Who wrote your speech?</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure the hon. the Minister did not write it because I am sure it is above his plane. I want to get back to the Bill. The preamble reads as follows, and I hope the hon. the Minister of Forestry can understand this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas it is desirable that the native nations in the territory of South West Africa should in the realization of their right of self-determination develop in an orderly manner to self-governing nations and independence.</block>

<p>This is once again typical of this Nationalist Party Government. This has been proved before, and I will again show during this debate that they are doing the same thing here. They establish a false premise, as they are doing here in the preamble and when they have established that, they build up their case. Of course, the whole case is wrong because it is build on this false foundation. This preamble talks of &#x201C;their right of self-determination&#x201D;. My hon. Leader and other hon. members on this side have raised this point, and now I want to ask the hon. the Minister the following question: Since when have the Bantu people had this &#x201C;right of self-determination&#x201D;? The hon. member for South Coast made the point very clearly that this is an absolute and not a qualified right. Although the Bill does not go so far as to grant independence to these people it does at least establish the right of those people at any time, in terms of this phrase of &#x201C;their right of self-determination&#x201D;, to demand independence.</p>

<p>As I asked before, when did they get this right? I submit they never had it before March of last year. It was March of last year when the hon. the Minister came back from Ovamboland where he had given them a degree of local self-government and granted the establishment of tribal authorities. I think the first regional authority was established then.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="#hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it was mentioned when the Minister returned in March last year. But that is incidental. The hon. the Prime Minister seems to be under the impression that they have had this right for a long time and that this has been an issue in elections of the past. In this connection I wish to refer to what he said on 23rd April of this year, as reported in Hansard, Col. 3947&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In contrast to that it is the policy of the National Party in respect of the black people, with our homelands policy, which has not only been debated in this House on countless occasions already, but which has been the issue in one election after another, to afford those people an opportunity of exercising self-determination. We have stated very clearly that we shall lead them to independence.</block>

<p>He said this question of self-determination had been an issue in elections. I deny that categorically. The last general election in 1966 was held under Dr. Verwoerd and his policy was not one of self-determination. [Interjections.] His policy&#x2014;and this has been proved conclusively by arguments inside this House and outside&#x2014;was one of &#x201C;I shall give them independence when I think they are ripe for it, not when they want it&#x201D;. Let us go further. If we accept this right of self-determination we then reach the stage where these people can ask for their independence and what is this Government then going to do about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member says the Government will either say yes or no. I want to say to him the hon. the Prime <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="#page_1248"/>Minister does not agree with him; they cannot just say yes or no. On 23rd April the Prime Minister admitted in this House that he had got to the stage where he had lost control over the time-table. I quote once again from Col. 3947. While the Prime Minister was speaking I interjected and asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And if they prefer independence?</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: If they prefer independence and if they are ripe for it, this Parliament will decide and this Parliament will grant them independence.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. W. T. Webber: Who is going to decide whether they are ripe?</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: This Parliament, in consultation with the people concerned. But surely the hon. member knows as well as I do that they will never gain independence in any other way than by an Act of this Parliament?</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. W. T. Webber: And if they do not agree with this Parliament?</block>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister: Then it is a question of negotiation.</block>

<p>By saying that the Prime Minister admits he will no longer have control over the timetable, that he will only be able to negotiate. He can no longer say, as the hon. member for Randfontein said he could, yes or no. This is the thing that I am so afraid of in this Bill. As I said before, this Bill is giving the peoples of Ovamboland and Okavamboland and other peoples up there no more than what they already have to-day. The important part of this measure, however, is the preamble. As I said, the Government is now taking the opportunity of establishing this premise on which the whole of the future is going to be built.</p>

<p>The preamble also deals with the question of independence, but before I get to that point I wish to refer to the fact that it also mentions the point of self-government. If I could have the attention of the Minister, I should like to ask him a question which he could perhaps answer right away. What does the Government mean by this term &#x201C;self-government&#x201D;? Do the Minister and the Government mean the self-government which is enjoyed by an independent country or do they differentiate between the terms &#x201C;independence&#x201D; and &#x201C;self-government&#x201D;?</p>
